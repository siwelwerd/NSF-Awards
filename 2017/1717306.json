 "awd_abstract_narration": "Vertically stacked three-dimensional (3D) integration of semiconductor chips is an emerging technology to ensure continued growth in transistor density and performance of integrated circuits (ICs). Despite the well-characterized advantages and limitations, the hardware security of such circuits has not received much attention. With shrinking number of trusted circuit manufacturers, trustworthiness of electronic devices is a growing concern. Vertical integration brings unexplored and unique challenges in managing hardware security. This research develops a cross-layer framework to manage and guarantee hardware security in 3D ICs. The systematic framework developed by this research assesses and enhances trustworthiness of 3D ICs for both commercial and defense-specific applications. Proposed project also supports diverse educational and outreach programs with emphasis on underrepresented groups in both New Hampshire and Stony Brook, Long Island. \r\n\r\nExisting hardware security solutions are for 2D ICs manufactured by a trusted foundry. Unfortunately, new security problems arise when multiple dies from different vendors are stacked in a 3D IC. Proposed research targets these security weaknesses with an emphasis on the trustworthiness of vertical communications. Solution mechanisms to prevent attacks on the vertical communication path will be investigated to achieve secure die-to-die communication. A secure power delivery architecture will be designed to detect small hardware Trojans in any die within the stack. A switching noise analysis based scheme will be investigated to detect malicious behavior in vertical communication paths.\r\n",

Despite the well-characterized advantages (such as reduction in delay, power, and ability to develop heterogeneous ICs) and limitations (such as thermal integrity and high testing cost), the hardware security challenges and opportunities of 3D ICs have not received much attention. The primary goal of this collaborative project has been to characterize the security threat models for different forms of 3D ICs and develop effective methods to thwart the identified security threats. We have accomplished this primary goal via multiple research tasks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have characterized four representable 3D hardware Trojan cases (see Figure 1) and quantitatively analyzed their practical examples. Several case studies (see Figures 2-4) were also performed to validate the feasibility of 3D hardware Trojan implementation. The major difference between 2D and 3D hardware Trojans is whether the Trojan trigger and payload circuits are located in the same tier where the target circuit resides. In 2D chips, the Trojan circuit co-exists with the victim in the same tier. One could perform testing or side-channel analysis to detect the presence of 2D Trojans. In contrast, conventional testing on 3D chips is typically done in a separated fashion. The die for each tier is tested individually before 3D integration. Once the good dies are stacked vertically, only limited testing can be performed to detect the defects between die-to-die connections. We have also introduced a run-time countermeasure against 3D hardware Trojans. We leverage the 3D communication infrastructure, 3D network-on-chips (NoCs), to tackle the cross-tier hardware Trojans in stacked multi-tier chips. Our invariance checking method has been deployed in 3D ICs to detect the Trojans, which introduce malicious NoC packets or facilitate information leakage among 3D tiers. In addition, we investigated the use of switching noise within the substrate to detect malicious through silicon vias (TSVs) in 3D ICs (see Figure 5). Since TSVs are relatively large, they introduce significant capacitance (and therefore switching noise) into the substrate, thereby changing the noise profile that can be observed via low-cost sensors within each tier. We have developed a method that secures 3D ICs from correlation power analysis (CPA) attacks with power distribution network (PDN) noise. 3D integration is envisioned as a natural defense to thwart side-channel analysis (SCA) attacks on the hardware implementation of cryptographic algorithms. To expand this natural defense, we have exploited PDN noise inherently existing in 3D chips to thwart CPA attacks. Instead of introducing external noise or flattening the power profile, our method utilizes the spatially and temporally varied supply voltages from other 3D planes to blur the power correlation of the crypto unit. We also developed charge-recycling (adiabatic) monolithic 3D ICs to simultaneously enhance energy efficiency and resistance against CPA attacks. We demonstrated the advantage of monolithic 3D technology in reducing the cell-level interconnect capacitance, which is dominant in charge-recycling circuits. Furthermore, since the power has relatively weaker dependence on input signals, we increased power side-channel resistance (see Figure 6 that demonstrates higher measurements-to-disclosure). In addition, we demonstrated how the phase differences in charge-recycling circuits can be used to obfuscate the circuit, thereby protecting against reverse engineering attacks. The proposed obfuscation method is highly resistant against removal and sensitization attacks, while exhibiting low overhead. We have proposed transistor-level logic locking technique for both monolithic 3D as well as conventional 2D ICs. In the proposed technique, the key bits are used as data signals for existing logic gates. Thus, depending on the key bit, the gate may exhibit normal functionality or produce a constant output signal. The constant output is then used as a non-controlling signal in subsequent gates. Thus, accurate functionality can be provided only with correct key bits. We evaluated the resilience of the proposed approach against both sensitization and power side-channel attacks. Overall, the results of this research have significantly contributed to the development of secure 3D ICs with enhanced protection against hardware Trojans, power side-channel attacks, and reverse engineering attacks.</p>\n<p>Our research results have been disseminated in the forms of workshops, conferences papers, invited talks, tutorials, and journal papers. This project has supported four PhD students (two female PhDs). Multiple undergraduate students have also played a role in some of the research tasks. In addition to conventional conferences, the students presented their work in the Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) TECHCON and attracted the attention from various semiconductor companies.
