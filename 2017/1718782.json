 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recent prevalence of advanced cyber attacks has caused enterprise breaches with severe consequences in critical sectors, such as national defense, manufacturing and the financial industry. Current defense practices rely on attack prevention and detection technologies, but our understanding of the capabilities of these security tools against truly advanced threats, which rapidly grow in sophistication, is severely lacking. This project seeks to harden enterprise security against advanced threats by systematically designing a new multi-layer intrusion-resilient framework that addresses individual enterprise defenses, as well as global, community-based protections. Overall, with a focus on educational activities, outreach to under-represented minority groups and technology transfer to industry, this project aims at contributing a new holistic defense approach to the security community that increases the security stance of our national infrastructures. \r\n  \r\nThis project develops a new framework for enterprise intrusion resilience that: (1) protects both individual assets and enterprises as a whole; (2) adapts to attacker's strategies by devising security tools that are themselves resilient to breaches; and (3) promotes new coordinated protections across enterprises and industry sectors while protecting the privacy of shared data. These solutions leverage cryptography, game-theoretical modeling, and community-based defenses to provide strong intrusion resilience against advanced threats. The investigators plan to engage actively with the security industry to evaluate their techniques in practical settings and provide concrete recommendations on local and coordinated defensive strategies for protecting our national infrastructures. By educating students and cyber professionals, as well as conducting a range of outreach activities to the community, this project seeks to increase awareness of emerging attack techniques and best proactive defenses for successfully mitigating the cyber attacks of the future.",

Typical targets are organizations in critical sectors, such as national defense, manufacturing or the financial industry, where leakage or alteration of high-value information inflicts severe damages to states, enterprises or individuals.&nbsp; In response to ATs, the security industry has invested in breach-prevention and detection technologies, but our understanding of the capabilities of these security tools against truly advanced threats is severely lacking. This project seeks to harden enterprise security via practical solutions that provide strong intrusion resilience against such attacks. Towards this goal, the project is designed around the development of an integrated and multi-layered enterprise defense framework that leverages cryptography and community-based intelligence across the following innovations:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Holistic security posture assessment</strong>: The project seeks to provide enterprises the ability to evaluate their security posture and optimally orchestrate their security defenses under possible constraints so that stronger intrusion resistance is achieved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Enhanced asset protection</strong>: The project seeks to protect enterprise assets with advanced crypto-assisted anti-breach technologies, including secure chains of custody for reliable security analytics, breach-resilient architectures for security operation management (e.g., access control, credential protection etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>Secure intelligent sharing and analytics</strong>: The project seeks to enable privacy-preserving learning and analytics (including exact matching, similarity, clustering and ranking) across threat indicators shared by different enterprises for timely detection of emerging campaigns targeting multiple organizations. &nbsp;<br /><br />Along these lines, the contributions of the project are summarized as follows:<br /><br /><strong>Enhanced security and effectiveness of security analytics</strong>: An advanced-threat actor is a skilled and stealthy intruder who compromises a device or a service using innovative hacking methods to gain and retain unauthorized access to a computer network without being detected. Existing security tools depend on the collection of system, application, and event logs, along with their and timely analysis at a SIEM system - which of course becomes the first target of the attacker. The project presents VaultBox, a secure log-collection system that provides reliable, stealth and immutable transmission of logs, withstanding malicious losses or corruptions of logs while in transit or at rest. VaultBox provides strong security without sacrificing simplicity and efficiency, thus promoting its adoption towards richer security analytics based on a more secure chain of custody.<br /><br /><strong>Secure transparency-based credential management</strong>: Transparency logs store append-only directories and allow users to look up entries and verify their freshness and consistency with respect to older versions, thus paving the way towards a more accountable Internet, where communities audit a potentially malicious service (e.g., Certificate Transparency enables domain owners to audit Certificate Authorities and detect impersonation attacks). By employing tools that incur overhead proportional to the size of an ever-increasing log, current solutions cannot sustain long-term usage of such systems. The project improves this state of affairs by introducing a new append-only authenticated dictionary with only (poly)logarithmic overheads, thus significantly helping the wide adoption and long-term sustainability of such important log-validation services.<br /><br /><strong>Low-bandwidth private indicator matching</strong>: Private Set Intersection (PSI) involves the design of cryptographic protocols that allow a client and a server to compute common elements of their individual sets without revealing anything else. Most existing solutions incur communication costs proportional to the input sets. The project considers the problem version where the client's input is much smaller then the server's input and employs hashing, homomorphic encryption and private information retrieval to build low-bandwidth PSI protocols that hold promise for practical usage ? namely, private set membership (of an element held by a client in the set held by a server) incurs the currently lowest known communication cost, thus finding practical application for any type of private set-membership checks.<br /><br /><strong>Practical private indicator clustering</strong>: In collaborative learning, multiple parties contribute their datasets to jointly deduce global machine learning models for numerous predictive tasks. Despite its efficacy, this learning paradigm fails to<br />encompass critical application domains that involve highly sensitive data, such as healthcare and security analytics, where privacy risks limit entities to individually train models using only their own datasets. The project presents cryptographic protocols that allow two parties to privately perform collaborative cluster analysis on their combined sensitive datasets. Due to their modular design, judicious use of cryptography and integration of approximation tools, these protocols achieve high efficiency and accuracy, thus motivating self-interested stakeholders to collaborate with each other towards richer joint machine-learning analysis over their individual datasets, without compromising their privacy.<br /><br />Overall, the project develops techniques that advance the state of the art in the area of Enterprise Security by introducing new promising security solutions that are designed to offer not only more enhanced protections, but importantly also more practical defense mechanisms, thus promoting wider adoption of provable-secure solutions to real-world cybersecurity problems.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/18/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nikos&nbsp;Triandopoulos</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1718782/1718782_10505372_1668753590844_2019SATCPoster_PrivateClusterAnalysis--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1718782/1718782_10505372_1668753590844_2019SATCPoster_PrivateClusterAnalysis--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Towards Scalable Collaborative Learning\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1718782/1718782_10505372_1668753590844_2019SATCPoster_PrivateClusterAnalysis--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Towards Scalable Collaborative Learning\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A scalable cryptographic protocol that allows two parties to privately perform joint cluster analysis on their combined sensitive datasets.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Triandopoulos</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nikos&nbsp;Triandopoulos</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Towards Scalable Collaborative Learning</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
