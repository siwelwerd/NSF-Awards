 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project concerns the statistical properties of mathematical models known as particle systems that describe fluid-dynamical and materials-science aspects of important physical systems. More specifically, the project studies models of (1) cluster growth, (2) randomly composited materials, and (3) diffuse gases.  Many basic and important questions about these models remain open.  One of the more striking examples is that we still lack a fully rigorous understanding how fluid equations arise from molecular interactions.  The investigator will attempt to make progress on this problem and others by applying recently-developed techniques in the theory of stochastic homogenization.  The work will have an interdisciplinary character, mixing results from probability and analysis.  The project will make use of computer simulation to empirically test ideas during development of the theory.\r\n\r\nTechniques in quantitative stochastic homogenization, particularly those used to obtain optimal rates in the elliptic setting, are now mature enough to attack problems that previously did not seem to be amenable to this approach.  The basic homogenization idea remains the same, namely, to view the microscopic models as perturbations of their smooth macroscopic limits.  The key new insight is that the regularity theory of the macroscopic limit often has a microscopic analogue.  Examples of possible applications include the derivation of the Landau equation as a scaling limit of interacting particles and Anderson localization for a Bernoulli potential on the lattice.  This approach has already proved successful, and the investigator expects it to continue to yield new results.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe main goal of this project was to use techniques from stochastic homogenization to study the macroscopic behavior of several physically motivated microscopic models. Over the course of the grant, five research projects were completed along these lines. The topics were:\n\n\n1. water droplet formation on rough surfaces,\n\n\n2. Anderson localization with singular noise,\n\n\n3. pattern stability in the Abelian sandpile,\n\n\n4. convex hull peeling, and\n\n\n5. infinite order periodic homogenization.\n\n\nEach of these projects required the invention of new tools and techniques.\n\n\nIn article 1, the PI and collaborator gave the first complete rigorous analysis of a natural free boundary with flat facets. The model was motivated by a series of engineering papers which aimed to deposit microscopic droplets with prescribed shapes. The Hamiltonian encoding the scaling limit of the microscopic model has beautiful number theoretic structure. Due to the Hamiltonian being discontinuous, the proofs required the invention of new viscosity solution tools. The collaborator in this case was one of the PIs postdoctoral mentees, and the project helped launch a new research program.\n\n\nIn article 2, the PI and collaborator proved localization at the edge for the Anderson model on the planar lattice with singular noise. This advanced our rigorous understanding of Anderson localization and in particular made progress towards proving its universality. This work also contributed a new randomized unique continuation principle for the lattice and a cleaner re-organization of the well-known multi-scale analysis.\n\n\nIn article 3, the PI and collaborator proved stability of patterns in the Abelian sandpile. This essentially completed a long story about convergence on the rectangular lattice. The proofs were an adaptation of the regularity theory of fully nonlinear elliptic equations. The new techniques created here will hopefully be useful on other lattices.\n\n\nIn article 4, the PI and collaborator studied the limit shape of convex hull peeling. Convex hull peeling is a natural generalization of median to high dimensional data, and is a natural affine-invariant surface erosion model. The paper introduces new game-theoretic tools to estimate fluctuations in convex hull peeling. It also gives a new formulation of viscosity solutions for level-set flows, which should be useful for other problems.\n\n\nIn article 5, the PI and collaborators studied unique continuation for elliptic equations through the lens of homogenization. The paper is a sharp quantitative analysis of infinite order homogenization in the periodic case. The paper introduces a novel finite-difference regularity scheme and brings in new tools from orthogonal polynomials. It also includes a simpler reformulation of the classical theory of higher order correctors.\n\n\nIn addition to the above research projects, the PI also wrote lecture notes on homogenization which appeared in print as part of the IAS/Park City math series. These notes are aimed at graduate students and have since been used in the PIs teaching of PhD students.\n\n\nOver the course of the grant, the PI was supervising three graduate students and jointly mentored three postdocs.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/13/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CharlesKSmart\n"
