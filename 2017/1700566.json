 "awd_abstract_narration": "Keeping computers and information systems secure is a major challenge. Business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches, and the growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have appropriate, specific knowledge and skills. In this project, Clark State Community College will work with high schools to engage students in considering this high-demand career field. In particular, the investigators will lead the development of approximately 30 hands-on cybersecurity laboratory modules that are specifically designed for delivery within a high school classroom environment, with its typical time constraints and limited technical resources. The module development process will consider appropriate content, timing, methods of delivery, and incremental development of knowledge and skills. Project teams consisting of college faculty and students and high school teachers and students will design, develop, and test the modules.\r\n\r\nThe lab modules will cover entry-level cybersecurity knowledge and skills that map to in-demand industry certifications (specifically, CompTIA Security+ and CISSP), and the modules will also be mapped to the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. Existing high-quality materials will be adapted when possible, and the investigators will coordinate with others who are currently developing cybersecurity curricula to avoid duplications. An advisory board consisting of college, high school, business, military, and government experts will provide guidance on the topics, content, coverage, and flow of the modules. Each module will consist (typically) of a set of PowerPoint slides, a list of Internet references, a written lab activity, assessment questions, application software, and a mapping to industry certifications and the NICE Cybersecurity Workforce Framework. For each content area, a beginning, intermediate, and advanced cybersecurity lab activity will be developed. The cybersecurity modules will be initially distributed and beta-tested through a hands-on training institute for college and high school educators during the summer.",
