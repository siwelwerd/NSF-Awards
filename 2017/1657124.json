 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transport layer security (TLS) and secure socket layer (SSL) protocols aim to establish a secure channel with confidentiality and integrity guarantees over an insecure network. SSL/TLS is currently being used to protect a large number of servers and websites including banks, file servers, and social networks. In fact, 37% of North America's network traffic is now protected by SSL/TLS. To avoid impersonation attacks in SSL/TLS, users initiating an SSL/TLS communication are recommended to authenticate their communication peer to ensure they are interacting with the intended party and not an impostor. The X.509 public-key infrastructure (PKI) compensates for the Internet's inherent lack of trust by providing a cryptography-backed authentication framework in which entities are organized hierarchically based on trust, and each entity can obtain a certificate confirming its identity. While there is open-source software that implements the X.509 prescribed authentication checks, bugs in this software can leave users vulnerable to impersonation attacks. The X.509 open-source standard implementations, unlike SSL/TLS, have escaped rigorous security evaluations despite the fact that the security of SSL/TLS critically hinges on a correct X.509 implementation. This project seeks to reduce the attack surface of SSL/TLS and other applications that use X.509 as the authentication provider by developing an automatic technique for detecting logical bugs in X.509 implementations. \r\n\r\nThis project will take advantage of the insight that a given X.509 implementation partitions the certificate input universe into accepting (certificates considered valid by the implementation) and rejecting (certificates considered invalid) universes. One can use symbolic execution to automatically extract an approximation of the two universes from a given X.509 implementation and represent them with logical formulas. The project then aims to precisely capture the X.509 standard specification in some formal logic and also develop a reference implementation of the X.509 standard. To prove the compliance of the reference implementation against the formal specification, the research will leverage a combination of model checking and deductive verification techniques. With the provably correct reference implementation, say R, at hand, it will be possible to detect logical bugs and inconsistencies in a given X.509 implementation, T, by checking whether T deviates from R. Deviations will be efficiently calculated by comparing the certificate universes of R and T. In addition to its research impact, the techniques and research findings of this project will have a positive impact on the training of the future generation of computer security professionals.",

The tools and foundational techniques developed in this project can identify noncompliances during the early development stage of implementation. This way, it is possible to avoid the security repercussions of non-compliance during deployment. The testing approach comprises of two logical components: (a) a testing approach that can find behavioral deviations of two different X.509 implementations using symbolic execution; (b) a reference implementation that faithfully follows the requirements of RFC 5280. For testing the compliance of a given implementation s, one would use component (a) to test the deviations between s and the reference implementation developed in (b).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this project, as part of component (a) mentioned above, we developed an open-source tool to generate a custom certificate chain containing concrete and symbolic values, called SymCert. The next component of (a) then uses such SymCerts for symbolically executing an implementation under test for approximating the logic. The final component of (a) uses a satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solver to compare the extracted logic of two different implementations. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach can recognize differences between implementations that are hard for fuzzing based techniques to discover. Additionally, for testing the PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification checks, performed as part of certificate chain validation, we developed an automatic, custom tool that uses a two-stage search combining brute-force and symbolic execution. This tool includes a constraint provenance tracker (CPT) that keeps track of the source code fragment that contributed to a particular constraint during symbolic execution.

In CERES, we use the novel notion of executable specification, which allows a custom interpreter to execute the specification directly and consequently giving us a reference implementation with little to no cost. We observed that it is possible to develop such an executable specification for X.509 standard. Such a specification is feasible due to the partitioning of the specification into syntactic and semantic rules. For capturing the syntactic requirements of an X.509 certificate according to RFC 5280, we use a restricted fragment of the attribute grammar. This identified fragment of attribute grammar induces efficient parsers that do not require backtracking. For capturing semantic restrictions, we observed that a quantifier-free first-order logic (QF-FOL) fragment is sufficient. An SMT solver can thus check semantic requirements expressed in this QF-FOL fragment. Using an SMT solver for checking semantic requirements has the following benefits: (I)&nbsp;it is possible to check the absence of conflicting requirements; (II) the SMT solver can provide the causes and proof of non-compliance; (III) one can easily extend the semantic requirements to add newer requirements with little cost.
