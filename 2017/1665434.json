The conference will be unique among recent subfactor conferences. Whereas many such conferences have dealt with relationship of subfactors with physics or conformal field theory, this conference will focus on the planar algebra descriptions of subfactor standard invariants. The conference will bring together leading experts for a concentrated look at this specific area. The award funds will be primarily directed to support graduate student and postdoc participation. This will provide an important opportunity for these junior researchers to learn of the state-of-the-art of the field, interact with leading researchers in the field, and develop contacts for future collaboration.",
