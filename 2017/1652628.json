 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: CAREER: Can Bioengineering Improve the Performance of Coastal Restoration?\r\nPI Name: Christine Angelini\r\nProposal Number: 1652628\r\n \r\nTo meet rising societal demand for shrinking ecosystem services including clean water, clean air, increased food supply, and flood protection, degraded habitats must be restored.  This project on oyster bed restoration highlights a new paradigm integrating global expertise in ecology and engineering.  Although nearly 1,000 projects have been initiated and $80 million has been spent since 1990 to restore imperiled Eastern oyster reefs in US estuaries, these efforts have resulted in the restoration of less than 2% of the reef area lost over the last century. Because oyster reefs remain functionally extinct worldwide, coastal residents are not deriving the valuable services these ecosystems provide, including shoreline protection from storms and erosion, water quality enhancement, and habitat for diverse animal communities. Thus, the persistence of coastal communities hinges upon our ability to develop new technologies to accelerate the pace of restoration and to train the next generation of students to be innovative restoration ecologists and engineers. The PI will develop new approaches to significantly enhance the yield of oysters generated relative to contemporary restoration methods that deploy large mounds of substrate. Education efforts will focus on enhanced student participation in interdisciplinary and international education programs that will prepare them to be globally competent and innovative restoration ecologists and engineers. \r\n \r\nThis research utilizes a series of experiments, expertise in structural engineering and fluid dynamics, and terrestrial laser scanning technology to study oyster reef assembly processes at small (1 meter) and larger spatial scales. The PI will test how Oyster Restoration Element (ORE) size, roughness, and spatial configuration mediate oyster growth, promote biodiversity, and provide enhanced ecosystem services in degraded reefs on the east and west coasts of Florida. Knowledge gained through this research will provide powerful insight into more efficient coastal ecosystem restoration. This work will establish a new area of study focused on harnessing hydrodynamics, species' interactions and substrate design to elevate the performance of restoration. The education plans will focus on improving undergraduate engineering advising and creating new courses and programs in which students can acquire an interdisciplinary, international education. These activities leverage existing infrastructure at the University of Florida to tackle two factors that tether engineering students to campus and prevent them from delving into complementary fields of study: student perceptions that experiential programs--including study abroad, field courses, and non-engineering minor degrees--are incompatible with strict degree requirements and limited student access to these programs.",
