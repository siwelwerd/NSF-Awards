 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops a high-capacity, high-performing storage system closely matched to the identified needs of climate science, but also of interest to a wide range of research and engineering fields such as brain and behavior research, high-energy physics, renewable energy, genomics, bioinformatics, computational chemistry, and the study of dark matter.  The two-tiered design of the storage system is consistent with best practices and would maximize research capacity and utilization.\r\n\r\nThe effort would create a distributed, shareable and parallel cluster running the BeeGFS file system (a European development), delivering about 1.8 PB (usable) storage and capable of up to 5GB/sec of streaming performance.  The project would support twelve science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) projects in a broad range of disciplines; co-investigators in mechanical, environmental, civil and aerospace engineering, computer science, and biology are participating.  The results would improve input-output operations associated with a number of research and engineering computation bottlenecks: parallel sequential writing during distributed-parallel geochemical, computational fluid dynamics, and structural mechanics simulations; new file creation during real-time data acquisition; and random read operations during post-processing and visualization.",

Moreover, this CC* Storage award has fostered research and training opportunities for the PI and the doctoral, masters, and undergraduate students of the PI and Co-PIs. The PI has been awarded three consecutive 10-week summer research fellowships at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) in 2019, 2020, and again in 2021.

SDSU is leading efforts in the study of simulating subsurface CO2 injection, geologic CO2 sequestration, and greenhouse gas flux measurement.  Geologic CO2 sequestration in deep subsurface reservoirs is a promising technique to reduce the impact of anthropogenic CO2 production on the climate.  Funding of this award will ultimately benefit society and contribute to the societal outcome of understanding, predicting, and moderating atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration.  This CC* Storage award has led to an increase in campus-wide partnerships between computational scientists, mechanical engineers, mathematicians, geological scientists, and biologists by providing a centralized, shared, 2.4PB capacity, data storage resource that several independent Linux clusters can mount for high performance I/O and scientific data archival.
