 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description\r\nToday, 3% of the world's total land cover is considered urban. By 2050, this number is expected to increase to 5%. Urbanization is one of the most significant forms of habitat change, resulting in biodiversity loss through local extinction processes. Urban expansion is expected to impact 25% of all endangered species in the next decade. The overall objective of this project is to investigate how some animals are able to thrive in urban environments while others are not, with a particular focus on how the natural stress response of some birds allows them to respond to factors such as light, noise, and pollution. This stress response differs between individuals that live in urban versus rural areas. This project will determine whether the stress response is genetically inherited by studying house sparrows living in a range of urban and urban settings. There is increasing global effort to build more environmentally-friendly cities, which may reduce stress levels of humans living in densely populated areas. Basic knowledge on how individuals adapt to city life can guide such strategies. The PI will visit a laboratory at Princeton University to learn the genetic techniques required for this project. Increasing her competence in modern molecular genetics through cooperation with Princeton will both establish an important new collaboration, and will significantly contribute to development of her career at the University of Nevada at Reno.  In addition, a number of outreach activities are planned, such as the involvement of citizen scientists who will learn about the research process through collection of data from urban nest box studies.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nUrbanization affects biological systems worldwide. Phenotypic differences between urban and rural populations demonstrate that some individuals have adapted to city life while others are displaced. A key trait facilitating adaptation is the degree to which animals respond to stress. This stress response has a heritable component and exhibits intra-individual plasticity. However, the mechanisms behind this variability and whether they might be responsible for adaptation to different environments are not known. The overarching hypothesis guiding this work is that an epigenetic mechanism, specifically DNA methylation, is responsible for modifying an individual?s stress response to environmental pressures. Variation in DNA methylation is a prime candidate to explain how organisms adapt to urban environments. Using house sparrows (Passer domesticus) from a gradient of urbanized habitats, the PI will first examine urban-rural differences in DNA methylation patterns at specific candidate genes and relate these patterns to the stress response. To unravel if differences in the stress response are due to heritable adaptation or phenotypic plasticity, an unprecedented cross-fostering field experiment will be integrated with multi-generational screening of the stress phenotype and methylation patterns. This experiment disentangles the contribution of genes, expression, and environmental effects across generations to variation in the stress response. By linking the fields of urban ecology, endocrinology, and epigenetics, this project will pioneer insights into the epigenetic variation underlying a physiological response. Knowledge of the mechanisms behind observed phenotypic differences will enable us to better assess the potential for adaptation of animals to city life, and thereby the impact of urbanization on wild populations. The information acquired is becoming essential in a world that is increasingly experiencing the stress of urbanization.",

The answers to the objectives operate at the interface between the genome and the phenome, linking environmental differences with physiological traits. There are three major findings as a direct result of funding.</p>\n<p><strong>First</strong>, we disentangled whether the glucocorticoid phenotype is a result of genetic or plastic mechanisms using a 4-way cross-foster between urban and rural environments. We showed that baseline corticosterone levels respond to the environment of the foster parent, i.e., rural offspring that were moved to an urban environment significantly increased their corticosterone levels, mimicking those of urban offspring. Therefore, hormonal plasticity plays a pivotal role in the modification of the phenotype, even within the first two weeks of life. This finding demonstrates for the first time how correlated phenotypic adjustments to urban life might arise. We consider this finding a major advance in our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie physiological responses to environmental change.</p>\n<p><strong>Second</strong>, we found that at hatching, urban house wren offspring had increased methylation as compared to their rural counterparts, and observed plasticity in methylation as offspring aged, indicating developmental effects of the rearing environment on methylation. Differential methylation analyses showed that cellular respiration genes were differentially expressed at hatching and behavioral and metabolism genes were differentially expressed at fledgling. Lastly, hyper-methylation of a single gene (CNTNAP2) is associated with increased glucocorticoid levels.</p>\n<p><strong>Third</strong>, although empirical and theoretical models all show extensive variation in phenotypic plasticity, the mechanisms behind this variation are often unknown. Using a cross-foster design, we selected individuals of different glucocorticoid phenotypes and compared the parental to the F1 generation. For the first time, we demonstrate high heritability (h2 &gt; 47%) in glucocorticoid plasticity. Our findings provide the first empirical evidence for the existence of heritable individual variation and is a critical step in understanding how and why endocrine systems evolve in the face of environmental change.</p>\n<p>Results from this project are published in 6 peer-reviewed journals and three more manuscripts are under review.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></span></p>\n<p>This project has propelled interest in urbanization and how we can improve the health and wellbeing of humans and wildlife living in densely populated places. Due to interviews with NPR and our local public radio station, I have been in touch with the urban planning board of Reno, Nevada. Songbird declines have been particularly dramatic in Nevada, including the decline of the state bird, mountain bluebird. We are currently advising urban developers on the types of lighting for animal and human health. Reno as a city has undergone rapid expansion (&gt;15% population growth for the past decade) and developers, conservationists, and forest management are all interested in greenifying Reno's landscapes.</p>\n<p>1) Engagement through data collection: The project uses existing resources at urban parks, elementary schools and UNR. We placed nest boxes (~350) at centralized locations to target K-12 students, the university, and residents of Reno. At Caughlin Ranch, monthly newsletters went out to all residents (~2000) updating them about the project, including pictures of undergraduate researchers, birds inhabiting the boxes and research findings. PI Ouyang led bird walks around Caughlin ranch (2 times per year with ~40 participants each time).</p>\n<p>2) Engagement for elementary students: Nest-watchers is a program that is initiated with this project. Nest boxes and feeders have been set up at elementary schools in third-grade classrooms (3 classrooms at 3 different elementary schools). Students keep a journal of daily sightings, and we teach the students about bird identification and using the data to test for differences between seasons. This program reached three elementary classrooms at Title I schools in Reno.</p>\n<p>3) Engagement of undergraduate researchers, especially under-represented students: As part of the Fledge Program, PI Ouyang?s research experience for undergraduates, we fledged 34 undergraduates. These undergraduates are part of McNair scholars program, targeting underrepresented groups in science. Undergraduates assembled research portfolios of their research prospectus, goals, data analyses, and their final research products. SURE survey results indicate that students? experience and attitude towards science significantly improved after participation in the Fledge Program. Of the 34 graduated students, 94% are in professional schools or careers in STEM.</p>\n<p>4) For my personal training, the collaboration with Princeton University (von Holdt lab) has been highly fruitful.
