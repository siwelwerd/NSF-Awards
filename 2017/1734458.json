The title of this conference is \"Connecting Observations to Global Circulation Modeling Challenges.\"  The goal of the conference is to bring modelers and theorists together with observationalists to identify and tackle outstanding questions and significant uncertainties that are present in current global circulation models.  The conference has a dual impact of improving models for societal benefit and developing the next generation of scientists by allowing them to fully engage in discussions about the state of the field and the next steps forward.\r\n\r\nThe 10th Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and 4th Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) will be held at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine in July 2017.  The main meeting is divided into eight sessions, each with an invited discussion lead and two or three invited speakers covering an area of outstanding challenges in radiation and climate.  Sessions will be convened on topics such as:  stability and moisture, convective aggregation, cirrus clouds, and mixed phase processes in Arctic clouds.  The GRS, which is held immediately prior to the GRC, will allow about 60 graduate students and early career scientists to share and present their work.",
