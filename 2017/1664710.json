It is important to make solar panels as efficient as possible so that the number of panels needed to obtain a certain amount of power can be reduced in order to save on installation costs. Tandem cells, comprised of a top cell that harvests the visible portion of the spectrum and a bottom cell that harvests the infrared portion, are the most promising way to achieve higher efficiencies. Silicon, which is used in approximately 92% of the solar panels that are manufactured each year, is ideal for the bottom cell and typically has 16-21 % efficiency by itself. Perovskite semiconductors are highly attractive for the top cell because they can be tuned to have the right bandgap and have efficiency as high as 22%. The objective of this project is to demonstrate the first 30%-efficient perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nThis project describes plans for a perovskite expert, Professor Michael McGehee, to partner with a silicon expert, Professor Zachary Holman, to make perovskites/silicon tandem solar cells. This team has made a prototype two-terminal monolithic device with a power conversion efficiency of 25.3 %. They hold the world record for this type of device and are in a very strong position to increase the efficiency to 30% over the next two years. This development is especially exciting because their packaged perovskite solar cells have already passed the PV industry standard damp heat and temperature cycling tests and it is likely that panels with these cells could be manufactured at a cost of < $100/m2. The bandgap of perovskites can be tuned from 1.2 eV to 2.3 eV using the materials set ABX3, where A is a mixture of methylammonium, formamidinium or cesium, B is a mixture of tin and lead, and X is a mixture of bromine or iodine. The most important research goal of this project is to find the optimal combination of these components for making a stable and high-quality semiconductor with a bandgap of 1.8 eV. The team will thoroughly characterize the semiconductors it makes to guide the process of optimizing the properties. Additional research goals of this project are to develop high-mobility TCO layers for the front of the tandem solar cells, improve the infrared response of the silicon bottom cell while decreasing its cost via a porous dielectric/metal rear reflector, and fabricate PDMS layers with scattering textures to be used at the front of the tandem to reduce reflectance.\r\nThis project has the potential to change our future energy landscape through the development of efficient yet inexpensive PV technologies. The project will also train a diverse pool of students and the results will be disseminated broadly. Holman is the PI of an NSF REU site into which the proposed project will be integrated. Approximately once every 18 months McGehee gives a lecture that is intended to be easy to understand even for people who are not yet scientists and posts it on YouTube.  These lectures are typically viewed more than 20,000 times by a wide variety of people. \r\n",

The approach used was to pair a complementary solar cell of a perovskite solar cell with a silicon solar cell?the workhorse of the solar industry?to form a tandem solar cell in which each sub-cell absorbs and converts only part of the solar spectrum. In particular, the project aimed to overcome the main scientific and engineering hurdles to a 30%-efficient silicon-based tandem, which were the development of an efficient wide-bandgap perovskite cell its (low-loss) integration with a silicon bottom cell. Prior to this project, we demonstrated a world-record 23.6%-efficient perovskite/silicon tandem, with a 14.5% perovskite top cell. This project was structured to further increase the device efficiency by improving the open-circuit voltage (<em>V<sub>oc</sub></em>), short-circuit current density (<em>J<sub>sc</sub></em>), and fill factor (<em>FF</em>) of the tandem through materials innovation and device optimization.</p>\n<p>To find the perovskite composition that yields the best efficiency and long-term stability, we investigated Cs<sub>x</sub>FA<sub>1&minus;x</sub>Pb(Br<sub>y</sub>I<sub>1&minus;y</sub>)<sub>3</sub> perovskite cell performance and photostability across a compositional space of formamidinium (FA) and cesium (Cs) at the A-site, for various halide compositions. We found that using more Cs at the A-site, rather than more Br at the X-site, is preferred to widen the bandgap, as it improves both <em>V<sub>oc</sub></em> and photostability. We developed bandgap maps and design criteria for the selection of perovskite compositions within the Cs<sub>x</sub>FA<sub>1&minus;x</sub>Pb(Br<sub>y</sub>I<sub>1&minus;y</sub>)<sub>3</sub>, space. With this, we identified perovskites with tandem-relevant bandgaps of 1.68 and 1.75 eV and demonstrated perovskite cell efficiencies of 17.4% and 16.3%, respectively, both with significantly improved photostability compared to that of the higher Br-containing compositions. Incorporating poly[bis(4-phenyl)(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) as a hole contact instead of the more common NiO<sub>x</sub>, we increased <em>V<sub>oc</sub></em> up to 1.1 V?a more than 100 mV improvement compared to our previous record.</p>\n<p>To understand the optical loss when coupling the perovskite top cell with a silicon bottom cell, we first characterized the optical constants of every material in the perovskite/silicon tandem device, and used these data to reproduce the device in an optical model. Our optical simulations revealed that reflection and parasitic absorption in the front indium tin oxide (ITO) layer and electron contact are responsible for the biggest optical losses. And, applying a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) light-scattering film on the front of the tandem can increase the <em>J<sub>sc</sub></em> by about 0.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>. We also found that the complex refractive index of methylammonium lead triiodide, the most common perovskite absorber for solar cells, can be used to generate approximate optical constants for an arbitrary wide-bandgap perovskite by translating the data along the wavelength axis. With these optical constants, we mapped the <em>J<sub>sc</sub></em> of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells as a function of the perovskite thickness and bandgap--both of which can be readily tuned experimentally--providing a guide to current-matched tandems with any perovskite bandgap between 1.56 and 1.68 eV.</p>\n<p>Guided by the aforementioned simulations, we achieved a 25%-efficient perovskite/silicon tandem, which was the highest reported tandem efficiency at the time published. This 1-cm<sup>2</sup> champion device featured a <em>V<sub>oc </sub></em>of 1.77 V, a 120 mV increase compared to our previous record; a <em>J<sub>sc </sub></em>of 18.4 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, consistent with our optical modeling predictions; and a <em>FF </em>of 77%, a slightly drop compared to the 79% of our previous report.</p>\n<p>To understand the origin of the <em>FF</em> loss, we adapted the <em>J<sub>sc</sub></em>-<em>V<sub>oc</sub></em> characterization technique to perovskite solar cells. We used a continuous-lamp solar simulator with an array of neutral density filters instead of the quasi-steady-state photoconductance technique commonly employed for silicon cells, which allowed us to tune sweep parameters to accommodate the complex behavior of perovskites, such as hysteresis. We found that, for a PTAA hole contact, increasing the PTAA thickness barely changes the recombination-limited pseudo-<em>FF</em>, but reduces the <em>FF</em> due to increased series resistance. It reveals that PTAA is an effective carrier-selective contact (capable of sustaining a high<em> V<sub>oc</sub></em>) but is resistive even to the holes it collects. By reducing the thickness of PTAA, thereby reducing the resistive loss, a maximum <em>FF</em> of 80.9% was achieved with the PTAA hole contact on a CsFA perovskite absorber. The series resistance that one can extrapolate as the PTAA thickness becomes vanishingly small sets an upper bound for the lumped resistance of the electron contact, and its comparatively small value of around 2 &Omega;&#8231;cm<sup>2</sup>. To further improve the <em>FF</em> and thus achieving the targeted 30%-efficient perovskite/silicon tandem, it is imperative to find new carrier-selective contacts with better conductivity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/01/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zachary&nbsp;C&nbsp;Holman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1664710/1664710_10482868_1564712477579_ProjectoutcomesreportFigure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1664710/1664710_10482868_1564712477579_ProjectoutcomesreportFigure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1664710/1664710_10482868_1564712477579_ProjectoutcomesreportFigure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 2.
