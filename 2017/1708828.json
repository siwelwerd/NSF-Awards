 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division funds this work. Professors Emily Fogle and Eric Jones from California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo (Cal Poly) study enzyme catalyzed reactions of compounds containing sulfur, thioesters. Thioesters are a class of reactive molecules with important roles in both chemistry and biochemistry. Thioesters are common intermediates in many biosynthetic reactions, including starting materials for steroid production.  The research examines enzymatic reactions of thioesters with nitrogen-containing molecules and to studies of a common bacterial form of the enzyme NAGS (N-acetylglutamate synthase).  This research is incorporated into a self-sustaining research experience that occurs in an upper division undergraduate laboratory class. The work is incorporated into a required, advanced biochemistry course that biochemistry majors take in their junior year. The goal is for all biochemistry majors at Cal Poly to have an authentic research experience and gain knowledge, skills and self-confidence. \r\n\r\nThe research project studies the enzymatic reaction of thioesters with nitrogen nucleophiles (aminolysis reactions) and characterizes a common bacterial form of N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS). Thioesters are a very important class of reactive carboxylic acid derivatives in which a sulfur atom replaces the typical oxygen or nitrogen atom in the leaving group position. Thioesters are generally more highly reactive toward nucleophiles than the equivalent oxoesters and this factor has resulted in important roles in both organic chemistry and biochemistry. The specific scientific aims of this work are to purify and kinetically characterize three bacterial NAGS enzymes and to determine the nitrogen and sulfur kinetic isotope effects for the NAGS-catalyzed reaction. This work is also incorporated into a self-sustaining research experience that occurs in an upper division laboratory class.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary scientific goal of this project was to understand how one particular enzyme, N-acetylglutamate synthase (NAGS), acts in the pathway that produces the amino acid arginine in bacteria.  Understanding how one enzyme works in a pathway often leads to a better understanding of exactly how a pathway works, and in the past, understanding how necessary pathways work in bacteria has allowed scientists to produce potent antibiotics.  Although this project did not develop antibiotics, it did deepen the understanding of an enzyme in a necessary bacterial pathway. \n\n \n\nPrior to our studies, this enzyme had been characterized from one organism and showed unusual characteristics: it bound the molecule it was supposed to use very poorly and was very inefficient.  This is surprising because enzymes are almost always extremely specific and extraordinarily efficient.  We studied NAGS enzymes from three different sources and found that the enzymes from two of them were not specific and were very inefficient, similar to the originally studied enzyme.  The enzyme from the third source showed the expected specificity, although the enzyme is still relatively inefficient.  Comparison of the structures of these enzymes suggests that the least specific/efficient enzymes are lacking a particular structural feature. These structural differences are likely to contribute to the differences in behavior observed.\n\n \n\nAnother important goal of the project was to involve undergraduate students in this research.  Cal Poly is a primarily undergraduate institution, and all of the research was performed by undergraduate research teams.  Undergraduate research is a high-impact practice and studies have shown that participation in undergraduate research improves graduation rates, increases college retention, increases independence and subject-matter expertise, and leads to greater confidence and understanding of the research process. This project involved 13 undergraduate students in traditional, one-on-one mentored research experiences, several being involved for a year or more. \n\n \n\nIn addition, more than 80 additional students participated in this research as part of a course-based undergraduate research experience (CURE).   In a CURE, original research is performed as part of a scheduled catalog course.  The problem being investigated is an actual scientific question with an unknown answer and students gain an authentic experience of scientific thinking and problem-solving within the framework of a class.  CUREs have been associated with many of the same benefits observed with traditional research, but they address some of the limitations associated with the traditional research model including equity, scalability and cost.   While implementing the CURE, faculty at our institution have developed teaching materials and skills necessary to continue to include CUREs as a permanent part of the curriculum.  Finally, we were also able to collect and publish data that suggests that students feel more confident performing scientific tasks at the end of our CURE than at the end of the traditional laboratory class that the CURE replaced.   This has important implications because students who feel confident performing scientific tasks are more likely to go into the technical fields which are needed in our increasingly technological society.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/17/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Emily Fogle"
