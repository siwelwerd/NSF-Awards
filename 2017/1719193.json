The conference brings together leading scientists and engineers from across the globe in academia, industry and government who are motivated to advance nanotechnologies in a way that is safe for human health and the environment. Increasingly commercial, industrial and environmental products and processes are using nano-enabled systems. Nanotechnology offers tremendous opportunities to improve human health, product performance, energy and food production efficiency, and environmental protection. Benefitting from such opportunities must be accompanied by knowledge and policy that protects the environment. This fourth GRC builds on a successful conference history, and will challenge speakers and participants to consider the horizon of these emerging innovations and implications of environmental nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe GRC has a tremendous success and track record of facilitating meetings that are in depth, intense scientific discussions involving scientific leaders in their disciplines and communities. This Environmental Nanotechnology GRC will focus on emerging topics, including i) applications of nanomaterials in food and agriculture, ii) translational issues and design opportunities in manufacturing, and iii) question the why, why not and how of nano-enabled products as well as recurring themes at the heart of the field, including engaging the public and nano-bio-phenomena and processes. This will be the second Environmental Nanotechnology GRS, which is organized by and for early career scientists and engineers. Graduate students, postdoctoral associates, and a group of invited mentors will come together to contribute to engaging technical research sessions and a mentorship panel. This year, sessions include, i) Nanotechnology: Novel Applications and Advantages to Current Alternatives, ii) The Yin and Yang of Nano-initiated Biological Inactivation, and iii) Novel Methodologies for Evaluating Environmental Impact-Benefit Tradeoffs of Nanotechnology. The mentorship component will include editors of leading journals in the field to discuss and provide guidance on publishing success.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIncreasing number of commercial, industrial and environmental products and process are are using nano-enabled systems.  The 4th Gordon Research Conference on Environmental Nanotechnology focused on nano-enabled products, including better understanding of the interaction of nanomaterials from these products and the environment through metrology and basic understanding of interactions with biological entities.  In addition we discussed public perception of nanomaterials and how we as scientists can better frame the public discussion surrounding nanomaterials.  In the past decade, the scientific community has made great advances in research evaluation nanomaterials that may eventually be used in consumer products and their eventual distribution in to the environment.  This meeting discussed the next steps in the field and projecting into the future.  The meeting focused on topics such as advances in nanomaterial design and development for creating the next generation of materials, as well as the new applications that are being developed for these materials.  These applications range from fabrication and unique properties of highly novel nanostructured materials that are, as yet, underutilized in such applications (e.g. 2D nanostructures, soft nanomaterials, and bio-nancomposites to innovative applications of both established and emerging nanomaterials to address grand environmental challenges related to resource security and sustainable development (e.g., carbon capture and conversion, nano-enabled membranes at the energy-water nexus, and sensing technologies for real-time environmental quality monitoring).  The applications of materials for food and agriculture were also discussed and their negative but also positive implications for the environment.  In addition the development and application for characterization of in situ characterization techniques to reliably measure the extrinsic properties, or those that depend on the surrounding environment was explored.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/07/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sharon L Walker"
