 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditionally, many of our critical systems have been developed with security as a reactive add-on, rather than a by default design. As a result, existing security mechanisms are often fragmented, hard to configure or verify, which makes it difficult to defend against various cyber attacks. This project will build the \"holy grail\" for enterprise/cloud/data-center security management with software-defined infrastructure (SDI): a unified framework for security and management of disparate resources, ranging from processes to storage to networking. Cloud computing is now an essential part of our national cyberinfrastructure; the proposed work will lower the total cost of ownership for clouds - further unlocking economic and environmental benefits - as well as improving the security of today's clouds.\r\n\r\nThis project proposes S2OS (SDI-defined Security Operating System), which abstracts security capabilities and primitives at both the host Operating System (OS) and network levels and offers an easy-to-use and programmable security model for monitoring and dynamically securing applications. This project will explore new techniques to transparently compose software into a unified enterprise, even if the individual pieces were never explicitly designed to inter-operate, similar in a way a traditional operating system managing various hardware resources for upper-layer user applications. Further, this project will contribute new ways to leverage global information for making effective local security management decisions. Finally, this project enables new innovations in programming dynamic, host-network coordinated, and intelligent security applications to protect the entire infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThis project will make significant contributions to how enterprise, data centers and cloud computing are securely built and managed. The project's PIs will engage in educational and outreach activities to train the next generation talent. In particular, the PIs plan to integrate the interdisciplinary research ideas into courses spanning networking, systems and security. The project will also actively encourage participation from underrepresented groups and transfer technology to industry partners.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n \n\n\nThe goal of this project was to study the unified abstractions and management of software security at a data-center scale. We prototyped and evaluated S2OS, a security OS for managing software-defined infrastructure. S2OS contributes techniques for virtualizing hardware and software, including components that predate S2OS, such as trusted execution environment (TEE) hardware. This project demonstrates the potential for leveraging global information, such as using machine learning on network data to identify and defend against malware. This project has also contributed additional system management and security data, tools, and techniques.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntellectual Merit: One set of contributions from this project is in the area of techniques to virtualize, or abstract and integrate, hardware and software that is not designed for software-defined security management. Examples include vSGX, a virtualized environment for running code designed for Intels SGX on AMDs SEVboth are trusted execution environments with different requirements and restrictionsfacilitating more flexible code deployments. Similarly, the project has contributed techniques for refactoring code to deploy in a TEE and has demonstrated that, unlike CPU hardware, the most efficient layer for virtualizing accelerators, such as GPUs, is at the software API level.\n\n\n\n\n\nA second set of contributions from the project comes from studying how to program security and management software across these hardware and software resources in a data center. For instance, the Toccoa sub-project supports programmable network packet analysis at the rate of tens of millions of packets per second, while also scaling out to more nodes linearly.In particular, S2OS presents SysFlow, a programmable zero trust framework for modeling and controlling software activities across the entire infrastructure. Current Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) mainly focuses on the network security and lacks in-depth considerations on system level security policies and abstractions, which leaves the realization of the principle incomplete. To bridge the gap, we propose an innovative programmable system security framework called SysFlow to enable unified, dynamic, and fine-grained Zero Trust security control for system resources. SysFlow introduces a novel system flow abstraction to model system activities across the entire infrastructure, and provides a system level data plane and control plane separation and abstraction.

The SysFlow data plane, acting as Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), enforces translated system flow rules, which can be updated dynamically and facilitate fine-grained responsive actions. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of SysFlow, which addresses the security issues in various scenarios with a minor performance overhead.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, S2OS contributes novel security defense and mitigation techniques that are only possible with data collected, analyzed, and applied at scale. For instance, the IMap sub-project shows how to implement network-level defenses that leverage data collected at scale yet deployed in individual switches. The xNIDS sub-project further applies machine learning to characterize network traffic, troubleshoot issues, and automatically generate defenses. Similarly, the study of ransomware defense shows that network-level monitoring for a command-and-control channel can be more effective than tracking file access behavior on a single system. Other examples of novel security management applications enabled by S2OS include 1) risk-aware micro-segmentation for micro-services, which confines file accesses within a containers scope and isolates potentially compromised containers from one another; 2) fine-grained and Context-aware Access Control (FCAC) in web applications, which offers context-aware, fine-grained access control within web servers; and 3) Virtual Patching, a security policy enforcement layer that prevents the exploitation of a known vulnerability promptly, even if a patch is not yet available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts: Data-center scale computing is rapidly becoming the norm for modern computing, yet security and administrative tools are struggling to scale up from a single machine to a rack or data center. The S2OS project shows how to leverage and extend software-defined infrastructure to build security management solutions at scale. The project has supported the training and research of seventeen students. Key software components of S2OS have been released as open source.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: GuofeiGu\n"
