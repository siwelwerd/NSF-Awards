This award is supported by the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences. This program motivates a diverse group of students to pursue careers in scientific research. The ten participants are integrated into different research groups. Cohort activities promote student independence and the development of professional skills and judgment during the ten week summer program. Each participant is given the opportunity to present his/her research at a meeting within the department, and to write up a summary of their work in a journal format that is compiled for distribution to their home institution. Opportunities for participants to present results at national meetings are also included. The participants are provided an experience that not only enables them to obtain a realistic view of modern chemical research, but also exposes them to an environment indicative of what they can expect in graduate school.\r\n\r\nThe program helps to prepare young scientists for global competition in science and innovation with a strong emphasis on the up and coming areas of chemical applications to the areas of energy and materials research. Sophomore or junior undergraduate students majoring in chemistry or biochemistry are targeted for recruitment. Special efforts are made to recruit women and minority groups traditionally underrepresented among professional chemists. A unique feature of this program is the partnership with the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) to recruit disabled students. The University of Arkansas Fayetteville, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry has established procedures that help assure success in the recruitment of students from these groups. This aspect of the recruitment plan utilizes the University's infrastructure in minority recruiting.",

This REU program sought to give students an intense 10-week research experience related to Materials and Energy research within the Chemistry and Biochemistry Department at the University of Arkansas during the summers of 2018 and 2019. A total of 19 students participated during these two summers.  A summer program for 2020 was planned but was cancelled due to the COVID 19 pandemic.   Presentations about graduate school and ethics were also included.  \n\nOne main objective was to introduce students to Ph.D. level research, with an emphasis on students from smaller schools with few opportunities for research.  An effort was made to ensure diversity of gender as well as include various members of underrepresented groups in STEM fields.\n\nAll students wrote their summer projects up in journal format.  The reports were compiled into a booklet and  mailed to the students, the mentors and the students\u2019 home institution.  Copies were also archived in the University Library. \n\nThis is the main outcome of the project was investment in human capital.  The training program introduced students to research science, and provided them with an opportunity to think at a different level.  Each student\u2019s research project made a contribution to the specific area that was being studied.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David W Paul"
