These participants will benefit from attending the school, learning from senior colleagues, presenting their own research in poster sessions, and expanding their network contacts within the community, but who lack funds and would not be able to attend without travel support. The student selection criteria emphasize ethnic diversity, gender equality, and geographic diversity, to ensure broad participation in the workshop.",
