 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nerve cells extend long, thin protrusions called axons that define the wiring pattern of the nervous system. Axons allow nerve cells to communicate electrically with each other and with other cells throughout the body. Each axon contains a microscopic, internal scaffold of space-filling proteins called neurofilaments that are constantly shuttled along the axon by molecular motor proteins; these define axon shape and size. Neurofilaments accumulate during development, increasing axon diameter and allowing electrical activity to travel more quickly; excessive accumulation (as occurs in many neurodegenerative diseases) can lead to communication abnormalities and axonal degeneration. This project tests the hypothesis that the rate of neurofilament transport determines the diameter, shape and function of axons.  The work will be conducted by a seasoned interdisciplinary team of biologists and physicists, combining innovative biological imaging techniques with mathematical and computational methods to investigate these important questions. The insights gained from this research will be critical for understanding healthy brain function and could also provide important insights into the axonal problems observed in many neurodegenerative diseases. Trainees on this project from both the physical and life sciences will work in teams supervised by the principal investigators, and will expand their skills through interdisciplinary interaction, adding to the skilled research workforce at the interface of the physical and life sciences. To extend the impact of the proposed research to the K-12 level, the physicists and biologists on this project will host focused, small-group workshops that will seek to empower middle and high school teachers with ideas and tools to invigorate their instruction in the areas of cell biology and algorithmic thinking, and introducing freely available but powerful learning tools that they can apply in their classrooms.\r\n\r\nThe function of nervous systems is dependent on the propagation of action potentials along axons at a velocity that is specific to their physiological function. This velocity is dependent on axon size and shape. A principal determinant of axon size and shape in vertebrates are space-filling cytoskeletal polymers called neurofilaments. Neurofilaments are also cargoes of axonal transport that move along microtubule tracks. Thus, neurofilaments define axonal morphology, but they are also in constant flux. The proposed research addresses this intriguing and physiologically important relationship. The central hypothesis is that the kinetics of neurofilament transport determines axonal neurofilament content, which in turn specifies axonal caliber and function. The specific goals are to determine the dynamic interplay between neurofilament transport velocity and flux in the specification of overall axon caliber, and how neurofilaments navigate local constrictions at the nodes of Ranvier. To accomplish these goals, the investigators will employ a tight integration of computational and mathematical methods with innovative live imaging of myelinated axons in peripheral nerves ex vivo from a new transgenic mouse that expresses a photoactivatable neurofilament protein in neurons.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNerve cells that are connected to each other and to other cells in the body by long slender extensions called axons.  Axons function to conduct nerve impulses and thus define the wiring pattern of our nervous system.   The conduction velocity of axons is influenced by their diameter; wider axons propagate nerve impulses more rapidly.  An important determinant of axon diameter are neurofilaments, which are microscopic sub-cellular space-filling protein polymers that accumulate in the cytoplasm of axons to drive axonal expansion during development. \n\nNeurofilaments are formed in the nerve cell body and shipped out into axons by a mechanism called axonal transport.  The central goal of this project was to test the hypothesis that the transport of neurofilaments determines axonal neurofilament content, which in turn specifies axonal caliber. The project was a collaboration between two researchers, one a biologist at Ohio State University with expertise on NFs and axonal transport, and the other a physicist at Ohio University with expertise on computational modeling.  A strength of the proposed research was the tight integration of experimental and computational approaches to explore a fundamental problem in cellular neuroscience that cannot presently be understood by experimentation alone. \n\nThe funded research resulted in the publication of ten peer-reviewed articles and supported, in part, the training of six graduate students, three post-docs, one undergraduate and one high school student with diverse backgrounds in the physical and life sciences.  Among our key accomplishments, we quantified the kinetics of neurofilament transport with high temporal resolution, revealing that the movement is faster and more intermittent than previously understood.  We discovered that neurofilaments are very flexible and frequently undergo complex folding behaviors, but when they move, they almost always stretch out, implying that they may be pulled from their leading ends and that their movement may function to organize them in the axon.  Using a novel approach to image neurofilament transport in living axons of adult mice, we showed that almost all neurofilaments in axons move and that they move both forwards and backwards along the axon, but in a net forwards direction.  This research resolved a long-standing controversy concerning the mobility of neurofilaments in mature adult axons.\n\nBy analyzing neurofilament transport during postnatal development, we showed that the growth of axon diameter is due primarily to an increase in neurofilament influx into the axons at early times, transitioning to a slowing of their transport velocity at later times.  Since the production and transport of neurofilaments requires energy, these changes have the advantage of reducing the metabolic cost of expanding axon diameter.\n\nIn the course of this work, we also analyzed neurofilament transport across nodes of Ranvier, which are sites along axons that are critical for the propagation of the nerve impulse.  It has been shown previously that axons are constricted at nodes.  We showed that these constrictions have an important physiological function in that they increase the efficiency of nerve conduction, but they are also potential bottlenecks for neurofilament transport.  We found that neurofilaments navigate these bottlenecks by locally accelerating, much as the current increases where a stream narrows. We showed that this local acceleration allows axons to maintain a stable morphology across these nodal constrictions and that this can be explained by an increase in the proximity of neurofilaments to the tracks along which they move, thereby increasing their frequency of movement. \n\nCollectively, this work has demonstrated the dynamic nature of axonal neurofilaments in axons and supports the hypothesis that axon morphology is actively and dynamically regulated by the movement of these structural protein polymers. \n\nTo increase the broader impact of our research, we developed an outreach initiative called Cells4Kids in which we visited local middle schools to talk to 6th graders about cells.  We prepared a highly interactive presentation which is designed to get the kids excited and curious about cells and cell movement.  The presentation is fun, engaging and informative and has been well received by both the kids and the teachers.  Over the course of this award, we have given this presentation to approximately 35 classes across five different schools in four different school districts, reaching a total of approximately 700 children.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/11/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anthony Brown"
