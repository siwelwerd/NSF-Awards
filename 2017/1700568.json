 "awd_abstract_narration": "An increasing percentage of the nation's technician workforce will use geospatial technologies in their occupations. An important need has therefore emerged for well-qualified technicians who possess geospatial skills. To meet this emergent need, the University of North Georgia (UNG) will collaborate with industrial partners to develop new programs focused on geospatial and engineering technology to prepare highly-skilled technicians for success in applicable science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professions. The curriculum will promote an integrated understanding of areas such as geographic information systems, computer-aided design techniques, surveying, and spatial analysis. In addition, the project will create course materials that incorporate elements of geospatial and engineering technologies into traditional science classes such as biology, geology, and physics to also enhance student learning in these courses. The project will offer students the opportunity to obtain employer-recognized credentials, expand pathways toward technician careers, and enrich the scientific and engineering technology workforce.\r\n\r\nThrough a strong partnership of education and industry, the project will develop curricula for two new academic programs at the UNG-Gainesville campus: an Associate of Science degree in Geospatial and Engineering Technology and a certificate in Land Surveying. Innovative courses will be developed to integrate aspects of geospatial technology courses, such as spatial environmental variability, and aspects of engineering technology courses such as numerical and design case studies. The coursework will focus on applications to distinctive technical areas including agricultural science and engineering, forestry and conservation, environmental science and engineering, surveying and mapping, geology, and civil engineering. The project will develop articulation agreements that link high schools and technical colleges to associate and bachelor level degrees to offer seamless transition pathways. The intellectual merit of this project is manifested by introducing and combining geospatial and engineering technologies to enhance career pathways in many applicable fields. The impact of the collective efforts on student learning will also be assessed. The project will disseminate course materials, processes, methodologies, outcomes, and best practices to the STEM education community.",

The UNG Gainesville Campus is predominately a 2-year campus with an access mission where the majority of students are enrolled in Associate Degree programs. The development and approval of the new academic programs was accomplished early in the time line of the project increasing the academic opportunities and workforce development initiatives in the region. To facilitate strong industry related skills and support of the AGET project, an\u202fExecutive Advisory Board (EAB) was formed and significantly strengthened curricular development, recruitment, implementation and dissemination efforts. Workforce development, the second project objective, was enhanced in the region through the project's curricular developments and has increased the geospatial and engineering technician workforce by way of the additional courses, certificate and degree pathway. The project provided a seamless transition from high schools and technical colleges to the above new associate degree and certificate program. Dissemination of project activities, a third objective, was achieved through various professional papers, conference presentations, and a lessons learned manual. \n\n \n\nCompleted project deliverables and outcomes include curriculum development\u202fwhere courses were developed leading to new stackable Associate of Science degree pathway in geospatial engineering technologies and a new technician level\u202fcertificate in Land Surveying. Courses are aimed at entry-level students and build progressive steps in understanding engineering CAD, surveying, geospatial science and technology (GST), and applied skills via directed emphasis areas for specific science and engineering technician careers. New courses developed in support of these programs included: Surveying 1, Surveying 2, Legal Aspects of Surveying, Professional Practice of Surveying, Physical Environmental Science, and Environmental Management and Sustainability.  Since the project's inception, 154 students have enrolled in Surveying 1, 63 students in Surveying 2, 91 students in the Legal Aspects of Surveying, 40 students in Professional Practice of Surveying, 438 students in Physical Environmental Science, and 130 students in Environmental Sustainability and Management.  The project additionally supported a redesigned Graphics and Information Visualization course that integrates CAD, GST, and surveying.   \n\nThe project supported industry outreach, high school recruiting and temporary employment of new full and part-time surveying faculty members. With the success of the project's new courses and programs, the University now supports a permanent state funded Senior Lecturer of Surveying Practice position. The new position serves as the lead instructor, advisor, recruiter and promoter of the surveying program at high schools and within the surveying industry.  The university also supports an additional part-time surveying faculty member.  \n\nAs a result of the AGET project, additional spin off courses and credentials were developed outside of the original project goals. These include an Introductory UAS course, a Terrestrial Lidar course, an Aerial Geomatics Methods course and a graduate certificate in Geomatics. The graduate certificate consists of four new courses including graduate versions of the Legal Aspects of Surveying and Professional Practice of Surveying and graduate versions of Aerial Geomatics Methods and Terrestrial Lidar. As a result of these additional courses and credentials, a student has stackable options beginning from the technician level, to professional level and finally to graduate level coursework associated with surveying and geospatial engineering technology. \n\nGeospatial lab exercises were supported and developed by the project and workshops were offered to faculty to facilitate implementation of lab exercises in courses and academic units outside of the academic home of the grant team.  Although workshop implementation was somewhat impeded due to modality changes etc. associated with the pandemic, AGET team members were able to assist in supporting the implementation of those exercises in a variety of courses. The geospatial course materials and lab exercises continue to be made available to faculty in other disciplines through a project web site.  \n\nIn summary, the work very effectively met the original goals and expectations of the project, resulted in additional new courses and programs outside of the original goals, and met a critical workforce need in the state of Georgia by offering the required coursework necessary toward licensure as a professional land surveyor. Overall, the new courses and programs developed, successfully and immediately meet workforce needs toward employment while concurrently articulating with baccalaureate degrees programs. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeff Turk"
