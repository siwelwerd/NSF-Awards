 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomical observations show that collisions between large galaxies are violent events.  During collisions galaxies form many stars, and the galaxies change shape.   Sometimes small galaxies, called dwarf galaxies, merge with larger galaxies during collisions.  Other times the collisions produce long trains of stars thrown out into the space between galaxies.  The investigators have numerically simulated the mergers of dwarf galaxies and studied the remnants of these mergers.  In this project, they will improve their simulations and compare the simulations with new observations.  New telescopes, like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), are designed to study the smallest and faintest galaxies in the Universe.  Many more colliding dwarf galaxies are soon to be discovered with these telescopes.  The investigators will use their simulations to better understand the merger history of galaxies.  This topic is important for understanding the history of formation of our own Milky Way galaxy.  This collaborative project will leverage strong existing outreach efforts at both Columbia University and The University of Arizona.  They will expand the TIMESTEP program, which reaches under-represented minorities and develops a community to support them throughout their academic careers.  They will also support graduate students who produce popular YouTube videos, which answer top public astronomy questions.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will improve their previous simulations by increasing mass resolution of the cosmological simulations and by modeling larger volumes of space.  They plan to model dwarf galaxy pairs in the region near our Milky Way galaxy.  They will dynamically match the models and explore the role of dwarf-dwarf galaxy mergers.  The investigators will also create a simulated catalog of dwarf sub-halo pairs using the high-resolution, dark-matter-only, cosmological simulation.  They will compare the observed dwarf galaxy pair counts with expectations of Lambda Cold Dark Matter cosmological models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Galaxies grow by merging with other galaxies.  They begin as small dwarf galaxies and these merge to form larger galaxies.  This process continues to eventually result in large galaxies like our own Milky Way galaxy.   This project examined how the first step of this process proceeds; how the small dwarf galaxies interact and merge.  Because dwarf galaxies are low mass and faint, they can only be studied in detail in the local Universe.  Observational data on the gas distribution of the interacting dwarf galaixes show extended gaseous features and bridges between the dwarf galaxies.  These gaseous features can often be linked to stellar features that reveal their tidal nature.   Simulations that reproduce the observational data of one of the pairs find that the merging will be complete in a few hundred million years, but the gas from this system will continue to fall back and feed star formation for billions of years.  This combination of observational and simulation data provides significant insight into the first stage of galaxy growth in the Universe.\n \nThe broader impacts of the project educated the public through the YouTube channel, \"Space with Sarah\".   These videos have recieved over 120,000 views and answer basic astronomical questions through videos with postdoctoral fellow Sarah Pearson.   This has been extended to Instagram posts that present the research life of an astronomer.  A new TikTok series will be launched in early 2021 that present \"science fun fact\" videos.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/23/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mary E Putman"
