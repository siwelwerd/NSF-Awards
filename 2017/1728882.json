 "awd_abstract_narration": "Governance is frequently defined by a delicate balance between citizens' desires to be provided services by a central government and their demands for autonomy, to be left alone by that same government. Functioning democracies depend on the effective management of this balance. This proves even more challenging in multiethnic nation-states, where cultural, ethnic, or religious difference can come to play central roles in the state's willingness or unwillingness to provide protection and assistance. Such difference can also become the basis for cultural minorities claiming the right to self-determination. In multiethnic democracies, there often results a tension between demands for recognition, the right to be counted, to vote, to be treated as an equal; and demands to exit the polity, to take on the risks and potential rewards that accompany independence. This project investigates whether strategies that invoke cultural rather than territorial claims are effective for obtaining state services and recognition in the context of democratic transition. Project findings will also be presented to organizations involved in development pathways for effective governance, conflict resolution standards, and sustainable transition to democracy.\r\n\r\nDr. Michael McGovern of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor will explore the strategic deployment of culture as a peaceful means of making claims on the central governing apparatus. The research takes place in a context undergoing democratic transition, among the Danu people in southern Shan State, Myanmar, which is selected as a site for investigating this question because it contrasts with claims-making practices of most other ethnic minority groups in Myanmar, defined by territorial claims and a history of armed resistance to the state. Research will take place in three adjacent townships in Shan State, located 1. in a semi-autonomous self-administered zone (SAZ) of the Danu, a hybrid Shan-Burmese population, 2. in an SAZ governed by the Pa-O National Organization, a former separatist group that fought the ethnic Burman-dominated central government (as well as the locally dominant Shan) until 1994, and 3. in an ethnic Shan township that is not part of an SAZ, but that sits between the two SAZs. Village-based participant observation, semi-structured interviews with local elites and representatives of the central state, and life histories with both villagers and local elites will allow the researcher to investigate the ways in which instrumental use of culture and alternation between armed resistance and cultural struggle do or do not lead to different forms of everyday governance, cultural practice, and political sentiment among ordinary civilian villagers and the local elites who speak on their behalf. The research will contribute to understanding the ways both states and minority groups utilize cultural claims, and to understanding the relations among culture-making, territorial claims and violence.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Cultural Recognition and Effective Democratic Transition\n \nMike McGovern\nProfessor of Anthropology\nUniversity of Michigan\n \n\nThis project began in July 2017 and concluded in July 2023.  The research took place in predominantly rural areas of southern Shan State, Myanmar.  The primary research question was how ethnic minorities related to the state during a time of democratic transition. During this period (2017-2019), ethnicity and religion were both mobilized to political ends.  The most dramatic instance of this dynamic was the eliminationist violence that the Myanmar state visited upon ethnic Rohingya on the opposite side of the country from my research area.  But in the new and unfamiliar terrain of democratic multiparty politics that emerged during the post-2011 transition from 50 years of military rule, ethnicity also played an unpredictable role.  The National League for Democracy (NLD), led by Nobel laureate and former political prisoner Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, had broad support across the country, making ethnic political parties both potential authentic voices for the aspirations of minority groups and potential wedges that could split the NLD vote.  The military and its allied Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) thus tried to form alliances with various ethnic parties, but to little effect.  The NLD took 86% of the parliamentary seats in the 2015 election, and 82% in 2020.  The second overwhelming victory for the NLD was intolerable to the military, which carried out a coup d??tat in February 2021.  Since that moment, the country has descended into a low-level civil war between the military and the majority of the civilian population.\n\n            The research area in southern Shan State is a place where several paradoxes were evident at the time of research and may help illuminate some events at the national level then and later.  First, in the main research village, the population was about equally split amongst Danu, Pa-O, and Tai (Shan) people.  Intermarriage was the rule, and ethnicity was so fluid that the children of Tai and Pa-O parents could come to consider themselves ethnically Danu.  What did hold these groups with quite different languages and histories together was a shared deep commitment to Theravada Buddhism.  When discussing the ethnic cleansing of Muslims from Rakhine State and other forms of anti-Muslim policy, the large majority of the researcher?s interlocutors considered this violence well-founded and necessary in order to protect Buddhism from what they perceived as attempts at eradication.  In fact, there were no credible such threats, but this was the justification used continuously by the military, by extremist monks, and by some civilians.  Only a small minority saw a parallel between the brutal violence visited upon the Rohingya in 2017 and the similar or even identical techniques that had long been used to suppress ethnic separatist movements and their civilian homelands in Shan State and neighboring regions such as Kachin, Kayah, Kayin and Chin States.\n\n            Part of the study?s design was to ask what allowed for the founding of the Danu Self-Administered Zone (SAZ), given that the Danu had never taken up arms against the state in their quest for an ethnically defined autonomous region.  Wa, Ta?ang, Pa?O, Kokang, and Naga SAZs had all resulted from stalemated armed conflict, but the explanation usually given to explain the Danu SAZ was the existence of a Danu colonel who pleaded for an SAZ and was made the region?s first chief executive.  Whether or not this explains the zone satisfactorily, it is true that the townships within the Danu SAZ voted for the military aligned USDP party over the NLD in both 2015 and 2020.  In the original study, the PI proposed to spend a significant amount of time in a village in the Danu SAZ and also in a village in one of the two Pa-O SAZs in order to compare the two.  After several months negotiating with the Pa-O National Organization, access that had initially been granted to work in a Pa-O village was denied, and so the comparative aspect of the study was shifted to the background.  With the onset of Covid-19 in 2020, research that was to be conducted that year had to be postponed, and with the coup and civil war that began in 2021, research was no longer safe for any Myanmar citizens who might want to talk with the PI.  Consequently, after three consecutive no-cost extensions, the PI closed out the data-gathering phase of the study and is now analyzing the fieldwork materials.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mike Mcgovern"
