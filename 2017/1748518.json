Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are currently the preferred light sources for many applications in this spectral range, thanks to their compactness, convenient operation and high output power. However, in the THz region the performance of QCLs is still not sufficient for various real-world applications. THz QCLs have much lower performance than MIR QCLs, and the highest operating temperature of THz QCLs is still limited to ~200K. Furthermore, currently no QCL can operate within the 5 THz to 11THz range. In this exploratory project, we plan to develop a new type of compact, high-performance and room-temperature operating THz sources to cover this \"gap\" spectral range. The proposed devices are based on an untested but promising new operation principle, and the successful demonstration of such devices will bring transformative impacts to the research field of THz sources and enable various applications. Therefore, the proposed research is suitable for the NSF EAGER program. This project will allow graduate and undergraduate students to actively participate in cutting-edge research, and acquire the knowledge, skills, experiences and broad perspectives necessary for their future leadership in scientific research and technology development on the competitive global stage. Combining research with education and outreach activities will also be a focus of our work, aiming at benefiting students of all age-groups and backgrounds, including those from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nThe objective of this project is to systematically explore how to realize a new type of THz sources based on a fundamentally different device operation principle. The device operation principle consists of two key processes: (1) generating optical phonons by resonant inter-subband transitions in multiple-quantum-wells (MQWs), and (2) transferring the energy from the generated optical phonons to resonant THz antennae which then emit photons into free space. As the device operation principle is not sensitive to temperature, such THz sources should operate well at room temperature and above. Designs of the MQWs and the THz antennae will be optimized to make both processes efficient, leading to a high overall energy conversion efficiency which is potentially orders of magnitude higher than that of typical THz QCLs. Moreover, such THz sources have a surface-emitting configuration, so the output power scales up with the device area. The proposed research may also allow us to gain new and/or deeper insights into the interesting and complex physics underlying the interplay between inter-subband transitions in MQWs, optical phonons and electromagnetic resonances of photonic structures. Interactions involving all three excitations have not been systematically studied. A better understanding of the underlying physics will guide us to improve the device design, and may inspire us to pursue new possibilities of more advanced devices.",

Wireless communication technologies have also been moving towards the THz frequency range to meet the increasing demand for bandwidth. However, development of technologies and applications based on the THz frequency range has been hindered by the lack of compact, high-performance and cost-effective THz light sources. The overarching goal of this project was to develop a new type of compact THz sources based on an unconventional operating principle, which would allow such THz sources to operate well at the room temperature and above. Specifically, these THz sources are based on converting excited polar optical phonons of semiconductors to THz radiation by establishing a strong coupling (i.e. ultrafast energy transfer) between the optical phonons and an array of THz optical antennas. In order to excite optical phonons in the semiconductors electrically (e.g. by injecting a current), we employed semiconductor multiple quantum well structures which were designed to have an intersubband transition energy matching the semiconductor optical phonon energy. Polar optical phonons in the semiconductors can be excited by the intersubband transitions in the multiple quantum wells with high energy conversion efficiency. The resonant frequency of the THz antennas is designed to match the optical phonon frequency, and the use of a metallic back-plane improves the field confinement in the multiple quantum well structures.

Semiconductor multiple quantum well structures based on the GaAs/AlGaAs material system are grown using molecular beam epitaxy by a collaborator. We then developed a reliable fabrication process, and produced several batches of devices employing multiple THz antenna designs and systematically characterized these devices.

The reflection spectrum of one of the fabricated devices is shown in Fig. 3, in which we clearly observed the hybridized modes due to the strong coupling between the THz antennas and the GaAs optical phonons. Subsequently, we measured the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the fabricated devices. The I-V characteristics of most of the devices exhibited typical features of electron transport in multiple quantum well structures. However, we also observed that the current density at the designed operating bias voltages was significantly lower than the expected value, which limited the optical phonon generation and hence THz radiation. The underlying causes is not yet clear and we are continuing the investigation on this. Finally, we systematically measured the emission spectra of these devices under different operating conditions. The emission spectra of a device are shown in Fig. 4. THz emission in the target frequency range clearly shows the features associated with the strong coupling between the THz antennas and the GaAs optical phonons. THz emission is observed also at room temperature, which is only moderately lower than that at cryogenic temperatures. We estimate that the THz emission power is on the order of nW. Although the THz emission power is not as high as expected, our proof-of-concept demonstration points to an encouraging path towards high-performance room-temperature THz sources.
