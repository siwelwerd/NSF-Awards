 "awd_abstract_narration": "New advances in additive manufacturing have enabled rapid and inexpensive fabrication of complex designs containing multiple classes of materials, such as metals, ceramics, and polymers, all within a single print job. This capability allows manufacturers to produce heterogeneous, multi-component designs that do not require assembly, thereby eliminating the cost and design constraints imposed by the assembly process. It also can allow designers to produce higher-performing and/or lighter-weight components than is possible through traditional means. However, our capacity to manufacture such designs currently exceeds our capability to optimize them. This research project will investigate novel algorithms for generating optimal structural geometries and material layouts for multifunctional, heterogeneous systems.  These algorithms will consider the behavior of the different types of materials used in a design and the interactions among the materials. In this way, we will enable system-level optimization of multicomponent designs that will exhibit cost and performance properties far exceeding components created using traditional approaches. This novel design approach has the potential for impacts across multiple research communities and industries, with applications ranging from biomedical devices to consumer electronics.\r\n\r\nThrough this research, we will introduce a new design formulation for handling multifunctional design problems containing several classes of material. This objective will be achieved through the development of novel topology optimization-based algorithms that will combine nonlinear finite element analysis with an original parametric design representation scheme, created specifically for heterogeneous problems. The numerical optimization problem will be solved using gradient-based methods in which function gradients will guide the optimization search of the design space.  These gradients will be computed using adjoint sensitivity analysis, and will take into account the various sources of nonlinearity being investigated, including hyperelasticity, plasticity, and material damage.  The resulting design algorithms will be validated using high-fidelity computational modeling of the optimized designs, along with analysis of analogous commercially-available designs, to quantify the performance gains generated by each algorithm.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe aim of this project was to create novel computer algorithms for automated design of high-performance structures and mechanisms.  In order to leverage next-generation 3D-printing technology, these specialized algorithms seek out designs that combine multiple materials, each with its own unique material properties.  By strategically combining these materials within a precise spatial arrangement, the algorithm can produce designs with precisely tailored, and often counterintuitive, behaviors.\n\nThe early stages of our investigation focused on design of 3D-printed structures with optimal structural and thermal response.  For this task, we considered both polymers and metals.  A natural application for this work would be the design of casings for handheld electronic equipment.  Because batteries and other electronic components can generate large amounts of heat, casings should be able to provide both thermal and mechanical protection.  To prevent temperature-sensitive components from overheating, it may be necessary to efficiently dissipate excess heat while also protecting against impacts due to falls.  In other scenarios, the casing may be used to provide insulation and prevent users from burns caused by contact with hot surfaces.  With this in mind, we created an algorithm that generated multi-material structures that simultaneously exhibit optimal structural stiffness and optimal thermal insulation.  The algorithm was also able to automatically select up to three different materials to include in the design, with the material selections being chosen from a suite of available design materials.  This particular functionality was chosen to exploit existing capabilities in multi-material 3D printing, since several commercially available 3D printers allow users to combine up to 3 distinct polymer materials within a single part.  Subsequently we devised an original mathematical formulation that enabled the algorithm to simulate the temperature field within the structure and automatically modify the design to ensure that each material region remained within its allowable temperature limit.\n\nIn the latter half of the project, we focused on design of mechanisms containing active materials.  Because of their unique molecular structure, active materials can undergo large shape changes in response to changes in their environment.  This means that by heating the material we can induce large motions without having push or pull on the material.  We created a series of algorithms designed to harness this capability to create programmable self-morphing mechanisms.  By combining multiple active materials within the volumes of the mechanism, we were able to encode the instructions for large complex motions into the mechanism?s material distribution.  The algorithms we created were used to simulate the thermomechanical response of various design candidates, and use this simulation data to find the precise material distribution that would yield the desired motion.\n\nWe investigated the use of two classes of active materials, the first of which was shape-memory polymers.  Using the above design strategy, we created an algorithm that could generate a 3D printed self-tying knot mechanism.  The mechanism emerged from the 3D printer as a long rod, and when placed in a heated water bath, the rod would spontaneously contort itself into a pretzel configuration, with the motion having been programmed into the rod?s material layout.\n\nWe also explored the use of shape-memory alloys, which are a class of metal-based active materials.  These materials are more costly to work with, but they offer a faster response time and higher actuation force.  Our design algorithms were able to produce a series of shape-memory alloy mechanisms, including a force inverter and a gripper mechanism.  Designs like these could be used for a variety of applications including for robotic arms.  This design approach offers several advantages over traditional motor-driven mechanisms. Its simplicity allows for the creation of smaller and lighter mechanisms, which could enable microrobotic technologies for things like smart drug delivery systems.  The need for fewer components can also contribute to increased robustness and fewer failure modes.\n\nThe PI also created an original senior-level undergraduate course titled ?Structural Design Optimization?.  The course has now been offered twice to both graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Illinois.  It covers methods developed during the project, including design optimization of multimaterial structures, and design for additive manufacturing.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/22/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kai James"
