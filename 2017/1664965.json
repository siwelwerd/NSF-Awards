 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many of the principal drivers of atmospheric chemistry are short-lived reactive small molecules known as \"radicals,\" the characterization of which is challenging because it is difficult to prepare them in a laboratory in sufficient quantities to study them. In this project funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Caroline Chick Jarrold uses a unique approach to preparing radicals by (1) stabilizing them with a negative charge, then (2) gleaning detailed information about the neutral radicals by using lasers to selectively detach the electrons in a way that the energy of the electrons precisely reflects the properties of the radicals. The specific molecules of interest are involved in production of ozone in the part of the atmosphere with negative impact on human health. Outreach is being done, in part, through her institution's STEM Summer Scholars Institute.\r\n\r\nThis project combines low-temperature preparation of radical species and their anionic precursors with anion photoelectron imaging (PEI) spectroscopy. This combination of tools is being applied to OH-isoprene adducts, and species formed by ozonolysis of isoprene, which may include Criegee intermediates (carbonyl oxides believed to be formed during ozonolysis), along with non-covalent complexes the intermediates form with H2O and O2. The oxidation of isoprene (2-methyl-1,3-butadiene) by OH and O3 leads to the formation of a wide range of reactive open-shell molecules, the kinetics of which has been a very active area of research. The spectroscopic data from the proposed studies complements kinetics studies with more detailed electronic and molecular structural information. Additionally, the effects of water, which influences isomerization and reaction barrier heights, and O2, which can both photosensitize and react with the transients, are being probed. Spectroscopic analysis is supported collaboratively by quantum wavepacket ab initio molecular dynamics studies. The broader impacts of this project include an increase in current understanding of the complex, interconnected web of atmospheric processes, in addition to highly technical training for a postdoctoral research associate, graduate students, and undergraduates in the context of an area of global importance.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe atmosphere, which appears invisible except on hazy or smoggy days, undergoes a complex web of chemical reactions that affect health and the climate.  Many of the principal participants of atmospheric chemical and physical processes are known as radicals, which are chemically unstable.  In addition, molecules that are usually unreactive can change chemically while undergoing collisions with other gas molecules, which happens 1027 to 1028 times per second in the volume of a sugar cube, though each collision is fleeting. However, even considering how brief collisions are, at any given moment, there will be over 1015 molecules that are in contact with another molecule, again, in the size of a sugar cube.\n\nWhile these radicals and molecules undergoing collision are drivers in atmospheric processes, they are difficult to study experimentally because they are, by nature, short lived and unstable.  This grant was used to develop new strategies for studying these short-lived species, and to expand our understanding of how they participate in the chemistry of the atmosphere.  We used a tool known as anion photoelectron spectroscopy, which allows us to study short-lived molecules or complexes by starting with a longer-lived negative ion of the species.  Indeed, the intellectual merit of the proposed project lies in the ability to study transient but important neutral reactive molecules or complexes that can be advantageously characterized using anions.  Using the method of photoelectron spectroscopy, we learn properties about the neutral that help us to predict how they react with other molecules, and how they might additionally be involved in absorbing solar radiation (energy), which contributes to the greenhouse effect, but can also make the molecules even more reactive. In a very direct way, the method maps out what are called the ?energy levels? of the molecules, which govern how they absorb radiation and how they react with other molecules.\n\nWe deployed these experimental methods, and relied on theory, to elucidate the properties of a range of complexes and reactive molecules. For example, we studied oxygen, which makes up approximately 20% of the atmosphere, and on which we rely on for life, as it undergoes collisions with a number of different molecules that can be found in the atmosphere, either as pollutants (for example, ethanol and hexanes, which evaporate from gasoline), or emitted by plants (isoprene, which is what we smell when we cut grass).  What we found is that the energy levels in oxygen change with different collision partners, which affects oxygen?s ability to absorb solar radiation, and, consequently, the reactivity of oxygen.  In another study, we measured the close-lying energy levels of a class of reactive species known as alkenoxy radicals.  Without knowing these energies, their reactivity cannot be accurately predicted.  In a third study, we looked at two molecules undergoing an actual reaction, again, by starting with a long-lived stable ion of the reactive complex.  The hydroxy radical, which is a very important reactant molecule in the atmosphere, reacts with isoprene, which then undergoes a sequence of reactions that ultimately produce ozone. Ozone is needed in the upper atmosphere to help block UV light from the sun. However, it is harmful and therefore very undesirable in the air we breathe.  Learning more about the ways the hydroxy radical interacts with isoprene is therefore of enduring interest.  In our studies, we were able to observe evidence of the hydroxy radical pulling of a hydrogen atom from an isoprene molecule.\n\nAt the core of these studies is the excess electron that allows us to stabilize the reactive species (hydroxy radicals, alkenoxy radicals, collision complexes).  An exciting aspect of adding and removing an electron is learning how the electron interacts with the neutrals when they are in close proximity.  A large scientific effort has been dedicated to studying electron-driven chemistry, and our studies connect with that important area of science directly.  As an example, we studied how substituting different atoms on a benzene ring changes how that benzene will interact with the electron, which affects how reactive it will be under certain conditions.  We also studied what happens when two molecules are competing for the electron, creating a new understanding of complex anions, which are central in the study of electron-driven chemistry.  These studies and the studies noted in the previous paragraph have all been reported in the literature or are under consideration for publication.  \n\nThe broader impact of this project is the addition of new information that can be leveraged to improve models that predict important atmospheric phenomena, such as ozone action days.  In addition, this project has provided invaluable hands-on scientific training for graduate students in Chemistry, as well as a postdoctoral research associate. Companies such as Intel and Pfizer have benefited from this project?s cultivation of a diverse group of excellent young scientists.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Caroline C Jarrold"
