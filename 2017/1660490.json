 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will develop a suite of water-stress indicators at several scales to assess the health of riparian ecosystems in response to sustained groundwater decline.  This project will address a topic of scientific and societal importance, namely how to evaluate and help prevent negative impacts of drought and human-induced water shortages on vulnerable, high-value riparian ecosystems.  It will integrate advanced methods in two rapidly emerging fields, hyperspectral remote sensing and isotope dendroecology, to develop a more holistic understanding of water stress at multiple scales of resolution.  The project will compare water stress indicators that vary in their timing, strength, and rates of change, and it will facilitate the evaluation of warning signs and time lags among physiological water stress, reduced growth, and dieback in individual trees as well as synoptic forest decline evident throughout a river corridor.  This project has the potential to influence groundwater management practices throughout California and in water-limited, multiple-use basins elsewhere.  In partnership with The Nature Conservancy and other project collaborators, the investigators will integrate project findings with statewide guidelines for protecting groundwater-dependent riparian ecosystems mandated under California's recently implemented Groundwater Sustainability Management Act.  The investigators will interact with groundwater conservation and management efforts in river basins through workshops for managers and stakeholders.  They will mentor early-career environmental scientists, including women in STEM fields, and they will conduct outreach activities for elementary and secondary school students to increase regional environmental awareness in the study region.\r\n\r\nRiparian forests and woodlands are hotspots of biodiversity, and they support key functions and habitats within river corridors, but they are particularly sensitive to large changes in water supply.  This project will take place in the Santa Clara River in southern California, where sustained groundwater pumping for irrigation during a severe drought has had negative impacts and allows for study of riparian woodland response to changing environmental conditions over both short and longer terms. The investigators will assess the signals and thresholds of water stress over the last decade using high-resolution aerial imagery and tree-rings to develop predictors of long-term impairment and collapse.  They will capitalize on extensive groundwater well records to link water-table dynamics with changes in plant water status detected at two different scales through the use of basin-wide, high-resolution aerial imagery taken seasonally during the drought and annual growth and carbon isotope data from tree rings covering the same period.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Background/Question/Methods\nThough riparian woodlands are thought to be buffered against water stress by their landscape position and favorable hydrology, climate change and groundwater extraction increasingly threaten their long-term sustainability, particularly in drylands globally. The overall goal of this project was to develop a suite of water stress indicators at several scales to assess the health of riparian ecosystems in response to sustained groundwater decline and climate variability. The study was centered primarily in the Santa Clara River basin (Southern California, USA), with complementary studies from the greater region and state. During the severe drought of 2012-2019, groundwater declined due to reduced precipitation and recharge, as well as increased agricultural irrigation; as a result, riparian woodlands suffered high mortality and dieback. We studied riparian woodland response to this event at different spatial and temporal scales, using complementary methods in remote sensing and field tree-ring research to (1) assess the effects water stress on riparian woodlands, and (2) develop water stress indicators across a range of geographic scales. We coupled tree-ring studies from riparian stands along the Santa Clara River with a basin-scale remote sensing investigation and a state-wide satellite imagery analysis to compare the timing and severity among indicators, and as well as to assess ecosystem resilience. The ultimate goal of the project was to identify trends and thresholds in forest response to groundwater decline that can be used to develop sustainable groundwater management approaches for protecting groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) in multiple-use river basins.\nMain Results\nTree-ring analyses of riparian cottonwoods at seven sites along the river revealed strong reductions in tree radial growth and transpiration via leaf pores (through decreased carbon isotope discrimination) during the driest years, indicating severe drought stress which was determined more by the rate of groundwater decline than by climate drivers.

Reductions in leaf gas exchange, growth and canopy green vegetation follow groundwater level decline more than climate indicators. There are numerous practical implications of this research, which are relevant to water managers in California and elsewhere.

Groundwater depth is a master driver for many aspects of riparian woodland health.
