 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bats are capable of swift, autonomous navigation through complex, natural environments - a feat that cannot be replicated by engineers at present. The central hypothesis behind this research is that system-level synergies between sensing, mobility, and control functions are critical factors behind achieving these unmatched capabilities of bats. To understand how these system-level synergies arise in nature, participating students will be advised by faculty teams spanning six departments to conduct interdisciplinary research projects centered on one of the following topics: acoustical scene statistics of natural bat habitats, dynamic biosonar sensing, maneuvering flight, neural control, physiological basis of sound emission and reception. All student projects will be based in the Shandong University - Virginia Tech International Laboratory in China.\r\n\r\nThe educational outcomes of the project will be undergraduate and graduate students with interdisciplinary skills between biology and engineering that will allow them to interpret biological functions from an engineering perspective and within their respective biological contexts. Furthermore, the IRES trainees will acquire intercultural competencies to work effectively in international teams. The project's scientific outcomes will enable engineers to design better integrated autonomous systems, e.g., self-navigating drones, that will have bat-like capabilities to deal with natural, unconstrained environments, such dense vegetation.",

Since these bat species occur only in the Old World, the bat observations were carried out in China.\n\nThe biosonar and flight behavior of the animals has been observed in the field as well as in the laboratory. Bats from the studied species\nemit ultrasonic signals through their nostrils that are surrounded by little \"megaphones\" called \"noseleaves\" and receive the returning\nechoes through their ears. The shapes of the noseleaves and outer ears in these bats are not static, but can be deformed very quickly by an\nintricate musculature. Hence, the outgoing biosonar pulses are diffracted by megaphones that change shape during emission and the\nreturning echoes are likewise received by ears that are deforming in the process. Using arrays of synchronized high-speed cameras and\nultrasonic microphone, the research has demonstrated - for the first time - that the shape deformations on the emission and reception side\nof the bats biosonar are carefully coordinated. This coordination has since given rise to studies with biomimetic robots and deep-learning\ndata analysis that have since confirmed an effect on the encoding of sensory information.\n\nFor the study of bat flight, a synchronized high-speed camera array was mounted on the walls of a flight tunnel to create video footage\nthat allowed for capturing the 3d geometry of flying bats. The data obtained from the tunnel was used as the basis for the first ever\ninvestigation of the aerodynamics of bat flight that was based on a detailed computational model. The results of this computational\nanalysis have been shown to capture the known aerodynamics of straight flight in bats accurately and hence offer the opportunity to predict\nthe far less well understood aerodynamics of maneuvering flight in bats more accurately using computational methods. The experience with the\nflight tunnel experiments in this program has been used to design a next-generation high-speed video camera array that can capture\nmaneuvering flights of bats and other animals without occlusion and produce high-quality image data from which even complex motions can be\nreconstructed.\n\nFinally, the project has studied the swarming behavior of bats in the field in the field using mobile ultrasonic recorders and small arrays\nof infra-red sensitive video cameras. The data from these recordings have been used to investigate how the acoustic level of overall\nemission of bats flying in a swarm varies with the number of bats in the swarm. It was found that in the studied swarms the acoustic levels\nincreased beyond what would have been expected from an increasing swarm size, i.e., bats tended to produce higher acoustic output the\nlarger the swarm they were flying in. Looking at individual bats in flying small swarms, the data collected has been used for an\ninformation-theoretic analysis of the relationships between the bat's flight trajectories to determine if information is transferred between\nthe bats. This was found to be the case.\n\nA total of 15 US students have participated in the program over the period of 3 years and spent 12 weeks each in China to conduct the\nresearch. In-depth interviews with these students have shown that the students have greatly benefited from the international dimension of\nthe program. While the language barrier, cultural difference, as well as logistical hurdles did pose a challenges to the students, all\nparticipants did show an improvement in their intercultural competencies and hence in their ability to be successful in\ninternational research environments.</pre><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/02/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rolf&nbsp;Mueller</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1658620/1658620_10470507_1641178392166_ires_taishanjump--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1658620/1658620_10470507_1641178392166_ires_taishanjump--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mount Tai\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1658620/1658620_10470507_1641178392166_ires_taishanjump--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mount Tai\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Student excursion to the top of Mount Tai, the holiest mountain of Taoism.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Matthew Bender</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rolf&nbsp;Mueller</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mount Tai</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1658620/1658620_10470507_1641178483125_ires_biosonardynamics--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1658620/1658620_10470507_1641178483125_ires_biosonardynamics--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bat biosonar dynamics setup\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1658620/1658620_10470507_1641178483125_ires_biosonardynamics--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bat biosonar dynamics setup\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Calibrating a setup consisting of high-speed video cameras and ultrasonic microphones for observing the dynamics in the periphery of the bats' biosonar.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rolf Mueller</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rolf&nbsp;Mueller</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bat biosonar dynamics setup</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1658620/1658620_10470507_1641178566067_ires_batflight--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1658620/1658620_10470507_1641178566067_ires_batflight--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Observations of bat flight\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1658620/1658620_10470507_1641178566067_ires_batflight--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Observations of bat flight\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Recording of bat flight kinematics in an instrumented flight tunnel.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rolf Mueller</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rolf&nbsp;Mueller</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Observations of bat flight</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1658620/1658620_10470507_1641178682238_ires_batswarming--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1658620/1658620_10470507_1641178682238_ires_batswarming--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bat swarming setup\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1658620/1658620_10470507_1641178682238_ires_batswarming--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bat swarming setup\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Field setup for studying bat swarms with infra-red sensitive cameras and an ultrasound recorder.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rolf Mueller</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rolf&nbsp;Mueller</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bat swarming setup</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
