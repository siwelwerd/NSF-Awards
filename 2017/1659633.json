 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. As such, it has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. A growing number of scientists are suggesting that recent human alterations to the earth's biosphere have moved us into a new geologic epoch, the Anthropocene, in which human activity is a major driver of environmental and ecosystem structure and function. Although recent environmental alterations dominate the discussion of the Anthropocene, people have used and modified the earth's ecosystems for millennia. The scientific and human challenges created by the Anthropocene will require researchers and citizens with STEM skills necessary to apply interdisciplinary scientific knowledge. Integrating archaeological and ecological data may provide new insights into the social context, timing, and regional variation of the Anthropocene. The goal of this REU site is to promote scientific skills and interdisciplinarity among first generation college students to prepare them to be thinkers ready to approach environmental challenges of the Anthropocene. Students will engage in an 8-week, archaeological and ecological interdisciplinary research project investigating deep-time evidence of the Anthropocene in the Upper Mississippi River System (UMRS). Working with scholars from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, University of Illinois- Illinois Natural History Survey, and Western Illinois University, students will gain practical experience in field investigations, laboratory research, and data analysis contributing to a research program using interdisciplinary approaches to understand the context of the Anthropocene in the UMRS.\r\n\r\nStudents of this REU site will research and contribute to an emerging body of literature that investigates the longevity of human interactions to river systems using ongoing long-term fish monitoring data and data documented in the fish remains from archaeological sites spanning millennia. Few studies have taken such a deep-time perspective within a regional ecosystem occupied by a range of sociocultural traditions. The research conducted by students of this REU site will use these data to examine evidence of the Anthropocene in the UMRS at new temporal and regional scales. By combining archaeological and ecological research tools, students enrolled in this REU program will gain interdisciplinary STEM and critical thinking skills needed by scientists and citizens to derive innovative solutions to confront challenges of the Anthropocene. This REU site will run for 8 weeks during the summer semester and students will be housed at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, Edwardsville, IL.",

Our REU site developed these skills among first generation college students (students with neither parent holding a bachelor's degree). We engaged students in immersive research experiences and co-curricular activities designed to promote their success as college students, future job seekers, and graduate school applicants. Our students conducted authentic scientific research and presented their results in at scientific conferences, thereby becoming active members of the scientific community.</p>\n<p>Each year of the project consisted of an 8-week interdisciplinary research experience for 10 undergraduate students during the summers of 2017, 2018, and 2019. The majority of our students (22 of 30) were first generation college students including many students who identified with groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences (e.g., women, students in underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, students who identify as LGBTQ+, and students with disabilities).</p>\n<p>We used an immersive approach for this research experience, with every student from each cohort participating in all steps of the scientific process from hypothesis formation, research design, data collection (both field and laboratory), data analysis, research writing, scholarly presentation, and dissemination. All students, regardless of their major, were trained in both archaeology and ecology and contributed to an interdisciplinary research poster as the final product for their REU. For their final research product, &nbsp;an archaeology student and an ecology student teamed up to develop a hypothesis, conducted various analyses, and developed interpretations that incorporated both archaeological and ecological data, methods, and theory. Each pair presented their posters in a public symposium on the Southern Illinois University of Edwardsville campus. Additionally, each cohort presented their research at a professional scientific meeting, the Mississippi River Research Consortium (MRRC). The 2017 and 2018 students presented in-person, while the 2019 cohort presented virtually at the 2021 MRRC after the 2020 MRRC was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We had six specific objectives for the students in each cohort: 1) improve their ability to critically understand STEM issues; 2) improve their understanding for STEM skills; 3) increase their scientific literacy; 4) increase their content knowledge in ecology and archaeology; 5) improve their ability to communicate scientific findings; and 6) have students engage in a &nbsp;high quality, immersive research and learning experience.</p>\n<p>We assessed the improvement in our student&rsquo;s critical thinking using the STEM critical thinking rubric. Across all years, students demonstrated significant gains in critical STEM thinking in several domains assessed. Using a pre- and post-survey of students&rsquo; perceived abilities with STEM skills, archaeology skills, and ecology skills, students reported significant gains in nearly every skill identified each year of the program. The PI and co-PI developed a content test instrument to test students&rsquo; understanding of scientific literacy and the students had strong gains each year of the program. Students were given a pre and post content-specific test regarding subject matter and methodological skills they learned and practiced during their REU experience. In years 1 and 2, students demonstrated significant gains in these measures. In the third year, ecological students demonstrated significant gains on the ecological content. Archaeological students did show gains in archaeological content, although there was substantial variation among students.</p>\n<p>Attendees of the final REU symposium were asked to evaluate each team&rsquo;s poster following an established rubric. The rubric consisted of 10 questions in three groupings: Organization, Delivery, and Substance. On average, student groups received 89% for year 1, 91% for year 2, and 91% for year 3, based on the points available through the judging process. Considering that the majority of our students had no previous experience giving poster presentations, these scores are impressive.</p>\n<p>Each year of the program, overall student satisfaction was high. Nearly every student who participated in the REU agreed that they would recommend the experience to other undergraduate students. These findings demonstrate that the students believed the REU met their expectations, positively contributed to their college experience, and was a high-quality research experience. Students indicated high overall satisfaction with the REU experience from the beginning&nbsp; through the end of our 8-week program. Additional comments to open-ended questions both on weekly surveys and on the final program assessment demonstrate that, every year, students had a rewarding learning experience in a safe, inclusive, and comfortable research environment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/26/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Carol&nbsp;E&nbsp;Colaninno</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659633/1659633_10474936_1653596937237_SOE-archaeology2019--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659633/1659633_10474936_1653596937237_SOE-archaeology2019--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Archaeology\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659633/1659633_10474936_1653596937237_SOE-archaeology2019--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Archaeology\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU students learn archaeological practical skills</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Howard Ash</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carol&nbsp;E&nbsp;Colaninno</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Archaeology</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659633/1659633_10474936_1653596678223_REU-fish-measuring2018--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659633/1659633_10474936_1653596678223_REU-fish-measuring2018--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Measuring Fishes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659633/1659633_10474936_1653596678223_REU-fish-measuring2018--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Measuring Fishes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU students measuring the total length of fishes sampled from the Mississippi River.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Howard Ash</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carol&nbsp;E&nbsp;Colaninno</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Measuring Fishes</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659633/1659633_10474936_1653596760144_REU-lab2018--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659633/1659633_10474936_1653596760144_REU-lab2018--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Zooarchaeology\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659633/1659633_10474936_1653596760144_REU-lab2018--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Zooarchaeology\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students identifying fish remains from archaeological sites along the Mississippi River</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Howard Ash</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carol&nbsp;E&nbsp;Colaninno</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Zooarchaeology</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659633/1659633_10474936_1653596856795_REU-Symposium2017--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659633/1659633_10474936_1653596856795_REU-Symposium2017--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Presenting research\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659633/1659633_10474936_1653596856795_REU-Symposium2017--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Presenting research\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU participants presents their research at the final symposium</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Howard Ash</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carol&nbsp;E&nbsp;Colaninno</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Presenting research</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659633/1659633_10474936_1653596616064_REU-electrofishing2018--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659633/1659633_10474936_1653596616064_REU-electrofishing2018--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fish Sampling\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1659633/1659633_10474936_1653596616064_REU-electrofishing2018--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fish Sampling\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU participants sampling fishes in the Mississippi River</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Howard Ash</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carol&nbsp;E&nbsp;Colaninno</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fish Sampling</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
