 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: For over 25,000 years, human-kind has been using a manufacturing process known as sintering that uses both high temperatures and long processing times. It is believed that we are no longer confined to these high energy, inefficient traditional strategies. Through the use of the transient liquid phase, it has been found that ceramic materials can be sintered at unprecedented low temperatures. Through accelerated stimulus with ultrasound, it is hypothesized that even lower temperatures in greater efficiencies in the sintering process can be gained for a broad variety of inorganic materials, including the possible use in refractory materials, such as bricks. With such energy reductions in the process, it is anticipated that future techniques would be more efficient and lower cost.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: The kinetics of sintering in terms of densification and grain growth are considered and quantified in simple binary materials under cold (at or under 300\u00b0C) sintering conditions. Detailed structural studies are being correlated with the various stages of sintering. Densification kinetics are being determined with a dilatometer in a modified mechanical tester. Transmission electron microscopy and impedance spectroscopy are being used to consider defect microstructure, stoichiometry, and defect chemistry monitoring differences in the cold sintering relative to process parameters. This base line data on model binary oxide systems provides critical insights into the nature of the cold sintering mechanisms. A complementary effort builds on those investigations and addresses the question on if and how ultrasonic radiation can be utilized to enhance the kinetics of cold sintering. There is literature pointing to ultrasonic radiation and sonochemistry that can improve particle compaction, dissolution, and precipitation, naturally leading to the conjecture that many mechanisms and stages of the cold sintering will be positively impacted.",

Sintering is a materials fabrication process that mankind has used for over 28,000 years from the late Paleolithic period. Ceramic figurines artefacts have been found and determined to have been fired from powders of clay mixed with water in earthen trench kilns. From ancient potters into the modern age of advanced ceramics the sintering process has used high temperature to drive the powders into a densified microstructure, eliminating porosity, and improving strength, and other properties. Advanced ceramics are important materials that enable components across all areas of modern society in computation, communication, transport, energy storage and management, manufacturing, healthcare, and military hardware.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Typically, ceramics are sintering at 50% to 90% of the melting temperatures, ceramics having high melting points, and the sintering temperatures are around 1000 <sup>o</sup>C and higher. These high temperatures are required in conventional sintering to drive the diffusion processes of atomic species at the particle contact points. In contrast the Cold sintering process enables densification at temperatures less than 350 <sup>o</sup>C, and this is enabled with the chemo-mechanical process that involves intermediate applied pressures, low temperatures and all-important chemical transient phase that permits low temperature dissolution, transport, and precipitation. As illustrated in Figure 1 a) we see the process that is occurring under the cold sintering process, the first begins with the dissolution of the atomic constituents with the transient phase between the particle contacts. This creates a concentration gradient that permits diffusion of the species along the interface, there can then be a precipitation on the surface in the pore region between the particles. These processes work in harmony and as the process progresses the powder densifies, change shape and grains can grow consistent with the conventionally known sintering process. However, now sintering is happening at temperatures an order of magnitude below the conventional temperatures for each respective material. Figure 1 b) shows an example of the microstructure of cold sintered ceramic, Na-Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>&nbsp; at 150 <sup>o</sup>C, and conventionally sinters at about 1700 <sup>o</sup>C, the activating chemical phase was acetic acid.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ZnO was one of the model materials studied under this program, and using different temperature heating rates and isothermal temperature holds with different times and monitoring the densification and grain sizes revealed important details on the activation energies that controlled the sintering process. These activation energies for densification and grain growth gives insights into the why the temperatures can be so low, and what controls the process. The various sintering parameters have been considered with respect to temperature, chemistry, applied pressure and time to control the densification and microstructure under the cold sintering process. From those studies the fundamental mechanisms control the sintering could be understood with respect to the dissolution, transport, and precipitation. The basic science that this project developed has now led to several groups around the world following the concepts of cold sintering and explaining the field and understanding.
