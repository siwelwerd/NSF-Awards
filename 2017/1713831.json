 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the abundance, distribution, and functional capabilities of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing (anammox) bacteria in a geothermal hot spring ecosystem located on the North Island of New Zealand. Anammox bacteria play an important role in removing reactive nitrogen (i.e., nitrogen species that directly or indirectly support growth) from both natural and engineered ecosystems, but their role in removing reactive nitrogen from geothermal hot spring ecosystems is not well understood. Increased knowledge of anammox bacteria is particularly valuable today, because most of the world's industrialized nations are struggling to manage elevated concentrations of reactive nitrogen in their fresh and marine water bodies. The insights into the distribution and diversity of anammox bacteria gained as a result of this project will help scientists and engineers develop and apply more robust and sustainable reactive nitrogen removal processes. This project will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Wei-Qin Zhuang, a noted expert in environmental microbiology and biotechnology, at the University of Auckland in New Zealand.  \r\n\r\nGeothermal hot spring ecosystem samples will be collected from the One Thousand Springs database, which has catalogued the 16S rRNA microbial diversity and associated geochemical conditions of over 1,000 geothermal hot spring ecosystem samples collected from the Taupo Volcanic Zone on New Zealand's North Island. This database will be mined to identify samples that indicate the existence of anammox bacteria. Further analyses will be performed on these samples to elucidate the abundance and functional capabilities of anammox bacteria within these samples. Abundance will be determined through quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses, and functional capabilities will be determined through metagenomic analyses. Subsequently, these same analyses will be performed on samples extracted from geothermal hot spring enrichment bioreactors operated by the Zhuang Laboratory, in order to understand the impacts of the translation of extremophilic anammox bacteria from a natural ecosystem to an engineered bioreactor.\r\n\r\nThis award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhen too much nitrogen makes its way into fresh and marine water bodies, it can stimulate algal growth and subsequently destroy the water body?s health.  Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is an innovative, biological treatment process that removes reactive nitrogen from wastewater effluent streams before it can wreak havoc on receiving water bodies. At full-scale, anammox is a very promising technology.  It consumes 60% less energy and produces 90% less waste than the standard reactive nitrogen removal processes.  However, the bacteria responsible for anammox are easily inhibited by varying environmental conditions, and it can take weeks for the process?s performance to be restored following an inhibition event.  Before anammox can be broadly applied to nitrogen-rich wastewater effluent streams, a comprehensive understanding of the environmental conditions that support anammox bacteria must be developed. \n\n \n\nIn this EAPSI-funded research project, state-of-the-art genomic tools were used to investigate the abundance and distribution of anammox bacteria within New Zealand?s natural aquatic environments.  In order to identify the environmental conditions that support the proliferation of anammox bacteria, abundance and distribution results were then correlated to ambient environmental conditions.  After investigating over 250 sample sets from all regions of the country, initial results revealed that anammox bacteria are present in a small fraction of New Zealand?s streambed environments.  The samples that contained anammox bacteria were from areas with elevated nitrogen levels and tended to be near urban areas, where nitrogen pollution is more common.  These correlations will be further investigated and validated in laboratory reactors.\n\n \n\nThis work was conducted in collaboration with Dr. Wei-Qin Zhuang and Dr. Gavin Lear at the University of Auckland, New Zealand.  With their support, initial results of this work were disseminated to several academic and government research communities across the country.  Within the next few months, a manuscript of the results will be sent to the Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand (the country?s leading scientific journal) to be considered for publication.  As New Zealand (and most nations around the world) is struggling to manage elevated concentrations of reactive nitrogen in its fresh and marine water bodies, this publication will be very important to the scientists and engineers who are attempting to control the fate of reactive nitrogen in both natural environments and the anammox process.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/14/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jennifer E Lawrence"
