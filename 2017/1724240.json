 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tourette syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by sudden movements and vocalizations known as tics.  The disorder can be highly debilitating with severe clinical and social effects.  The overall goal of this work is to combine experimental and computational approaches to better understand the mechanisms leading to tic production.  In past work, tic production has been linked to abnormal activity in a variety of brain regions, many of which are in an area called the basal ganglia.  Experiments in animals have shown that blocking certain forms of signaling between neurons in the basal ganglia induces tics.  This project will use innovative methods to collect data from neurons in the basal ganglia in these tic-producing animal models, which will be used in several ways.  Data analysis will identify changes in neural activity that are linked with tic production, providing a detailed view of the neuronal interactions involved. The data will also guide the development of two novel computational model networks, one focused and one large-scale.  These models will be used to explore how changes in signaling between neurons within the basal ganglia, as well as between the basal ganglia and major motor command centers in the cortex, can lead to tic production.  Results of these computational studies will yield predictions for subsequent experimental testing.  \r\n\r\nFor an action to be performed, it must be selected from among the myriad of possible movements that could be made.  How this action selection is accomplished is currently not well understood.  This project will enhance our understanding of how changes in neuronal activity and signaling lead to tic production, as well as to the selection of actions in general. The results about tic production will have clinical implications for Tourette syndrome by suggesting targets for interventions and providing a framework for testing the impact of potential treatments. Currently, such a framework in the area of Tourette syndrome is lacking, and related computational studies have been quite limited. The models developed will also advance the field by serving as resources for the study of additional questions relating to neuronal activity and to signaling between neurons in movement-related brain areas.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCompanion projects are being funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany (BMBF), and the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF).",

While the expression of tics was linked to the basal ganglia and specifically to abnormalities in their input nucleus, the striatum, the underlying mechanism of the disorder is still obscure.  The goal of this research project was to study tic expression on multiple computational levels. The project followed two key complementary aims of characterizing the role of intra-striatal local networks and of inter-nuclei global network in tic formation and propagation. The project integrated computational/theoretical (Rubin and Hamker labs) and experimental (Bar-Gad lab) approaches to create a comprehensive study of these aims.\n\nThe local striatal networks targeted by the Rubin and Bar-Gad labs were studied by testing the contribution of cholinergic (or tonically active) neurons, called TANs, and fast spiking interneurons, or FSIs, in the striatum to tic generation and the modulation of the striatal network by dopaminergic input.   Previous results from the Bar-Gad lab revealed a stereotypical activity pattern in striatal neurons associated with tic generation in a rodent model.  A novel computational model of TANs was developed as a source of new insights and predictions about the source of this activity.  The model was calibrated to capture a wide range of experimental results reported in the literature.  Analysis of the model highlighted the roles of various voltage-gated ionic currents to TAN dynamics and exposed a potential critical role for acetylcholine release in shaping the striatal activity associated with tics.  New experiments have revealed spatial variability in activity across the striatum as well as differences in activity depending on an animal's activity state (e.g., sleep versus wake), which point to new directions for future computational work.\n\nThe global networks targeted by the Hamker and Bar-Gad labs were studied by testing the changes in the activity of multiple parts the cortico-basal ganglia loop during tic expression and habit formation.  Results suggest that the transition from goal-directed to habitual behavior relies on learning \"shortcuts\" that bypass some of the action selection loops through the basal ganglia.  Enhanced habit formation in Tourette's syndrome may relate to altered learning dynamics in this process that result from changes in the neurotransmitters used for communication between neurons that have been linked with Tourette's.  Additional modeling work suggests mechanisms by which specific basal ganglia pathways participate in interrupting a planned movement in response to a stop cue; these mechanisms are natural candidates for consideration in explaining Tourette's patients' reduced performance on stop signal tasks.\n\nCurrently, the Rubin and Hamker labs are currently generating a systems level model of tic expression which implements a detailed intra-striatal network; that is, the funding of this project has helped to establlish ongoing collaborative links.
