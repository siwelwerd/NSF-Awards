 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traditionally meteorological radars have observed storms using single polarization to measure the intensity and velocity within storms.  Past research has shown that significantly more information about the storms, their particle types, and stage of evolution can be gleamed from using two orthogonal polarizations in radars.   This research focuses on the dual-polarization radar observations during the RELAMPAGO experiment in west Central Argentina. This region has among the most intense convective systems in the world in terms of frequency of large hail, very high storm tops, and extreme lightning activity, yet much remains unknown about the intense convection in this region. Because of the repeatability of storms in the region, this experiment will observe these storms to address science questions related to the initiation, initial organization/severe-weather generation, and growth stages of storm development, which are poorly understood.  This research will improve the understanding of, and the ability to predict, severe convective storms worldwide. Similar environments exist in many parts of the world including the US Rocky Mountains and Asia (such as Chengdu basin in China and Himalayan plains on the Indian subcontinent). The radar techniques developed from this project has the potential to benefit all the nationwide deployment of dual-polarization radars in the US.\r\n\r\nThis project will specifically address the analysis and retrieval of dual-polarization radar observations in some of the most intense convective storms, developing advanced retrieval techniques. The RELAMPAGO field observation set up will elucidate the tight connections between the, complex terrain, and the production of severe weather, role of terrain in initiating and developing organized convective storms and resultant intensity.  Development and application of advanced radar techniques, specially using frequency domain procedures, to identify the type of precipitation particles in the storm is an important part of this project.",
