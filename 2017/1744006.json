 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project uses both citizen science and crowdsourcing in the design, construction, and utilization of acrylic concrete structures for rainwater harvesting in San Angelo, Texas, an area prone to persistent droughts. By engaging citizens in water sampling and water quality testing this project gains insight into leaching of acrylic concrete leachate in these rainwater harvesting systems and aids in the development of low-cost, sustainable rainwater harvesting systems that can support human consumption of this harvested water. \r\n\r\nIn this research project, citizen scientists participate by collecting rainwater in their backwards, submitting measurements of captured rainwater through a mobile friendly platform, responding to surveys and interviews on the rainwater system, and participating in community workshops for continued and adaptive project design. Through this engagement process this research project seeks to expand the literature on engaging with vulnerable populations in citizen science water quality projects by considering local epistemologies and socioeconomic status in project design and implementation. This project has three goals to advance emerging rainwater harvesting technology: 1) advance the state of design and manufacturing of acrylic concrete that is used as a low-cost, sustainable rainwater harvesting system, 2) advance understanding of acrylic concrete leachate in the captured rainwater expand its use from irrigation purposes to human consumption, and, 3) fill a gap in the literature on how local knowledge in vulnerable populations plays an important role in water centric citizen science.  The project design has continuous community outreach, engagement and assessment through three workshops titles, \"construction\", \"water\", and, \"next steps\", that recruit and take participants through the research project, step by step. The project is generating a framework to facilitate engagement of community members and vulnerable populations in engineering through civil engineering research.",

We recruited nine families from various community organizations and events to participate in the project.&nbsp;Throughout the project, participants (citizen scientists) attended the workshops with their children, where all together worked on: designing the tanks, coating them with acrylic concrete mixture, setting up their rainwater harvesting system and collecting water samples and measurements. This project is unique since it incorporates qualitative and quantitative research methods to inspect resiliency and capacity building in water quality research.</p>\n<p>Various significant results have been found as they relate to the specific areas of interest. In the area of environmental engineering, this research produced the first water quality data of water contained in acrylic concrete tanks. This project advanced the state of design and manufacturing of acrylic concrete, as a low-cost, sustainable rainwater harvesting system. In the area of material mixture design, a testing matrix of various mixture designs revealed that an optimal mixture can be found to create these acrylic concrete harvesting tanks, with appreciable strength to withstand against debilitating cracking that would lead to water loss. In the area of rainwater tank design, participants found the acrylic concrete technology practical for rainwater collection. One significant observation was the fact that the participants could customize the shape of the tank to accommodate their needs and space constraints. Our group has produced the first data for participation of vulnerable populations in water quality engineering research. The results of the project will enhance scientific understanding on many levels through broad dissemination of the results and experiences. In the area of engagement of a vulnerable population in a citizen science project, we have found two significant results. The first is the perceived value of education in a research project. The vast majority of households involved in this study have young to adolescent children who also participated in the various research activities. Parents in the households have stated that they perceive value in exposing their young children to this research project as an ?educational activity.? The significance of this result is the contextualization of citizen science research to emphasize educational opportunities as a means of appealing to low socioeconomic minority populations. The second is the worthwhile value of leveraging community connections in engineering and science participant recruitment efforts. Disseminating solicitations to target populations was insufficient to garner their full participation; rather we learned that target populations are best reached through trusting persons within communities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our project initiated water quality research in a population that has not had opportunities to participate as citizen scientists in engineering research. The research group anticipates that this close exposure of families to engineering encourages children to pursue STEM fields and fosters parents in supporting them.&nbsp;Seven undergraduate students (1 female Hispanic, 1 male Hispanic, and 5 male Caucasians) from our student population at a Hispanic Serving Institution participated in this project as research assistants. Our students participated in all parts of the project including recruitment of participants, transcription of audio files, attendance at and contribution to the workshops with various households, material preparation, mechanical and water quality testing, and production of graphs and figures for forthcoming articles. Their activities expose our students to pathways to graduate school and into research areas that broaden their understanding of engineering identity and engineering as a means of empowering vulnerable communities. The PI presented the project at a local elementary school?s Science Fair, where children along with their families learned about rainwater harvesting and building simple acrylic concrete tanks to store the rainwater. The PI also presented the project as a Graduate Seminar at University of Arkansas (Fayetteville, AR), where highlights of the talk were: 1) participation of citizen scientist in research; 2) quantitative and qualitative research methods; and 3) drought resiliency.&nbsp;The PI has currently incorporated the results of this project into the lesson materials for the following courses: Economics and Sustainability of Infrastructures and Introduction to Engineering.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/26/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Azadeh&nbsp;Bolhari</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744006/1744006_10518243_1577342595842_IMG_20180112_144914--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744006/1744006_10518243_1577342595842_IMG_20180112_144914--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Coating the frame of the rainwater harvesting tank with the acrylic concrete mixture\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744006/1744006_10518243_1577342595842_IMG_20180112_144914--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Coating the frame of the rainwater harvesting tank with the acrylic concrete mixture\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Research assistants, Maria Ochoa & Austin Poole, coating the frame of the rainwater harvesting tank with the acrylic concrete mixture (Angelo State University's engineering lab)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel Castaneda</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Azadeh&nbsp;Bolhari</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Coating the frame of the rainwater harvesting tank with the acrylic concrete mixture</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744006/1744006_10518243_1577342199863_IMG_20180112_125817--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744006/1744006_10518243_1577342199863_IMG_20180112_125817--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Frame of the acrylic concrete rainwater harvesting tank\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744006/1744006_10518243_1577342199863_IMG_20180112_125817--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Frame of the acrylic concrete rainwater harvesting tank\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Research assistant, Maria Ochoa, building the frame of the acrylic concrete rainwater harvesting tank (Angelo State University's engineering lab)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel Castaneda</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Azadeh&nbsp;Bolhari</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Frame of the acrylic concrete rainwater harvesting tank</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744006/1744006_10518243_1577341769432_image1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744006/1744006_10518243_1577341769432_image1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Acrylic concrete rainwater harvesting tank\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744006/1744006_10518243_1577341769432_image1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Acrylic concrete rainwater harvesting tank\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An acrylic concrete rainwater harvesting tank built by the research team at Angelo State University's engineering lab</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Azadeh Bolhari</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Azadeh&nbsp;Bolhari</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Acrylic concrete rainwater harvesting tank</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744006/1744006_10518243_1577343422691_IMG_20180220_192434--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744006/1744006_10518243_1577343422691_IMG_20180220_192434--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Frames created by the citizen scientists\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1744006/1744006_10518243_1577343422691_IMG_20180220_192434--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Frames created by the citizen scientists\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Different forms and sizes of rainwater harvesting tanks were created by the participants (Angelo State University's engineering lab).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel Castaneda</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Azadeh&nbsp;Bolhari</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Frames created by the citizen scientists</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
