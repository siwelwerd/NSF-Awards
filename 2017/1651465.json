 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ionospheric irregularities diffract and refract radio waves. These effects present as Global Positioning System (GPS) signal phase and/or amplitude scintillation. The proposed activities consist of analyzing ionospheric irregularities sensed by a GPS scintillation array at the Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR) in Alaska that can resolve horizontal scales as small as 10 km. The Principal Investigators (PIs) will recover properties of the plasma structures such as electron content, drift velocity, and the horizontal dimensions of the irregularities. A primary research goal is to use the spatial structuring information to characterize the E- and F-region turbulence energy cascades. \r\n\r\nThese tasks will clarify whether turbulence explains observed GPS scintillations, and enhance understanding of the role of turbulence in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. Broader impacts include career development of 2 junior faculty - at least one of them female - and graduate student support. This research is also highly pertinent to the National Space Weather Action Plan. During extreme events, the E- and F-region irregularities that are the focus of this research's science can migrate to lower latitudes and significantly affect communications and navigation systems. Through its support and utilization of GPS, radio and optical data, this research maintains observational capability for space-weather operations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA star twinkles in the night sky because turbulence in the air is scattering the light that reaches our eyes, so that the stars' brightness seems to change over time.  In the same way, radio waves transmitted from satellites to the ground can twinkle, or \"scintillate,\" due to the atmosphere.  The scintillation may be measured as a rapid fluctuation in the signal's amplitude, phase, or both.  The part of the atmosphere that affects radio signals is called the ionosphere.  The ionosphere contains charged ions and electrons, created by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun ionizing the atoms and molecules in the atmosphere.  The sun's activity, including how much UV light it shines, increases and decreases over an 11 year period known as a solar cycle.  The activity level is high during \"solar maximum\" and low during \"solar minimum.\"\n\nIonospheric scintillation is a problem because it can intermittently reduce Global Positioning System (GPS) reliability for navigation, and in the U.S., happens most commonly in Alaska.  In a previously awarded NSF project, we had installed the scintillation auroral GPS array (SAGA), a set of six GPS receivers specialized to measure scintillation at Poker Flat Research Range, Alaska.  \n\nThe objective of this work was to continue to collect data with SAGA and use the data, along with other measurements made at Poker Flat, to sense the turbulence, or \"irregularities,\" in the ionosphere that cause GPS to scintillate.  Our goals were to sense how high up the irregularities might be: either in the E region of the ionosphere below about 150 km or in the F region above 150 km;  and to check the relationship of the layer (E or F) with the type of scintillation (amplitude, phase, or both).  \n\nTo do this we first used SAGA data from 2014-2019 (spanning solar maximum to solar minimum) to detect when scintillation happened, and then to classify whether the fluctuations were in the GPS signal's amplitude, phase, or both amplitude and phase.  We produced a list of all the scintillation events we found from 2014-2019, organized by year and type.  We then developed a way to try to determine how high up the irregularities are, using a separate instrument at Poker Flat, known as an incoherent scatter radar (ISR).  The ISR measures the density of charge particles at different heights in the ionosphere.  By assuming that the height where the density is highest is where the irregularities are, we were able to hypothesize whether the irregularities causing GPS to scintillate were in the E layer or F layer for each of the scintillation events found.  \n\nWe found that amplitude or both-phase-and-amplitude scintillations happen about 1% as often as phase scintillation events in Alaska.  We found that scintillations of any type happen at a higher rate during solar maximum (2014) than solar minimum (2019).  We found that, based on the ISR, a slight majority of the phase scintillation events were hypothesized to be in the E layer during solar maximum, and that during solar minimum the vast majority were E layer.  We found that amplitude or both-type scintillations tend to happen in the F layer, as measured by ISR, and at any time of day.  All phase scintillations that occurred during daytime in Alaska happened during solar maximum and were in the F layer.  This list of events from 2014-2019, the type of GPS scintillation  identified (amplitude, phase, or both), and the layer we think the  irregularities causing the scintillation might be in based on the ISR  (E, F, in between, or inconclusive), is publicly available.  In addition to publishing this database of events, we published journal papers, and posted the SAGA data and software we used to analyze SAGA and ISR data publicly open-source. \n\nThis project supported the research and training in STEM of a gender-wise diverse group of individuals at several stages of higher education.  One post-doctoral scholar supported by this project partnered with the Adler Planetarium of Chicago to collect data by relocating part of the SAGA array to collect data during the 2017 solar eclipse.  Two students (one a woman) completed their M.S. theses partly supported by this effort. Four graduate students did two-semester research projects using these data.  Two of them (one a woman) were inspired to continue to pursue Ph.D. research.  Three undergraduates, one funded by this effort, conducted research as part of this project.  Two of the undergraduates are underrepresented genders in STEM, and one has decided to continue research with a Master's thesis.  This effort enabled 11 students enrolled in a graduate class on the space environment to do final projects for the class using ISR and other data sets.  This effort enabled the PI to conduct outreach beyond the university: preschool activities on the 2017 solar eclipse, and speaking at an elementary school career night.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Seebany Datta-Barua"
