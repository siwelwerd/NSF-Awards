 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description: Two-dimensional (2D) sheet-like materials composed of one or a few layers of atoms often display properties dramatically different from the same materials in bulk form. This project focuses on a new two-dimensional material, namely silicon telluride, which has unique variable structures where Si atoms form Si-Si pairs to fill the sites between surrounding Te atoms. Each Si pair has four possible orientations, with easily achievable rotations between each other. The flexibility in Si dimer orientations enables unique structural variability and opens opportunities for new phenomena, properties, and functionalities. The research team combines theoretical and experimental studies to develop 2D materials with desirable properties and to achieve a fundamental understanding of the unique phenomenon in silicon telluride, which is expected to make significant impacts on the field of low-dimensional materials and electronic and optoelectronic industry. The research activities are integrated with educational efforts, augmenting the undergraduate and graduate curriculums through hands-on projects, enriched course materials, and summer workshops on nanomaterials to inspire the students' interest in science. Additional project activities including outreach to high school students and teachers through summer research activities and demonstrations at local high schools further extend the impact of this project on the community.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: Atomically thin, two-dimensional materials such as graphene, dichalcogenides, and black phosphorus offer unique properties and have attracted significant attention by the scientific community. Silicon telluride is a new 2D material, recently demonstrated with a thickness of a few atomic layers. It has a unique crystal structure in which the Te atoms form a hexagonal close-packed structure, and Si atoms form Si-Si dimers to fill the two-thirds of the interstitial sites between the Te atoms, with each Si dimer taking one of the four possible orientations: three in-plane and one out-plane. The Si dimers can easily rotate their orientations due to the small energy barriers and thus can enable dynamic structural variations, such as flipped Si dimers and domain boundaries between regions of different Si dimer orientations, which are expected to interact with charge carriers and excitons to give rise to new electronic and optical phenomena and properties. In this project, the team combines theoretical investigations based on first-principles calculations and experimental deposition and characterization approaches to develop a fundamental understanding of how structural variations in 2D silicon telluride affect the material properties by exploring various strain and doping optimization strategies.",

The reduced dimensionality enables a range of new properties that are different from the bulk, such as minimal dielectric screening, rippling, twisting, and easy functionalization, which bring new opportunities for advanced technologies such as electronics, photonics, catalysis, and sensing. Among the numerous 2D materials that are currently being studied, silicon telluride (Si<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>) is unique because the silicon atoms pair with each other to form Si dimers.&nbsp; The Si dimers then partially fill the interstitial sites between the closely packed Te atoms. The Si dimers can rotate at room temperature or above, thus enabling a unique structure variability. Besides that, the Si dimers can also dissociate, leading to other phases with different properties. Supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF)'s Division of Materials Research (DMR), we have investigated silicon telluride using state-of-the-art theoretical/computational methods and experimental techniques, gaining more understanding of the behaviors and properties of this material. Over the duration of the grant, we have made a number of major advances.</p>\n<p>We have discovered resistive switching in Si<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>. We have grown Si<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> nanowires and investigated their structure and electrical properties. We found that the nanowires grow along the c-axis that is perpendicular to the layers, with the stacking of layered nanosheets via the van der Waals force forming single crystalline one-dimensional (1D) structures. The 1D nanowires composed of 2D Si<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> material exhibit a unique resistance switching behavior under an applied electrical potential. A stable low-resistance state (LRS) is defined by the initial voltage applied to a fresh nanowire. One can switch the LRS to the high-resistance state (HRS) by changing the polarity of the applied potential, as shown in Figure 1. Theoretical calculations elucidate the electrically induced structural change that plays an important role in the resistance switching property. The resistance switching behavior of the silicon-based Si<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> is of great interest for both fundamental understanding and practical applications in memory devices.</p>\n<p>The existence of Si dimers also enables interesting mechanical properties of Si<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>. We carried out computational investigations to determine the critical strain of monolayer Si<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub>. The results show that when being stretched along the direction of the Si dimer, Si<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> can sustain a critical tensile strain up to 38%, as shown in Figure 2. The critical strain is one of the highest among 2D materials, which in combination with a moderate breaking stress, makes Si<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> one of the most flexible 2D materials reported. Because of the high flexibility, a large strain can be used to tune the band structure, and the bandgap can be reduced greatly from the visible to infrared range. This tunability will be useful for applications in photonics and optoelectronics. With increasing strain, the bandgap undergoes an unusual indirect-direct-indirect- direct transition. We also find that the uniaxial strain can effectively control the orientation of Si dimers. The results highlight the potential of Si<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> in nanomechanical applications.</p>\n<p>Two-dimensional materials are particularly interesting for their optical properties as they often feature stronger excitonic effects beneficial for many applications. Moreover, in-plane optical anisotropy in 2D materials offers an additional degree of freedom for device design and has potentials in angle-dependent optical and optoelectronic applications. The orientation of silicon dimers in Si<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> enables optical anisotropy in this material. Computational results show that the imaginary part of the dielectric constant in the direction parallel to the Si-Si dimer is much smaller compared to the direction perpendicular to the dimer. The prediction is verified by experimental data, as shown in Figure 3. The optical anisotropy can potentially be dynamically controlled by electric field or strain, which can be useful for applications. Raman measurements at various temperatures reveal vibrational modes that have not been previously identified. The results agree with calculations and can be very helpful for future experimental studies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to the outcomes described above, we also elucidated the nature of photocarrier dynamics in Si<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> that is important for optoelectronic applications. We also developed oxide coating methods to protect the material from its reaction with moisture, which is critical for making practical devices. Furthermore, we revealed the crystal structures of the metallic Si<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>3</sub> observed in the high-pressure semiconductor-to-metal phase transition and significantly expanded the knowledge base of related compounds SiTe<sub>2</sub> and SiTe.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/20/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Xiao&nbsp;Shen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1709528/1709528_10492787_1634330832880_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1709528/1709528_10492787_1634330832880_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Resistive switching in Si2Te3 nanowires\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1709528/1709528_10492787_1634330832880_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Resistive switching in Si2Te3 nanowires\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
