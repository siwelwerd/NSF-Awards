 "awd_abstract_narration": "The severe shortage of qualified STEM teachers necessary to educate and inspire the future technical workforce undermines our nation's economic competitiveness and its scientific and technological leadership. The situation in physics is particularly alarming. Fewer than half of all high school physics classrooms are led by a teacher with a degree in physics, and physics is the number one shortage area for new K-12 teachers.  Since 2001, the Physics Teacher Education Coalition (PhysTEC), led by the American Physical Society (APS) and the American Association of Physics Teachers (AAPT), has been working to engage physics departments in establishing the infrastructure needed to address the national physics teacher shortage. Building on the widespread engagement of the physics community and project experience and knowledge from dozens of successful programs, this award funds the thirteenth national PhysTEC Conference. This conference will bring together leaders of PhysTEC Sites, faculty from PhysTEC Member Institutions, and other members of the physics teacher preparation community.\r\nConference goals include:\r\n1. Provide professional development for physics teacher educators\r\n2. Foster networking among PhysTEC community members\r\n3. Support faculty learning communities for PhysTEC Site leaders\r\n\r\nThis conference will provide an opportunity for approximately 100 leaders and participants in the PhysTEC community to update and expand their knowledge regarding effective practices and research in physics teacher preparation. An evaluation plan will investigate the effectiveness of the PhysTEC Conference to engage physics departments, develop capacity for change, and improve physics teacher preparation, and result in a survey instrument that can be used for future conferences. Participants will lead their institutions in adopting research-based practices, including instructional practices shown to increase student learning and develop knowledge and skills for teaching physics.",
