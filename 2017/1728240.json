It specifically examines the impact on perceived political acceptance in illiberal regimes, which have a noted hostility to human rights frames, of adopting a human rights frame as a substitute when approaching identity issues. \r\n\r\nThe research plan involves participant observation over 12 months with 3 social movement organizations and approximately 50 semi-structured interviews. The project offers the potential for increasing understanding of the ability of social movements to shift frames in ways that enhance their social desirability, in both liberal and illiberal societies.",
