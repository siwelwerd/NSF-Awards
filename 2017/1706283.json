 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major challenge for global health is the development of portable, low-cost, and non-invasive technologies for the diagnosis of diseases, because the availability of such devices could reduce the number of mortalities caused by infection.  For example, pneumonia is a disease that annually takes the lives of approximately one million children under the age of five due to poor access to health care or tools that can rapidly diagnose the disease.  The goal of this research project is to develop innovative, non-invasive biosensing methods to detect compounds emitted in the breath of individuals suffering from pneumonia.  The researchers will create small tubes of a ceramic material, titanium dioxide, that have diameters on the order of several nanometers and then attach a metal layer to the exterior of the tubes.  They will then study how the electrical resistance of the tube changes as a function of its exposure to vapors of compounds that are emitted by microorganisms that cause pneumonia. \r\n\r\nThis research project will leverage known specific molecular interactions between metals and volatile organic biomarkers (VOBs). Such compounds are given off by microorganisms that cause diseases, such as pneumonia, and are found in the breath of infected individuals. Previous research has shown a clear link between VOBs from patient breath and pathological conditions such as diabetes, tuberculous, colorectal cancer, and pneumonia. The research approach uses metals deposited on a titanium dioxide nanotube substrate as a binding element for VOBs of interest.  Binding events cause a measurable change in current in the sensor which will be characterized.  The project will focus on creating a pneumonia sensor by (1) using computational modeling to understand the interactions between metals or combination of metals with known VOBs associated with pneumonia; (2) creating a metal-modified titanium dioxide nanotube sensing platform capable of detecting VOBs associated with pneumonia; (3) studying the limit of detection of the sensor for the VOBs associated with pneumonia; and (4) developing a sensor for examining the biological relationship between bacterial load in a culture and the amount of VOB generated using Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, and Haemophilus influenza (organisms commonly found in pneumonia with known VOBs).  These research efforts will demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach and lay the foundation for building a breath-based sensor for assessing pneumonia.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA major issue in addressing global health challenges is the lack of portable, low-cost, non-invasive technologies for diagnosis of disease. Pneumonia is one example where approximately 1 million children world-wide under the age of five die each year due to poor access to tools that can rapidly diagnose the disease.  The goal of this research was to develop cost-effective, non-invasive biosensing methods for point of care diagnosis of pneumonia using breath by understanding functionalized titanium dioxide nanotubes sensing platform can be engineered to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the breath that are metabolic byproducts of the microorganisms that cause pneumonia.\n\nOur research included a study of volatile organic compound emissions from pneumonia causing bacteria cultures (Streptococcus pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus) taken from culture banks and pediatric patients.  Significant findings showed two new volatile organic compounds discovered for Staphylococcus aureus human isolates.  Over all the VOCs measured from culture experiments showed distinct VOC patterns that could be leveraged as a indicator of pneumonia.  Furthermore, VOC evolution from culture occurred within a few hours of colonization which suggests that early diagnosis of Pneumonia via VOC profiles vs. standard clinical approaches which can take several days to weeks.\n\nThe VOCs found in culture guided the development of sensors that can be tailored for applications in pneumonia. For example, it was found that heptane is a significant VOC byproduct and a new type of nanostructured titanium dioxide functionalized with tetracosane was developed to specifically react with this chemical indicator for pneumonia.  In the long-term, this type of sensor could be used in conjunction with other sensors specific for other pneumonia associated VOCs to screen or detect pneumonia in a healthcare setting at the point of care.  This would allow healthcare and public health care professionals manage the disease.\n\nAdditional outcomes from the research revolve on new nanomaterials synthesis methods designed to improve sensor performance by fundamentally changing the crystal structure of the titanium dioxide nanotubes.  Our experiments in this area showed that utilizing a double annealing process of oxygen followed by hydrogen produced specific substoichiometric oxides while maintaining nanotube morphology.  This fundamental understanding of how the these oxides are created forms the fundamental basis of engineering high performing titanium dioxide nanomaterials for applications in sensors and other important fields of study, such as air pollution mitigation and water purification.\n\nTo date this project has produced 2 peer reviewed journal publications with two more submitted for review.  Several students have been trained in advanced analytical skill sets including gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, scanning electron microscope analysis, nanomaterials synthesis, electrochemistry, rapid prototyping/CAD, X-ray Diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. These skills have helped students obtain employment in industry. A  total of 4 undergraduate students, and 3 graduate students have participated in this grant, and one complete PhD dissertation produced.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Swomitra Mohanty"
