 "awd_abstract_narration": "Resilience thinking is a rapidly emerging concept that is being used to frame how scientists approach the study of biophysical systems. It also seeks to determine how societies, economies and biophysical systems can be managed to ensure resilience; that is, how to maintain the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance. There are strong overlaps between the scientific discipline of geomorphology (the biophysical processes that shape Earth's landscapes) and the concept of resilience. There is however a lack of awareness of the foundations of the former in the emergence of resilience. Thus, resilience is limited and limiting in its application to bio-geomorphic systems. A collective examination of bio-geomorphic systems and resilience will conceptually advance both areas of study and further cement the relevance and importance of understanding the complexities of bio-geomorphic systems in an emerging world of interdisciplinary research endeavors. \r\n\r\nThe 48th annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium (BGS) on Resilience and Bio-Geomorphic Systems will bring together leading and emerging scientists in bio-geomorphology and resilience thinking. The meeting will be organized around themes related to interactions between bio-geomorphic systems and resilience: (1) Foundations in geomorphic systems and resilience thinking; (2) Extreme events, thresholds, and resilience; (3) Cross-scale interactions; (4) Longitudinal resilience: mountains to coasts; (5) Eco-geo connections; and (6) Social-ecological systems. All papers presented orally and selected papers presented as posters at the BGS are published in the internationally recognized journal Geomorphology. In keeping with the tradition established by past BGS, the 2017 meeting will promote and enhance student education and participation.",
