 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract:\r\nThe study of spin transport by excitation of collective magnetization is an important new frontier in condensed matter physics.  Spin transport in magnetic insulators, metals, or carbon nanomaterials via degrees of freedom not simply carried by propagating electrons is proving to be fertile fundamental ground rich with potential technological innovation.  New discoveries in these areas inform future nanoelectronic models that could one day replace current technologies.  For example, a spin information conduit formed from a disordered magnetic insulator thin film could allow easy materials integration and an essential inter-connect in a future all-spin computer processor.  Similarly, large spin-wave effects in low-damping metallic ferromagnets could provide new ways to generate the spin currents needed to drive such a processor.  Optimized carbon nanotube network films offer potential for spin transport applications, but could convert waste heat to usable energy if their fundamental thermal and thermoelectric physics is better understood.  This project explores the fundamental science of these potentially transformative advances. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nThis project focuses on measuring spin and heat transport (and their interplay) across three classes of materials: disordered magnetic insulators, low-damping ferromagnetic metals, and single-wall carbon nanotube networks.  Each of these explores new and potentially transformative directions.  The study of spin transport in disordered magnetic insulators follows on preliminary results showing that spin transport, driven by the spin Hall effect and detected via the inverse spin Hall effect, is surprisingly efficient where antiferromagnetic correlations exist but in the absence of magnetic and structural long range order.  Specific tasks in this area include: 1) initial tests of amorphous Cr2O3 and NiO, 2) detailed characterization of distance and geometry dependence, 3) effects of annealing of amorphous YIG, 4) understanding of thermal gradient dependence, 5) waiting time and aging experiments, and 6) direct testing for non-equilibrium spin thermal conductivity in the disordered magnetic films.  Exploration of magnon-driven spin and heat transport and thermoelectric effects in low-damping metals focuses on the Co-Fe alloy system and is motivated by potentially dramatic new spincaloritronic effects. Specific tasks here include: 1) studies with the \"standard\" Zink Lab thermal isolation platform, 2) characterization of AMR, MTEP, PNE, and ANE, and 3) exploration of magnon-driven spin currents using e-beam lithographically defined thermal isolation structures.  Finally, study of spin and heat transport in carbon nanomaterials leverages expertise in preparation and study of highly-tuned single-wall nanotube network films.  Specific tasks here include: 1) study of Wiedemann-Franz \"violation\" and doping dependence of thermal conductivity, 2) designing more sensitive thermal isolation platforms, and 3) testing spin transport in the networks using a non-local spin valve geometry.",

We explored these issues with a range of experimental techniques, with a central focus on unique tools made using micro- and nanomachining.  There were several important Intellectual Merit outcomes of this work.  First, we demonstrated a magnetic field direction-dependent heat flow in specially tuned ferromagnetic metals.  This novel observation points to a unique new understanding of how heat can be carried in a metallic ferromagnet by excitations of the magnetization called spin waves.  Second, we demonstrated that this spin wave heat flow can also be used to produce increased voltages in the thermopower, or Seebeck effect, which generates energy from an applied thermal gradient.  Third, we showed a very unusual reduction of the heat flow by vibrations (or phonons) in a disordered carbon nanomaterial formed from mats of carbon nanotubes.  With further understanding of this effect, dramatically improved energy harvesting devices using the Seebeck effect could be possible.  Fourth, we demonstrated that polycrystalline gold thin films grown with a particular type of grain structure show a very surprising reduction in their ability to carry heat, while still allowing very efficient charge flow.  Fifth, we used quantitative magnetometry and neutron spectroscopy to better understand the magnetism of a few-nanometer thick interface layer that forms between a thin film of yttrium iron garnet, one of the most investigated materials in current magnetism research, and substrate almost always used to grow it.  Finally, we completed a wide range of experiments that clarify challenges with measuring spin flow in nominally insulating samples via the non-local resistivity technique.  These put an important limit on spin transport in disordered magnetic systems, and provide insight into how experimental artifacts could impact a wide range of other systems.     \n\n \n\nWe communicated these and other Intellectual Merit results by publishing seven papers (with two others coming soon), presenting 16 invited talks at conferences and University seminars, and via more than 10 contributed talks presented by PhD students.   This work also contributed to one US Patent application.  \n\n \n\nThe Broader Impacts of this project included education and technical training and public outreach.
