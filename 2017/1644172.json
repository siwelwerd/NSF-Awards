 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic slope front (ASF) is a persistent feature of the continental shelf and slope around much of Antarctica.  It is a notably coherent yet under-sampled component of the Southern Ocean?s global circulation. The AFS is a primary source region for the renewal of Antarctic surface water from below and also bottom water flow into the global deep ocean. There is considerable interest in understanding the exchanges and transformations of AFS ocean heat, gasses, salt (freshwater), nutrients, particulates and carbon through exchanges with components of the high latitude ocean, polar atmosphere, sea-ice and land ice. \r\n\r\nThe ASF and associated currents are absent on the West Antarctic Peninsula, whereas a well-established ASF has been observed in the Amundsen Sea. In between, the Bellingshausen Sea hosts ice shelves that have experienced some of the most dramatic recent thinning rates in Antarctica, yet remains one of the most under-studied regions of the global ocean. The project will make a comprehensive survey of the frontal circulation along the continental shelf break and the major troughs of the Bellingshausen Sea using both ocean gliders and ship-based CTD and ADCP measurements.  In terms of broader impacts, this research will reduce the uncertainty in coupled climate models that may be used to project future sea-level rise resulting from rapid thinning of the West Antarctic ice shelves that connect to the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas. The project will also support the education of a graduate student and post-doctoral researcher.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFloating ice shelves fringe the coast of Antarctica and represent the terminus of ice streams that flow from the interior of the continent towards the coast.  Throughout West Antarctica, these ice shelves have thinned substantially in recent decades, largely due to the oceanic circulation of warm water under the ice that has the ability to melt the base of the shelves.  Thinning of an ice shelf can lead to collapse, which impacts the stability of that part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) that is ?grounded,? or sitting on bedrock.  An increase in the flow of the WAIS into the ocean has the potential to contribute meters of sea level rise on centennial time scales.  Studies of how ocean currents supply warm water under floating ice shelves has largely focused on a small number of glaciers in the Amundsen Sea.  Our project used a combination of measurements collected from dedicated research cruises, autonomous vehicles, and instrumented elephant seals, to provide one of the first surveys of the Bellingshausen Sea, a region that neighbors the Amundsen Sea to the east.  These two shelf seas have many similarities, but also some key differences.  For instance, the Bellingshausen sector marks the region where relatively warm Southern Ocean waters reach their closest location to the continental shelf.  Thus, the warmest continental shelf waters in West Antarctica are found in the Bellingshausen Sea and are likely an important precursor of waters that flow towards the larger glaciers in the Amundsen Sea, such as Pine Island and Thwaites.\n\nThis project has illustrated that the Bellingshausen Sea plays a critical role in connecting the local circulation systems of individual shelf seas throughout West Antarctica.  First, we showed that variations in the seafloor, or the ocean?s bathymetry, acts to focus ocean circulation features into narrow boundary currents that provide efficient pathways for transporting heat between the edge of the continental shelf and the coast.  In particular, large troughs, carved out by retreating glaciers during past climate transitions, effectively steer warm water towards the Bellingshausen Sea ice shelves, giving rise to their strong melting.  These troughs also provide a conduit for glacial meltwater, released into the ocean from the ice shelves, to flow back towards the edge of the continental shelf.  As these ?modified? waters interact with offshore waters flowing on to the continental shelf, fronts, or regions of sharp changes in water properties, are established.  These fronts support strong ocean currents that flow parallel to the shelf and allow for the exchange of water properties between the Bellingshausen and Amundsen Seas.  The strength of these fronts can, in turn, influence the exchange of heat on to the continental shelf and ice-shelf melt rates.  Thus, there is a sensitive interplay between ocean processes occurring both near the coast and at the boundary between the continental shelf and the open ocean.\n\nDue to the input of freshwater that enters the ocean through ice melt, at high latitudes the warmest waters are typically found a few hundred meters below the surface.  Yet, work from this project has also shown that ice-shelf melt rates are also sensitive to circulation features close to the surface.  Specifically, freshwater water flowing into the ocean surface near the coast leads to the formation of a westward-flowing circulation feature that hugs the coastline as well as the face of the floating ice shelves.  While this ?river? of freshwater is too shallow to access the region under ice shelves, its properties influence the amount of heat carried into these ice-shelf cavities.  When the current is weak, mixing in the ocean can carry heat upward where it is eventually lost to the atmosphere.  When the current strengthens, the base of the current suppresses this mixing, almost like a lid, and rather than the heat moving upward through mixing, it is carried horizontally into the ice-shelf cavity, increasing ice-shelf melt.  Using measurements of temperature and salinity collected by seals carrying small sensors, we mapped this coastal circulation feature for the first time and showed that it flows continuously from near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula throughout all of the West Antarctic shelf seas.  Furthermore, modifications to ocean properties occurring in one localized region, for instance increased glacial melt along the West Antarctic Peninsula, are communicated broadly throughout West Antarctica by the coastal current and can strengthen melt rates for all of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet?s floating ice shelves.  This last result has major implications for how WAIS will evolve on decadal and centennial scales and highlights a need to improve representation of near-coast ocean-ice interactions in climate models, which are used to predict future sea-level rise.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew F Thompson"
