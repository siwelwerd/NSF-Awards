 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Objectives and Approaches\r\nThe objective of this research is to boost the efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices to over 15% by eliminating the major energy loss channels. The approach is to apply an ultrathin ferroelectric layer at the organic/electrode interface to induce a strong electric field into the organic semiconductor layer for efficient charge separation and extraction. With this unique structure, there will be no need to apply an external field to have the electric-field-induced charge extraction persist. \r\n \r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis project provides a transformative device design that promises to increase the efficiency of organic photovoltaic devices potentially to the thermodynamic limit. The ferroelectric polymer is a universal dual function interfacial layer for both low- and high-work function surface modifications. Further, this research will bring new fundamental insight to the physics of charge photo-generation, collection, and the origin of the open circuit voltage in organic photovoltaic devices. \r\n  \r\nBroader Impacts\r\nNew fundamental understanding regarding the influence of a strong electric field on charge dissociation and extraction will establish the theoretical base for new applications in electric field-controlled electronic devices, including organic light emitting diodes, excitonic solar cells, high speed photorefractive polymers, organic bistable memory, organic photodetectors, organic transistors, and multiferroics. This research will support outreach activities for students diversified in age, gender, and ethnicity. This platform of learning, which particularly targets high school students, will encourage students to consider careers in the energy conversion engineering field and provide the PI the experience necessary to develop into a stellar teacher-scholar.",
