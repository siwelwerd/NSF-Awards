 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to increase the power of the HERCULES laser facility at the University of Michigan to enable fundamental research in frontier areas of plasma, laser and optical physics. This research will foster new technologies that impact medicine, energy and national security in addition to scientific applications across a very broad range of other fields: from biology to materials science. Particular applications of this research include the development of compact laser generated sources of energetic ion and gamma-ray beams for cancer treatment, high resolution imaging, and detection of nuclear materials for Homeland Security purposes. Another potential major application for this laser system is as a \"table-top\" electron accelerator and x-ray source. The development of such table-top systems will be transformative, since they would be very compact and relatively inexpensive. Over the past decade the high power laser systems at Michigan have become important facilities for graduate student training. US and international researchers and students will continue to take part in the research projects using the extreme laser intensities available with the upgraded HERCULES facility.\r\n\r\nThis grant will enable acquisition of two new pump lasers and associated equipment for the final two amplification stages of the HERCULES laser system at the Center for Ultrafast Optical Science at the University of Michigan. HERCULES will then operate either at a peak power of 500 TW (five times its present capability) or at 50 TW with an increased repetition rate of 5 Hz. These upgraded amplifiers will replace two existing \"home-built\" pump laser systems which have recently degraded in performance and reliability. The HERCULES laser system has previously achieved the world's highest focused laser intensities, however one of the most exciting frontiers for these lasers is to go beyond this -- to explore the dynamics of plasma in ultra-relativistic fields and observe the effects of radiation reaction and the effects of nonlinear Quantum Electrodynamics on laser plasma interactions. Research in this unexplored regime will be made possible by the upgraded system.",
