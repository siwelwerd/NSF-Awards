 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar-powered production of hydrogen from water offers the potential to enable solar power, which is available on a transient basis, to be stored in the form of a chemical fuel. This capability would allow the energy to be stored temporarily, then deployed during times of high demand but relatively low availability of sunlight. In addition, conversion of solar energy into hydrogen fuel would help provide the foundation for a hydrogen-based transportation infrastructure incorporating fuel-cell vehicles. Efficient and cost-effective solar-powered production of hydrogen from water remains a scientific and technological challenge. This project will investigate concepts from the field of semiconductor electronics to enable new approaches to make efficient, low-cost photoelectrodes for splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen using the energy in sunlight. Specifically, photoelectrodes will be designed with thick oxide layers that serve as a protective coating at the liquid water interface with the device. At a smaller scale in the photoelectrode, local regions that are electrically conductive will be designed to enable electrons to move easily between the semiconductor region where sunlight is absorbed and the aqueous solution in which the electrons help split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. For educational impacts, the project will introduce new components into an introductory-level course for freshman students in electrical engineering. These components will provide students with expertise required to design and to create physical prototypes of a wide range of engineered systems. By developing these capabilities at the outset of their university academic careers, students will be able to deploy them extensively throughout the remainder of their education.\r\n\r\nThis project will seek to engineer localized electrical conduction paths across insulating oxide layers for efficient and stable Si-based metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) photoelectrodes for solar-driven water splitting. These investigations will build upon recent advances in the engineering of local conductivity via electrical breakdown in MIS devices that have enabled highly stable, Si-based MIS photocathodes and photoanodes. Three primary fundamental research directions will be pursued: (i) investigation of the influence of localized conduction paths between absorber and catalyst on photocurrent density, photovoltage and other aspects of MIS photoelectrode performance; (ii) engineering of a new, scalable approach, based on thin-film metallization reactions, for engineering and optimizing local conductivity across protective oxide layers for MIS photoelectrodes for water splitting; and (iii) characterization of spatial inhomogeneity in water splitting activity, and its relationship with material and device fabrication processes, using scanning electrochemical microscopy. Cross-fertilization spanning the disciplines of materials processing, electrochemistry, and solid-state device physics could enable increased impact of the technological infrastructure associated with silicon-based electronics and photovoltaics on solar fuel generation and the associated energy storage capability.",

A fundamental issue plaguing conventional semiconductor photoelectrodes is that semiconductor materials that are efficient absorbers of solar illumination, e.g., silicon, are easily corroded in the liquid environment in which solar-driven photoelectrochemical reactions typically must occur. Incorporation of a wide-bandgap electrically insulating protective layer atop the semiconductor to separate the semiconductor from the solution has been explored quite extensively as an approach to improve stability, resulting in the development of metal-insulator-semiconductor (MIS) photoelectrodes. However, MIS photoelectrodes must contend with the challenge of providing efficient transport of photogenerated carriers across the insulator to the catalyst (typically metal) at the device-liquid interface. The most typical solution is to use an extremely thin (few nanometers or less in thickness) insulating layer to facilitate tunneling by photogenerated carriers, but thin insulating layers are extremely likely to compromise stability, particularly over the long term. The approach demonstrated in this project enables the use of thick insulating layers with only localized carrier transport paths across the oxide, and in which those localized transport paths are protected from the solution by the catalyst material atop the transport path. This approach is based on a thin-film reaction between a layer of aluminum and an underlying layer of silicon dioxide in which localized ?spikes? of aluminum penetrate the silicon dioxide at elevated temperature. This spiking process enables the formation of localized, nanoscale channels through the silicon dioxide protective layer in an MIS photoelectrode that, upon removal of the aluminum by etching, can be filled by a metal catalyst using a straightforward electrodeposition process. Photoanodes for water oxidation fabricated using this approach have demonstrated excellent stability and performance. These results constitute a general method for low-cost, lithography-free, and scalable fabrication of Si-based MIS photoanodes based on an Al thin-film reaction process combined with metal catalyst electrodeposition that has outstanding potential to enable realization of photoelectrodes that substantially reduce the cost of green hydrogen production.</p>\n<p>This program also had a substantial impact in education and personnel development. One student, of Hispanic descent, involved in work for this project received his Ph.D. in 2020, and another Ph.D. student is expected to receive his Ph.D. in 2022. Several undergraduate researchers in the laboratory graduated during the project, with six moving on to Ph.D. programs in electrical engineering. Two of these undergraduates received NSF Graduate Fellowships, awarded in 2020 and 2021. This project also helped to enable the development of a series of new laboratories for a first-year introductory undergraduate electrical engineering course at UT Austin taken by approximately 400 students annually. These labs introduced students to a broad range of concepts in electrical engineering, including a number related to sustainable energy technologies. Because the new laboratories were based on the Arduino platform, the basic hardware cost for students was reduced by over 50%, and the labs opened up many new possibilities for self-instruction, exploration of applications outside the context of the course, and engagement with the large community of Arduino enthusiasts. The Arduino-based labs also facilitated a successful transition to remote learning for students during the 2020-21 academic year.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/30/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Edward&nbsp;T&nbsp;Yu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1702944/1702944_10492693_1627673179383_Lab_apparatus_photo--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1702944/1702944_10492693_1627673179383_Lab_apparatus_photo--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Photograph of apparatus for solar water splitting at UT Austin.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1702944/1702944_10492693_1627673179383_Lab_apparatus_photo--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Photograph of apparatus for solar water splitting at UT Austin.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Apparatus for solar water splitting using photoanodes developed at UT Austin.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University of Texas at Austin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Edward&nbsp;T&nbsp;Yu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Photograph of apparatus for solar water splitting at UT Austin.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1702944/1702944_10492693_1627673288494_Water_splitting_graphic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1702944/1702944_10492693_1627673288494_Water_splitting_graphic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Schematic illustration of photoanode for solar water splitting.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1702944/1702944_10492693_1627673288494_Water_splitting_graphic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Schematic illustration of photoanode for solar water splitting.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic illustration of photoanode for oxygen evolution component of solar water splitting developed at UT Austin.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University of Texas at Austin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Edward&nbsp;T&nbsp;Yu</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Schematic illustration of photoanode for solar water splitting.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
