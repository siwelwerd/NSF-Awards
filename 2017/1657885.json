 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microscopic communities in the ocean can be surprisingly diverse.  This diversity makes it difficult to study the individual organisms and reactions that control specific reactions controlling nutrient cycles. Past studies confirm that iron and nitrogen are vital elements for biological growth. There is increasing evidence, however, that other chemicals such as silica, zinc, cobalt, and vitamin B12 may be just as important. This project will provide an unprecedented view of community distributions using new molecular methods to isolate and link active proteins to specific chemical cycles during the very first research deployment of a brand-new autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).  The AUV will collect samples in programed patterns by pumping water directly into its filtering mechanism and then return the samples to the ship for analysis.  The Bermuda Atlantic Time-series Study (BATS) station, which provides abundant supporting data, is the site for this innovative investigation into the microbial ecology and chemistry of the open oceans. Additionally, data will be widely distributed to other scientists through the Ocean Protein Portal website being developed by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI) and the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office. Data will also contribute a new teaching module in the Marine Bioinorganic Chemistry course at WHOI. \r\n\r\nThis first scientific deployment of the newly engineered and constructed biogeochemical AUV, Clio, will generate a novel dataset to examine marine microbial biogeochemical cycles in the Northwestern Atlantic oligotrophic ocean in unprecedented detail and at high vertical resolution. First the project proposes to understand if the microbial community reflects the varying chemical composition and cyanobacterial species through nutrient response adaptations. Additionally, the research will determine if iron stress in the low light Prochlorococcus ecotyope found in the deep chlorophyll maximum is a persistent feature influenced by seasonal dust fluxes.  The highly resolved vertical data from the in situ pumping capabilities of Clio are fundamental to a rigorous examination of these biogeochemical questions.  This highly transformative dataset will greatly advance understanding of the nutrient and trace element cycling of this region and will be the first field validation of the potentially revolutionary capability these new approaches represent for the study of marine microbial biogeochemistry.",

Specifically, this BATS research is tasked with quantifying the role of ocean-atmosphere coupling and climate variability on air-sea exchange of CO<sub>2</sub>, and in particular carbon export to the ocean interior for which a key question is determining nutrient regulation on upper ocean phytoplankton primary production rates. Historically, field experiments and modelling have suggested nitrogen and iron are the limiting elements for primary productivity though there is growing recognition that other macro- and micronutrients such as phosphate, silicic acid, zinc, cobalt, and vitamin B12 could also constrain the growth of phytoplankton, through co-limitations and secondary limitations. For this collaborative research at the BATS site, we employed two newly developed oceanographic capabilities for advancing the investigation of nutrient-phytoplankton interactions which are: (1) the detection of protein biomarkers by targeted metaproteomics and (2) large volume <em>in situ </em>sampling by a new vertical autonomous underwater vehicle <em>Clio</em>. Targeted metaproteomics is a new environmental method developed by the Saito laboratory (Woods Hole Institute of Oceanography, WHOI) that enables proteomic techniques to detect and quantitate protein biomarkers in complex environmental samples. The new vehicle <em>Clio </em>(Figure 1 from Breier et al., 2020, and Figure 2), also developed at WHOI represents a fully automated and high-throughput capability for collection of multiple large volume (100-300l) in-situ &nbsp;particulate samples during a single 12-14 hour deployment allowing for increased sampling resolution.</p>\n<p>For this project we have collected monthly proteomic samples from the upper 200m of the ocean at the BATS site since 2015 using conventional in-situ pumps attached to a cable and winch system, and successfully conducted the scientific validation of the AUV -Clio on three BATS expeditions in 2018 to investigate seasonal variability in phytoplankton nutrient stresses. Additionally, a transect from Bermuda - Woods Hole in June of 2019 was conducted to assess basin scale spatial distributions of protein biomarkers. For each BATS cruise Clio made 3 dives down to ~ 1000m while on the transect cruise Clio conducted 9 dives, completing two major objectives of its first ocean section of 1km depth across this transect, and successfully diving to a new depth maximum of 4100m.</p>\n<p>Synthesis efforts are ongoing though results so far from the proteomic samples have already given important insights into the biogeochemical processes occurring in the North Atlantic Subtropical oligotrophic gyre. In the euphotic zone (approximately 0-100m), a layering of nutrient stressors is evident, and that the seasonal deepening of the upper ocean thermocline is represented within the nitrogen and phosphorus transporters and element sparing systems, becoming more prevalent through the summer period. In contrast, within the chlorophyll maximum (typically at the base of the euphotic zone) iron stress proteins become increasingly pronounced, which is surprising given the relatively high iron input from dust deposition in this region of the Atlantic Ocean, but indicates isolation of the chlorophyll maximum from surface waters, particularly in the summer months. In addition, transporters for organic forms of nutrients (dissolved organic nitrogen and phosphorous) are seen within all of these profiles, implying these organic sources are key to the functioning of the upper ocean ecosystem at the BATS site. Together these results clearly imply a layering of multiple nutrient stressors, rather than model results that imply single nutrient limitation. Finally, Clio demonstrated its valuable ability to conduct high resolution sampling of the chlorophyll maximum at every 5m while holding depth to less than 10cm whereas a co-occurring wire-based pump deployment varied in depth range by more than 15m (Figure 3). The resulting metaproteomes from these high-resolution Clio samples were distinct, and able to clearly show dynamic transitions in the iron, nitrogen and phosphorous stress proteins at this important biological region, which is not possible with conventional methods.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This collaborative research has combined new chemical laboratory methods and novel oceanographic sampling platforms to make advances in chemical oceanography, such as, the discovery of the fine structure of adaptive phytoplankton responses to chemical gradients in the chlorophyll maxima, while leveraging the long-term BATS research efforts. The addition of these proteomic data to the BATS site, offers significant potential for specifically quantifying functional processes that regulate phytoplankton growth and ultimately upper ocean carbon export.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/01/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rodney&nbsp;Johnson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657885/1657885_10477254_1625164605525_AR2021_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657885/1657885_10477254_1625164605525_AR2021_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657885/1657885_10477254_1625164605525_AR2021_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">AUV Clio being prepared for deployment on the BIOS owned R/V Atlantic Explorer during a BATS cruise off Bermuda in 2018</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Paul Lethaby</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rodney&nbsp;Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657885/1657885_10477254_1625164411643_AR2021_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657885/1657885_10477254_1625164411643_AR2021_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"AUV Clio technical details\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657885/1657885_10477254_1625164411643_AR2021_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"AUV Clio technical details\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure1 illustrates the technical components of the AUV Clio (Breier et al., 2020)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">John Breier (Breier et al., 2020)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rodney&nbsp;Johnson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">AUV Clio technical details</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657885/1657885_10477254_1625165014440_AR2021_fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657885/1657885_10477254_1625165014440_AR2021_fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1657885/1657885_10477254_1625165014440_AR2021_fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Demonstration of Clio ability for  high resolution sampling in the deep chlorophyll maxima (DCM).
