 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Engineering Research Centers (ERC) Program of the National Science Foundation (NSF) is a premier example of successful government funding, serving as one of the flagship research programs over the past 30 years. It is unique in its size, scope, and impact on the culture of academic research and has demonstrated significant successes. Although the program is still vibrant and vigorous, many of the individuals involved in the origination and early development of the program and its centers are retired and/or rapidly becoming unavailable. Therefore, the goal of this RAPID project is to compile and document a detailed history of the ERC Program from the standpoint of lessons learned, best practices, achievements, successes and pitfalls, and the evolution of management policies to date. It will draw on multiple resources, including: archived documents, input from key participants in the ERC program (both inside and outside NSF), and the personal experience of the program's managerial team members. The project's PI and co-PI have been instrumentally involved with the program for a large portion of its existence, serving in the roles of the program's developer and leader (Preston) and as the communications specialist (Lewis).  \r\n\r\nThe project will provide a permanent record for faculty, students, industry, and practitioners regarding the management of university center programs. The history will have significantly broad impact in the U.S. and around the world, since the material will be organized in such a way as to be accessible to audiences ranging from engineering faculty and students to academic administrators and government officials, in addition to industry executives and research managers. The effort will result in a wiki-like, e-book in the form of a PDF document with a narrative spine and branching links to addition resource documents, such as: interview summaries, graphics, videos, and websites. The history will be made available and actively marketed to a large variety of academic researchers and administrators, as well as government and industry executives and program managers around the world. It will serve as a living resource to guide future participants in multidisciplinary research center programs to achieve maximum success and help strengthen the Nation's economic competitiveness.",
