 "awd_abstract_narration": "The potential impacts of rapid high-latitude ice sheet melting on sea level and oceanographic circulation in the coming several centuries are of increasing concern. There is evidence that the great ice sheets of the last glacial maximum did not melt at a uniform rate, but instead disintegrated most rapidly in one or two abrupt melting steps known as Meltwater Pulses 1A (MWP-1A; ~14,600-13,500 years BP) and 1B (MWP-1B; ~11,450 to 11,000 years BP). MWP-1A has been documented in several locations, but there remains controversy over whether deglacial MWP-1B existed and how much sea level rose across that time interval. Preliminary data from the Sulu Sea basin indicate that the subsurface ocean rapidly warmed and freshened during the several centuries of MWP-1B. These results suggest wide-spread oceanographic changes in the western Pacific but it is not known whether this change is related to sea level rise driven by melting ice or some other change in the ocean-climate system. This research will utilize the sediment archive in the Sulu Sea to further understand the origin of the ocean changes tied to the MWP-1B event and document whether similar events have occurred over the last 395,000 years, a period spanning three glacial-interglacial cycles. The product will be a new and unique reconstruction of thermocline conditions in Sulu Sea and sea level related ventilation history. Developing a better understanding of the ventilation history of the western tropical Pacific thermocline and the relationship to high-latitude ice sheet melting events will facilitate more accurate predictions about future changes. Broader impacts of the project include support for a Ph.D. student, incorporation of results into teaching, and continued practice of public outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThis project will reconstruct the timing of thermocline and deep basin ventilation events in the Sulu Sea in the western tropical Pacific using geochemical measurements of deep dwelling planktonic and benthic foraminifera. Earlier geochemical work on shallow dwelling foraminifera in the Sulu Sea has provided detailed records of millennial-scale surface ocean change over the last 395,000 years. Preliminary oxygen isotope data from the thermocline dwelling foraminifer Globorotalia tumida across the MWP-1B interval in a Sulu Sea sediment core indicates a larger decrease in delta-18O than in the surface dwelling species previously measured. This unexpected result raises the following questions: (1) is this evidence of glacial meltwater influx into the tropical Pacific thermocline or an Asian monsoon related signal at the same time as MWP-1B? (2) if this is an ice sheet meltwater signal, why is the response larger in the thermocline than at the surface? (3) is this change in thermocline properties at the time of MWP-1B related to pulses of rapid sea level rise or to changes in the western boundary current advection of surface and thermocline waters into the western Pacific? To address these and other questions this project will analyze delta-18O on G. tumida (calcifies ~160-200 m) at high resolution in samples from Sulu Sea sediment core MD97-2141 spanning the Holocene to Marine Isotope Stage 6 (~130,000 years BP), and across glacial-interglacial transitions back to ~395,000 years BP. These data will be paired with Mg/Ca measurements on selected intervals to isolate the water temperature contribution to measured changes in foraminifera delta-18O. The project will also utilize analyses of the planktonic foraminifera Globorotalia crassaformis that calcifies at ~700m and the benthic foraminifera Oridorsalis umbonatus to assess the timing of deeper ventilation events in the Sulu Sea.",

The Sulu Sea's unique silled bathymetry means that a relatively limited set of ocean current and sea level mechanisms control Sulu Sea thermocline variability. This project took advantage of the Sulu Sea setting coupled with the high sedimentation rates and reduced benthic faunal sediment mixing to address three main objectives:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.) We demonstrated that the North Equatorial Current and its bifurcation into the northward flowing Kuroshio Current (a major western boundary current) directly influence the Sulu Sea thermocline. Using this relationship and foraminiferal geochemistry, we generated a record of Sulu Sea subsurface salinity changes since the Last Glacial Maximum 20,000 years ago that that enables us to identify millennial scale variability in the North Equatorial and Kuroshio currents (see Weiss et al., 2021).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2.) We utilized older sediments in the Sulu Sea spanning 132,000 -26,000 years ago to reconstruct the sea level flooding history of the Karimata Strait during this critical and controversial period (see Figure 1). We determined that Sulu Sea surface salinity is strongly controlled by sea level. &nbsp;When past sea level is above the level -36 m (below present sea level) &nbsp;and the Karimata Strait is open, relatively fresh surface water from the South China Sea is syphoned away from the Sulu Sea, leaving the Sulu Sea surface relatively salty. When sea level is lower than ~36 m below present and the strait is closed, the relatively fresh water in the South China Sea preferentially enters the Sulu Sea lowering surface salinity. Our analysis of Sulu Sea foraminifera geochemistry reveals that the Sulu Sea surface was relatively fresh, and the Karimata Strait was closed during intermediate interglacial Marine Isotope Stage 3 (60,000-26,000 years ago). However, during more advanced interglacial stages 5a and 5c (117,000-72,000 years ago) the Sulu Sea surface was relatively salty, indicating that the Karimata Strait was open and demonstrating that sea level was several meters higher that previous estimates. Our Marine Isotope Stage 3 results place important new constraints on rate of sea level drop and ice volume build-up to the Last Glacial Maximum. They also show the Karimata Strait formed a land bridge that would have facilitated the first human and megafauna migration to Borneo ~40,000 years ago. The sea level aspect of the study is discussed in a manuscript submitted to the Journal Paleoceanography and Paleoclimatology (Weiss et al., in review).</p>\n<p>3.) We also investigated the timing and magnitude of millennial-scale changes in temperature and salinity at deglaciations prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. High-resolution records of glacial-interglacial transitions are critical to our understanding of ice sheet stability. The best studied millennial deglacial event was the Younger Dryas (12,000-11,600 years ago). The Younger Dryas was a brief return to glacial-like conditions that interrupted steady warming during the most recent deglaciation, but it?s origin remains the subject of debate as is the issue of whether the Younger Dryas was a one-off event or if Younger Dryas-like events occurred during any or all of the previous glacial-interglacial transitions. We generated surface and subsurface temperature and salinity reconstructions using foraminifera geochemistry spanning Terminations II (~136,000-128,000 years ago), III (~250,000-240,000 years ago), and IV (~344,000-334,000 years ago) to investigate whether the Younger Dryas-like events observed in the Sulu Sea surface during those intervals also affected the Sulu Sea subsurface.
