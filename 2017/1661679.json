 "awd_abstract_narration": "RELAMPAGO (Remote sensing of Electrification, Lightning, And Mesoscale/microscale Processes with Adaptive Ground Observations) is a study of extreme thunderstorms. It includes a field program to be conducted from 1 Nov to 15 Dec 2018 in west central Argentina, which is regarded as perhaps the world?s best natural laboratory for thunderstorm research. Cutting edge observations from mobile Doppler radar and other instruments will be collected and then analyzed to answer the very basic question of why the thunderstorms in this region are among the most intense in the world. RELAMPAGO will identify the mechanisms that trigger these thunderstorms and contribute to their violence. RELAMPAGO will also determine why these extreme storms are such prolific hail producers, but do not appear to generate many tornadoes. Understanding the initiation and evolution of thunderstorms and how they generate severe weather in Argentina will enable scientists to create better, and more general, theories about thunderstorms in the U.S.  This will lead to better forecasts of U.S. thunderstorms and their severe impacts, including hail and tornadoes, and reduce losses of life and property in the U.S. RELAMPAGO is a collaborative project with critical involvement from the University of Illinois, the Pennsylvania State University, University of Colorado, and the Center for Severe Weather Research.  Student participation will help shape the careers of the future generation of scientists, engineers and forecasters by equipping them with cutting edge skills and knowledge. \r\n\r\nRELAMPAGO is a study of extreme thunderstorms. It includes a field program to be conducted from 1 Nov to 15 Dec 2018 in west central Argentina. RELAMPAGO is motivated by satellite observations showing that the thunderstorms in this region are arguably the deepest and most intense in the world. The scarcity of available ground-based observations has kept open the question of why these thunderstorms are so intense. Thus, a novel set of targeted, integrated ground-based instrumentation, including mobile Doppler radars, radiosonde systems, and deployable meteorological sensors will be used to investigate the local environment in which these storms initiate and organize, and the internal storm processes that generate severe weather.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the extensive suite of RELAMPAGO observations and complementary numerical simulations will be used to determine the convective triggering mechanisms in this environment, and the properties of the regional orography and circulations that contribute to the extreme nature of these storms. Orographically modified environments will be related to the frequency of supercellular convection and its transition to mesoscale convective systems. A new understanding of how such environmental modifications enhance hail production will also be gained, as will an understanding of how (and when) the environments support severe-wind production but reduce the likelihood of tornadogenesis through stronger cold pool generation and reduction of low-level vertical wind shear. This research on extreme thunderstorms outside the U.S. will leverage the results from past U.S. projects, permitting a more general, and geographically unconstrained, understanding of such storms.  This will aid the development of conceptual and predictive models that can be used by forecasters in the U.S. and worldwide, mitigating future loss of life and property.",

Global hotspots for hailstorms include the U.S. Great Plains, and in northern Argentina, in the lee of the Andes. The latter region was the focus for the field phase of this research ? we traveled to the C?rdoba Province with scientific instruments to better understand the storms there, and how those storms and their environments are affected by the mountains. Our team?s main research focus was to better understand the fundamental nature of hailstorms, with specific goals of (i) ameliorating the documentation and characterization of hail and hailstorms, (ii) improving hailstorm forecasts, and (iii) refining radar-based hail detection and sizing.</p>\n<p>We made successful strides towards the first goal while in Argentina. This includes successfully implementing a drone survey of a hailswath, from which we photogrammetrically estimated the sizes of ~16,000 hailstones, an unprecedentedly large sample size. We documented several giant hailstones from the region, including using 3D infrared laser scanning to create a digital model of one &gt;4-inches stone. We assessed an historical hail event by applying photogrammetry to citizen-supplied videos, interviewing locals, and analyzing radar data. As a result, we documented the Southern Hemisphere?s official largest hailstone (7.1 inches; <strong>Image 1</strong>), photogrammetrically estimated the size of what may have been the world-record hailstone, and introduced a new class for hailstones exceeding 6 inches across, called ?gargantuan? hail.</p>\n<p>After our trip, we analyzed radar observations and environments of all known gargantuan hail storms and found that, while common measures of potential storm severity were similar in storms with smaller hail, there was evidence that gargantuan-hail-producing storms had unusually wide updrafts. We used a 3D-scanned hailstones dataset (including the one from Argentina) to quantify hailstone shapes, finding that hailstones? maximum dimensions are 20-40% larger than a sphere with the same volume as the actual hailstone.</p>\n<p>Towards the second goal, we developed a novel hail trajectory model to explore how different environments affect hail sizes. We found that when the wind speed increases with increasing height through midlevels of the atmosphere, the storms had wider updrafts. Wider updrafts lead to longer times hailstones can spend growing in their journey through the updraft, begetting larger sizes. Intriguingly, we found increasing wind speed with height in the lower atmosphere, despite also increasing updraft width, led to smaller hail. This is because increased horizontal winds in the updraft made hailstones? journeys too quick, limiting their sizes.</p>\n<p>A storm?s hail production evolves throughout its lifetime, including changes in maximum sizes by factors of 3-4, and 1-2 orders of magnitude changes in the amount of severe (&gt;1-inch) hailstones. We tied these hail size fluctuations to storm structural changes, including the updraft widening or narrowing, and shedding of clockwise-rotating vortices from the updraft flanks. Also, increasing the atmospheric instability ?fuel for a thunderstorm?s updraft ? does not lead to bigger hail. This surprising finding goes against conventional wisdom. Instead, there is an optimal middle-range of instability that maximized hail sizes. This resulted from competing effects: greater instability leads to wider updrafts (which tends to increase hail sizes), but also faster horizontal flow across the updraft (which tends to decrease hail sizes). <strong>Image 2</strong> shows a simulated hailstorm and a pathway taken by a large hailstone.</p>\n<p>Towards our third goal, we explored a novel radar analysis technique to identify and size hailstones using the unique capabilities of the dual-frequency Doppler on Wheels (DOW) and C-band on Wheels (COW) radars. We also used the 3D-scanned hailstone models to calculate what a radar would ?see? from realistic hailstones, for the first time. These calculations showed much greater variability in the simulated radar signal strength than what is often assumed in models and in radar-based hail size algorithms. We applied a technique known as spectral polarimetry at low radar elevation angles and found evidence of hailstones moving at different speeds and directions from raindrops, which may be important for how hailstones strike surfaces like rooves, and thus damage them. We also identified how a new class of hailstorms that produce large amounts of small hail (<strong>Image 3</strong>) can be unambiguously identified in polarimetric radar data. Finally, we used radar data collected in Argentina to document a prolific hailstorm, as well as the interaction of a storm complex with the mountainous terrain.</p>\n<p>Our results have already found their way into operational forecasts and warning decision making, in both the United States and abroad. The opportunity to study unique storms in a mountainous environment has led, in our opinion, to important steps towards our main objective of better understanding the nature of complex and damaging hailstorms.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/16/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Matthew&nbsp;R&nbsp;Kumjian</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1661679/1661679_10479801_1668637466981_Image1_Druetta--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1661679/1661679_10479801_1668637466981_Image1_Druetta--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The Southern Hemisphere record hailstone\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1661679/1661679_10479801_1668637466981_Image1_Druetta--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The Southern Hemisphere record hailstone\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photograph of a hailstone measuring 7.1 inches in maximum dimension.
