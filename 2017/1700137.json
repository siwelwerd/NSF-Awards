 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract:\r\nIn recent years interest is increasing in a class of emerging new materials called topological insulators (TI) displaying unexpected quantum properties at their surfaces/interfaces. This has led to vast advancement in quantum science, and with potential for future quantum devices that can be energy efficient for information storage and transmission. These new materials can carry current without dissipation and are capable of enhancing the performance in existing technology such as spintronics (used in computer data storage, communication and sensing). Another topology related phenomenon is a new type of quantum state called Majorana bound states (MBS) that can appear in TIs by combining materials with different physical phenomena (topology, superconductivity, magnetism), which may lead to future highly fault-tolerant quantum computing. In this project, students as well as young scientists acquire knowledge and train in many advanced areas, as well as push the frontiers of physics and material science. There is potential to lay the foundation for establishing energy efficient quantum electronics to revolutionize the future information technology. Instruments, patents and knowledge developed during this research would be made available to companies.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nThe demonstration of two-dimensional quantum coherent properties and unexpected stabilization of interfacial ferromagnetism to much higher temperatures in TI by proximity coupling to a ferromagnetic insulator, has prompted the investigation: i) to reach the occurrence of quantum coherent properties in a ferromagnetic TI at a higher temperatures, ii) the quantum behavior of spin polarized chiral current in TIs with proximity induced gap when hybridized with a magnetic insulator, and iii) probe unconventional superconducting pairing, the electron spin polarization and quantum coherence in the edge conduction channel of magnetic TI by tunneling spectroscopy. These goals are achievable based on our extensive previous related multidisciplinary knowledge with thin film heterostructure properties using state of the art molecular beam epitaxial system for film growth and measurement facilities, including atomic level characterization of interfaces utilizing the national facilities.  Education and training of students (including high school students summer programs) and young scientists in the areas dictated quantum coherent topology driven phenomena are planned under this program.",
