 "awd_abstract_narration": "Drought has long been a concern for the countries surrounding the Mediterranean, from the Iberian Peninsula to  Turkey on the north and from Morocco to Syria along the southern shore.  Much of the region experienced prolonged drying in the second half of the 20th century, and the recent turmoil in Syria follows a particularly acute drought in the Fertile Crescent.  Moreover, climate models are remarkably consistent in projecting a strong drying trend around the Mediterranean over the 21st century.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to understand the dynamical mechanisms that drive natural variability and forced change in precipitation and evaporation over the Mediterranean region.  The observational record is extended through the use of tree ring - based climate reconstructions to give long-term context to the drying of recent decades.  Other work considers the role of Mediterranean cyclones in regional precipitation variability, along with changes in cyclone behavior that may contribute to the future drying seen in climate models.  The role of jet stream shifts in future drying is examined using a linear stationary wave model and other diagnostic techniques.  A thorough moisture budget analysis is carried out using both observationally-based reanalysis products and climate model output.  Previous work shows that much of the hydroclimate variability in the Mediterranean is linked to the North Atlantic Oscillation, which involves a north-south shift of the Atlantic jet stream and storm track.  Preliminary work by the PIs suggests that this variability can be distinguished from aridity occurring as a consequence of a warming climate.  The work also includes an effort to develop probabilistic projections of Mediterranean hydroclimate that take into account the skill of models in simulating past variability.\r\n\r\nAs noted above, the work has great societal relevance due to the human impacts of widespread drying and the somewhat dire model projections of future Mediterranean aridity.  The projections are plausible given their consistency from one model to another, but an examination of the underlying the mechanisms, in the context of a long-term climate record, can do much to assess their validity.  The PIs engage with the Mediterranean climate and impacts communities through MedCLIVAR, a research coordination network which conducts activities including workshops, schools, and exchange programs focused on Mediterranean climate.  Closer to home, the project engages with undergraduate students through the Lamont Summer Intern Program and conducts outreach through the biannual Lamont Open House.  The project also provides support and training for a postdoctoral research scholar, thereby developing the workforce in this research area.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Mediterranean region - the Mediterranean Sea and the land to its north in Europe, south in North Africa and east in the Middle East ? is one for which climate models project a much drier and hotter future.  This is of great concern due to the specifics of the Mediterranean climate.  Like all the Mediterranean-type climate regions, precipitation is concentrated in the cool season while the summers are hot and dry.  On the poleward edge of the Hadley Cell and equatorward edge of the winter extratropical storm tracks, Mediterranean climates are highly variable influenced by both tropical and extratropical dynamics. These conditions make water resources stressed and variable and generate hazards in terms of drought, wildland fire and heat with important impacts on ecosystems and societies.  These characteristics also make it hard to disentangle human-driven climate change from natural variability: whether precipitation in the Mediterranean has already changed due to human activities remains contentious.  \n\nIn this project we improved understanding of the physical mechanisms of climate change and variability in the Mediterranean region using models, observations and long-term tree ring records.  The latter allows us to better understand natural variability and place the recent history of Mediterranean climate in a proper long-term perspective.  While most of the work focused specifically on the Mediterranean we also compared its climate history and mechanisms of variability and change with those of the world?s four other Mediterranean-type climate regions in the Americas, southern Africa and Australia.  \n\nWe made the case that the Mediterranean region ? and the world?s other Mediterranean-type climate regions ? are undergoing changes in cool season precipitation consistent with what climate models predict occur in response to rising greenhouse gases.  According to rain gauge data extending back to the early 20th century, the Mediterranean has been drying and the amount and spatial pattern of this are quite consistent with climate model predictions of human-driven climate change.  Climate models and observations also agree that the three southern hemisphere Mediterranean-type regions have been drying in winter due to rising greenhouse gases and also that California/west coast of North America has not been drying.  We showed that the strong drying of the Mediterranean is due to the development in response to rising greenhouse gases of a local high-pressure system while the drying of the southern hemisphere regions follows from Hadley Cell expansion and a poleward movement of the storm track.  \n\n In other work we have elucidated the mechanisms of winter precipitation variability in the Mediterranean and shown the importance of changes in the moisture transport by the mean flow relative to that by Mediterranean storm systems.  To aid the disentangling of natural variability and climate change we have also contrasted the hydrological mechanisms of precipitation changes associated with each and performed sophisticated statistical analyses to separate decadal timescale variability from forced change.   In terms of the mechanisms of precipitation change in response to rising greenhouse gases we have shown that the response of the stratospheric polar vortex plays an important role by driving tropospheric circulation change but that there is major disagreement across climate models in how the vortex responds. Other work has elucidated the connections between greenhouse gas-driven changes in circulation over Europe and the Mediterranean and those over the North Atlantic Ocean and the connection to changes in Atlantic sea surface temperatures. On the long-term timescale, this award contributed to the development of the new tree ring-based European Russia drought atlas which helps improve the centuries-long climate record in the northeast of the Mediterranean region.  We also produced the best validated tree-ring reconstruction of the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index extending back  to 910 CE and showed that it largely behaves like a ?white noise? process with intermittent band-limited power, suggesting that it is stochastically forced. Also using dendroclimatic records we showed that for most of the last millennium the leading mode of variability of growing season surface soil moisture was a monopole centered over the European Channel.  This mode contrasts with the leading mode in the past century which is a north-south dipole with a relation to the North Atlantic Oscillation.  Decadal to centennial timescale variations of the English Channel mode were responsible for a notable wetting of England, Wales, northern France, Benelux region in the late 19th century.  The dendroclimatic record was also used to characterize the tremendously wet climate of the Great Famine of 1315-17 which led to famine across much of northern and central Europe but not in the Mediterranean region which consistently was shown to have weak climate anomalies during the event.  We also have identified a potential role for solar driving of Medieval era climate anomalies in the Middle East.\n\nResults have been published in many papers and presented at conferences with the team helping organize sessions for the European Geophysical Union and MedCLIVAR conferences.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard Seager"
