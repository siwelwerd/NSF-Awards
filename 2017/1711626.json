 "awd_abstract_narration": "The electronics market is continuing to grow, as functionality of electronic circuits' increases for reduced cost, and the market expands into the developing world with mobile applications. The demand for overall computer and communication infrastructure is also increasing as a result. Electronics became a major driver of the global economy and increased quality of life with reduced device dimensions and integration of new materials and techniques. The recent advances in device technologies is enabling integration of large amount of high-speed data storage with logic circuits to construct computers on chip. If the memory access circuitry can be scaled down, the single-chip computer can significantly outperform the conventional computers in speed, power consumption, cost and size. One of the memory technologies that can enable integration of large data storage with logic circuits is phase change memory, which stores information in the highly resistive amorphous and conductive crystalline states of glassy materials as logic '1's and '0's. Phase change materials can also be used to make a family of multi-contact devices that complement conventional silicon electronics to reduce the area required for the logic circuits. The multi-contact phase change structures that are investigated in this study utilize thermal interactions in addition to electronic interactions to achieve the same or improved functionality at smaller area, reduced power and cost. The graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in device fabrication, characterization, simulations and modeling. The students involved with this project interact with industrial leaders to advance the field of phase change memory and will help transition this multi-contact phase change device technology to mass production. Minority students will be mentored through UConn Mentor Connection and Northeast Alliance program.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on fundamental studies on electro-thermal interactions and behavior of phase change materials that enable multi-contact logic devices, and design, fabrication and evaluation of these multi-contact devices as multiplexers, routers, counters, state machines and other logic units.  These devices offer speeds comparable to DRAM (dynamic random access memory) and non-volatile configurations at sufficiently low power levels for critical feature sizes < 50 nm. Pattern transfer technologies to achieve sub-50 nm critical features are now commonly available in silicon CMOS and some of the large-scale manufacturers have announced high density phase change memory products. Hence, the challenges related to integration of phase change memory with CMOS are practically resolved, and new device and circuit concepts that utilize this infrastructure can lead to significant impacts in a relatively short time. These multi-contact phase change devices can be manufactured along with conventional phase change memory arrays atop silicon CMOS to realize logic functions at a significantly reduced transistor count in the CMOS layer.",

In the recent years, 3D integration of electronic memories led to enormous storage capacity with substantially reduced cost, new processor architectures, and artificial neural network and artificial intelligence (AI) implementations dramatically improved performance and application space. The speed of typical data-heavy computations are still limited by memory access latencies between CPU / GPU and DRAM (dynamic random access memory), flash memory and magnetic drive. The emerging CMOS compatible resistive non-volatile memory (RRAM) technologies, such as phase change memory (PCM), conductive bridging RAM (CBRAM) and magnetic RAM (MRAM), offer the possibility of monolithic integration of processor and high-performance non-volatile memory. Such realization can eliminate the need for off-chip DRAM, hard drive and motherboard, leading to dramatic performance improvements. Among all RRAM, PCM is the most mature, and has been demonstrated in large volume production by leading semiconductor manufacturers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Phase change memory utilizes short electrical pulses to melt a very small volume, down to (~ 5 nm)<sup>3</sup>, to transition the material from its highly-conductive crystalline phase to its highly-resistive amorphous phase. The amorphized volume can be recrystallized by heating the material above its glass transition temperature using short electrical pulses. Typical PCM write / erase times are &lt; 1 micro second and reading prior to write/erase or block erase are not required. PCM cells offer ~10<sup>2</sup>-10<sup>4</sup>x resistance (R) contrast&nbsp;<sup>[29]</sup>&nbsp;in a highly desirable resistance range (k&#8486; to M&#8486;), 10<sup>8</sup>-10<sup>11</sup>&nbsp;endurance cycles, 10+ years data retention at CPU temperature, and can be used in high-temperature (e.g. automotive) and high-radiation (e.g. aerospace) applications as data is not stored as charge. In contrast, flash memory write / erase times are in the order of ~1 ms, can be cycled only ~10<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;times, requires block erase, and is sensitive to radiation and high-temperatures. With improved speed (write / erase times ~ 1ns) and endurance (~10<sup>15</sup>&nbsp;cycles), PCM can become a non-volatile alternative to DRAM. With multi-bit-per-cell storage, PCM can become a very high-speed alternative to 3D NAND flash.</p>\n<p>The ability to store multiple bits per cell reduces the per-bit cost for conventional non-volatile storage and allows implementation of PCM cells for AI hardware. However, there is a technical problem that needs to be resolved: Resistance drift of the high-resistance state, increase of the resistance of the highly-resistive amorphous state, lead to mixing of the bits in multi-bit-per-cell implementations.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit: In this project we investigated the electronic conduction mechanisms and resistance drift in amorphous GeSbTe (the most commonly used phase change material) from room temperature to cryogenic temperatures.&nbsp;Our experimental results show significant resistance drift at low temperatures (measured down to 80 K) and response of resistance drift to high-field stress and photoexcitation suggest an electronic origin to resistance drift, which makes mitigation of resistance drift a possibility within reach. We constructed electric-field and temperature dependent electronic transport models that can capture the electronic characteristics of the phase change materials and devices in the full range of operation.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts: Graduate and undergraduate students and high-school teachers were involved with this project that served as an excellent opportunity for training and education. Students learned how to design experiments, construct scientific instruments, collect and analyze data and construct models to interpret the results. At the beginning of the COVID-19 isolation period (Spring 2020), undergraduate students involved with our research activities (lead by electrical engineering undergraduate student Kevin Knowles) designed, constructed and tested pressure monitors that would be integrated with ventilators constructed at University of Connecticut for emergency deployment. After the isolation period, we returned to our laboratory and reinitiated the research and outreach activities through the support of this project.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/27/2023<br>\nModified by: Ali&nbsp;G&nbsp;Gokirmak</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1711626/1711626_10497333_1703729478141_IMG_4568--rgov-214x142.jpeg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1711626/1711626_10497333_1703729478141_IMG_4568--rgov-800width.jpeg\" title=\"David Blain (REU) discussing his model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1711626/1711626_10497333_1703729478141_IMG_4568--rgov-66x44.jpeg\" alt=\"David Blain (REU) discussing his model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">David Blain (REU 2019) worked on modeling of phase change materials and their interaction with electron beams.
