 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry supports an international meeting as part of the Chemical Sciences and Society Symposia (CS3). The CS3 convenes eminent high-level researchers from the US, UK, Japan, China and Germany to explore frontier chemistry research on diverse topics. The CS3 meeting in Dalian, China, September 4-7, 2017 will be on the topic \"Solar Energy and Photonics\". Previous meetings have been developed multilaterally through discussions of the chemical societies in each participating country (specifically with the American Chemical Society in the US). This series is intended to be of valuable to the global chemistry enterprise internationally as it attempts to foster work in trans-national teams, across scientific disciplines, and beyond institutional boundaries. The workshop proceedings are promoted and distributed to the global science and technology community and the general public through reports on the web. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, this workshop focuses on chemistry and its application for solar energy and photonics. Four subtopics are included 1) Photocatalysis for water splitting. 2) Photovoltaic materials with abundant elements. 3) Artificial photosynthesis for carbon dioxide reduction. 4) Photonic materials and photo-up conversion.",
