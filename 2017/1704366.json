 "awd_abstract_narration": "Robots are becoming integrated into more areas of life, no longer confined to the predictable environment of a factory, performing the same task. Robots that work among humans require greater intelligence and the ability to adapt to changing tasks in an unpredictable environment. This work develops a sophisticated control system for robotics by modeling the control systems in the brain of a remarkably intelligent, capable, and adaptable insect: the praying mantis. This work promises to transform our understanding of intelligence in both robotics and neuroscience. A model of decision-making in the relatively simple brains of insects advances the study of more complex brains. The model will then be used to allow a legged robot to adapt its movement to suit its goals such as assisting humans, or its \"needs\" such as seeking energy or avoiding danger. These advances seek to give robots the autonomy that animals have. Instead of being programmed for every possible situation, a robot could be trained, continue to learn from experience, and improve efficiency even in novel situations. At an after-school robotics program at an inner-city school, students will benefit from hands-on experience creating robots with the unique perspective of bio-inspired design and modeling of nervous systems.  \r\n\r\nThis work expands the scale and sophistication of a synthetic nervous system (SNS), a continuous time dynamical model of praying mantis nervous system, and applies it to robotic control. Multi-channel neural recording and stimulation techniques are revealing how insects simplify motor control by distributing computation throughout the nervous system. This project leverages these techniques to understand how the capability of the \"higher\" level (the brain, where sensory input is processed) is directly supported by intelligence in the \"lower\" level (ganglia that coordinate the legs). These data will be used to develop and implement an SNS to control the six-legged MantisBot, endowing it with online learning and intelligent autonomy. Neurobiology will inform this work in all three specific aims: 1) Investigate the lower-level intelligence of the mantis nervous system and use the results to increase the intelligence of MantisBot's low-level control networks; 2) Investigate the correlation between descending commands and behavior and use the results to develop a simplified brain (i.e. high-level controller) for MantisBot; and 3) Investigate the effect of conflicting visual inputs (e.g. simultaneous prey and predator) on descending commands, and use these findings to endow MantisBot with robust intelligence distributed throughout its SNS.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n The intelligence of animals is ultimately expressed through the movement of their bodies. We propose that intelligence emerges from the interaction between brains and bodies as animals modify their movements to suit their needs. We investigated this mind-body interaction through the predatory behaviors of praying mantises and dragonflies. These insects all hunt prey using either ambush or pursuit strategies, which require different types of movements to track, intercept, or chase prey. Some species change their strategy, pursuing prey when hungry and waiting to ambush prey when they are sated. We explored how intelligent hunting strategies emerge from the interaction between brain circuitry, hunger state, and the body.\r\n\n\n As a result of this work, we described how hunting behavior in a \"flexible\" species changes from pursuit to ambush as the animal becomes sated (Bertsch et al. 2019). The mantises respond with larger movements to prey, and react to prey further away when they are hungry, and transition to smaller movements to track prey near to them as they become sated. This transition can be experimentally evoked by injecting insulin, a hormone that circulates in the body after eating. We also recorded from neurons in the central complex of the mantis, and showed that they respond to prey position and distance, and produce output that directs the body to move to track and pursue prey (Wosnitza 2022). Together these results suggest a central location for integrating the location of a goal, the current needs of the animal, and the appropriate movements of the body in this context. We have extended this work to compare the anatomy of the central complex in both mantises and dragonflies that use different strategies to hunt prey.\r\n\n\n Brains adapt to intelligently control bodies, and bodies also adapt in many ways to further the survival of the animal. Many species of mantis that use the ambush strategy also have adaptations to resemble the bushes and grasses they are hiding in. We examined the grasping legs of these insects, and discovered that these species trade strength and capacity of their legs to resemble the sticks and leaves of their environment. This is an important extension of our central question; as brains and bodies evolve to use different strategies, they must often balance improvement in one area with deficits in others.\r\n\n\n A major goal of this work was training undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research. Students at Colby College we trained in behavior analysis, neural recording, micro-CT and confocal microscopy imaging, anatomical analysis, and many other methods. Students were involved in developing, implementing, trouble-shooting, and communicating their research. The P.I. also integrated the anatomical work into an undergraduate laboratory course. Students in this course learned techniques to image dragonfly brains, and methods of analyzing brain anatomy that are common to both insect and mammalian (including human) neuroscience.\r\n\n\n Students also took this research in new, and unpredictable directions. As an example, one student was trained on methods to record neural activity in insects, and became interested in how this technique was used in human neuroscience. This resulted in a publication using EEG recording to understand the effect of meditation training on the brain (Young et al. 2021).The experience students gained working on this project led them to further success in their careers: graduate study in neuroscience, psychology, and biomedical engineering; professional training in medical and dental schools; and working for companies applying neuroscience research to treat disorders.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/12/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JoshuaPMartin\n"
