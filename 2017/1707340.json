It is called a superfluid because it can flow with zero viscosity with no loss in energy. Once set flowing in a continuous channel, superfluid will never stop. This fascinating property is related to the fact that liquid helium enters a quantum state below 2.176 degrees Kelvin. Remarkably, recent experiments at the University of Massachusetts and Penn State found helium atoms can flow through solid helium samples like a superfluid. The Penn State team is measuring the flow rate of the helium atoms through solid helium samples of different densities, thicknesses, crystal orientations to understand the exact mechanism responsible for this phenomenon. The proposed experiments provide opportunities for postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students to receive the most rigorous trainings to be future scientists. The principal investigator and his students and post-docs are active participants in the full range of outreach activities sponsored by the Penn State Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (MRSEC) for K-12 students. These organized and coordinated outreach activities are far more effective than isolated individual efforts.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe solid helium samples are sandwiched between superfluid leads in the form of porous Vycor glass cylinders infused with superfluid helium. The mass flow is thought to be related to the motion of edge dislocations and/or the transport of helium atoms through the superfluid screw dislocations in solid helium samples. Mass flow experiments through the superfluid/solid helium/superfluid \"sandwiches' are in progress to test the veracity of the dislocation line model. Since dislocation lines are absent in solid helium grown inside highly porous silica aerogel, measurements in such solid samples provide a direct test on the necessity of dislocation lines for the phenomenon. Solid samples of different thicknesses ranging from 8 \u00b5m (where dislocation lines do not form a connected network) to a few mm are being studied to understand the effect of connectivity of the dislocation network. The dependence of crystal orientation is studied by affixing graphite crystals with their c-axis (which nucleates epitaxial growth of solid helium crystals) pointing either along or perpendicular to mass flow direction inside of the sample space. The mass flow through solid helium is driven by superfluid fountain pressure imposed across the samples. The flow rate as a function of temperature and the fountain pressure are measured to search for the boundary separating the dissipation-free and dissipative regions.",
