HPDC, the premier venue for presenting the latest research on the design, implementation, evaluation, and use of parallel and distributed systems for high performance and high end computing, will take place over the week of June 26th in Washington, DC. There will be:\r\n?\tA set of co-located full-day workshops with topics that include\r\no\tFault-Tolerance for HPC at Extreme Scale (FTXS)\r\no\tSoftware Engineering Methods for Parallel and High Performance Applications (SEM4HPC)\r\no\tThe Eighth Workshop on Scientific Cloud Computing (ScienceCloud)\r\no\tThe Seventh Interntional Workshop on Rontime and Operating Systems for Supercomputers (ROSS)\r\n?\tThe main conference on Wednesday, June 28th through Friday, June 30th. This is a single-track conference that will include keynotes, paper sessions, a poster session, a panel, and an industry/institutional session.\r\n\r\nStudent travel to conferences is important. This travel award will support students who would not otherwise be able to attend and provide the opportunity for them to interact with senior researchers in academia and industry.",
