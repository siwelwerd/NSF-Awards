 "awd_abstract_narration": "Big Science programs such as the International Space Station or the Large Hadron Collider expensive and their true worth is fully realized only after years or decades. The high cost of sustaining these programs often crowds out other scientific research.  To address this challenge, this project reviews mechanisms to gauge the future productivity of Big Science projects. The analysis will identify waypoint mechanisms and assess their predictive power. This research will give government agencies and the scientific community an overview of tools for understanding how best to evaluate and manage Big Science projects, thereby increasing the efficient use of public and private dollars to advance scientific progress. \r\n\r\nSurvey results of program directors at NSF, DOE, NASA, and NIH characterize current best-practices for making interim assessments of infrastructure-heavy research programs.  New candidate waypoints are developed, and tested by analyzing the scientific research supported by the International Space Station.  The quantitative analyses will control for a host of project-specific factors such as the sub-discipline of the research, the background and characteristics of the principal investigator, and the initial funding date to ascertain the degree to which candidate waypoints provide statistical rigor to predict the eventual attainment of valued outcomes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur research focuses on assessing the productivity of long-term programs that require large initial and ongoing investments of resources, but whose payoffs are uncertain and&mdash;even if eventually realized&mdash;lie far in the future.  Consider the International Space Station.  NASA describes the Station as a \"groundbreaking research platform,\" with \"innovative experiments\" aimed at \"extend[ing] results for the betterment of humanity.\"  Yet even this glowing description acknowledges \"we may not know what will be the most important discovery from the space station.\"  At the same time, ISS operations consume well over 2 billion dollars per year for the foreseeable future. What evidence is there to suggest that Station science is on the path to producing scientific discoveries and valuable commercial innovations?\n\nThe problem goes well beyond the space program, extending more broadly to all \"Big Science\" programs.  The enormous sums spent on these undertakings are often justified by predictions about their contributions to knowledge, the economy, or innovation.  At virtually any point in the lifecycle of a Big Science program, it is not easy to explain to the public or elected officials why the program is a compelling investment, given that the benefits will emerge only over time &ndash; if at all. The cost of Big Science projects can crowd out other worthy endeavors; moreover, the existence of Big Science assets&mdash;and the sunk costs they represent&mdash;generate a perverse incentive to fund projects that utilize these assets, regardless of concerns about their methods and goals.\n\nOur focus in the research is on how evaluators might use the intermediate outputs of scientific work-in-progress, such as publications, invention reports, or patents, to revise their judgements about the merits of a research project.  We refer to these measures as waypoints&mdash; intermediate steps on the path toward a desired outcome.  To identify the characteristics that might make certain waypoints particularly valuable, we develop a game-theoretic model of research assessment with two players, a principal investigator (PI) who wants to secure research funding for a project, and a program officer (PO) who wishes to maximizes the productivity of a portfolio of projects under their control.  PO must decide whether to fund (renew) PI?s project or fund an alternative project.  However, before PO makes their funding decision, they can choose a waypoint, observe whether or PI?s project has achieved this waypoint, and use this signal to update their beliefs about the project?s worthiness using Bayes? rule.  The analysis identifies the characteristics of waypoints that make them useful tools for assessment and to assess the tradeoff between waypoints that minimize the rate of false positives and those that minimize the probability of false negatives.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William T Bianco"
