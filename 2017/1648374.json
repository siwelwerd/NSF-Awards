 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be in the area of optical materials. Optical materials are widely used in applications such as eyeglasses, cameras, cell phones, fiber-optic cables etc. Novol aims to push the frontiers of innovation in optical material research by creating new polymers with a much better balance of optical properties relative to glass while being tough and lightweight. The goal is to provide significant improvement in vision quality for patients with ophthalmic disorders. Particular benefit could be seen in pediatric and hyperopic prescription markets where choices of lens materials are restricted due to greater demand on lens properties. Long term project goals will focus on making lower-cost and more efficient lens assemblies for imaging, diagnostics and surveillance applications. A parallel aim of the research is to reduce the environmental impact of existing optical polymers, which are often made from highly toxic materials. Commercial opportunity presented through this work will not only benefit the end users but also the lens manufacturers through its ability to utilize safe and bio-derived monomers like sugars for making a highly important category of materials in today?s markets.\r\n\r\nThe technical objectives in this Phase I research project are to demonstrate optical and mechanical advantages of a new class of polymers made from sugars. Sugars have versatile properties arising from their complex structures, presence of heteroatoms and multiple functional groups. This research aims to bring together principles of organic, polymer and biological chemistry to create a new type of highly transparent, strong and refractive polymers useful in many optical applications, including lenses. Recent innovation in optical materials has focused largely on increasing a singular lens property, refractive index, mainly to afford thinner lenses for prescription eyewear applications. Technical objectives of this work go beyond the need to create just high index optical polymers and focus on making polymers that balance high refractive index with other critical properties of optical materials such as low dispersion of light and desirable mechanical strength. Lens materials with such well-balanced properties are currently unknown and if created, will provide unique advantages for many commercial applications of lenses such as prescription eyewear, sports accessories, camera assemblies and device screens. Another technical objective of this effort will focus on co-polymerization of sugar derivatives with known synthetic polymers to improve the properties and bio-based content of existing polymers.",

Our work is directly applicable to the field of optometry for making corrective eyewear. Nearly 40% of the world&rsquo;s population today suffers from refractive errors and 30% is due to myopia. Myopic eyeglasses are generally thick on the edges and have limited field of view. Due to shortcomings of current plastic materials, patients observe poor peripheral vision in their eyeglasses which can severely interfere with routine tasks like driving, playing sports, performing benchwork, etc. Blur-reducing eyeglasses based on aspheric design currently cost 2-3x more than a standard pair of eyeglasses. World Health Organization estimates that uncorrected myopia, a leading cause of vision disability around the world, incurs costs of $200 billion in direct and indirect productivity loss annually. As myopia becomes an epidemic around the world due to growing population and onslaught of digital technology, demand for high-quality &amp; affordable eyeglasses will increase from 2 billion pairs in 2015 to 4 billion by 2030. Work performed as part of this SBIR Phase I grant serves to overcome technical gaps in current eyewear market by harnessing the unique structural properties of plant derived chemicals and the polymers made from these materials. Novol&rsquo;s revolutionary lens material provides an alternative that can minimize the issues of edge blurring in eyeglasses, while being light-weight, tough and cost-competitive. Combined benefits of Novol&rsquo;s bio-based lenses brings a first-of-a-kind plastic to eyewear market that is comparable to glass in its optical performance, without the obvious drawbacks of shattering and being heavy-weight. Besides eyewear, Novol&rsquo;s bio-based material can also be used to replace glass lenses in traditional and digital cameras to create a very high-quality, yet light-weight module for cellphone cameras.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/04/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Monica&nbsp;Bhatia</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1648374/1648374_10468689_1515089955511_lens1117--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1648374/1648374_10468689_1515089955511_lens1117--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Novol lens 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1648374/1648374_10468689_1515089955511_lens1117--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Novol lens 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image of bio-based lens made by Novol</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Novol Inc</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Monica&nbsp;Bhatia</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Novol lens 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1648374/1648374_10468689_1515089895041_Lens--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1648374/1648374_10468689_1515089895041_Lens--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Novol lens 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1648374/1648374_10468689_1515089895041_Lens--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Novol lens 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image of bio-based lens made by Novol</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Novol Inc.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Monica&nbsp;Bhatia</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Novol lens 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1648374/1648374_10468689_1515090080743_lens5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1648374/1648374_10468689_1515090080743_lens5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Novol lens 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1648374/1648374_10468689_1515090080743_lens5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Novol lens 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Image of Novol's bio-based lens</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Novol Inc</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Monica&nbsp;Bhatia</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Novol lens 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
