It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.\r\n\r\nThe Program recommends an award of  $91,780 for the purchase of the following:\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n1)\tSEAL 408 accessory equipment\t$60,218\t\r\n2)\tScience system IT upgrades\t$31,562\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t$91,780",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFunds from this award were used to improve our towed multi-channel seismic (MCS) system and several elements of the IT infrastructure that support data collection on the R/V Marcus Langseth.   The R/V Marcus Langseth (Langseth) is owned by the National Science Foundation and is operated by Columbia University within the U.S. Academic Research Fleet (ARF) as the National Facility for Seismic Imaging.  The vessel has unique capabilities to carry out both long-offset two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) MCS projects for the U.S. research community.\n\nThe Langseth marine seismic equipment includes components called Reduced Velocity Interface Modules (RVIM) that are critical part of our marine seismic data collection. These RVIM modules are vital because they significantly reduce tow-induced hydrophone streamer electronic noise. When towing streamers &gt;10km long behind the Langseth  especially for  two-dimensional (2-D) seismic imaging.   Lowering noise on streamers improves the data collected and ultimately results in better seismic imaging.\n\nThe Langseth maintains a significant array of IT equipment that supports seismic and other science systems onboard.  The IT system benefited from replacement of 3 existing workstations, 3 laptops, and 3 uninterrupted power supply units (UPS). These workstations support data collection from Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP), the navigation and positioning system, and the source controller for operates our acoustic source for marine seismic system. The laptops support both the technical team and data collection onboard Langseth.  All of this new equipment will replace out of date equipment as well as provide for back up power as required.\n\nTwo other rack-mounted electronics packages allows technical team to  expand Langseth's network capabilities onboard and significantly improve data handling on the vessel.  Moving terabytes of data that are routinely collected on each project around efficiently  for both storage and archiving as well as scientist access while at sea is a key task for technical personnel.   \n\nThis array of upgraded equipment improves our oveall ability to collect cleaner seismic data, acquire other data more routinely and store and make it more available more effectively. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/05/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sean M Higgins"
