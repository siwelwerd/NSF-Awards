 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to understand how the Earth responds to a cryospheric mass imbalance on\r\na time scale of centuries in a compact, well-monitored region of Patagonia, a region of complex Neogene ridge subduction and youthful volcanism. The problem of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is an important problem and critical to understanding the viscosity and time-scales of deformation in the upper mantle. The PI team will try to quantify and model the isostatic response to ice and sediment loading and unloading.   A primary driver of modern rock uplift beneath and surrounding the Southern Patagonia Icefield (SPI) is interpreted to be ice loss following the peak advances of the Little Ice Age (LIA). Recent geodetic studies reveal remarkably rapid uplift rates (up to 40 mm/yr and averaging ~20 mm/yr around the SPI). These rates are the fastest modern geologic uplift rates; ones that demand a low viscosity mantle. In Patagonia, the presence of a somewhat poorly understood slab window that developed during Late Cenozoic time supports speculation that a low-viscosity zone underlies the region where GIA is very\r\nrapid.\r\n\r\nThis team will explore the causes of high rates and spatial-temporal pattern of the inferred GIA using: (1) a regional broadband seismological array to delineate the crustal and upper mantle structure and viscosity and observe seismicity (currently undefined) along the subducting Austral slab; (2) shipboard reflection seismic data and sediment cores to image and date the young pro- and subglacial sediments deposited in the glacial troughs (now fiord-like lakes) carved by advancing ice with a goal of defining both the geometry of ice and volume of deposited sediment through time; (3) new mapping and dating of the subaerial morainal sequence to define the time-varying spatial geometry of the SPI along its two largest outlet glaciers; and (4) improved geophysical models of glacier and solid earth responses.",

This requires an understanding of the structure of the crust and upper mantle beneath the SPI, since this controls the elastic response and viscous flow in the solid earth that accompanies ice mass loss. We constrained these parameters by installing and operating a network of 27 broadband seismographs throughout much of southern Chilean and Argentinian Patagonia from November 2018 to February 2021. The results of the seismic analysis shows low upper mantle seismic velocities and very thin rigid lithosphere that coincides with a gap in the subducting plate beneath Patagonia. The gap in subduction has enabled hotter, less viscous mantle material to flow underneath the region. The low viscosity mantle allows rapid response to the loss of ice in recent decades, leading to extremely rapid uplift of the SPI region, as observed in recent geodetic studies. Using the seismic structure, we derive an estimate of the three-dimensional variation of mantle viscosity beneath Southern Patagonia (figure 1). This estimate is being used by other investigators to reconcile geodetic uplift measurements with estimates of ice mass loss.\n\n\n The directional dependence of seismic velocity, termed seismic anisotropy, allows us to study the crystalline fabric of the mantle that results from deformation due to mantle flow at depth. We use S-wave measurements of seismic anisotropy beneath the seismic stations to infer the directions of mantle flow. We find that mantle material flows eastward in a warm, low viscosity shallow mantle channel, through the gap in subduction, from below the Chile Rise spreading center under the South American continent (figure 2). This mantle flow thermally and mechanically erodes the lithosphere and feeds the region of hot mantle beneath the SPI. \n\n\n The deployment of 27 seismic stations also allows us to study the local seismicity and infer the stress distribution in a region undergoing rapid deglaciation. Most of the local seismicity is within the upper 25 km of the earth and located near the SPI. Earthquakes to the east of the SPI show compressional faulting, whereas earthquakes beneath the SPI and to the west show a complex pattern, with mostly strike-slip and normal faulting. Very few earthquakes occur near the subduction megathrust plate boundary to the west. We attribute these observations to stress fields induced by the rapid deglaciation and uplift of the SPI region. In addition, we interpret the lack of seismicity in the subduction megathrust as indicating that the plate boundary may be locked, with stresses building up to a major earthquake in the future.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/23/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DouglasAWiens\n"
