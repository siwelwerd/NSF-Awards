U.S. undergraduate and graduate students from University of Texas at El Paso will work with Mexican researchers at the University of Guadalajara Smart Cities Living Lab on interdisciplinary projects involving computer science, civil engineering, and neuroscience.  These projects will focus on creating sustainable and resilient infrastructure and services for city residents.  \r\n\r\nThe research will focus on sensor data management, data analytics, and multi-modal optimization.  Students will develop innovative solutions for smart mobility and smart buildings related to scalability, modularity, interoperability and relevant Smart Cities services, resilience, and security.  Students will also have access to a smart city testbed equipped with cutting-edge technology at the University of Guadalajara in Mexico.",
