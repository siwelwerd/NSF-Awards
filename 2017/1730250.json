 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a training program for cross-training of participants, including graduate students, postdocs, as well as junior faculty, from three disciplines (Computing, Mathematics, and Atmospheric Sciences) to foster multidisciplinary research and education using advanced cyberinfrastructure (CI) resources and techniques.  The training focus will be Atmospheric Sciences topics that require knowledge and skills of high performance computing (HPC) and Big Data.  The impacts of this \"Data + Computing + Atmospheric Sciences\" training program include 1) prepare a better scientific workforce for advanced CI; 2) broaden CI adoption and accessibility for trainees recruited nationwide; 3) complement curricular offerings through multidisciplinary research training and team-based projects.  The project, thus, serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission, by promoting the progress of science and advancing the national prosperity and welfare.\r\n\r\nThe training program will focus on modeling and analysis of atmospheric radiation budget.  Clouds play an important role in Earth's climate system, particularly its radiative energy budget.  New technical advances of cloud simulation in numerical global climate models (GCM) usually come with high computational cost, which makes HPC an indispensable tool.  The advances of satellite-based remote sensing techniques have made a significant change in our way to observe the state of the atmosphere and evaluate GCM, and have led to growing amount of large datasets.  Because of these advances and changes, more than ever, HPC and Big Data have become parts of essential knowledge and skills to tackle some of the most challenging questions in Atmospheric Sciences.  The project will conduct cross-training of participants on a wide range of levels, including graduate students, postdocs, as well as junior faculty from the areas of Computing, Applied Mathematics, and Atmospheric Sciences.  The goal of the project is to foster multidisciplinary workforce development and collaboration using advanced CI resources and techniques.  The training program includes 1) customized course design for three disciplines with commonalities and differences; 2) online instruction on selected topics in HPC, Big Data, Applied Mathematics, and Atmospheric Sciences; 3) faculty-assisted team-based research projects.",

Numerous studies have indicated that El Nino and the southern oscillation (ENSO) could have determinant impacts on remote weather and climate using the conventional correlation-based methods, which however, cannot identify the cause-and-effect of such linkage, and ultimately determine a direction of causality. This study employs the vector auto-regressive (VAR) model estimation method with the long-term observational sea surface temperature (SST) data and the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data to demonstrate the Granger causality between ENSO and other climate attributes. Results showed that ENSO as the modulating factor can result in abnormal surface temperature, pressure, precipitation and wind circulation remotely, not vice versa. We also carry out the global climate model sensitivity simulations using the parallel computing techniques to double confirm the causality relations between ENSO and abnormal events in remote regions. Our statistical and climate model-based analyses may enrich our current understanding on the occurrences of extreme events worldwide caused by different ENSO strengths through teleconnections.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>3. In collaboration with Dr. Pubu Ciren at NOAA, Team 5 of our 2019 cohort conducted research on machine learning based algorithms for global dust aerosol detection from satellite images. This study developed five different machine-learning (ML) based algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest (RF), Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to identify dust aerosols in the daytime satellite images from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) under cloud-free conditions on a global scale. In order to train the ML algorithms, we collocated the state-of-the-art dust detection product from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) with the VIIRS observations along the CALIOP track. The 16 VIIRS M-band observations are used as the predictor variables. The validation and comparison results based on the collocated CALIOP data indicate that the FFNN method based on all available predictor variables is the best performing one among all methods. When applied to off-track VIIRS pixels, the FFNN method retrieves geographical distributions of dust that are in good agreement with on-track results as well as CALIOP statistics. For further evaluation, we compared our results based on the ML algorithms to NOAA's Aerosol Detection Product (ADP), which is a product that classifies dust, smoke, and ash using physical-based methods. Overall, this study demonstrates the great potential of ML methods for dust detection and proves that these methods can be trained on the CALIOP track and then applied to the whole granule of VIIRS data.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>4. Team 8 of our 2020 cohort studies the use of machine learning in severe weather forecasting has recently garnered interest, with current efforts mainly utilizing ground weather radar observations. They investigate machine learning techniques to discriminate between nontornadic and tornadic storms solely relying on the Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) sounding data that represent the pre-storm atmospheric conditions. This approach aims to provide for early warnings of tornadic storms, before they form and are detectable by weather radar observations. Two machine learning methods tested in the project are Random Forest (RF) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The higher accuracy in the RF and CNN models for the majority class of nontornadic supercells suggests that the imbalanced dataset is a meaningful contributor to the lower accuracy for tornadic storms. After applying the simple method of randomly undersampling (oversampling) the majority (minority) class, the accuracies of significantly tornadic class prediction of RF and CNN are enhanced to 65.85% and 36.01%, respectively.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/22/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jianwu&nbsp;Wang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730250/1730250_10503982_1640180590376_image1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730250/1730250_10503982_1640180590376_image1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Group photo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730250/1730250_10503982_1640180590376_image1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Group photo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Group photo of the 6 REU Supplement funded UMBC undergraduate students, the 4 graduate assistants, and 4 faculty in the 2020 program.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jianwu Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jianwu&nbsp;Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Group photo</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730250/1730250_10503982_1640180652346_image2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730250/1730250_10503982_1640180652346_image2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Climate Causality Analysis\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730250/1730250_10503982_1640180652346_image2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Climate Causality Analysis\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Granger causality analysis shows ENSO causes change in surface air temperature (Ts) on the global scale, not vice versa.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hua Song</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jianwu&nbsp;Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Climate Causality Analysis</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730250/1730250_10503982_1640181371697_image4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730250/1730250_10503982_1640181371697_image4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Deep Learning based Tornado Prediction\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730250/1730250_10503982_1640181371697_image4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Deep Learning based Tornado Prediction\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Feature importance scores and variable contributions from Random Forest model without pressure variable for our deep learning based tornado prediction</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Brice Coffer</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jianwu&nbsp;Wang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Deep Learning based Tornado Prediction</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730250/1730250_10503982_1640182024691_image3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730250/1730250_10503982_1640182024691_image3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Deep learning based global dust aerosol detection\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1730250/1730250_10503982_1640182024691_image3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Deep learning based global dust aerosol detection\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a,b) Distribution of clear sky and dust over land and ocean, for both training and testing data.
