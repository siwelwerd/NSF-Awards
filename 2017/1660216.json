 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to develop an innovative approach to improve and sustain math educators' problem solving teaching skills. Despite the expectations placed on math teachers by the Common Core State Standards, most are insufficiently prepared to teach students how to become critical thinkers. Much of this problem is due to limited pedagogical skills of teachers in providing adequate problem solving instruction and supports on top of teachers' own limited problem solving skills. This project remedies this with its integrated modules and powerful analytics engine that suggests learning pathways for both expert and novice teachers. They anchor their research in National Council of Teacher's of Mathematics Principles to Action. It will help teachers develop confidence and skills in planning and evaluating their lessons, as well as understanding student misconceptions and intervening in a timely manner. Teachers who approach problem solving with confidence inspire students to approach difficult math tasks the same way. This has great implications for how many students will continue to enroll in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math programs. In addition, the project sets the stage for educators to develop 21st Century skills including critical thinking, communication and collaboration - essential job skills for the young minds they mentor.\r\n\r\nThis effort refines and scales up their product, which is a web and mobile application that works seamlessly in conjunction with our current student-facing platform, to provide teachers with timely supports for improving students' problem-solving skills and math communication. This project will deliver professional development continuously and in-context using virtual peers, rich rubrics, interactive tools and actionable data. The analytics engine leverages adaptive learning models in order to build robust modules. The Data Collector Layer will contain interfaces for users to get recommendations, receive user feedback and provide other analysis reports. The Analytics Core Layer will be implemented using a collection of machine learning algorithms. The Service Layer will calculate recommendations based on user profile, user feedback, pre-stored best practices and other use cases. The Persistence Layer will store and get calculated data to recommendation engine's own database. The company plans to conduct several formative evaluations during the course of the project, as well as two pilot studies at the end of each year with a control and experiment group. The results will enable them to determine the effectiveness of ongoing, just-in-time supports for improving teachers' skills and confidence inside and outside the classroom.",

In working towards realizing those goals, the purpose of this project was to support teachers in effectively teaching mathematics through problem solving by coupling the use of a scaffolded problem solving application, CueTeach, with intentionally curated learning materials and embedded features aimed at supporting teachers in the moment. These embedded features included the Content Module (improved ways to create and access rich tasks), the Assessment Module (smart tools for visibility into student data), Best Practice Module (features for effective implementation) and the Coaching Module (professional learning support). The goal of this project was to determine the degree to which teachers' engagement with CueTeach influenced their instruction, as defined by essential teaching practices (NCTM, 2014).</p>\n<p>This study followed a multiple case study design that included 7 participating teachers, and was broken into three phases. In Phase 1, participants continued with \"instruction as usual,\" and did not have access to the learning materials or CueTeach. In Phases 2 and 3, participants were given access to CueTeach and were encouraged to use it with students approximately two times per month. During these phases, data was collected from monthly surveys on teachers' engagement and learning from the learning materials, CueTeach usage data, and one recorded video and interview per phase. Changes for each research question are summarized below.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Question 1: How did CueTeach influence the tasks teachers select for instruction?</strong></p>\n<p>Changes in task selection were noted for six out of the seven teachers. All noted changes resulted in increased alignment of problems and/or rationales with the NCTM (2014) teaching practices. These changes included increases in teachers using rigorous or open-ended problems with multiple solutions or pathways, allowing for sensemaking, and/or creating opportunities for students to talk about their thinking.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Question 2: How did CueTeach influence the ways in which teachers elicit or share evidence of student thinking?</strong></p>\n<p>Five of the seven teachers in the study exhibited shifts in how they elicited student thinking. These shifts primarily included providing additional avenues for students to share their thinking (e.g., through turn and talks), or shifting the questions being asked from gathering information or funneling student thinking, to eliciting or examining student thinking.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Question 3: How did CueTeach influence the ways in which teachers facilitate meaningful mathematical discourse?</strong></p>\n<p>Data from the study suggested that five of the seven teachers exhibited shits in their classroom discourse as a result of the product. For these five teachers, shifts included more opportunities for students to talk, explicit instruction or questions aimed at encouraging student discourse, and increased appreciation of student discourse. Teachers attributed these changes to seeing the value of student thinking/what students were capable of through the use of CueTeach, and to the use of product taking away barriers to enactment (e.g., by scaffolding for language disabilities) or supporting enactment through the learning materials.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Question 4: How did CueTeach influence the ways in which teachers pose purposeful questions?</strong></p>\n<p>Data from all seven teachers suggested shifts in the questions that teachers posed, with nearly all teachers beginning to ask questions to make student thinking more visible or to facilitate student discourse. At the end of the study, the teachers also tended to ask fewer questions aimed at gathering information or funneling student thinking. For six of these teachers, this consisted of asking students about their thinking, their ideas, what they noticed or wondered, or asking questions to encourage students to engage with the ideas of their peers. The remaining teacher increased the number of open-ended questions they asked, causing students to respond with more robust answers.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Question 5: How did CueTeach influence the ways teachers envision classroom instruction related to problem solving?</strong></p>\n<p>Changes in classroom instruction were noted in six out of the seven teachers. Observed changes included teachers emphasizing sensemaking and deemphasizing or eliminating the use of keyword strategies, which are often cited as ineffective in research studies and are in contradiction to the NCTM (2014) effective teaching practices. Additionally, teachers began to value the thinking involved in problem solving, with some teachers being more explicit in modeling their own thinking, while others began to create opportunities for students to do more of the thinking and explaining.</p>\n<p>Cross teacher analyses suggest that all teachers shifted their instruction in one or more categories. Notably, the most change was seen in the ways that teachers expressed their value of student thought, or allowed students to share and discuss their thinking. Moreover, changes in these categories appeared to impact other areas, such as the problems that teachers selected, the ways in which teachers unpacked problems, and general patterns of instruction.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/21/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sheela&nbsp;Sethuraman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1660216/1660216_10477102_1658428398300_ClassProgress1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1660216/1660216_10477102_1658428398300_ClassProgress1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Class Reports\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1660216/1660216_10477102_1658428398300_ClassProgress1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Class Reports\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screenshot of the Class Progress interface where teachers can view how the students are progressing through the problem-solving experience.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CueThink Inc</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sheela&nbsp;Sethuraman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Class Reports</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1660216/1660216_10477102_1658428166034_NewProblem1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1660216/1660216_10477102_1658428166034_NewProblem1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"New Problem Creation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1660216/1660216_10477102_1658428166034_NewProblem1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"New Problem Creation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Screenshot showing interface where teachers can create their own task to assign to the class.
