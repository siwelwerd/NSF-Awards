 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Research Training Group (RTG) in Number Theory and Arithmetic Geometry at UC Berkeley will establish a number of activities involving researchers at all career stages ranging from undergraduates to senior faculty.  The guiding aim is to create a research group based approach to the training of students and postdocs, enabling them to take full advantage of the wide expertise and experience of each other and the senior faculty, and to provide access for undergraduates to the research of the group and to mentor students planning to pursue related advanced degrees.  The RTG will provide a unifying structure for the development of researchers and to foster collaborations. Activities of the RTG include research workshops, new research seminars, undergraduate conferences, and undergraduate mentoring. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe research expertise of the faculty affiliated with the RTG covers a wide range of topics in number theory and arithmetic geometry, as well as several related fields such as algebraic geometry, representation theory, and logic.  The research conducted as part of this award will include work on automorphic forms, Arakelov geometry, Shimura varieties, Langlands correspondence, p-adic cohomology theories, motives, algebraic dynamics, and log geometry. The project activities will integrate the many research activities of the participants into a coherent research group fostering further collaborations and more extensive training.",
