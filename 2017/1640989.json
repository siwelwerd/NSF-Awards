 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims at advancing a new approach to explaining formation of small-scale horizontal structure in the shear and buoyancy fields of stratified turbulence in the atmosphere based on direct solution of the statistical state dynamics (SSD) equations. Direct solution of the SSD equations is a new approach to investigating the dynamics of turbulent flows that makes accessible to study mechanisms and phenomena in the dynamics that are inaccessible to analysis based on simulations of individual turbulent state realizations or on statistical mean quantities obtained by averaging ensembles of individual turbulent state realizations.  Illustrative of such a mechanism is the cooperative instability of turbulence/mean-flow interaction that results in small scale shear and buoyancy layering in the stratified turbulence of both the atmosphere and ocean. This layering instability arises as an analytic bifurcation in the SSD of stratified turbulence while having no analytic counterpart in the dynamics of realizations, although the same layering phenomenon is seen in both SSD and realizations. In this research, SSD will be extended to obtain a theory for the spontaneous emergence of layering in the shear and buoyancy fields of stratified turbulence. The goal is to use SSD to understand the mechanism by which coherent layered structures are formed, maintained and equilibrated by interaction between the incoherent turbulence and the coherent layered structures.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe SSD method constitutes a conceptual as well as methodological advance in understanding turbulence in planetary atmospheres. By directly solving the statistical equations for the turbulent state dynamics the underlying coherent structures together with their associated incoherent eddy fields are obtained explicitly allowing e.g. analytic prediction of shear and buoyancy layer formation and of the sensitivity of the layer structure and its associated turbulent fluxes to changes in system parameters. Direct solution of the SSD equations reveals that shear/buoyancy layering and the associated turbulence is supported as a novel dynamical state in which coherent layered structures interact in a synergistic manner with small-scale turbulence to produce emergent layering instabilities leading to finite amplitude coherent equilibria in the shear/buoyancy/turbulence fields. The SSD approach allows exploration of these new cooperative dynamical regimes by providing analytic and numerical methods for obtaining turbulent statistical equilibria directly from the SSD of the turbulence.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nSSD allows analytical exploration of mechanisms by which coherent components of turbulence interact with incoherent components synergistically to produce emergent dynamical phenomena.  The concepts and methods being developed are widely applicable to deepening understanding of turbulence in a wide variety of physical systems including mechanisms underlying formation and maintenance of coherent structures and regulation of turbulent transport in the atmosphere at all scales from the planetary to the boundary layer. SSD is broadly applicable to the study of a new class of emergent instabilities which are essentially related to mean flow/turbulence interaction but unrelated to laminar flow instability. Among other applications, this instability concept provides an explanation for the phenomenon of abrupt reorganization of atmospheric turbulence as a function of parameter change. Using SSD insight can be gained into the role of eddy fluxes in determining the climate response to boundary forcing (such as SST variation during ENSO events). This capability is important because the direct response to e.g. boundary condition changes can be small compared to the indirect effect brought about by subsequent changes induced in eddy statistics. SSD constitutes a general theory of turbulence in shear flow and among the broader impacts of this work are its application to turbulent phenomena in other physical contexts including plasma turbulence, the turbulence of wall-bounded shear flows and MHD turbulence. The broader impacts of this work also include support of a graduate student in atmospheric dynamics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe turbulent atmosphere is commonly observed to be horizontally layered in density and velocity.  This layering occurs spontaneously and the immediate goal of this work was to explain why and how this phenomenon occurs.  The broader goal was foundational: to advance a theoretical approach to understanding turbulence based on analyzing the dynamics of the statistical state of the turbulence directly rather than pursuing the traditional approach of analyzing turbulence through the lens of the dynamics of individual realizations of turbulent states. This goal was pursued by formulating, analyzing and simulating equations governing evolution of the statistical state of turbulence in stratified shear flow expressed using the second moments of the velocity and buoyancy state variables.    Analysis of the statistical state dynamics (SSD) of turbulence in atmospheric shear flow provided us with novel methods for simulating turbulence and new conceptual perspectives on the dynamics underlying the turbulence.  This new perspective makes accessible to study mechanisms and phenomena in the dynamics of turbulence that are inaccessible to analysis based on simulations of individual turbulent state realizations or on estimation of statistical quantities obtained by temporal, spatial or ensemble averaging of individual turbulent state realizations.   The underlying reason that SSD provides insights not otherwise available using traditional methods is that turbulent states in stratified shear flows are established and maintained by interaction between coherent and incoherent components of the turbulent velocity and buoyancy fields which are separated in the SSD formulation while these are not separated when expressing the dynamics for individual\nrealizations of turbulence.  Illustrative of  such a mechanism inaccessible to analytical understanding except by solution of the SSD equations is the instability arising from turbulence/mean-flow interaction that gives rise to spontaneous emergence of shear and buoyancy layering in stratified turbulence.  Although the velocity and buoyancy layering phenomenon is clearly evident both in observations and in simulations of turbulent stratified shear flows, analytical expression of the underlying instability giving rise to velocity/buoyancy layering is contained only in the SSD formulation and not in the equations for the evolution of individual states.  The reason for this is that the underlying coherent structure forming instability is by its nature an instability of cooperative interaction between the statistical mean flow (first cumulant) and the fluxes of momentum and buoyancy (second cumulant) and its expression therefore requires capturing the dynamics of this interaction between essentially statistical quantities which requires formulating the dynamics in statistical variables.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/26/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian F Farrell"
