 "awd_abstract_narration": "EAGER: MOCVD Growth of a new wide-bandgap oxide semiconductor for Transistor Applications\r\n\r\nAbstract\r\nNontechnical: Ga2O3 is a new wide-bandgap oxide semiconductor material which is anticipated to allow a 10 to 100x improvement in transistor power density over current high performance silicon carbide transistors.  The development of Ga2O3 for transistor applications will allow an unprecedented level of performance in applications that require high total continuous-wave power and efficiency. Solidstate lighting and solar energy harvesting are two areas that will directly benefit from the development of this technology.  High power density transistors are used to efficiently convert the direct current (DC) voltage generated by solar panels into alternating current (AC) power that can be feed into the existing grid.  Similarly, high power density transistors are used to control the DC current used to drive the light emitting diodes using in solid state lighting.  There are also applications for very these high power density transistors in the direct current (DC) power transmission lines that join different electrical grids across the globe.   In order to achieve these results the proposed fundamental study of (Al,In,Ga)2O3 materials for transistor applications is highly needed.    \r\n\r\nTechnical: The objective of this proposal is to study the metal organic chemical vapor deposition growth of \u00e2-Ga2O3 and related compounds such as \u00e2-(AlxGa1-x)2O3, \u00e2-(InxGa1-x)2O3, and \u00e2-(AlxInyGa1-x-y)2O3. This group has extensive experience in the growth of III-Nitrides'a similar wide bandgap material system and has recently shown promising results by applying that experience to the growth of Ga2O3.  We are proposing to undertake a 2 year comprehensive study of the material growth.  In addition to this fundamental study we will also apply the material improvements to the development of transistors based on this material system. The core elements of this project are: (1) development of a fundamental understanding of the metal organic chemical vapor deposition growth of \u00e2-(Al,In,Gay)2O3; (2) Demonstrating effective doping of this wide bandgap material; (3) Demonstration of the ability to realize high quality hetero-interfaces; (4) Using the doping and hetero-interface engineering to realize high mobility layers; and, (5) using all of that to demonstrate high performance transistors.  The principal investigator's background is extremely well matched to the proposed research, and all the required resources and expertise are available.",
