 "awd_abstract_narration": "Archaeologists are well placed among scientists to answer questions of three kinds: What changes in the size and organization of human societies take place over the shorter or longer term? To what extent do cultural and non-human processes and events have an effect over different geographic scales? To what degree do deliberate socio-economic strategies achieve (or not) their explicit aims or prove counterproductive? All three of these questions are perennially important to policy-making, economics, diplomacy, risk management, and other applied social sciences. Michael Lane of the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC) responds to all three in his proposed research. In collaboration with Greek and American colleagues, he proposes to answer specifically and generally relevant questions concerning what motives lay behind an technologically intensive agricultural endeavor over 3,000 years ago, whether it was initially organized by state institutions or a rather looser-knit association of communities, whether relevant hydraulic technology was largely a local innovation or adopted from abroad, how rapid the technological change was, whether and how attendant political and economic institutions kept pace, and the extent to which the agricultural intensification successfully addressed an issue - for example, population pressure or external demand - without raising some other undesirable social or economic cost. Answers to these questions have clear contemporary relevance, covering such issues as feeding the world's growing population, building political and economic capacity, and transferring relevant technologies. The project will also provide training for the next generation of American researchers, including UMBC undergraduates and an American interdisciplinary geological archaeology post-doctoral fellow.\r\n\r\nThe Late Bronze Age was a time in the wider Eastern Mediterranean of the emergence of state institutions in societies on the periphery of pre-existing kingdoms in Egypt and Mesopotamia. Lane's research will be carried out in the Kopaic Basin in Greece, where, during the Late Bronze Age (ca. 1700-1100 BCE) the region's inhabitants realized a colossal drainage and land reclamation project, involving 15 miles of channeled rivers, together with dikes to prevent re-flooding. He has discovered a vast, largely intact buried landscape of cultivated fields evidently irrigated through the drainage system. Prior studies indicate that the most recent construction of the drainage works dates to about 1300 BCE. Lane's preliminary results indicate that the fields were created as early as 1700 BCE. The consensus is that state institutions are required for orchestrating such work, yet no indication of these is found earlier than about 1500 BCE. Hence a period of two centuries exists that needs to be reevaluated either for evidence of a centralized state or, conversely, of the social capacity to realize such a technological feat without central authority and administrative bodies. The discrepancy between newly obtained and consensus dates bears important implications for understanding possible interconnections among local and regional Late Bronze Age socio-economic developments, including whether the relevant technology was mostly indigenous or introduced, whether the undertaking was mainly a response to internal stimuli or external interests, and whether it was viable over the long term. Lane's proposal, involving side-by-side employment of well-established carbon-14 and luminescence dating methods with state-of-the-art shell amino-acid racemization dating - widely used in crime scene investigation and also applied in archaeology - will not only address these important concerns but also lead to potential methodological improvements in multiple areas of research.",

Allongside separately funded scientific dates from the encompassing archaeological project (MYNEKO), and those the principal investigator's prior fieldwork, they have contributed significantly to regional scientific chronology.</p>\n<p>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the support of the NSF and other foundations, MYNEKO has produced 35 useful radiocarbon dates, 21 useful optically or thermally stimulated luminescence (OSL and TL) dates, and amino acid racemization ratio (AAR) correlates with some of both of the former, despite some operational difficulties and contamination. This total may be compared with the current count of approximately 110 14C dates from elsewhere in LBA mainland Greece&mdash;15 lately from Iklaina and 72 from Mt. Lykaion alone&mdash;as well as a handful of luminescence dates (e.g. Kastrouli).</p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The MYNEKO:SDP OSL dates from features hypothetically date to the LBA are consistent both with this period as previously defined and with OSL and TL dates obtained during prior fieldwork&nbsp;from similar features in the project area, which in turn are corroborated by 14C dates, when the latter's ranges are narrowly interpreted.</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hypothesis that the carbonate substrate would raise the 14C dates was refuted. On the contrary, in the two loci chosen for side-by-side sampling, there is a discrepancy of several hundred years in the opposite calendric direction between the carbon-independent (quartz) OSL dates, on the one hand, and 14C and calcium carbonate TL dates, on the other. As of the time of writing, one stratum of one locus had been resampled for 14C, and analysis confirms that this offset is not due to contamination or laboratory error and it correlates with depth like the others.</p>\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certain AAR ratios already obtained, particularly of the amino acid glutamine, exhibit a rate of change congruent with the sequence of OSL dates, which also shows a linear function as depth of deposition increases. Significantly, the rate of change as calculated by correlating AAR ratios with OSL dates at one locus when applied to the other locus, seems to confirm the OSL date, being within seven percent of it.</p>\n<p>The chronometric discrepancy&mdash;one that was not observed in results from different loci in a prior phase of research&mdash;suggests local excess of radioactive 14C, that is a net deficit of stable isotopes. It is unlikely due to artificial addition of mineral lime, which is not currently done in the region for agriculture, because the soil substrate is already carbonate. The current working hypothesis, with reference to the AAR and 14C control sample results, is that the parts of the ancient lakebed sampled during MYNEKO:SDP, being relatively elevated, were periodically exposed to open air, resulting in differential upward movement of lighter isotopes, due to evaporation, and even their removal. The consultant micromorphologist observed evidence of repeated oxidation and reduction of oxygen in local soils that may correspond to periods of exposure and submersion. Under such conditions, it appears that quartz OSL and AAR analyses are more reliable than sediment 14C and calcite TL analyses in the Kopaic Basin and similar temperate lake and wetland environments on carbonate bedrock. Resampling of the same context has been done for both luminescence and AAR analyses, and it is hoped the results will help put the hypothesis to the test.</p>\n<p>In addition to realizing its intellectual merits, MYNEKO:SDP achieved its broader cooperative and institutional advancement aims. It contributed corroborating data to the PI and his current Greek collaborator's reassessment of the nature and rate of emergent social complexity in the LBA in the region. It provided remunerated employment and attendant data for a US post-doctoral researcher, and it served to advertise and promote the expert luminescence dating services of the Archaeometry Laboratory of the University of the Peloponnese, Greece.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/01/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;F&nbsp;Lane</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1732642/1732642_10490637_1572607487058_IMG_6039--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1732642/1732642_10490637_1572607487058_IMG_6039--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1732642/1732642_10490637_1572607487058_IMG_6039--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Nikos Zacharias samping for OSL dating at locus D1-T1.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">M.F.
