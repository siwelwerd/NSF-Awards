 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Igor Kaltashov and his group at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst are developing powerful analytical tools to study processes such as protein/receptor recognition and enzymatic reactions. These new tools will advance understanding of the mechanisms of complex biological processes at the molecular level, ultimately facilitating manipulation of these processes to achieve desired outcomes. Thus, the new tools can have significant impact not only in chemistry, but also in biotechnology and medicine. Elements of the research involve close interaction with industrial collaborators, adding a valuable dimension to the educational experience of the graduate and undergraduate students involved.  Dr. Kaltashov and his group are also engaging in outreach activities which seek to expose local high school students to the state-of-the-art analytical instrumentation at UMass-Amherst.\r\n\r\nCharacterization of biopolymer dynamics and architecture (conformations of individual biopolymer chains and assemblies of multi-unit systems) is both challenging and important for improved understanding of biochemical processes. There is particular need for tools capable of probing transient systems, which are encountered in processes such as protein aggregation, assembly and evolution of quaternary structures, interaction with physiological partners, and enzyme catalysis and transport phenomena.  Improved understanding of these phenomena requires reliable kinetics data and knowledge of conformational changes that accompany transitions.  In order to improve on existing characterization capabilities, the Kaltashov group is developing a new robust, sensitive, and highly selective experimental strategy that uses a combination of liquid chromatography (LC) run under native conditions (e.g., size-exclusion chromatography) with on-line detection by native electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS). The new LC/MS platform incorporates ion manipulation in the gas phase to enable studies of highly heterogeneous systems (e.g., protein-polymer conjugates).  Incorporation of on-column H/D exchange and chemical reduction reactions enables top-down HDX MS/MS characterization of higher order structure and conformational dynamics of proteins.",

Such systems are increasingly used in modern medicine, but the analytical tools required for their characterization had been lacking. The focal point of this work was understanding the dynamic processes occurring within separation devices (chromatographic columns) on the time scale of separation, and how they can be used to extract quantitative information on the speed and efficiency of biopolymer interactions that give rise to large macromolecular assemblies. This work was supplemented with limited charge reduction, a gas-phase ion manipulation technique developed in our laboratory, that allows meaningful structural information to be obtained on systems that exhibit extreme degrees of structural heterogeneity and cannot be characterized using common analytical tools. Lastly, a new technique has been developed and tested that uses chemical transformations inside chromatographic columns (the so-called ?in-line? format) to process difficult-to-analyze biopolymers prior to their detection and characterization. One particularly exciting aspect of this work is the possibility to probe higher order structure of large systems, such as protein aggregates, that have remained so far outside of the reach of modern methods of biophysical analysis. The list of analytical targets, whose analysis is enabled by the development of these new techniques includes recombinant antibodies beyond the G-isotype (such as IgE?s) and synthetic vaccines (large immunogenic carrier proteins conjugated with antigens that are too small to be able to ?train? our immune system on their own). This list will undoubtedly continue to grow, and in the near future will be expanded to include gene therapy products and several non-biologic complex drugs (NBCD?s, a recently emerged and rapidly growing class of medicines that includes nanoparticles and other large and highly heterogeneous drugs of abiotic origin). Importantly, these novel approaches have been already adopted by other researchers, and are actively used in our ongoing collaborative work with colleagues in the biotech/biopharma sector (such as Fina Biosolutions, a Rockville, MD firm specializing in production of key components of synthetic vaccines). An important component of this project was development of human resources, which included training several graduate and undergraduate students in using modern tools of biochemical analysis and involving them in research that is highly relevant to the biopharma/biotech sector, one of the major economic growth engines in the United States. Importantly, the work carried out by the undergraduate students (applications of analytical chemistry in forensics and pharmacovigilance) raises the awareness of the healthcare-related issues that disproportionately affect the developing countries (such as the problem of counterfeit medicines), and therefore contributes promoting global equity in healthcare.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/17/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Igor&nbsp;A&nbsp;Kaltashov</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1709552/1709552_10485467_1655494813887_TOCgraphic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1709552/1709552_10485467_1655494813887_TOCgraphic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A synthetic smoking secession vaccine\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1709552/1709552_10485467_1655494813887_TOCgraphic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A synthetic smoking secession vaccine\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A synthetic smocking secession vaccine built by conjugating multiple non-immunogenic nicotine molecules to a highly immunogenic carrier protein, detoxified diphtheria toxin.
