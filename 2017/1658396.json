 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine invertebrates use an array of strategies to survive, move, and reproduce across diverse and dynamic environmental conditions. This project investigates the intersection of these strategies and how they facilitate the persistence of blue crabs and a pathogenic virus along the Atlantic coast of North and South America. The widespread distribution of this crab-virus system makes it useful for investigating host-pathogen interactions. Blue crabs can reduce their activity level and induce winter dormancy in colder climates, but it is unclear how this alters progression and transmission of the pathogen. Conversely, year-round growth and reproduction of tropical blue crabs may be offset by higher pathogen abundance and activity. This project will use a combination of field and laboratory studies to reveal how crab life history and pathogen dynamics interact and adapt at the extremes of their range. Genetic sequencing, crab movement tracking and oceanographic models will be used to understand how crab-disease dynamics vary across temperate and tropical latitudes. The blue crab is an ecologically and economically important species and knowledge generated in this project will help provide management guidance to support sustainable fisheries. Best practices to avoid and limit disease will be communicated to commercial and artisanal harvesters through partnerships and workshops. Local high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will be engaged through a variety of formal and informal educational programs. Public outreach will be implemented through a museum partnership with the Shedd Aquarium and will include the training of a science communication intern.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative project will combine empirical field and laboratory experiments, population genomics, and biophysical modeling to explore the consequences of latitude-driven changes in life history and oceanic connectivity on a trans-hemispheric pathosystem comprised of the blue crab, Callinectes sapidus, and the pathogenic virus, CsRV1. The virulence of the CsRV1 virus from tropical and temperate latitudes and the impact of overwintering will be studied by experimental virus challenges of crabs transplanted between high and low latitudes. The impact of infection and virulence on crab movement will be investigated in laboratory raceway experiments of healthy and infected crabs and in the field with acoustically tagged crabs deployed in temperate and tropical locations. Population genetic studies using thousands of genome-wide RAD sequencing markers for crabs and whole-genome sequencing for the virus will define genetic connectivity of crab and virus populations across their range, and will investigate the possible latitudinal, seascape, and life history-driven changes in blue crab and virus genomes. The two population genomic data sets are expected to provide different inferences and scales of connectivity because CsRV1 virus genotypes are transmitted only among post-larval crabs while blue crab genotypes also move by a potentially long-range dispersive larval stage. Finally, integrated biophysical models will be used to investigate the relative contributions of adult and larval dispersal on the population structure of the crab and the pathogen across a broad swath of habitat between New England and Argentina with a decade of simulations. An open-source Lagrangian stochastic model will estimate pelagic larval transport, and spatially explicit biased-correlated random walk models will estimate adult movement. Models will be informed by experimentally-derived movement and behavior data, as well as information on crab larval and adult behavior and overwintering duration available in the published literature. Under a series of scenarios in which crab behavior is affected by latitude and virus infection, statistical comparisons will be made between biophysical model-based predictions of connectivity and genetic estimates of connectivity. These analyses will advance our understanding of the physical, environmental, and biological factors that shape the dynamics of the blue crab CsRV1 pathosystem.",

It supports fisheries and fishing communities across this range but is also an important member of the marine community, serving as predator, prey, and scavenger. Its life history, as with many marine organisms,&nbsp;is shaped by its environment, thus it can vary with latitude and environmental conditions. For the blue crab, life history includes such things as the time spent in the plankton as a larvae, the location and type of juvenile habitat available, salinity of the mating and spawning habitats, and in regions where the water temperature drops below 10? C in the winter, it means winter hibernation or dormancy. Marine organisms are also affected by parasites across their life history stages and across their geographic ranges but we know little about how these factors interact to drive disease. We used the Atlantic blue crab and its viral parasite, Callinectes sapidus Reo-like VIrus 1 (CsRV1), to study how the crab host and parasite are connected across their broad range, and how latitude intersects with life history to drive differences in disease.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our project had three main objectives:</p>\n<p>1) Determine how life history variation in the blue crab affects patterns of CsRV1 prevalence, virulence and host susceptibility.</p>\n<p>2) Determine the genetic structure of the blue crab and CsRV1 populations from temperate to tropical regions.</p>\n<p>3) Characterize the population connectivity of the blue crab across its entire geographic range and compare this to host and pathogen population genetic structure.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>We collected blue crab samples across their range and found that in the part of their range where blue crabs are dormant in the winter (far north and south Atlantic), the prevalence of the CsRV1 virus is much higher than in the central part of their range where they are active year-round. This could be due to a difference in temperature preference of the virus for cooler warmer waters but could also be affected by the lower density of blue crabs in the Caribbean that limits transmission of the virus between crabs. We also found that prevalence of CsRV1 appears much lower during the winter in regions where the crabs experience dormancy; however, laboratory experiments show that the virus remains present at much lower levels in dormant crabs and begins to multiply rapidly in the spring when the water warms. Hence, our results showing lower prevalence in the winter could actually be a result of the virus also going dormant and being less easily detected.</p>\n<p>Our genetic studies show that the Atlantic blue crab is the same species across its range but the populations we sampled show genetic differences consistent with different oceanographic regions and distances separating those populations. The genetic population of CsRV1 virus was consistent with the host geographic origins and was only found affecting the blue crab <em>Callinectes sapidus</em>, not any of the other species of <em>Callinectes</em> (e.g., <em>C. danae</em>, <em>C. bocourti</em>, <em>C. similus</em>, <em>C. ornatus</em>, <em>C. marginatus</em>) found within the range of the blue crab.</p>\n<p>The connectivity of blue crabs and the CsRV1 virus across their range are driven by different factors. Blue crabs are transported across long distances as pelagic larvae and to a lesser degree by bottom-dwelling adult crabs moving between estuaries. The CsRV1 virus, on the contrary, is only transported by adult crabs moving it along the coast since it does not infect crab larvae and is unlikely to remain viable for long outside the host crab. Although healthy adult crabs can travel long distances outside of estuaries, when infected with CsRV1 their activity rapidly declines, which reduces the likelihood of an infected crab moving from one coastal estuary to the next before dying.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>We worked directly with local fishers, fishery managers, and scientists to collect all of the blue crab data from across their range. At many of these locations we also gave presentations on the research project and ongoing results. Where appropriate, our partners were engaged in the publication of the results and included as co-authors. The project also involved the training of enumerable graduate and undergraduate students with diverse backgrounds from the University of Florida and University of Maryland. We continue to give presentations stemming from the project to scientific and agency personnel, the latter of whom are using our results in their directives to manage fishery stocks and aquaculture operations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/05/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Donald&nbsp;Behringer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1658396/1658396_10485681_1692134726364_IMG_1329--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1658396/1658396_10485681_1692134726364_IMG_1329--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Blue crab fitted with acoustic transmitter\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1658396/1658396_10485681_1692134726364_IMG_1329--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Blue crab fitted with acoustic transmitter\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Blue crab is affixed with an acoustic transmitter prior to being released into an array of hydroacoustic receivers that will record its location as it moves along the coast.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Donald C Behringer</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Donald&nbsp;Behringer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Blue crab fitted with acoustic transmitter</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1658396/1658396_10485681_1692134571764_IMG_2148--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1658396/1658396_10485681_1692134571764_IMG_2148--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dredged blue crabs\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1658396/1658396_10485681_1692134571764_IMG_2148--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dredged blue crabs\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Atlantic blue crabs dredged from the bottom of Albemarle Sound NC to measure the prevalence of the CsRV1 virus during winter dormancy</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Donald C Behringer</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Donald&nbsp;Behringer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Dredged blue crabs</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1658396/1658396_10485681_1692134926359_IMG_5298--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1658396/1658396_10485681_1692134926359_IMG_5298--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Blue crab fitted with activity monitor\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1658396/1658396_10485681_1692134926359_IMG_5298--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Blue crab fitted with activity monitor\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A blue crab fitted with a device that continually monitored its activity patterns.
