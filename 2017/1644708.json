 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a proposal to create an I-Corps Site at the University of California - Santa Cruz (UC-SC). The proposal outlines a focused summer program of eight weeks targeted at the under-represented population of the university. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\nParticular strengths of the proposal include: offering the I-Corps curriculum during a summer program that is well articulated; targeting under-served students in a region with potential for significant impact; an unusual mix of social, not-for-profit startups with for-profit ones; a strong collaboration with the Bay Area I-Corps Node; the commitment from the university to support the I-Corps focused activities; and, there is likely to be an impact not only on the region but also on the students, 25% of who are Hispanic. This project could potentially serve as a model for others to replicate.",
