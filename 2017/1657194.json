 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by engaging in hands-on field experience, laboratory/project-based entrepreneurship tasks and mentorship experiences.\r\n\r\nThis project at the University of North Carolina addresses STEM access, opportunity, and identity gaps for diverse middle school youth and their teachers.  The project activities integrate science, engineering, and computing to address socio-environmental problems that are multifaceted, have local and global significance, and lend themselves to personally meaningful and authentic disciplinary STEM engagement. The hypothesis is that this integrated approach will strengthen youth's STEM-linked identities, broaden their STEM academic and career pathways, provide a model for meaningful STEM integration, and nurture teachers' learning. The project will recruit 60 middle school students from two rural school districts in North Carolina (Randolph County School district and Rockingham County School district). These districts will partner with three middle schools that serve diverse and socioeconomically disadvantaged student populations. The project includes a research component to study youths' STEM-linked identities, which will: (1) identify features of the program that trigger and sustain STEM identity work; (2) fill an enduring gap in the literature by identifying long-term, identity-related outcomes of informal STEM education; and (3) provide an updated, tested model of disciplinary identity. This project contributes to a long-term goal to improve the STEM learning infrastructure in the North Carolina Piedmont so youths who have historically been denied an enriching STEM education can access and remain on pathways that lead to STEM-related personal affiliation, academic success, and career opportunities.\r\n\r\nThe project objectives are: (1) create, enact, and refine a pedagogical model that engages middle school youth with socioenvironmental problems through science, engineering, and computing; (2) study the effectiveness of the model in triggering and sustaining youth's STEM-linked identities and pathways; (3) test an updated model of disciplinary identity; (4) study the effectiveness of the program for teachers' STEM professional learning. The project includes the following primary intervention strategies: (a) a two-week residential Summer Institute (SI) focuses on the problem of access to clean water, examined through science, engineering, and computing. Near-peer mentors, STEM professionals, undergraduates and graduates in STEM fields, and a STEM career counselor contribute to the SI. Participants include 60 youth and six teachers from partner schools; (b) Saturday Academies (SAs) focus on environmental problems integrating engineering design and computing. The evaluation plan includes comprehensive formative (process) and summative (outcome) components.",

Primary strategies included: a residential STEM summer institute, Saturday Academies, and after-school programs at three middle schools. The objectives were: 1) to create, enact, and refine a STEM-integrated pedagogical model for youths' environmental problem solving; 2) to study the effectiveness of the pedagogical model in triggering and sustaining youths' STEM-related identity work and pathways; 3) to study the effectiveness of the project in triggering and sustaining teachers' STEM professional learning.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;A major contribution was the creation and refinement of a pedagogical model&nbsp;(Image 1)&nbsp;that was a resource for designing curriculum&nbsp;(Image 2)&nbsp;and a heuristic to surface and study youths' STEM identity work.&nbsp;The framework emphasized environmental problems as multifaceted, having local and global significance, and lending themselves to personally meaningful, disciplinary STEM engagement. The six profile categories that formed the backbone of the model included: acting as altruist, acting as conservationist, investigating, inventing, tinkering, and designing. STEM profiles allowed youth to recognize that, without any changes to self, they were valuable contributors to the learning community.&nbsp;Every youth resonated with one or more categories of the STEM profile framework, with nearly even distribution among categories that youth mentioned as \"very much like me\" in end of program interviews (Image 3). An analysis of 73 youth interviews indicated that the STEM categories prompted: 1) new recognitions of self; 2) unexpected recognition by others; and 3) new ways of belonging in STEM. In longitudinal interviews with a subset of youth one to three years after their participation, all youth identified one or more categories as helpful in surfacing and naming the ways they felt changed by project experiences.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The project originally proposed a 4-phase longitudinal model of identity development to study youths' identities. The team found three problems with this model: 1) it was too linear; 2) it assumed a fixed endpoint towards a unified STEM outcome; 3) it ignored the experimental aspects of youths' STEM identity work. The team created a revised grounded theory of longitudinal identity work that accounted for the playfulness youth enacted to perform and narrate themselves in new ways throughout the program. Nearly all youth consistently affiliated with one or two STEM profile categories over time, but their affiliation with other categories were much more \"elastic\" (i.e., less predictable).

The research team developed a grounded theory of affectionate knowing that illustrated the non-binary ways that youth enacted caring in practice.&nbsp;The authors operationalize affectionate knowing as moving into and out of spaces of domination of and connection with more-than-humans. Empathy was key to moving youth towards connection, and human-centered concerns (e.g., concern for one's safety) moved youth into domination spaces. Three implications are: 1) care cannot be evaluated with a snapshot measurement; 2) caring is not an either/or construct; 3) a curriculum needs scaffolds, space, and time for youth to learn to see with empathetic, connected, and holistic worldviews because those are less emphasized in traditional STEM and even outdoor curricula.</p>\n<p>The teachers who participated in the project shifted their views of youths' learning in STEM, from a narrow content focus prior to the professional development to noticing youths' social and emotional learning, the nature of their engagement in disciplinary practices, and their interest and identity development in STEM.
