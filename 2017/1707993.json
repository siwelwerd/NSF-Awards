 "awd_abstract_narration": "Of all the fundamental constants of nature, G, the universal gravitational constant, is known with the least precision. The current situation surrounding the uncertainty in the knowledge of G is puzzling the fundamental physics and precision measurement communities. The world's best experiments yield values which are incompatible with one another and differ by about 40 times the uncertainty of the most precise experiment. Furthermore, knowing the true value of G is important in various fields, as it is necessary in efforts to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics in a quantum theory of gravity. The project enabled by this collaboration will be to carry out carefully controlled metrological experiments where the precision of the measurements will be in the part-per-million. Since part of the past discrepancies between determinations of G can be traced back to the methodology used, the group will combine different approaches to determine G within the same apparatus, hoping to obtain highly precise values of G from each approach, but with the expectation that the values obtained using different methodologies will mimic the current situation in the community, namely, that different methodologies, no matter how precise, yield different results. With the experiments carried out in the same apparatus our effort would then help understand the current discrepancies among existing experimental results.\r\n\r\nThe project will establish a torsion pendulum facility dedicated to measuring the Newtonian gravitational constant G with unprecedented sensitivity using three different experimental techniques within the same apparatus. An agreed upon value for G remains elusive as recent measurements by different experimental groups have scattered widely, or have had low precision. The spread in measured values and the relatively low precision of the measurements is recognized by the precision measurement community as something that needs to be addressed. This project will build a system based upon the ideas introduced in previous torsion pendulum experiments, but will expand the scope and breadth of the measurements by the multi-mode nature of the apparatus. In the primary mode G will be determined by measuring the angular acceleration needed to keep a torsion pendulum's fiber from twisting while it rotates on a turntable in the presence of carefully designed attractor masses (that also rotate on a separate turntable). This angular acceleration feedback mode has yielded the most precise measurement of G to date, yet it has only been performed once. Compared to previous efforts, the proposed system will achieve smaller metrology errors by using advanced measurement and characterization techniques. Using the same apparatus, G will be determined by measuring the change in the resonant frequency of the torsion pendulum with the attractor masses present and removed by measuring the thermally induced oscillation of the pendulum. In the third approach, G will be determined by large amplitude determination of the change in the resonant frequency of the pendulum when the attractor masses are at two different positions. Each technique is expected to provide a measurement with a relative error of approximately 2 ppm. The measurements performed within this project will be of broad interest to scientists in diverse fields of physics and metrology, and the approach may shed light on why previous experiments have resulted in discrepant measurements of G. In addition to broad scientific interest, undergraduate and graduate students will be integral to the success of the project. They will be trained in experimental physics and precision measurement techniques. The project will provide training and education for first-generation college students and undergraduates from diverse backgrounds by recruiting from a rural, federally-recognized Hispanic Serving Institution that has limited research opportunities on campus. Students from three different universities will be in contact, enhancing their exposure to different academic cultures and providing networking opportunities. As part of the proposed activities, demonstrations associated with the principles of forces will be developed and used at community gathering events, recruiting events and in classroom environments.",
