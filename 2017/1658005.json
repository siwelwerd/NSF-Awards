 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will mainly support graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and junior researchers based at US institutions to participate in the XI Americas Conference on Differential Equations and Nonlinear Analysis that will take place at the University of Alberta, Canada, August 12 to 19, 2017.  This conference is part of the Americas Conference Series that started in 1994 in Taxco, Mexico and have had meetings on a regular basis. The Americas Conference Series has served as a means to promote the progress of science and the collaboration among researchers from North America and Latin America, and to train graduate students. Through several years of concerted efforts from researchers of all Americas countries, this conference series has been extremely successful in achieving its goals. Many researchers who started their participation in the series as junior researchers have benefited greatly and have become experts in their fields; now they are making major contributions and play active roles in the research and training activities of the conference series. The Conference Series has always been distinguished by diversity of participants. Forty percent of   plenary lecturers are women mathematicians from the Americas. The conference will have a strong participation of junior and senior mathematicians from minority groups, with a large percentage of Hispanics and African American individuals, and will provide a great opportunity for new scientific collaborations.\r\n \r\nThe XI Americas Conference on Differential Equations is devoted to the subject of nonlinear applied differential equations and dynamical systems. The topics will include analytical and computational issues and cover some of the most important applications of differential equations as well as some of the latest mathematical analysis techniques for their study. The activities will include a first part with 6 mini-courses on recent developments of Hamiltonian PDE and water waves, invariant manifolds, synchronizations and applications, high dimensional data, dynamics of spatial structures, and persistent homology, modeling spread patterns of animal diseases that are communicable to human beings.  The second part includes 20 plenary talks on recent advances in a broad spectrum of current research topics; there will be 8 theme sessions organized by leading experts in respective research areas. Contributed talks and poster sessions have also been designed to provide additional unique opportunity for more junior researchers to present their work.
