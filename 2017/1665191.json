 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division of NSF supports the project by Professor Gregory S. Girolami of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to develop new and better molecular precursors for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of thin films.  The current work will develop new classes of transition metal compounds, especially as they relate to the use of such molecules as precursors for the deposition of metals and metal oxides on surfaces with deep vertical features. The research will lead to a better understanding of the chemistry of volatile transition metal compounds and how they can be used to uniformly fill such deep features with a focus on better ways to deposit the wires and insulators that are key components of modern-day computer chips.  The work will enhance already existing interactions between Professor Girolami?s group and leading companies in microelectronics development. This project will contribute directly to the education and training of B.S. and Ph.D. students, and the results will be disseminated by presentations at international conferences, and by publication in reputable scientific journals.  This award will contribute to the education of a diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students, and enable Professor Girolami to write short radio spots highlighting recent scientific advances of interest to the public. \r\n\r\nA vital national scientific need is the development of new and better molecular precursors for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of thin films. The current project is contributing directly to this need by investigating the synthesis of new volatile compounds (especially of the transition metals), investigations of their chemical reactivities, and studies of their volatilities and utilities as thin film precursors. Some of the specific objectives of the current project are the synthesis of new complexes containing hard-soft chelating ligands, and the synthesis of high molecular weight but still highly volatile compounds, which are expected to be useful for the CVD of superconformal thin films. In parallel, investigations of the use of these new compounds for the CVD of thin films will be carried out collaboratively with experts in these techniques. The development of these new molecules will lead to better performing materials and new fabrication methods that will enable the continued miniaturization of integrated circuits. In this way, the Girolami group will contribute to achieving one of the most important \"Difficult Challenges\" of the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors: the rapid introduction of new materials/processes for the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of thin films. The project lies at the interface of inorganic and materials chemistry, and is well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  Professor Girolami?s group is also well positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science.  Outreach activities involving the production and broadcast of TinyTech radio spots will also be part of the funded project.",
