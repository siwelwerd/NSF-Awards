 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1\r\nThe Global Learning and Observations to Benefit the Environment (GLOBE) Program, an international educational and citizen science program, provides students and the public worldwide with the opportunity to participate in data collection, analysis, and the scientific process, while contributing meaningfully to our understanding of the Earth system and global environment. The 6th GLOBE Learning Expedition (GLE) and the 22nd GLOBE Annual Meeting will be held in Killarney Ireland July 1-6, 2018. The theme of the GLE meeting is Connecting Mountain, Woods and Lake Biomes: Developing a Special Sense of Place for the GLOBE Community. The GLEs are organized every four or five years in order to provide students from around the world the opportunity to present their research projects to their peers, to GLOBE scientists, and to the wider GLOBE community. GLEs also provide students with the opportunity to participate in a collective place-based research experience, learn about each other's cultures, and to develop collaborative partnerships that will enhance their future GLOBE, academic and career experiences. The GLOBE Community consists of students, teachers and scientists in over 100 U.S. Partnerships and 100 Partner Countries. The GLOBE Implementation Office will arrange all the logistics. Over 250 adult participants and 150 students are expected to attend the week-long event.\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\nConcerns over the number of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics(STEM) graduates has been mounting for decades, and has risen to a new level with the publication of recent reports. These reports all point to the lack of qualified STEM graduates to meet short and long-term workforce needs of the nation's economy. The previous two federal administrations have touted the need for more emphasis on STEM education. In addition, GLOBE is an excellent vehicle for making connections between formal and informal environments (through public participation in science) and for creating and sustaining STEM interest in students in all levels of the educational system.\r\n\r\nSpecific objectives for this meeting include:\r\n1) Students share their learning/experiences related to GLOBE-based research to peers;\r\n2) Students participate in science and motivate each other through real-time interactions;\r\n3) Participants (scientists, teachers, Country Coordinators, US Partners) share experiences, collaborate in\r\ndoing science and celebrate accomplishments;\r\n4) Participants learn more about GLOBE and how students from different backgrounds can contribute to\r\nscience and understanding about our planet;\r\n5) Teachers and students share how GLOBE activities are being conducted in their schools; and\r\n6) Students collaborate with each other through using protocols to study the local environment during the\r\nGLOBE Games.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGLOBE Learning Expeditions (GLEs) are organized every few years in order to provide students from around the world the opportunity to present their research projects to their peers, to GLOBE scientists, and the greater GLOBE community. These conferences also provide students with the opportunity to establish friendships and to develop collaborative partnerships that will enhance their future GLOBE experiences.\n\nTeachers are provided with an opportunity to share innovative ideas and challenges, to attend protocol and related professional development sessions, and to build connections for research efforts between schools.\n\nThe outcomes for the 2018 GLE award were to strengthen the GLOBE Community through interconnection and promote GLOBE through collaboration.  The location of the GLE was at an inspirational setting, a national park.  This was highlighted by an opening presentation at the event by a local photographer, Norman McCloskey, who developed a book called ParkLight Images of Killarney National Park, which consisted of images of this park landscape.  This set the tone for the students\u2019 visit to the park for GLOBE scientific investigations/GLOBE Games.  (all participants left the event with a copy of this book sponsored by the Irish Environmental Protection Agency.)  Students were divided into different groups, mixed internationally so that they could develop friendships and bonds with each other.  In this way, they could collaborate with each other through using the protocols to study the national park environment.  Ireland, was experiencing a drought during the GLE and so the setting was even more inspirational given the contrasts in colors and the panorama visible.      \n\nOne hundred and seventy-five GLOBE students presented their research to peers, scientists and other community members.  In total, 392 GLOBE members from 37 countries attended the meeting.  Students could ask questions of each other during the presentations, as well as during the field trips to the national park.  In addition, scientists and other community members at the student presentations were encouraged to ask questions of the students and focus on how the research connected with the students\u2019 local community and globally.\n\nOn two evenings of the GLE, students were able to share information about their countries and cultures.  One evening a \u2018marketplace\u2019 was held where students should share information about their school, traditional music, foods, customs, etc.  This had the impact of relaxing the students so that the next day the atmosphere within the meeting was different, changing to more of a real \u2018community\u2019 feeling rather than an event feeling.  Students worked more collaboratively in the field, having broken down many barriers during the prior evening. Language was not even as big of an issue anymore. \n\nPrior to the GLE, the GLOBE Annual Meeting occurred; during this meeting US Partners, Country Coordinators, and teachers were able to share updates with each other on GLOBE in their partnerships, countries, and schools. Federal sponsors and GLOBE Implementation Office staff also updated the community on the program.  One hundred and forty-five participants attended this meeting.  In addition, during the GLE, professional development opportunities were offered to the 59 teachers at the event.      \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anthony P Murphy"
