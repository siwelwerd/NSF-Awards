 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evolution is foundational to biology. Although undergraduate biology majors often have interest in pursuing careers in medicine and allied health, they may not have opportunities to engage in evolutionary thinking in the context of medicine. Evolution has historically been neglected in medical research and medical education, leaving many medical professionals with an incomplete understanding of human biology. Evolutionary medicine is a growing transdisciplinary field that applies evolutionary theory to human health and understanding our vulnerability to diseases. This perspective has made unique contributions to almost all major areas of health, including aging, cancer, infectious disease, mental health, and reproductive health. However, few resources exist to help college instructors teach the applications of evolution that are critical for human health. This project aims to provide college instructors with the resources to enhance the teaching of evolution, a core concept of biology, in ways that are of most relevance to students who are planning on careers related to human biology.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is to establish a suite of resources that can help evolutionary medicine instructors teach in evidence-based ways:  1) articulating the core principles of evolutionary medicine and learning goals for evolutionary medicine courses, 2) developing validated tests based on student misconceptions in evolutionary medicine that can be used by instructors to accurately measure student learning in evolutionary medicine, and 3) creating and curating open-access evidence-based teaching resources and materials. These resources will provide evolutionary medicine instructors with the tools they need to teach in student-centered, active learning ways aligned with defined learning goals and measure the impact of their instruction on student learning. These resources will be packaged for broad dissemination to have the largest impact on undergraduate students interested in medicine and allied health.\r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Environmental Biology and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEvolutionary medicine is a growing field that uses the principles of evolutionary biology to better understand, prevent, and treat disease.  Increasingly, evolutionary medicine is being taught in undergraduate biology courses. We documented that most evolutionary medicine courses are being taught in anthropology and biology departments at research institutions, but there is much variation in what topics are being taught in evolutionary medicine courses, indicating a need for standardization of the core ideas of evolutionary medicine that should be taught to undergraduates.  Further, to date there have been few tools to help instructors teach evolutionary medicine in evidence-based ways.  \n\nIn this project, we developed an expert-generated set of 14 core principles of evolutionary medicine that can be used to develop learning goals for teaching evolutionary medicine.  Based on these principles and using data collected from students about common misconceptions in evolutionary medicine, we developed a test that can measure student understanding of evolutionary medicine that any instructor can use in their courses.  Finally, we created an open-access website, called EvMedEd, that hosts over 1500 vetted teaching resources for evolutionary medicine, including videos, readings, and evidence-based activities that we created for instructors to use.  Notably, we developed the EvMedEd Navigator, which provides Medically Relevant Examples (MREs) that introduce an example where an application of EvMed principles has led to an improved understanding of health and disease.  These MREs are aligned with the core principles of evolutionary medicine.  This collection of tools is freely available to any instructor, which should have a broad impact on the way evolutionary medicine is taught at the undergraduate level and hopefully will increase the number of evolutionary medicine courses being taught at non-research institutions.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/22/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sara E Brownell"
