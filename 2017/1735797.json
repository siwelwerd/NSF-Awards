 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation project will explore emerging questions in geopolitics about interactions among extra-territorial sovereignty (the power nation-states exert over people and places outside their borders), state-building, ethnic nationalism, and multi-ethnic contestations over space, place, and political expression.\u00a0 The project will focus on the ways through which foreign direct investments and foreign investments in infrastructure development legitimize practices of extra-territorial sovereignty, how state security operates to monitor and control the livelihoods of marginalized populations, and how those populations then navigate the restrictions placed upon them.\u00a0 The investigators will analyze the way contemporary social, political, and cultural transformations condition how different ethnic groups attach meaning to and claim geographic places and how extra-territorial sovereignty shapes the politics of development and produces new political\u00a0beliefs, expectations, and experiences.\u00a0 The project will provide an empirical test of new theories emanating from feminist geopolitical thought that will advance scholarly engagements with affect, emotion, memory, and everyday practices to better understand macro-scale geopolitics.\u00a0 It also will contribute understanding about how state and extra-territorial sovereignties interact to impact individuals in their everyday lives. The project also will provide support to enable a graduate student to establish an independent research career.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThrough an ethnographic case study of Chinese economic and political influence in Nepal, the doctoral student will investigate the following set of core questions: (1) How do the seemingly banal, everyday, and gendered practices of Tibetan nationalism and place making in one part of Kathmandu reveal the messy intricacies of Chinese extra-territorial politics of development in Nepal?\u00a0 (2) How do Chinese extra-territorial sovereignty and Nepali ethnic nationalism produce Tibetan refugee subjectivities in Nepal?\u00a0 (3) How do place based identity politics and Nepali ethnic nationalism produce contestations between Tibetan refugees and members of other ethnic groups in Nepal?\u00a0 The recent intensification of Chinese politico-economic influence in Nepal makes this project significant and timely.\u00a0 In addition to providing new insights regarding this specific case, the project will have great value in helping to better understand the complex political, cultural, and socioeconomic dynamics among people and states in a broader range of other settings of interest to the U.S. from a national security and foreign affairs perspective.\u00a0 The doctoral student will employ a combination of qualitative research methods, including interviews, focus groups, participant observation, visual methods, and content/discourse analysis.\u00a0 Using these methods, the student will examine how everyday interactions, events, and practices reveal the intricacies of macro-scale geopolitics.\u00a0 In doing so, this dissertation will provide additional linkages between feminist political geography and geographies of sovereignty and territory.",

This project is crucial in the analysis of contemporary geopolitics as it investigates how state security operates to monitor and control the livelihoods of its marginalized populations. The project directly answers McConnell's (2013a, 122) call to ethnographically examine how sovereignty is practiced in the everyday. Drawing on Feminist Political Geography, this project examines how everyday interactions, events, and practices reveal the intricacies of macro-scale geopolitics. By examining how power/knowledge are produced through the intersectionality of multiple narratives and discourses of place making and indigeneity, this project plays an important role in the collective actions for decolonizing and deconstructing discourses, power relations, and sites of knowledge production (Dowler et al. 2014). Building up on this theorization, this project is important for understanding the role of sovereignty in transforming the cultural politics of being. These engagements are acutely pronounced when writing with and about Tibetans who live in multiple conditions of exile in Nepal.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">This project investigates the epistemic violence of change in the Tibetan refugee social worlds in Nepal. Epistemic violence speaks to both how violence is inherently produced through knowledge and how violence seeks avenues for new modes of knowledge production. Nepali state borrows from its Chinese \"big brother\" (terminology that is increasingly used to anthropomorphize Nepal-China geopolitics) in its practise of imaging (surveillance), coding (making acts legible or illegible), and erasing (coercion and extradition). Boudha is arguably the first urban public space in the entirety of Nepal to have extensive surveillance instruments in place. As the mobility of people in this space is circular - a clockwise circumambulation around the sacred stupa (kora in Tibetan) - the surveillance of the space is in the form of kora. Surveillance cameras are placed at angles so that the assemblage of it all produces a security apparatus that knows all and is placed to surveill what is legible in the space and what is rendered as illegible. Although, this illegibility is not illegal, the state treats any Tibetan illegibility here as extra-illegal through extraterritorial policing praxis - or simply put, the long reaching hands - of the Chinese state interests. This project engages how the state apparatus sees particular events and activities as illegible and illegal. Herein, results show that the sovereignty of the state lies in its ability and capability to erase.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The security apparatus of China in Nepal makes places like Boudha a microcosm of Chinese imperialism. As a form of political tactic, Tibetan refugees engage with other Himalayan ethnic peoples through intimacy and kinship to create political possibilities. In reverse, Himalayan communities engage with Tibetan politics to make social claims (education, social support) with the Central Tibetan Administration. Findings show that while at large Tibetans and Himalayan peoples are cohesive and in solidarity with one another, Chinese aided forms of espionage and eavesdropping exist in these communities creating spaces of mistrust, eavesdropping, and rumor. Further research findings show that refugee refusal is romanticized. Rather Tibetans gain access to, and make claims for,&nbsp;<em>formal</em>&nbsp;politics, citizenship, and mobility through political intimacy and social relations with other Himalayan ethnic groups.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The co-PI will share results from the project with leaders from Tibetan refugee communities and other Himalayan ethnicities through workshops co-organized with the Boudhanath Area Development Committee (BADC), which is a local agency that emphasizes on preserving the cultural heritage of Boudha. Contemporary social, political, and cultural transformations are changing how Boudha is being imagined and claimed. By partnering with BADC, the co-PI will contribute to the ongoing dialogues taking place in Boudha, mainly that of cultural loss and ethnic cooperation. Results from the research will be disseminated to the academic community through national and international conference presentations and workshops and through publications in scholarly journals. The project will lead to the completion of the co-PI's Ph.D. dissertation.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/02/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rupak&nbsp;P&nbsp;Shrestha</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1735797/1735797_10511485_1556852142248_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1735797/1735797_10511485_1556852142248_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Police in Boudha\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1735797/1735797_10511485_1556852142248_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Police in Boudha\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Police presence in Boudha during Dalai Lama's birthday</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rupak Shrestha</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rupak&nbsp;P&nbsp;Shrestha</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Police in Boudha</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1735797/1735797_10511485_1556852175905_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1735797/1735797_10511485_1556852175905_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Police in Boudha\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1735797/1735797_10511485_1556852175905_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Police in Boudha\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Police presence in Boudha during Dalai Lama's birthday</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rupak Shrestha</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rupak&nbsp;P&nbsp;Shrestha</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Police in Boudha</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1735797/1735797_10511485_1556852205576_3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1735797/1735797_10511485_1556852205576_3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Police in Boudha\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1735797/1735797_10511485_1556852205576_3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Police in Boudha\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Police presence in Boudha during the anniversary of Dalai Lama's Nobel Prize award</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rupak Shrestha</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rupak&nbsp;P&nbsp;Shrestha</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Police in Boudha</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1735797/1735797_10511485_1556852245594_4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1735797/1735797_10511485_1556852245594_4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CCTV cameras\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1735797/1735797_10511485_1556852245594_4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CCTV cameras\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">CCTV cameras in the Boudha stupa vicinity</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rupak Shrestha</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rupak&nbsp;P&nbsp;Shrestha</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">CCTV cameras</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1735797/1735797_10511485_1556852346379_7--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1735797/1735797_10511485_1556852346379_7--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tseten and Tibetan money\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1735797/1735797_10511485_1556852346379_7--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tseten and Tibetan money\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Tseten -
