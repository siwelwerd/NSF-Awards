 "awd_abstract_narration": "Grasslands comprise 26% of global land area and 80% of agriculturally productive land. In addition to their agricultural importance, grasslands also play key roles in diverse ecosystem services, including the production of clean water and the prevention of flooding. Native grasslands are often very species-rich, with richness increasing with increasing annual precipitation and declining following disturbance. These patterns of diversity can have important consequences because species-rich grasslands have been shown to be more productive and more resilient to unpredictable events like drought, flooding, or tornado damage. It is essential to understand the processes that govern both the patterns of plant diversity and the benefits of plant diversity to better manage grassland areas. The different processes that create and maintain the rich diversity of plant species coexisting in grasslands are unknown, but recent research suggests that plant pathogens may play a role. This project examines the extent plant disease determines natural patterns of plant diversity within grasslands by conducting parallel experiments at multiple field sites within the United States and China. Undergraduates, graduate students and post-doctoral researchers will be trained in diverse field and laboratory methods, including students and faculty from colleges and community colleges adjacent to study sites in Illinois, Missouri and Kansas. Data from this project will generate new directions for the management of rangelands and also lead to improvements in the yield and resilience of agricultural and native ecosystems.\r\n\r\nPathogens are predicted to accumulate and limit plant productivity most strongly in grasslands with low plant phylogenetic diversity, low plant genetic diversity and high precipitation. These predictions will be tested through a coordinated set of field observations, field manipulations, and greenhouse assays, performed on parallel diversity and rainfall gradients in North American and Asian grasslands. Specifically, patterns of plant and pathogen phylogenetic diversity, patterns of plant resistance due to genetic diversity, and patterns of ecological and evolutionary feedback will be tested across rainfall gradients in central United States and China. Rainfall manipulations of experimental plant communities will test environmental dependence of plant species coexistence, productivity benefits of plant diversity, and the role of pathogens as drivers of these processes. These empirical studies will be integrated with mathematical models to generate predictions of patterns and benefits of plant biodiversity, as well as predictions of vulnerabilities of grasslands to environmental perturbations.",

Pathogens can play an important role in the maintenance of plant diversity, however the influence of plant pathogens in generating patterns of biodiversity and the benefits of biodiversity are poorly understood.

We saw a positive response of plant productivity to plant species richness (i.e. overyielding) that became stronger over time.\n\n\nOveryielding can be generated by the increased likelihood of inclusion of productive plant species (called the selection effect), or through all plant species being more productive in mixture (called the complementary effect). Complementarity is of particular interest because it can generate transgressive overyielding (i.e. greater yield than the best monoculture). Complementarity can result from resource partitioning or pathogen dilution.\n\n\nAcross all years, complementarity increased with plant species richness and over time. Complementarity also increased with precipitation, as monoculture yield declined with high precipitationas expected from greater accumulation of pathogens. Two species mixtures that included multiple plant families showed greater complementarity than those that included two species from the same plant familyas predicted by phylogenetic structure of pathogen specialization.\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect evidence of the dynamics of soil pathogens and pathogen dilution generating overyielding\n\n\nMicrobiome composition, particularly pathogenic and saprotrophic soil fungi, shifted with plant composition after one growing season. After three growing seasons, saprotrophic fungi, pathogenic fungi, oomycetes, AM fungi, and bacteria, were strongly differentiated with plant composition and with precipitation.\n\n\nAfter one growing season, we found that plants generally grew worse with soil microbes from monocultures from conspecifics than other species. The strength of this negative feedback was predicted by the observed soil fungal pathogen and oomycete dissimilarities, consistent with accumulation of host specific pathogens suppressing yield in monoculture.\n\n\nIncreasing diversity of plant species in the plots may be expected to dilute host-specific soil pathogens, potentially generating overyielding. We found evidence of this, as plots with stronger average negative feedback showed greater complementarity in the next year, consistent with dilution of host-specific soil pathogens being important drivers of overyielding. We confirm this interpretation by fitting a general model of plant community dynamics to the data which showed that pathogen-driven negative feedback maintains plant species coexistence and pathogen-driven complementarity. Finally, the strength of complementarities dependence on pathogen dissimilarities increased over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nDilution of foliar pathogens is common and also generates overyielding \n\n\nWe found that foliar diseases were generally reduced in plots with many plant species and in plots with species with many plant families. We also found that the foliar pathogen dilution predicted complementarity, consistent with foliar pathogen dilution contributing to overyielding.\n\n\n\n\n\nDirect evidence of resource partitioning contributing to overyielding \n\n\nWe found evidence that resource partitioning contributes to overyielding. Generally, complementarity increased in plots that included plant species having highly different traits and these relationships increased over time. As these plant traits likely relate to mechanisms of resource acquisition, this result is consistent with resource partitioning contributing to overyielding.\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary of evidence for pathogens driving productivity benefits of plant species richness\n\n\nOverall, we have evidence that pathogen dynamics can contribute to coexistence of plant species and can generate the pattern of increasing plant species richness with increasing precipitation. We also find that overyielding increases with precipitation, as monoculture yield declines with precipitation, as expected from stronger pathogen impacts. We find direct evidence that host specific soil and foliar pathogens accumulate in monocultures thereby suppressing yield and are diluted with plant diversity, thereby contributing to overyielding. This interpretation is supported by independent inoculation studies and theoretical modeling. We also find evidence that resource partitioning also contributes to overyielding.\n\n\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts\n\n\nWith this project, we trained eight graduate students and six postdoctoral scholars. We trained many undergraduates, including seven Research Experience for Undergraduates, and three postgraduate scholars. Graduate students supported by this grant participated in elementary school outreach supporting understanding of local ecology in both Spanish and English-speaking classrooms. We presented results from this project at many public events including native plant organizations, prairie restoration conferences, art museums, churches, and master gardener associations.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/15/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JamesDBever\n"
