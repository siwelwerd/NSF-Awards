 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to understand how commonly experienced levels of insufficient sleep may affect decision making in important 2-person strategic interactions.  Sleep deprivation is considered a public heath epidemic by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and current sleep trends indicate that approximately 30% of the U.S. adult population receives 6-7 hours or fewer of nightly sleep.  And, while research has made significant advances at understanding how sleep restriction affects decision making, the domain of interactive decisions and social tasks is largely unstudied.  Simple strategic interactions are the building blocks of more complicated decision environments that highlight prosocial (or anti-social) behavior and the benefits from social interactions.  Therefore, this research will not only advance science, but it will also benefit society in furthering our understanding of the full costs of current trends regarding insufficient sleep.  Additional benefits from this research include research assistants training in both economics and psychology, thus extending the interdisciplinary benefits of the project to the level of student engagement.\r\n\r\nA main objective of this project is to examine strategic 2-person interactions in well-rested (WR) and sleep-restricted (SR) subjects.  An ecologically valid at-home sleep restriction protocol will be administer to young adult subjects. The at-home protocol more closely mirrors one's naturalistic sleep environment compared to a sleep lab, thus delivering high external validity regarding the sleep manipulation.  The strategic decision tasks planned are selected to help identify key cognitive components of decision making affected by sleep (e.g., backwards induction, optimism, use of heuristics).  Sleep levels will be randomly assigned to subjects and then passively but objectively measured using wrist-worn actigraphy for a full week of treatment sleep (SR=5-6 hrs/night attempted sleep; WR=8-9 hrs/night attempted sleep).  Following the treatment week, subjects will be administered a set of strategic decision tasks involving cooperation, coordination, and zero-sum bargaining.  Because these tasks form the building blocks of more complicated real world strategic environments, this research hopes to make significant contributions to our understanding of how common levels of insufficient sleep may harm the outcomes and efficiency realized from social interactions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project set out to study the impact of commonly experienced levels of insufficient sleep on decision making in strategic interaction settings.  Several merits to our approach can be highlighted.  First, we studied sleep levels, randomized across participants, that approximated either the recommended nightly sleep levels (i.e., around 8 hours per night) or an insufficient level of nightly sleep estimated to impact tens of millions of U.S. adults (i.e., around 6 hours per night).  Secondly, participants experienced their assigned sleep level (restricted sleep or well rested) for a full week prior to decision making in their home-setting.  The use of one's home-setting while varying sleep levels in a controlled fashion helps increase the confidence we have regarding how our findings can be extended to the real world.  Also, we measured sleep levels in a passive but objective fashion, using research-grade sleep tracking devices so that we did not rely on self-reported sleep, which is known to be subject to some bias.  Then, after the sleep treatment week, participants completed incentivized decision tasks that have previously been vetted in the literature. \n\nAll these features of our project design help maximize the likelihood that findings can be transferred \"outside the lab\" regarding what we might expect from real-world decision makers in strategic settings with realistic levels of insufficient sleep.  There is broad impact to the methodology we used given the interdisciplinary nature of the study of sleep and behavior.  Additionally, the project provided training for several undergraduate research assistants majoring in economics and psychology, thus enhancing their educational experience and giving students exposure to research methods and protocols.\n\nThere were several key outcomes from this project.  First, we were able to establish the validity of the at-home sleep manipulation protocol.  Other researchers will be able to take advantage of this if desiring an established and validated way to manipulate sleep in a realistic setting in order to study human participants in well-rested versus sleep-restricted states.  Regarding decision making effects, our results suggest that insufficient sleep generally promotes less effortful decision making.  One specific example was that study participants were more likely to cheat for monetary gain when in the restricted sleep state.  Other researchers have suggested that it takes deliberation to avoid the temptation to be dishonest, and our results would support this view that insufficient sleep reduces deliberation in these tasks (and, therefore, more cheating is observed).  Another key finding was with respect to the impact of insufficient sleep on interpersonal conflict resolution.  Here, our data from a simplified bargaining task suggests that when participants could not voluntarily resolve their dispute (in our case, dispute was over a sum of money and how it would be split), this tended to make it even less likely they could voluntarily resolve their next dispute.  Sleep restriction was found to significantly magnify this effect.  One interpretation of this finding is that when bargainers are sleepy, they are more likely to become caught in a trap of unsuccessful conflict resolution.  Both of these findings have broad implications given that moral choice and interpersonal conflict are widespread, and it suggests that current trends of insufficient sleep in society are costly in ways we do not typically consider (e.g., not sleeping enough increases dishonesty and reduces the capacity to resolve interpersonal conflict).\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/12/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David L Dickinson"
