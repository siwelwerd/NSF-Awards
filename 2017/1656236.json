 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mosquitoes are extremely important insects because most species blood feed on vertebrates to reproduce.  Blood feeding also underlies why some mosquitoes transmit microbes like malaria parasites and Zika virus that can cause severe disease in humans.  Hormones are molecules that coordinate functions between different organs, tissues and cells.  Prior studies implicate specific hormones in regulating mosquito reproduction and immune defenses against disease-causing microbes, but the molecular mechanisms involved are largely unknown.  This project will identify the immune responses that hormones activate in mosquitoes after blood feeding, how these immune responses affect microbes that infect mosquitoes, and how activation of the immune system affects reproduction.  These goals will be met by conducting molecular and functional experiments that analyze particular aspects of mosquito reproduction and immunity.  The broader scientific impacts of the study will significantly enhance understanding of mosquito immunity with applied relevance to disease transmission in humans and other vertebrates.  Results will also provide fundamental insights into processes that operate in all animals.  Broader impacts to society include new information about the biology of mosquitoes that affect human populations. They also include scientific training of students at the post-graduate, graduate and undergraduate levels, and development of educational programming for use at the middle and high school level.\r\n\r\nThe immune system provides fitness benefits by defending organisms from infection, yet also has potential costs, because immune defenses can be self-damaging or energetically expensive.  Understanding these trade-offs and how organisms regulate immune defenses relative to functions like reproduction are issues of long-standing, fundamental interest, yet are difficult to study at the physiological and molecular level.  Mosquitoes provide a powerful study system for addressing these questions because reproduction and infection are often coupled.  This application focuses on how two hormones, insulin peptide 3 (ILP3) and ovary ecdysteroidogenic hormone (OEH), regulate immunity during reproduction of Aedes aegypti and select other mosquito species.  Specific aims are: 1) characterize the signaling and immune responses ILP3 activates in hemocytes, 2) assess whether ILP3 and OEH activate humoral defenses in the fat body and gut, 3) determine whether immune activation enhances defense or reduces reproduction, and 4) assess whether immune activation during reproduction is a conserved response.  Aims 1 and 2 will be addressed through transcriptome, signaling pathway, and functional studies.  Aim 3 will be addressed by measuring pathogen mortality, mosquito survival, and egg production.  Aim 4 will be addressed through comparative assays.  Results will provide new insights into endocrine-immune interactions in mosquitoes and processes that occur in all animals.  Research and education will be integrated through post-graduate, graduate and undergraduate training.  Study modules will be developed for middle and high school students.  Scientific results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nMosquitoes are extremely important insects because females of most species must blood feed on vertebrates to reproduce. Blood feeding also underlies why some mosquitoes transmit pathogens like malaria parasites, viruses and certain types of worms that can cause severe disease in humans. Hormones are molecules that coordinate functions between different organs, tissues and cells in all animals. Prior studies implicate hormones in regulating reproduction and immune defenses in mosquitoes against disease-causing organisms. In contrast, the specific identity of these hormones and how they function are incompletely understood. To address these questions, we conducted a series of experiments in several different mosquito species.\n\n\nWe report that hormones closely related to insulin that humans produce control reproduction and immune cell growth in mosquitoes. These insulin-like hormones are released in response to blood feeding. After release, insulin-like hormones control pathways in reproductive organs that activate the development of egg cells, and concurrently stimulate immune cells to divide. Activating egg cells enables females to produce and lay eggs after blood feeding. Increasing the number of immune cells in circulation protects mosquitoes from bacteria that naturally inhabit the digestive system but can invade the body of mosquitoes after a blood meal. Increasing the abundance of immune cells provides no increase in defense against pathogens that mosquitoes transmit. Our results also show that the same insulin-like hormones control egg formation and immune cell growth in all groups of mosquitoes that blood feed. In contrast, some mosquitoes have evolved to reproduce without blood feeding. In these species, insulin-like hormones still regulate egg formation but no longer control the growth of immune cells. We hypothesize this shift has occurred because mosquitoes that no longer blood feed are at very low risk of infection from bacteria in the digestive system.\n\n\nAltogether, results from the study significantly enhance understanding of how mosquitoes produce eggs and control the growth of immune cells in the circulatory system. These results are important because they explain how blood feeding activates reproduction in mosquitoes and how the immune system affects pathogens that infect or are transmitted by mosquitoes. Findings also provide new tools for inhibiting mosquito reproduction, which can reduce mosquito populations and risks of disease transmission to humans and other animals.\n\n\nBroader impacts to society include new information about the biology of mosquitoes that affect human populations. The study also provided scientific training to students at the post-graduate, graduate and undergraduate levels. This training enabled several individuals to secure permanent positions as scientists in universities and government institutes. It also enabled several undergraduate students to continue their education in science related disciplines. Educational materials developed as broader impacts for the project were used by middle and high school students from rural backgrounds. These materials helped teachers explain how mosquitoes transmit pathogens to humans, livestock and pets like dogs. Materials also provided guidance on how citizens can help reduce risks from mosquito-borne diseases.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/21/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MichaelRStrand\n"
