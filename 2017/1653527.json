 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI Name:  Amama\r\nProposal Number: 1653527     \r\n\r\nNO2 is one of six priority air pollutants regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency and has been linked to health problems (lung diseases, strokes, ischemic heart disease, and cancer), formation of ground-level ozone, and fine-particle pollution. Under ultraviolet (UV) light, titanium dioxide (TiO2) oxidizes low-level NOx (~1 ppm or below) in air to harmless nitrates. This project will provide the framework for the coupling of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and TiO2 with the goal of enabling low-cost and large-area CNT-based/TiO2 coatings for efficient outdoor pollution control. This technology is expected to provide significant improvement in urban air quality and combat ozone at the source. The educational plan will simultaneously advance scientific discovery and increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) pipeline, as well as equip engineering students at Kansas State University (KSU) with skillsets for innovative and successful careers in nanotechnology.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to integrate nanotechnology and heterogeneous catalysis to fabricate well-tailored and multifunctional CNT-based composites for environmental remediation. The PI will test the broad hypothesis that photocatalytic activity and photoresponse of CNT-supported TiO2 nanocomposites (CNT/TiO2) are enhanced by the properties of CNTs and resulting interfacial charge transfer properties. The research goal will be achieved by pursuing the following specific tasks: 1) scalable synthesis of highly uniform CNTs [metallic single-walled CNTs (m-SWCNTs), semiconducting SWCNTs (s-SWCNTs), and multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs)] using an industrial waste gas from Fischer-Tropsch synthesis as a feedstock; 2) controlled CNT functionalization and coupling of CNTs and TiO2 using UV light and a green solvent (H2O2); 3) elucidation of the coupling mechanisms between CNTs and TiO2; and 4) evaluation of the photocatalytic activity of CNT/TiO2 in the oxidation of NOx under various environmental and material variables. This study will illuminate the coupling mechanisms between TiO2 and CNTs and establish structure-property-function relationships. The work is a novel means for maximizing charge-separation efficiency of TiO2 and extending its photoresponse to the visible-light region. The resulting s-SWCNT/TiO2 photocatalyst will provide a transformative pathway for the synthesis of visible-light-active, low-cost, efficient, and large-area CNT-based/TiO2 coatings for the photocatalytic oxidation of NOx. Creation of a scalable and controlled CVD synthesis approach for s-SWCNTs and m-SWCNTs that are orders-of-magnitude higher than conventional post-purification methods will be transformative, as it is a necessary first step for scalable synthesis of well-tailored SWCNT/TiO2 photocatalysts. The use of UV/H2O2 for CNT functionalization during TiO2 deposition will ensure that electrons are freely shuttled along the CNTs; this approach differs from conventional approaches, which largely involve the use of aggressive acid treatment that imparts significant defects on CNTs. The resulting structure-property-function correlations of CNT/TiO2 photocatalysts will substantially improve understanding of the coupling mechanisms and lay a solid foundation for the adoption of the nanocomposites in a number of photocatalytic applications including water splitting, air purification, CO2 reduction, water purification, and microbial inactivation. The international exchange program will benefit both research and education at KSU, as US students will gain valuable global perspective--a critical skill for an engineer in the 21st century.",

The study is motivated by the two major limitations of TiO<sub>2</sub>: rapid recombination rate of holes and electrons and a wide band gap that confines its photoactivity to the UV range. The research methodology involved coupling TiO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;with metallic and semiconducting nanomaterials to form Schottky junctions and heterojunctions, respectively. Tasks completed included scalable and controlled synthesis of nanomaterials (carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, and MXenes) and coupling of the nanomaterials with TiO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;to form hybrid photocatalysts. In concert with this research work, the PI pursued an educational plan to increase the STEM pipeline and equip chemical engineering students at Kansas State University (K-State) with skillsets for innovative and successful careers in a multicultural environment.</p>\n<p class=\"default0\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"default0\">Nitrogen oxides (NOx) are classified as criteria air pollutants by the Environmental Pollution Agency (EPA) because they pose severe risks to human health and the environment. We studied the effects of reaction conditions that are relevant to practical applications (relative humidity, initial concentration, and headspace or reactor geometry) on NOx photocatalytic oxidation over standard TiO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;(P25) and the synthesized CNT-TiO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;films. In terms of the De-NOx index (Figure 1A), CNT-TiO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;photocatalyst significantly outperforms P25 in its De-NO<sub>x</sub>&nbsp;ability, especially at higher humidity levels (~50%), which is typical for most periods of the year in major cities. However, while the trend in DeNOx appears to be similar at low humidity for P25 and CNT-TiO<sub>2</sub>, the CNT-TiO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;photocatalyst is far superior at oxidizing the toxic intermediate (NO<sub>2</sub>). CNT-TiO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;catalyst is more robust and exhibits superior performance after repeated use and aging for a year (Figure 1B), especially at higher humidity levels. Given the pivotal role played by water in the oxidation of NOx as studies were conducted under different humidity levels, we used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis to probe the amount of chemisorbed and physisorbed water on the hybrid and convention (P25) photocatalysts. Based on the results, the remarkable DeNOx performance observed with CNT-TiO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;is attributed to the significantly higher ratio of physisorbed-to-chemisorbed water on the surface of CNT-TiO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;compared to P25.</p>\n<p class=\"default0\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"default0\">In addition to coupling CNTs to TiO<sub>2</sub>, we explored the use of 2D nanocarbons and metal carbides (graphene and MXenes, respectively) for coupling.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>We developed a facile, low-cost, efficient, and fluorine-free one-step hydrothermal process to synthesize delaminated, OH-terminated MXene (Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>). The Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>sheets were successfully coupled with commercial TiO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;to form a hybrid photocatalyst (TiO<sub>2</sub>-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-OH). As shown in Figure 1C, MXenes synthesized via the one-step process and coupled with TiO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;exhibited a purification effect and a positive DeNOx index, while hybrids obtained by coupling MXenes obtained from the conventional method (using HF for etching Al) showed a detoxification effect, evidenced by its negative DeNOx index. The activities of the hybrid photocatalyst (TiO<sub>2</sub>-Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>-OH), along with other state-of-the-art photocatalysts, were evaluated in the abatement of NOx and compared in the spider chart in Figure 1D. The MXene-TiO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;hybrid obtained from this study exhibited the highest DeNOx index, selectivity toward innocuous nitrates, and NO conversion.</p>\n<p class=\"default0\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"default0\">In photocatalysis, semiconducting SWCNTs are required for the formation of heterojunctions. Due to the inverse relationship of band gap and SWCNT diameter, a band gap of ~1 eV requires SWCNTs to have diameters less than 1 nm. Unfortunately, traditional catalytic CVD growth of SWCNT forest typically yields wide-diameter distributions (&gt; 1. 5 nm). Given the overwhelming number of potential parameter spaces to optimize, we employed an autonomous research system (ARES) at the AFRL to increase the rate of experimentation and improve the growth optimization process. By performing over 200 growth experiments in ARES with the different feedstocks and extensive multi-excitation Raman spectroscopic characterization, we demonstrated that Ru-promoted Co catalyst nearly doubles the selectivity of small-diameter SWCNTs (diameters below 1nm) at 750&deg;C in comparison to Co. At higher temperatures between 800 and 850&deg;C, Ru stabilizes Co catalyst nanoparticles and increases the selectivity of small-diameter SWCNTs by almost a factor of three. Results reveal that SWCNT diameters are not only dependent on catalyst properties but also the type of feedstock.
