 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF large facilities are major science and engineering research platforms that serve whole research communities. Cyberinfrastructure (CI) comprises advanced computing, data and software infrastructure, networking, related cybersecurity, and related training and workforce development -- all also designed to broadly serve the research community. NSF facilities are increasingly depending on CI -- including that within a facility as well as existing CI resources and capabilities located outside the facility. This award supports the conduct of a National Science Foundation Large Facilities Cyberinfrastructure Workshop in Alexandria, Virginia on September 6 and 7, 2017. The workshop has the overall goal of enabling direct and synergistic interactions among the NSF large facilities community and the cyberinfrastructure (CI) community to jointly address the CI needs and sustainability of existing and future large facilities.  \r\n\r\nObjectives of the workshop include developing a common understanding of current and evolving large facilities CI architectures, design and operational practices, issues and gaps; and identifying common CI requirements, solutions and opportunities for interoperability and sharing elements across facilities. Desired outcomes include disseminating practices that can aid future large facilities in developing and sustaining CI; enabling CI developers to most effectively target facility needs; exploring means for continuing and sustaining the community conversation and activities initiated at the workshop; and generating input that can inform future NSF planning for CI-related programs.  The report from the workshop will be publically posted, and this activity is anticipated to have broad impacts in advancing the needs of large scale science and engineering research.",

The overarching goal of the workshop was to enable direct and synergistic interactions among the NSF large facilities and the CI communities to jointly address the CI needs as well as the sustainability of the CI of existing and future large facilities.\n\nThe workshop was preceded by a pre-workshop survey and the collection of white papers from the facilities.

The workshop program was developed on the basis of the survey responses and was primarily composed of 4 panels focused on key crosscutting issues followed by breakout discussions on each panel topic.\n\nThe white papers and survey responses provide a wealth of information about facilities? CI and its operation. An initial analysis of the white papers to identify crosscutting requirements and challenges, architectural patterns, effective practices, and opportunities for sharing interoperability was one of the post-workshop activities.\n\nOverall, the workshop provided a unique forum for interaction and frank discussions between the facilities and CI communities on important issues related to the facilities? CI, and was viewed as constructive by all participants. Workshop details as well as related material are available at http://facilitiesci.org/.\n\nThe key findings and corresponding recommended actions summarized below are synthesized by the steering committee from the pre-workshop survey responses, white papers, and discussions and feedback from the community before, during, and after the workshop, including the pre- and post-workshop surveys and workshop panels and breakouts. There was also an overall view among the participants that while this workshop was effective and resulted in useful discussions and insights, a longer term sustained activity that combines crosscutting as well as topic-focused discussions is needed to fully address the challenges and opportunities related to large facilities? CI.\n\nKey findings:\n\n- The need for, and benefits of, close interactions, collaborations, and sharing among the facilities and with the CI communities are well recognized, including the sharing of CI- related expertise, technical solutions, best practices, and innovations across NSF large facilities as well as research facilities outside NSF (DOE, NIH, NASA, etc.).\n\n- There is a lack of effective mechanisms and funding structures to support interactions and sharing among facilities regarding their CI. There is also a lack of a facilities? CI community that can collectively address CI sustainability and help provide continuity between existing and future facilities.\n\n- There is a need for, and a current lack of, easily accessible information about current CI technologies, solutions, practices, and experiences.\n\n- There is a critical lack of a focused entity that could facilitate interactions and sharing across facilities. A model such as that used by the NSF-funded Center for Trustworthy Scientific Cyberinfrastructure (CTSC) was explicitly and repeatedly noted as an effective model that should be explored to address this gap.\n\n- The constantly changing technology and CI landscape highlights the tradeoffs between longer stability and incorporating new and potentially more effective/efficient solutions. A crosscutting approach for addressing these tradeoffs is missing, as are mechanisms and funding for evolving/refactoring facilities? CI.\n\n- Workforce development, training, retention, career paths, and diversity are major crosscutting challenges that the community shares. They may be best addressed coherently across all facilities through a coordinated approach.\n\nRecommended Actions:\n\n- Foster the creation of a facilities? CI community and establish mechanisms and resources to enable the community to interact, collaborate, and share.\n\n- Support the creation of a curated portal and knowledge base to enable the discovery and sharing of CI-related challenges, technical solutions, innovations, best practices, personnel needs, etc., across facilities and beyond.\n\n- Establish a center of excellence (following a model similar to the NSF-funded Center for Trustworthy Scientific Cyberinfrastructure, CTSC) as a resource providing expertise in CI technologies and best practices related to large-scale facilities as they conceptualize, start up, and operate.\n\n- Establish structures and resources that bridge the facilities and that can strategically address workforce development, training, retention, career paths, and diversity, as well as the overall career paths for CI-related personnel.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ivan Rodero"
