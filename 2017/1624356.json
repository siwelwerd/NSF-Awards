 "awd_abstract_narration": "Researchers in high energy physics seek to understand the fundamental nature of matter and the basic forces through which it interacts. One way they do this is by observing what happens when counter-rotating beams of protons collide. The characteristics of the debris produced in the collisions can reveal the basic physics of fundamental particles and the forces between them. Highly sophisticated particle detectors and analysis methods are required to measure these characteristics. NSF provides funding to US researchers to conduct research in experimental high energy physics using the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world?s premier laboratory for this research. In addition to directly supporting research activities, NSF will provide, via this award, funding to twenty-nine US universities to maintain the operation of US-supplied components of the CMS detector and its supporting software and computing systems, carry out technical planning and development that will enable future enhancements to CMS?s detection capabilities, and promote science education and outreach. The Large Hadron Collider is located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) near Geneva Switzerland.\r\n\r\nUS participation in CMS will stimulate the development of a scientific and technically educated workforce, advancing the multidisciplinary application of technology, and the popularization and dissemination of science to the general public. The award will support activities that provide opportunities to develop and maintain complex detector apparatus, custom analog and digital electronics and software systems for data management, data processing and technical analysis. Technical professionals are required to perform many of these tasks, increasing the expertise of the US work force. The operation of existing detector components, design of upgrade components, and related research activities create opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration among university physics personnel, university personnel in engineering departments, and physics department technical personnel as  physicists, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers and computer scientists work with post-docs and students. Similarly, physics personnel will work closely with computing professionals at their home institutions and at national laboratories to support the various software and computing activities.\r\nTechnical part: This award supports the development and operation of the instrumentation and analysis tools that are essential to studying debris from proton-proton collisions. These tools are essential for answering basic, foundational questions, such as ?What is the origin of mass of the elementary particles?? The Higgs Boson discovery, a physical manifestation of the mechanism that generates elementary particle masses, led to the 2013 Physics Nobel Prize that was awarded to Peter Higgs and Francois Englert. Is that the end of the story, or are there other, as-of-yet undiscovered, contributions to this process?  Other fundamental questions, equally important, may have answers that depend, at least in part, on the physics observed through the continued operation and analysis of data obtained from the LHC. ?What is the dark matter that accounts for 25% of the mass of the universe? Can dark matter be produced and observed at the LHC? Can evidence of extra dimensions predicted in some models be found at LHC energies? Are there particles with exotic properties, unlike any forms of matter observed so far, whose existence is predicted by some theories that extend the standard model of elementary particles??  In each case, answering the question requires the aggregation of large amounts of data from which to draw meaningful statistical inferences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award provided funds for the operation of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland.   The CMS collaboration comprises over 2500 scientists, engineers, and technicians from all around the world.  The efforts\nof U.S. scientists, who represent roughly 30% of the collaboration, are critical to the successful operation of CMS.   Specific contributions include the work of scientists and engineers who ensure that the CMS detector operates properly during data taking as well as a complex of \"Tier 2\" computing facilities.   The Tier 2 centers, which are distributed across seven U.S. universities, are used for data analysis and the generation of simulated events.    \nAward funds were also used to carry out research and development efforts for a planned upgraded CMS detector that will be capable of handling the increased radiation levels and data rates from an upgraded High-Luminosity LHC accelerator complex that will commence operation late in the \ncurrent decade.  \n\nAlthough the work of scientists who analyse the data produced by the CMS detector is funded through separate research awards, these data and the tools to used analyze them would not exist without the work funded through this award.   Physics results produced during the funding period include precision studies of the Higgs boson.   This particle, which is the capstone of the \nhighly successful standard model of particle physics, was discovered at the LHC in 2012.   The data taken during this award period reveal that the properties of the Higgs boson are consistent to within experimental uncertainties with standard model expectations.   The standard model is, however, known to be incomplete, motivating several searches for beyond-the-standard-model (BSM) phenomena, which were also undertaken during the period of this award.    Although these searches have thus far revealed nothing new, they have placed constraints on BSM models that will guide future experimental and theoretical efforts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel R Marlow"
