The activations of catalysts using plasmas holds great promise for increasing the efficiency of catalytic systems with potential applications in a broad spectrum industries, including chemical and materials synthesis, environmental remediation, and energy generation. The overriding goal of the project is to investigate the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for the synergistic effects of plasma with catalysts. The plan is to correlate the magnitude of the plasma catalytic synergistic effect(s) with incident reactive species fluxes, along with changes in catalyst surface properties, and surface electronic structure. A careful systematic comparison of the different catalysts may elucidate the microscopic origins of the synergistic effect and explore potential plasma activation of thermally inactive catalysts. The project may lead to better understanding of the requirements for plasma conditions and catalysts to fully exploit the synergistic potential of plasma-catalyst systems.\r\n\r\nA mechanistic study is proposed that is aimed at providing atomistic insights to unravel the key mechanisms responsible for the synergistic effect(s) during plasma-catalyst interactions. Iron, nickel, cobalt, and copper supported catalysts (on alumina and silica supports) will be employed in this study. These catalysts vary strongly in thermal catalytic activities due to different electronic structure and surface-catalytic mechanisms. The investigation will be focused on studying atomistic surface modifications of the catalysts for the oxygen/methane model system as the plasma-surface interaction conditions are changed. This will include the impact of these surface changes on the products formed and their formation rates. Gas phase characterization will be achieved by molecular beam mass spectrometry and two-photon laser induced fluorescence. Surface characterization will include ellipsometry, ultra-violet and x-ray induced photoemission spectroscopy coupled with thermal desorption, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.  The proposed approach has the potential to make transformative changes to the current state-of-the-art by enabling a mechanistically informed design of catalysts ideally suited for plasma-catalyst synergies. In addition to training graduate and undergraduate students, the investigators plan to develop course material on plasma-catalysis and an interactive lecture for middle school students.",

The lack of understanding of fundamental mechanisms of plasma-catalyst interactions impedes further improvements of plasma-catalysis technology. One of the obstacles to achieve such goal is the implementation of in-situ surface characterization in plasma-catalyst systems where the plasma source usually is in close contact with the catalyst. We have developed a FTIR-based facility that is able to do both real-time gas phase measurements and in-situ surface characterization by DRIFTS employing a well-characterized remote plasma jet fed with either Ar/O<sub>2</sub> or Ar/O<sub>2</sub>/CH<sub>4</sub> that interacts with a heated supported nickel catalyst. We investigated the effects of plasma power, catalyst temperature and plasma feed gas composition on the conversion of CH<sub>4</sub> into CO and CO<sub>2</sub> products. Our collaborators at University of Minnesota characterized the species produced by an identical plasma jet and operated under the same conditions with modulated beam mass spectrometry. By correlating incident plasma-produced species, gaeous product species and surface species, we identified atomic oxygen as the key species that contributes to the plasma-catalytic CH<sub>4 </sub>conversion. This is illustrated in the first image for the catalyst at both room temperature and at 500 C where selected products and the loss of CH<sub>4</sub> are shown as a function of the incident oxygen atom flux. For the low temperature catalyst the reaction is all induced by plasma species, whereas at high temperature thermal catalysis dominates at low plasma power, but at high plasma power is overwhelmed by plasma effects. In the other image, gas phase and surface measurements are compared. This image shows that surface CO follows surface CH<sub>n</sub> at 25 C, and correlates with the CO gas phase production rate. This indicates that surface CH<sub>n</sub> is transformed to surface CO, and ultimately gas phase CO. At elevated catalyst temperature, the density of surface CH<sub>n</sub> remains low because of spontaneous, thermally driven oxidation. This results in a strong increase of surface CO and gas phase CO<sub>2</sub>. These results suggest that dissociation of CH<sub>4</sub> to CH<sub>n</sub> and adsorption at the catalyst surface may be the rate-determining step for these operating conditions, consistent the results of work in which CH<sub>4</sub> is admitted to the plasma source, and which resulted in much higher conversion of CH<sub>4</sub> to oxygen containing products. The surface spectroscopic studies of CO on the nickel catalyst also showed systematic shifts of CO vibrational frequency with operating conditions. The atomistic interpretation of such shifts using computational approaches is promising for understanding plasma-catalyst synergy better, and a collaborative effort is currently underway.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact.</strong> The gas phase and surface measurement methodologies demonstrated in this work can be applied to the study of other plasma catalysis systems, including nitrogen fixation, ammonia synthesis and related approaches. The experience of collaborative efforts and exposure to broad levels of technical expertise will make the graduate students involved in this work highly successful in their future career paths, including research and development positions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/19/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gottlieb&nbsp;S&nbsp;Oehrlein</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1703211/1703211_10499697_1634672278418_Project_Outcome_figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1703211/1703211_10499697_1634672278418_Project_Outcome_figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Atomic oxygen impact on CH4 interaction with Ni catalyst\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1703211/1703211_10499697_1634672278418_Project_Outcome_figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Atomic oxygen impact on CH4 interaction with Ni catalyst\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Impact of atomic oxygen on loss of CH4 and formation of CO and CO2 for a Ni catalyst at both 25 \ufffdC and 500 \ufffdC interacting with an atmospheric pressure plasma jet using various working gas compositions.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yudong Li and Gottlieb S.
