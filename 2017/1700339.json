 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Initiation Awards provide support for faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities who are building a research program. It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at her home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Albany State University has potential broader and societal impact in a number of areas. The project focuses on contributing to the knowledge in solar energy science by studying the instability and toxicity of perovskite photovoltaic cells, while maintaining competitive efficiency. Undergraduate students, as well as high school students and teachers will gain research experiences.  The project will be a first step in building  a sustainable solar cell research program at the institution. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the project is to concurrently address two critical issues of perovskite solar cells, instability and toxicity, without compromising performance. To achieve this, environmentally-friendly novel perovskite Cex(CH3NH3)1-xGeI3 will be synthesized with a facile, low cost approach to realize fortified\r\nstability and enhanced performance.  A simple device with p-i-n planar architecture will be constructed.  Lead will be replaced with germanium to minimize toxicity, and cesium partially incorporated to fortify stability. Meanwhile, the fundamental operative mechanism of perovskite solar cells will be elucidated by investigating cells with various configurations. The findings gained in the project will enrich knowledge in the photovoltaic field, facilitating the process of various practical applications and commercialization of perovskite solar cells. Particularly, the comprehensive understanding of the operative mechanisms will have a far-reaching impact on rational device design and optimizing device performance. The research will be integrated into introductory physics courses as well as analytical chemistry courses more appropriate for senior undergraduate students.",

It represented the establishment of a new clean energy research project, which added another dimension to the existing research programs on ASU campus to enhance research capacity and opportunities.

The first objective was to develop halide lead free perovskite Cs<sub>x</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>1-x</sub>GeI<sub>3</sub> as a light absorber in solar cells. As the first-year annual report indicated, replacement of Ge of lead had been attempted which renders perovskite even more instable. Then the research direction was diverted to partially substitute innocuous manganese for toxic lead. Our findings have proved that the compounds of CsPb<sub>x</sub>Mn<sub>1-x</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>I still possess the semi-conducting crystal structure of perovskite. Not only they could act as light absorbing layers in perovskite solar cells thanks to their photovoltaic properties, but they are less toxic due to the partial replacement of lead. Noteworthy is the improved stability when compared with the organic-inorganic hybrid counterparts. &nbsp;The article has been published on Georgia Journal of Science (2022,Vol. 80, No. 2, Article 9). Although the lead has not been completely substituted due to the constraints of perovskite crystal structure, the exploration of all-inorganic perovskites with reduced toxicity is significant which could guide more research towards this direction. Therefore, the first-year objective was completed. The second objective was to identify the best electron/hole transporting materials to build p-i-n heterojunction to optimize the performance of perovskite solar cells.&nbsp; Zinc Oxide (ZnO)was proposed to act as electron transporting layers. A new synthesis method was tried which allowed us to successfully grow ZnO nanowires, which outperforms ZnO in nanoparticles as they have better carrier transporting properties. Meanwhile, in order to explore further, the mixture of ZnO&nbsp; nanowires and Titanium Oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) was attempted with the conclusion of the mostly adopted electron transporting material TiO<sub>2</sub>, mixed with nanowires of ZnO with a proper ratio, could further optimize the performance of perovskite solar cells. The findings have been published on RSC Advances (RSC Adv., 2021, 11, 19705).&nbsp; The new type of hole transporting material has been experimented with and a manuscript is under review.&nbsp; Overall the second objective is completed. The third objective was to explore photovoltaic mechanisms and working principles by numerical simulation.&nbsp; The simulation software allows examination of various structure configurations of solar cells with different materials.
