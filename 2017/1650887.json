 "awd_abstract_narration": "To understand how new species evolve we need to understand the genes involved in the process and where these genes are located in the genome. Speciation results from genes that cause reproductive incompatibilities between groups of individuals, and earlier studies have suggested these genes are located on the X chromosome. This project will investigate the role of the X chromosome in the evolution of two closely related species of field crickets. These two cricket species are still capable of producing some hybrid offspring and exchanging genetic information. Populations of these species co-occur in the Northeastern U.S., where they form an extensive natural hybrid zone, in which genes have been exchanged for thousands of generations. The researchers will investigate rates of genetic mixing between the species, and determine where it occurs across the genome. This research will address the hypothesis that the X chromosome contains the genes that lead to reproductive isolation, by testing whether the X chromosome shows a lower rate of genetic exchange between species. Specific genes located within regions of low genetic exchange will also be identified to further our understanding of what is required for new species to evolve. This is a collaborative research project that will be mainly conducted at a liberal arts, undergraduate college and will provide substantial opportunity for training and mentoring of undergraduate students. Outreach includes science education workshops and activities, and will target underrepresented, middle and high school students in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will test both the importance of the X chromosome in speciation and whether observed islands of differentiation in the field crickets, Gryllus firmus and G. pennsylvanicus, reflect differential introgression and/or recent selection. The project has three main objectives. First, the X chromosome will be mapped using hybrid backcrosses and within species crosses; patterns of differentiation for these X-linked chromosome markers will be assessed. Second, gene sequences will be obtained from genome regions that show varying rates of gene exchange and differentiation between species. Genome regions with low rates of gene flow and high differentiation might harbor genes responsible for reproductive isolation and species identities. Absolute and relative measures of genetic differentiation and estimates of selection will be calculated for high differentiation regions and for control regions with low differentiation. These results will be used to test if the genome is composed of a patchwork of high and low differentiation regions. The third objective is based on the observation that there is a one-way incompatibility between the two cricket species, but that this 'rule' is broken in some population crosses. If regions of high differentiation are responsible for reproductive isolation, then there should be consistent genomic differences between pairs that produce offspring and those that do not. Results will provide important insights into the genomic architecture of speciation, the role of the X chromosome in reproductive isolation and divergent adaptation, and will contribute to ongoing debates about genomic islands of differentiation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research investigated the role of the X chromosome in the generation and maintenance of new species.  In many species the X chromosome seems to play a large role in reproductive incompatibilities between species and, as a result, has a reduced probability of crossing the species barriers.  This trend even includes the gene exchange between humans and Neanderthals, which shows evidence of reduced gene flow on the X chromosome.  Here we studied two closely related species of field crickets (Gryllus firmus and Gryllus pennsylvanicus) which form an extensive natural hybrid zone and still exchange genetic material through hybridization.  In theory we expect that, in these species that still exchange genes, alleles that are neutral or globally advantageous will be able to cross species boundaries (\"free flowing\", thus no species specificity), whereas genome regions responsible for reproductive isolation or local adaptation will not (\"restricted flow\" and species specificity). However, a similar pattern of species specificity could be observed in cases of no gene flow between species combined with strong intra-species local selection. The area outside of the selected genomic regions will be similar between species due to common ancestry, whereas the selected areas will quickly diverge and acquire species specificity.  We confirmed that genes previously classified as \"restricted flow\" were indeed concentrated across the entire X chromosome.  We sequenced the cricket genome and annotated genes; we did not detect any strong candidate genes for reproductive isolation in these areas of \"restricted flow\".  We thus tested if the pattern observed in the genome better conforms to the \"Islands of speciation model\", where most of the genome is \"free flowing\" and some areas related to reproductive isolation or local adaptation do not, or if it conforms better to an \"isolation model\" without any gene flow between species and local selection .  In the \"islands\" model we would expect elevated absolute divergence (i.e., Dxy) as well as relative divergence (i.e., Fst).  Absolute divergence can be understood as the absolute percentage difference between species or populations, whereas relative divergence is related to relative differences in allele frequencies.  In relative divergence, if two populations have different alleles, this counts as maximum differentiation even if the alleles are virtually identical (e.g., one difference in 1000 basepairs).  To calculate these two indexes of differentiation, we sequenced 5K base pairs around SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) previously classified as free-flowing or restricted-flow.  We sequenced four populations of each species and a total of 96 individuals (12 per population).   Our analyses indicated that  areas previously classified as \"restricted-flow\" indeed had higher relative divergence (Fst), but not higher absolute divergence (Dxy), suggesting that the data fits the \"isolation\" model mode closely than the \"island\" model.  We also recalculated divergence time between species using genomic DNA (rather than mitochondrial DNA), our estimate puts species divergence closer to 1 million years, significantly longer than the previous mtDNA estimates of 200K years.  This means that, despite the production of hybrid offspring in the hybrid zone, the species are not freely exchanging genes, the genetic evidence suggests a pattern that is consistent with very limited gene flow through most of the genome.  Given the longer divergence time, it makes sense that the two species would have had time to accumulate their large number of reproductive isolation barriers.  This research has been conducted with heavy participation of students at a liberal arts college (Williams College) and has contributed to their scientific education.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/18/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Luana S Maroja"
