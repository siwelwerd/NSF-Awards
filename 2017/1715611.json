 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the nature of dark matter is one of the most pressing issues in all of modern astrophysics.  This mysterious substance makes up the vast majority of the material in galaxies, including our own Milky Way Galaxy, but does not appear in any images taken of these objects.  Furthermore, dark matter is one of the two major components, along with dark energy, that make up the Universe.  While the properties of dark matter are not well known, relatively simple models of it have done a remarkable job of reproducing the distribution of galaxies in the Universe.  However, when looking on smaller scales, the models predict that thousands of small galaxies should orbit galaxies such as the Milky Way, while careful observations of the Milky Way have detected fewer than 50 satellite galaxies.  The primary goal of this project is to build up and analyze a large enough sample of rare gravitational lens systems to distinguish between different models of dark matter and, thus, to further our knowledge about one of the most important components of the Universe.  The excitement of this program will be shared with the public, with a special emphasis on introducing young people to the scientific method and to the techniques of cutting-edge astrophysics research.  This will be accomplished through specialized summer programs for high-school students, introductory-level college classes in astronomy and sustainable energy, and research projects for undergraduates.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental question underlying this project is \"what is the nature of dark matter?\".  We now know that dark matter is a major component of the mass energy of the Universe, second only to dark energy, and completely dominates the mass of galaxies and galaxy clusters.  However, the properties of the dark matter particle are not well quantified with efforts to measure these properties proceeding both in astrophysics and physics.  The proposed research utilizes four steps to better understand dark matter: (1) building better statistics by applying our gravitational imaging and flux-ratio anomaly techniques to new samples that will provide a significant increase over our current numbers, (2) significantly improving the power of the lensing approach to disentangle cold and warm dark matter by pushing orders of magnitude down the mass function of substructures, (3) develop techniques to reduce systematic errors that are now known to have affected earlier dark matter analyses, and (4) do at least two independent measurements of the substructure mass function in distant galaxies and analyze the results in the context of alternative dark matter models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe nature of dark matter is one of the biggest mysteries in astronomy and physics today.  Investigations have revealed that dark matter makes up the majority of the total matter in the Universe, being over five times as prevalent as the normal matter that scientists have studied for centuries. In spite of this ubiquity, scientists know very little about what dark matter is.  There are many theories about the nature of dark matter, and in order to learn which ones are more likely to be correct, we need to compare the predictions of the theories with observational or experimental evidence.  Providing this kind of evidence and, therefore, advancing our knowledge about dark matter was the goal of this program. This work provides an excellent complement to physics experiments that are trying to directly detect dark matter particles.\nOne of the main astronomical techniques that we can use to learn about dark matter is to determine the abundance of low-mass clumps of dark matter in the Universe.  This is because some of the major theoretical models for dark matter differ in the number of low-mass clumps that they predict, even as they agree about the statistics of high-mass clumps.  The traditional approach to doing this is to search for low-mass satellite galaxies that orbit the Milky Way.  This approach is extremely powerful, but it has two potential drawbacks.  The first is that it requires the dark matter clumps to contain stars, so that they can be identified as satellite galaxies.  The second is that there is a chance that the Milky Way differs in some way from the average galaxy in the Universe, which would mean that extrapolating from the Milky Way measurements might give an erroneous result. Therefore, our work in this project has focused on using an alternative technique, gravitational lensing, which has the ability to detect low-mass clumps of dark matter even at large distances from the Milky Way and even if they don't have stars and, thus, complements and extends the Milky Way results.\nDark matter is difficult to study because it does not emit light and therefore can only be detected by its gravitational effect.  This NSF-supported project utilizes gravitational lensing: the bending of light around massive objects such as galaxies or clumps of dark matter.  In particular, we focus on so-called \"strong gravitational lenses\", in which the near perfect alignment between a massive galaxy and a more distant galaxy causes multiple images of the background object to be formed.  These systems often show the background galaxy bent into arcs or rings that bend around the foreground galaxy (see the image for some examples).  In order to detect the presence of low-mass clumps of dark matter, we have developed sophisticated techniques that take advantage of highly detailed pictures of strong lens systems to locate additional small distortions to the images of the background galaxy.\nIn this project, we developed and tested code to analyze two existing and independent gravitational lens data sets in order to constrain theoretical models of dark matter.  This is a challenging process because not only are we looking for very small additional distortions on top of the main gravitational lensing effect, but not much information can be gained from a single lens systems.  Because the existing samples of lenses that we can use for this analysis are small, we also conducted observations with the Keck Telescopes to increase the numbers of lens systems that have detailed enough imaging for us to use for this type of analysis.  In order to get the required level of detail, we used the adaptive optics capabilities of Keck, which correct for the blurring by the Earth's atmosphere.  The accompanying figure shows some examples of the new images that we have obtained.  We have applied our new code to the existing samples and plan to analyze the new data once we have observed enough systems to significantly improve the expected constraints on dark matter properties.\nDuring the project, we have shared the excitement of astrophysics research with a diverse group of young students.  This was accomplished through a intensive summer program for high-school students who are interested in STEM fields.  The students spend four weeks living on the UC Davis campus, attending lectures in the mornings and then working on research projects during the afternoon.  They end the program by giving a presentation on the results of their research projects and then preparing a poster that they can show their parents and other students in the larger program.  We had to pause the program during the pandemic, but it has successfully restarted and we had an excellent experience in 2022.  We hope that these students will go onto studying STEM fields at the university level.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher Fassnacht"
