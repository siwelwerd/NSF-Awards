 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Molecular heterogeneity and the regulation of cell adhesion by force\r\n\r\nAll close contacts between cells inside the human body involve specialized molecules known as adhesion proteins. These molecules participate in transmitting signals, for example recruiting immune cells to the sites of inflammation, and are critical to the development and maintenance of tissues. The mechanical forces that these proteins feel when they bind to their targets can dramatically alter their behavior, controlling how long the bond endures before breaking. In many cases this regulation is counterintuitive, with larger tension leading to longer bond lifetimes, and the underlying microscopic mechanisms are poorly understood. This project aims to investigate those mechanisms through theory and computations, creating general methods for analyzing experimental data that will elucidate the molecular details of adhesion in a variety of biological contexts. The focus will be on protein heterogeneity-the diverse structural states which adhesion bonds can assume, each with its own characteristic response to applied forces. The project will integrate cutting-edge biophysics research into undergraduate education through the BIOREPS (BIOphysical REsearch Problem Set) initiative. Students in an undergraduate biophysics course will transform recent high-profile research articles into problem sets published in an open online database. These activities will give students valuable experience in scientific pedagogy and communication. The resulting database will become a unique resource, available to all educators looking for research-based course materials. \r\n\r\nThis project's research strategy is based on the following hypothesis: the regulation of adhesion protein bonds by tension can be explained by characterizing their heterogeneous conformational states, and resolving how the protein switches between states under various force conditions. This project will identify and describe the multiple conformational states of the bonds directly from data gathered by single-molecule force spectroscopy experiments. This project will develop new theoretical approaches that bridge the divide between experimental measurements and the microscopic mechanisms of adhesion to overcome the challenge of deciphering the molecular details from the data. This project will also develop structure-based models that relate observable bond dynamics in specific systems to tension-induced changes in protein configuration and bond energies. Parallel focus on data analysis and model development provides a comprehensive framework for discovery, drawing on the mutual feedback between experiment and theory. The research will provide direct insights into adhesion, but also aid the development of new and more informative experimental protocols.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project sought to develop theoretical models for adhesion proteins, the biological molecules responsible for attaching cells to one another or to other molecules in their environment.  Under natural conditions the bonds which these proteins make are constantly pulled and pushed by their surroundings.  How a bond responds to these applied forces can be complicated, in certain cases leading to quite counterintuitve behaviors:  for example pulling harder on the bond can sometimes strengthen it, allowing it to last longer before breaking (a phenomenon known as catch bonding).  Figuring out the mechanisms underlying cellular adhesion helps us understand both normal biological function, and also how the body responds to disease (i.e. how immune cells recognize their targets, or how cancer cells invade a tissue).\n\nThe scientifc outcomes of the project fell into three main categories:\n\n1) We developed models for specific adhesion protein systems:  cadherin-catenin-actin (a component of cell-cell junctions) and selectins (which help tether white blood cells to sites of inflammation).  Our models helped explain earlier experimental observations of catch bonds in these systems, and provided insights into the structural mechanisms that lead to this unusual bond behavior.\n\n2) We developed a variety of methods to analyze experimental data on cellular adhesion.  These methods ranged from analysis of microscopy images using machine learning to techniques that allow us to extract bond properties (such as mean attachment lifetime versus force) from experimental measurements.  As an example of a practical application, we worked with experimental collaborators to analyze blood samples from a group of patients with sickle cell disease.  One of the most dangerous aspects of the disease is a vaso-occlusive crisis, which occurs when sickle red blood cells adhere to proteins surrounding blood vessels.  This can block blood flow, depriving tissues of oxygen.  We studied this abnormal adhesion in an experimental setup that mimics the conditions inside blood vessels.  We found that even among sickle cell disease patients, the strength of adhesion varies widely from person to person, and in some cases sickle red blood cells exhibit catch bond behavior under increasing blood flow.  Interestingly the measured strength of adhesion correlates with the chance that patients have certain adverse clinical features (like pulmonary arterial hypertension or intracardiac shunts).  This analysis technique has the potential in the future to help doctors evaluate the effectiveness of sickle cell disease drug therapies in individual patients, by measuring how much adhesion is affected by a particular drug.\n\n3) One of the approaches we developed to analyze experimental data also had a surprising broader significance:  it was an example of a more general mathematical theory for controlling biological systems that are intrinsically random (adhesion interactions are one example, since the bond breaks and reforms in a random way).  The theory turns out to have close parallels to methods developed to control quantum systems for quantum computing applications.  We have now demonstrated applications of these control ideas in a variety of contexts:  from controlling how a single protein folds to steering an evolving population of cells (for example a bacterial infection or tumor) into states that are more susceptible to drug therapies.  We plan on exploring this unexpected side-benefit of the project further in future years.\n\nThe project also involved educational initiatives related to a biophysics course that the PI developed at Case Western Reserve University.  One component was the BIOREPS (BIOphysical REsearch Problem Set) database:  students in the course transform recent high-profile research articles into problem sets published in an open online database.  Beyond giving students experience in scientific pedagogy and communication, the database can be a valuable resource for other educators looking to develop research-based course materials.  The other component was undergraduate summer research, with many of the students recruited through the biophysics course.  The project had a good track record preparing undergraduates for future careers in science, with two of the students going on to win prestigious NSF graduate research fellowships based on their work in the project.  Additionally, the project supported three completed PhD theses to date, and another successful NSF fellowship application for a current graduate student.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael G Hinczewski"
