 "awd_abstract_narration": "Approximately 80% of the energy consumed in the United States annually is produced through combustion processes, and soot (or black carbon) is a by-product of incomplete combustion. Soot is known to have harmful impacts on the earth's climate and human health, and climate scientists have found that black carbon is the second most important man-made climate-forcing agent, falling between carbon dioxide and methane. Small-sized particles, of which soot is a dominant contributor, are thought to be responsible for a range of cardiovascular and respiratory problems and may act as a carrier for toxic combustion by-products, introducing further health effects. Thus, reducing emissions of soot from combustion processes is a critically important goal, and developing a fundamental understanding of the chemical and physical processes in combustion systems that lead to soot will be necessary. In this project, researchers are performing laser-based optical diagnostic studies aimed at understanding a critical phase in the soot formation process. These experiments are being complemented and informed by computational chemistry calculations. The results of the project will include data that will be of relevance to the combustion research community, as well as other scientists exploring the role of black carbon precursors in interstellar space and their potential use here on Earth in electronics and solar energy conversion. Finally, this project is helping to train and prepare graduate students for careers in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThis research project is based upon the hypothesis that soot inception begins with the agglomeration of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) species that are large enough to \"stick\" at flame temperatures. This project involves several new experiments designed to address this idea as well as competing models for particulate inception, and they are: (1) Broadband, cavity-enhanced absorption/extinction measurements in the near infrared spectral region for both molecular and particulate species. (2) Two-dimensional excitation/emission studies through the ultraviolet and visible to gain insight in aromatic electronic structure. (3) Wavelength-agile, angle-resolved scattering measurements to define particle fractal morphology. (4) Extension of the computational chemistry to evaluate electronic structure's role in thermodynamic stability, band gaps, and spectroscopic properties of PAH and their aggregates. (5) Application of a suite of solid-state diagnostics to thermophoretically sampled particulate including infrared and Raman spectroscopies and optical and electron microscopies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSoot (sometimes referred to as black carbon) is produced when hydrocarbon fuels are burned. In our understanding of the formation of soot in flames, an area of active debate centers on the transformation of molecular-sized species into three-dimensional particles.  Because of the deficiencies in our ability in measuring things that are bigger than molecules and smaller than particles, most of the evidence we have for this transition is circumstantial.  For example, many of the diagnostics that we had performed prior to this grant provided either average properties or were a characteristic dominated by some components of the sample.  (We lump these with the phrase ?ensemble properties? often without being certain which of these we mean.)\n\nThat is not to say that progress was not made in improving our understanding over the past 15-20 years.  For our past work (that continued throughout this grant), computational chemistry was used to provide interpretations of the experimental work.  The key finding of our earlier diagnostic work informed by these computations was that the limit of the size of the molecules that can stick together was on the order of 500 atomic mass units (also known as amu or Dalton).  What that suggested was that the molecules involved in forming particles had ~50 carbon atoms or 10 aromatic ring structures (probably a network of hexagons, like chicken wire).\n\nDuring this grant, we introduced a new experimental diagnostic to study this transition: laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry.  Something like this had been suggested by the PI to a colleague in his department decades ago but never successfully attempted.  Over the ensuing years, advances in sensitivity and selectivity in the mass spec instruments, as well as our ability to sample flames without interferences and excessive disturbance to the flame structure. \n\nWhat we learned was exciting.  First, we could identify exactly the weight of each molecule that made up the particle and say confidently what its empirical formula was (the exact number of atoms of each element in the sample.). This allowed us to state confidently, that there were few oxygen or nitrogen atoms in the soot particles.  Moreover, the distribution peaked at exactly the same size as we had concluded for our earlier diagnostics.   Further analysis also enabled us to limited the sort of bonding present in our molecules and we concluded that most of the structures were highly condensed (nearly circular), flat, fused hexagonal structures.  These results challenge some of the other models for how particles are formed and provide valuable experimental data that emerging models must explain.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J.
