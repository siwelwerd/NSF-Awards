 "awd_abstract_narration": "Black holes (BHs) are the most compact objects predicted by Einstein's theory of gravity.  Despite their tiny size, BHs are powerful actors on the cosmic stage.  Most galaxies have massive BHs at their centers.  Such BHs can drive outflows and jets that extend over galactic scales, and beyond.  The processes that link the most compact and the most extended scales originate near the BH event horizon.  Images of that region have only recently become available, thanks to the NSF-supported Event Horizon Telescope (EHT).  The team will obtain new EHT images that, for the first time, trace magnetic fields.  The team will conduct state-of-the-art simulations to compare to the new images.  This will provide strong constraints on conditions near the BH event horizon.  Senior team members will train junior team members.  The team will also partner with D.C.'s Koshland Science Museum to engage with students from groups underrepresented in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe team will (1) produce state-of-the-art simulations of BH accretion and jets with fully dynamical gas-radiation interaction that accounts for kinetic physics relevant to systems like Sagittarius A* and M87, (2) undertake polarimetric observations with the EHT to resolve BH emission on event horizon scales in Sagittarius A* and M87, and (3) apply the simulations to enable realistic modeling of the polarimetry.",
