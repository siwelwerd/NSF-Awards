 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most studies of the effect of drought on freshwater organisms have focused on short, seasonal droughts, while the effects of atypical intense droughts are not well understood. The southeastern United States has recently experienced the most extreme drought in at least 10 years.  Alabama has been particularly hard hit, with nearly 98% of the state being directly affected by drought conditions.  The lack of rainfall during Fall 2016 reduced many streams to trickles while others have completely dried; major rivers reached low levels not seen in over 60 years. Alabama is known as a global biodiversity hotspot for freshwater species of fish, amphibians, and invertebrates. Many of these species are threatened, endangered, and/or found nowhere else on Earth. This study seeks to determine the role of downstream refuges on the effect of intense droughts in aquatic ecosystems with high species diversity. The specific objectives are to: 1) determine changes in species composition in response to intense drought, 2) Identify habitat offering critical refuge from the drought to species with different movement abilities, 3) Build a predictive model of the effects of intense drought and future recovery at local and regional scales. Two graduate students and several undergraduates will be involved in the sampling and research activities of the study. This research will provide management tools to identify and protect Alabama Strategic Habitat Units. The study also will offer summer camps for middle-school students and public outreach activities to citizen science groups organized with collaboration of the Auburn University Museum of Natural History.\r\n\r\nThe study will assess the impacts of extreme drought on the dynamics of habitat use as well as evaluate the resilience of aquatic species to flash drought. The investigators hypothesize that the ability to use downstream refuge during drought is a bottleneck that varies based on species vagility and position in the stream network. Stream habitats in two drainages that have experienced the exceptional drought will be sampled and compared to historic, baseline data collected since 2012 to test this hypothesis. The study will predict shifts in distribution patterns of stream fauna in response to flash drought by combining pre-drought survey and environmental DNA (eDNA) data from streams of various sizes in two ecoregions of Alabama, with species-specific vagility potential based on functional trait databases, life history information, and professional judgment. Predicted and observed patterns will be compared using fine scale surveys, broad scale eDNA collections, and spatial analysis. The results of this investigation will provide critical information pertinent to understanding the resiliency of specific taxa and stream communities in general to drought disturbance in a global hotspot for diversity.",

Rarely has there been an opportunity where a severe drought has affected an area that had been recently and thoroughly sampled in a region as rich in aquatic biodiversity as the Mobile River Basin of Alabama. The 2016 drought in Alabama hit most strongly in areas that the Auburn University Museum of Natural History, Alabama Natural Heritage Program, and Troy University had just surveyed for aquatic biota including coastal plain and piedmont locations. Some streams completely dried and all were greatly affected by dewatering. Utilizing the same techniques as previous studies, we were able to revisit those sites to determine what the effect of the drought was in these regions. Thus far, analysis of fish data shows remarkable resilience of the fauna to these major changes, which often completely dried the sampled creeks. There were no changes to species composition or any other metrics analyzed. Species that live in low drainage order systems are likely to have experienced similar droughts in the past, although perhaps not at the same frequency, and have the ability to rapidly recolonize these habitats after a drought. Analysis of crayfish data, however, show a major change in populations pre- and postdrought. Although species of crayfish did not change, abundance tended to decline (especially in smaller streams) and many streams showed a skewed sex ratio with more males than females. Crayfishes are not as vagile (able to move) as fishes, and we had expected the drought to hit them harder than fishes. We are still analyzing the thousands of other invertebrates that we collected during this study, and it is expected that some of them may not be as resilient as fishes or crayfishes. We additionally resampled areas for the imperiled Flattened Musk Turtle (<em>Sternotherus depressus</em>) and the&nbsp;Black Warrior Waterdog (<em>Necturus alabamensis</em>). These species are difficult to observe using traditional sampling techniques, so we employed environmental DNA (eDNA). Organisms in water slough cells that contain DNA, and individual species can be identified in samples by amplifying genetic markers specific for those species from filtered water. Although there were some differences in detection between pre- and postdrought collections, the general areas occupied were the same except for two exceptions. The&nbsp;Flattened Musk Turtle was not detected at the most upstream locality in the Locust Fork and we did detect&nbsp;the&nbsp;Black Warrior Waterdog at a historical site where it was not detected pre-drought (Mulberry Fork). Our data suggests that aquatic vertebrates (fishes, amphibians, and reptiles) are resilient to extreme flash drought events, whereas crayfishes show a greater response to these droughts. We expect that analysis of other aquatic invertebrates (mostly insect larvae and nymphs) will show a greater effect. These results are important as they will inform management decisions in other areas of the world that are affected by drought. The study also demonstrates the need for baseline data.
