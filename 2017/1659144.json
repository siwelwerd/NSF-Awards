 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides for our future generation of effectively trained research scientists. The project anticipates future directions in science by training young scientists in the theoretical and practical use of computation to find, understand, and exploit structure in large or complex data sets. Large and complex data sets are ubiquitous in many areas of science, business and humanities. The project aims to broaden participation in scientific research by locating and encouraging talented students at institutions with fewer research offerings than has the REU site. Along with encouraging a career in science, the project aims to further engage each participant in a lifelong dialog with science and scientific research.\r\n\r\nTraining, mentorship, presentation, and peer engagement are all key elements addressed by this project to encourage our talented undergraduates to become research scientists. The project provides full scholarships to undergraduates to work with mentors in a ten week summer session on a project from the site's portfolio of projects. The program begins with a science boot camp. Throughout the experience the participants attend lecture series and engage with their cohort of REU participants, further facilitating growth as career scientists. At the conclusion, the participants present their research to their peers and the research community at the site, with some projects selected to be presented at a national conference. \r\n\r\nThe portfolio of mentored projects share the theme of computation to find structure in large or complex data sets. Projects feature computation either for the exploration or manipulation of data, such as for visualization or high performance GPU computation, or for the theoretical framework of computation, such as for understanding brain processes, deep learning, and neural nets. Because of the cross-cutting nature of computational science, the projects come from diverse fields with mentors from diverse departments, including Computer Science, Chemistry and Psychology, the Center for Computational Sciences, and the medical school.",
