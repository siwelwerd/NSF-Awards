 "awd_abstract_narration": "If we are to understand how the Sun and Earth formed, we must first understand how the Galaxy itself was formed and how it changes over time.  Astronomers know that the Milky Way Galaxy contains huge clouds of gas and dust.  It is from these \"Giant Molecular Clouds\" (GMCs) that all stars are born.  The goal of this project is to understand how these giant clouds are formed and how they change over millions of years.  Using computer models developed over a number of years, the awardee will investigate how the explosions of very large stars affect the clouds.  The models include many of the things known to affect the gas in the Milky Way: the temperature and density of the gas, the rotation of the Milky Way, the light from the billions of stars in the galaxy, and even the chemistry of the atoms and molecules in the clouds.  Much of the work will be done by a postdoctoral researcher, guided by the Principal Investigator (PI) who is a world-renown expert in Milky Way astronomy and the birth of stars.  Graduate and undergraduate students will also be involved in the research, and female high-school students will be invited to the PI's institute to shadow graduates and early-career scientists.  In this way the PI hopes to inspire a new generation of young, female researchers.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to continue numerical modeling of star formation on very large spatial scales (GMCs and above).  The new models will include ionizing and non-ionizing UV radiation, supernova feedback, turbulence, magnetic fields, chemistry, and galactic shear.  Many of these effects have been excluded from past models or used individually rather than in combination.  This project will use advanced computational methods to simulate GMC formation and destruction, providing the first fully self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and radiation MHD models at high resolution and with comprehensive treatment of physics and chemistry.  Such modeling is useful not only in synthesizing star formation and GMC evolution in the Milky Way Galaxy but may also be used to interpret new ALMA observations of other, nearby galaxies.",

These models quantify the \"self-regulation\" theory of  star formation in GMCs, making predictions for the fraction of a given cloud that will eventually collapse gravitationally to make stars (this fraction is known as the star formation  efficiency -- SFE), and the complementary fraction of the cloud that will be dispersed due to the effects of stellar feedback. \n\nThe team's studies required supercomputer simulations to solve the equations of gas dynamics including gravity and feedback effects, and intercompared results for many different models to understand how the conditions in the GMC (such as the level of turbulence and strength of magnetic fields) affect the SFE and other outcomes, including cloud lifetimes.

To interpret  their computational simulations, the team developed an analytic theory of how energy is lost in unstable, turbulent, fractal interfaces when shocked wind gas at millions of degrees mixes with much denser gas and then radiates away energy rapidly.  Previous more idealized models failed to predict the energy loss of winds because they did not include a turbulent, fractal interface.  The loss of hot gas in turbulent interfaces also provides an answer to the longstanding puzzle of why so little X-ray emission has been observed from wind bubbles around young star clusters.\n\nThe team's computational chemistry models made predictions to calibrate the relationship between emission from carbon monoxide (CO) and molecular hydrogen (H_2) in a range of galactic environments.  The CO-H_2 calibration can be used to obtain the mass of GMCs based on observations of millimeter-wave emission with the ALMA millimeter array facility built and managed by the NSF. \n\nDeveloping new computational modeling techniques was a major part of the team's effort, and crucial to the new results that were obtained.  The new software tools developed as part of this project will be used by members of the team and other  researchers in future work.   The training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers via this project will be extremely valuable to their future careers in academia, national laboratories, and industry. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/22/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eve C Ostriker"
