This goal will be accomplished by partially supporting the travel costs for US-based Ph.D. students to attend the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), which is one of the premier international conferences on research in artificial intelligence. The conference, which in 2017 will be held in Melbourne, Australia attracts an international crowd that includes academics, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders.",
