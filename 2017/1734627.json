 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently, delicate and challenging underwater manipulation tasks are performed only by human divers when it is safe for them to enter the environment. Robots can help address this issue by distancing human operators from dangerous environments, while still leveraging their skills in planning complex manipulation tasks. Rigid robotic manipulators, however, are typically not suitable for delicate manipulation tasks.  To address this limitation, this project explores the design and control of soft robotic arms inspired by the octopus.  Soft robots can perform delicate tasks of scientific interest in underwater environments, such as retrieving biological samples or delicate artifacts, without harming them.  Such soft robots can also be safer when operating alongside humans. The results of the research will be integrated into hands-on courses as part of the Oregon State University PhD in Robotics and into K-12 outreach via the OSU Robotics Club and Oregon FIRST Robotics competitions.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to establish a framework for underwater manipulation, combining shared autonomy between human operators and robots with mechanically-directed soft actuation and sensing. The proposed work will examine new actuator morphologies, alternative fabrications techniques, and the use of stretchable integrated liquid metal sensors. To control the soft grippers, this project develops a planning and control interface that utilizes machine learning techniques to leverage human operators' skills at quickly identifying stable grasps. The physical attributes of the soft grippers will be designed in tandem with algorithms, which will provide improved understanding of underwater interaction and shared autonomy.  Dexterity and compliance of the soft manipulators will be evaluated for large contact-area, multi-point gripping, which is particularly advantageous for grasping delicate objects underwater.  Testing will be done in a benchtop underwater test bed, using kinematic motion capture and interaction forces to evaluate performance.\r\n",
