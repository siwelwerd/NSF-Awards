 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project involves the development of a turn-key simulation platform to automate electromagnetic design and modeling. This involves the integration of state-of-the-art open-source simulation engines with intelligent control software and cloud-based high-performance computing (HPC). Its three main benefits are to: (1) cut design time by at least 50%, (2) reduce operating costs by an order of magnitude via savings in labor and capital-equipment expenses, and (3) improve device performance, form factor, and energy efficiency by more than 10%. This tool enables the advanced manufacturing of new kinds of photonic and optoelectronic devices in critical industries including telecommunications, photovoltaics, biomedicine, photolithography, imaging, displays, and solid-state lighting. Its impact is to help propel US manufacturing competitiveness to the forefront of the $180B global photonics industry. This is the next generation of computer-aided design (CAD) tools.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimpetus will develop an on-demand, pay-per-use, cloud-based photonics simulation platform, built on top of state-of-the-art open-source electromagnetic simulation engines, to automate the design and prototyping of a range of photonic devices in critical industries including telecommunications, photovoltaics, imaging, displays, and solid-state lighting. Phase I will involve developing a new Python application program interface (API), simulation templates for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), metamaterial split-ring resonators, and other common devices, as well as pre- and post-processing modules to enhance the productivity of our tools. This tool for research and development will be deployed on scalable, high-performance computing (HPC) in the public cloud. Work in Phase I will lay the groundwork for Phase II to develop the first turn-key simulation platform for advanced photonics manufacturing.",

These include a new Python application program interface (API) for each package as well as 11 new modules for Meep: a module for guided-mode decomposition, a material library for 11 metals used in optoelectronic devices, a module for importing arbitrary material data, modules for visualizing the the simulation geometry and electromagnetic fields, a module for computing scattered power as a function of angle, and 5 simulation templates for modeling various photonic devices including organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), silicon thin-film absorbers, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) Bragg grating outcouplers, photonic-crystal nanobeam cavities, and complimentary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) image sensors. The Meep and MPB user manuals have been converted to Markdown format and migrated to ReadTheDocs, a popular documentation repository for open-source projects [links: https://meep.readthedocs.io and https://mpb.readthedocs.io], from their original MediaWiki format which had been hosted on MIT servers. The documentation has been revamped and updated to include all the new features and modules from Phase I as well as installation instructions. Additionally, the documentation has been incorporated into the source repository so that changes can also be tracked via the Git version control system. This enables the documentation to be accessed offline. Documentation for the auxiliary libctl package has also been converted to Markdown from MediaWiki format and migrated to ReadTheDocs [link: https://libctl.readthedocs.io]. New versions of Meep (version 1.4) and MPB (version 1.6) were released as gzipped tarballs. Binary packages for these versions were made available for Linux and macOS via the Conda package manager. Binary packages for the Linux distributions Ubuntu, Debian, and CentOS were updated to the latest versions. An Amazon Machine Image which includes the latest versions of Meep and MPB for Ubuntu was made available on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/01/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ardavan&nbsp;Oskooi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
