 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to characterize soil-snow-atmosphere dynamics of mercury (Hg) in the snow-dominated Arctic tundra. Chemical conversion of Hg in snowpack from non-volatile forms to gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) can lead to substantial degassing of Hg from snow, thereby reducing the impact of atmospheric deposition. Contrary to the GEM chemistry seen in the midlatitude snowpack, preliminary observations from Toolik Lake, on the north slope of the Brooks Range, Alaska, provide evidence that photochemical GEM formation and degassing are suppressed in tundra snow and that for much of the winter, interstitial GEM is actually converted into non-volatile Hg. These patterns result in extended periods when interstitial snowpack air is depleted in GEM. If confirmed, this chemistry would likely signify a net transfer of atmospheric GEM to snow or underlying soils, thereby increasing Hg deposition to tundra ecosystems. Proposed project objectives are to investigate (1) the frequency and underlying processes that determine GEM depletion and formation in arctic snowpack and tundra soils; (2) the degree to which GEM dynamics cause vertical Hg exchange between soils, snow, and the atmosphere; and (3) how these processes provide additional sources &#8722; or sinks &#8722; of Hg via atmosphere-surface transfer and snowmelt input. GEM concentrations in soils, snow, and air, as well as vertical exchanges, will be characterized at Toolik Field Station. Measurements will be made by means of a snow-sampling manifold system allowing for fully automated and continuous all-winter measurements of trace gases at multiple depths in the undisturbed snowpack and the atmosphere. These experiments will be supplemented by flux chamber measurements to assess the contribution of the underlying tundra soils. Other trace gas observations, and chemical characterization of soil, snow, melt water, and soil water will be incorporated to assess the environmental and biogeochemical controls on GEM dynamics and the Hg budget. This proposed research will leverage ongoing LTER and NEON projects at the Toolik Field station, providing linkages between in-snow processes, tundra soil and freshwater biogeochemical cycling, pollution import into the Arctic, and ecosystem processes. The project will directly involve high school, undergraduate, graduate students, and a postdoctoral scientist. It will expand an existing partnership with local high school chemistry classes through research presentations in classrooms, laboratory tours, and data analyses using study results. Dissemination to the scientific community will be accomplished through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations, and by communication with U.S. and international regulatory agencies. The general public will be reached through news releases, institutional publications, open house events, and a web site. Data will be archived at the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado for distribution to the national and international polar research community.",

Hundreds of tons of it are released into the atmosphere each year by power plants through the burning of coal, as well as through mining activities and other industrial processes, and are distributed throughout the world. Airborne mercury eventually falls back to the ground, accumulating in soils, rivers, lakes and oceans, even in remote areas such as the Arctic, where large quantities of mercury are threatening the environment and the health and well-being of northern wildlife and people. Exposure to high levels of mercury over long periods leads to neurological and cardiovascular problems. Infants and young children can suffer from developmental disorders, reduced memory and increased risk of attention problems.</p>\n<p>This study performed a detailed and long-term investigation of mercury deposition, sources, and cycling in the Arctic tundra in a remote area in Northern Alaska. We continuously measured various forms of atmospheric mercury deposition using flux tower systems, along with concentrations and dynamics in vegetation, snowpack, and Arctic soils. We also employed stable mercury isotope analyses, a powerful new technique to fingerprint different mercury sources. We found that the absorption of mercury from the atmosphere by the tundra vegetation drives high loads of mercury in Arctic soils. Vegetation uptake of the gaseous form of atmospheric mercury, which is ubiquitously found in the global atmosphere, but previously has been considered to be relatively inert, surprisingly formed the dominant source of mercury in the tundra, accounting for over 70% of total annual mercury deposition. By analyzing different vegetation groups, we found that different functional vegetation types strongly differ in tissue mercury concentrations, with highest mercury concentrations observed in feather and peat moss and brown and white lichen. The high mercury content in these tissues, which exceeded concentrations in common plants (i.e., vascular plants) three to six fold, combined with their high representation in Arctic biomass, were reasons for high contributions of vegetation to deposition and transfer of mercury to tundra soils when vegetation dies or sheds leaves.<strong></strong></p>\n<p>Tundra uptake of gaseous mercury form the atmosphere leads to high soil mercury concentrations, with mercury mass found in Arctic soils greatly exceeding the levels found in temperate soils. We estimate that the seasonally thawing (active) layers of Arctic soils may contain as much as 400 Gg of mercury (i.e., 400 thousand metric tons), constituting one of the largest global mercury reservoirs. Mass balance consideration and carbon-14 dating revealed that mercury stored in upper surface (organic) soils likely derived from recent origin, but that deeper permafrost soils store old mercury that has accumulated in the Arctic over many millennia. Our data support that high tundra soil mercury concentrations might explain why Arctic rivers annually transport large amounts of mercury (in the range of 44 metric tons) to the Arctic Ocean.</p>\n<p>Detailed temporal and spatial analysis of mercury in Arctic snowpack showed that the snowpack plays a minor role of supplying mercury to the tundra during snowmelt. In fact, snow mercury concentrations were extremely low and the inputs during snowmelt were almost negligible. A more important role of snowpack, however, is that it covers the Arctic surface for up to eight months each year. By providing a surface cover, we found that photochemical re-evasion of mercury, during which mercury contained at the surface can be volatilzed back to the atmosphere, is rarely observed in the interior Arctic tundra. Once mercury is deposited to the Arctic, primarily by summertime uptake via plants, it is hence efficiently retained and stored in the Arctic over long term. Finally, we found that some of the mercury in tundra soils is water solubility, and although generally the percentage of soluble mercury is low (0.05%), it is enhanced in subsurface soils.
