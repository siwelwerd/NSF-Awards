 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to improve dietary compliance and health outcomes in diabetic and pre-diabetic populations. Almost 30 million Americans adults have Type II diabetes. Type II diabetes is a serious public health concern, as its complications, which include cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness and amputations, greatly affect patients' health and quality of life. To effectively self-manage their disease, patients face the difficult task of controlling their glucose levels by following dietary guidance and preventing excessive weight gain. Digital health products have the potential to improve patient adherence to these recommendations by providing real-time, interactive self-management aid. Yet, existing mobile diabetes self-management applications are limited to their function as glucose trackers. The goal of the proposed project is to develop a proactive diet-related decision-making support system that is personalized to continuously monitored glucose concentrations. The integration of software and sensor technology will result in a more efficient and individualized method to prevent disease progression in Type II diabetics.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project examines the commercial feasibility of using biological inputs from wearable sensors to eliminate the need for calorie-tracking and develop personalized and dynamic real-time food-related decision support. Our proprietary algorithms use continuous glucose readings as biological feedback to assist diabetic patients with decisions about what and when to eat. Previous studies have demonstrated improved glycemic control and sustained weight loss using portable glucometers to improve self-regulated eating behavior in overweight non-diabetic populations. The proposed technology will translate this evidence-based biobehavioral intervention approach to Type 2 and pre-diabetic patients in real-time. The user interface will be a mobile platform with graphical outputs to assist with 'in-the-moment' decision-making as well as to monitor their glucose variability. The platform will provide summary statistics for patients that can be shared with their healthcare providers.",

T2DM is a serious public health concern, as its complications, which include cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, blindness and amputations, greatly affect patients&rsquo; health, quality of life, and ability to be active members of society. The total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2012 was $245 billion, including $176 billion in direct medical costs and $69 billion in reduced work productivity. Research consistently demonstrates that among patients with T2DM, elevated glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels are a key indicator of glucose control. High HbA1c levels are associated with all-cause mortality and the risk of cardiovascular disease and cancers of the colon and rectum, stomach, pancreas, breast, and liver. Lowering HbA1c levels to 6.5-7% significantly improves health outcomes. Yet, even in the most effective behavioral interventions, 20-50% of people are unable to achieve HbA1c targets. One reason for these less than optimal effects is the lack of personalized attention to dietary decision making in a person&rsquo;s daily life. Therefore, the main goal of this I-Corps project was to develop a sustainable business model for BioSense, a temporary small business seeking to commercialize a proactive dietary decision-making support system that assists people with type 2 diabetes to achieve recommended glucose control targets.</p>\n<p>There were four main objectives to fulfill the project goal: (1) conduct customer discovery interviews with stakeholders in the field diabetes management; (2) determine the key customer segment(s)/value proposition(s), identify key customer relationships, channels, partners, activities, resources, and explore potential cost structure(s) and revenue streams; (3) translate customer discovery outcomes into a functional prototype of the product to be developed and commercialized, and (4) arrive at a go/no-go decision about starting a company.</p>\n<p>Related to the four main project objectives, Year 1 outcomes included: (1) conducting 125 customer discovery interviews in 7 U.S. cities with stakeholders in the area of diabetes management; (2) determining that continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) companies are BioSense&rsquo;s primary customer segment and newly diagnosed patients with T2DM are a secondary segment; and (3) observing that CGM companies will require feasibility and preliminary efficacy data to consider partnering with BioSense to distribute the developed technology. Identifying CGM companies as a primary customer led to discoveries regarding the formation of partnerships for the distribution of our technology. Device companies would need two key items from BioSense: (1) a clearly defined market and (2) evidence that the product could achieve the outcomes necessary to establish a pathway towards device reimbursement. As such, BioSense would need to work first to develop and test a product that would address the pain point of newly diagnosed T2DM patients and conduct preliminary efficacy trials for reducing HbA1c levels. Based on these outcomes, it was decided that BioSense would not become a company at the conclusion of I-Corps.

Related to these aims, BioSense obtained NSF approval to contract a local vendor to build the BioSense MVP; a mobile application that integrated glucose monitoring data with real-time dietary guidance.
