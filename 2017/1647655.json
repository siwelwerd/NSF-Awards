 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will provide the first technical advancement in the specialty metals industry (manufacturers of titanium and nickel) in more than 4 decades. Specialty metals are ubiquitous in our lives, with applications from aircraft parts to medical implants, yet the vacuum arc remelting (VAR) process, the work horse for this industry, has remained relatively unchanged since its development in the 1940?s. By coupling the ability to measure the location of electric arcs used for melting these high value alloys in the VAR, with the ability to steer the arcs, substantial electrical savings can be achieved, decreasing costs to the consumer and increasing reliability of the final products. For example, it is well known that the lack of understanding of the dynamics of the process leads to an estimated 8% yield loss, costing the US industry $1.024B per year in lost revenue through yield loss and electrical inefficiency, contributing to the high price of these products. This project proposes to decrease this loss by 50% by developing an applied feedback control technology capable of optimizing the energy distribution within these systems, providing better quality metals at a cheaper production price.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is to prove that real-time control can improve plasma-based industrial processing systems. The innovation uses externally applied magnetic fields to manipulate arc position modes during melting operations. By coupling arc position sensing, which measures magnetic field vectors exterior to the process to determine arc positions interior to it, with active manipulation of externally derived fields, arcs can be precisely controlled. Relying upon years of development and validation of arc position sensing, coupled with Finite Element Analysis simulations and experimental validation, this technology will become the first active control of arc melting systems. The significant realization is that spatial and temporal control of the diffuse current paths can be controlled precisely if the validated measurement system of current location is coupled with external field generators. This effort will focus on the application to VAR furnaces but may have significant application to other processes with diffuse current pathways such as Joule heated systems, fuel cells, additive manufacturing or industrial microwave processing. The expected impact of arc control during melting is a reduction in manufacturing defects, an enablement of the production of ingots with increasing diameter, a reduction in energy required in alloy production, and improved safety of operations.",

Vacuum Arc Remelting (VAR) furnaces are the workhorse for the manufacture of high value metals and alloys (Ni, Ti, Nb, Zr, Hf, etc).&nbsp; Yet, melting in VAR furnaces has remained relatively unchanged since its introduction in the 1940s. It is well known that the behavior of the electric arcs during VAR processing impacts product yield and contributes to ingot defects. Until the introduction of <em>VARmetric</em><sup>TM</sup>, there were no technologies capable of measuring the location of electric arcs during melting and therefore no way to quantify the relationship between arc location and defects such as those that caused the jet engine failure and complete loss of aircraft on American Airlines Flight 383. Operational variations in arc locations not only lead to defect formation, they also lead to yield or productivity losses, estimated at more than $1.024B per year in lost revenue in the U. S. alone.&nbsp; This NSF SBIR provides proof of concept for coupling arc position sensing through <em>VARmetric</em><sup>TM</sup> with applied magnetic fields to control arc locations, and thus provide a means of avoiding operational conditions leading to defects.&nbsp; Additionally, the energy transfer to the melt pool can be optimized, increasing electrical efficiency, while the integrated Vacuum Arc Control (VAC) system will provide the advanced process control necessary to advance the state of the industry.</p>\n<p>For this NSF SBIR, Ampere Scientific successfully developed a laboratory arc furnace for validating the VAC control. This arc furnace integrated our patented Arc Position Sensing technology with an independent optical monitoring system of the arcs.&nbsp; Figure 2 provides a comparison of the determined arc positions from the two measurement systems, which are in good agreement.</p>\n<p>We developed a 3-axis Helmholtz coil configuration to generate magnetic forces in any known direction.&nbsp; The 3-axis Helmholtz coils were designed using COMSOL Multi-physics finite element modeling software to inform the coil diameter, spacing and number of windings to produce a given magnetic field strength and uniformity. This approach allowed us to specify a design which yielded field strengths approximately equivalent to existing VAR industry applications of axial magnetic fields for stirring. A coil picture is shown in Figure 3, along with validating results to show we can move the arcs with magnetic field application in our laboratory arc furnace.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, our goal was to provide proof that we could alter the arc distribution in a known way. Previously, we have sometimes observed a &ldquo;ring&rdquo; arc distribution mode with APS &nbsp;during industrial VAR melting. This distribution is the result of the arcs tending to be concentrated closer to the electrode edge than the center, and travelling in a circular pattern.&nbsp; We used this distribution mode as our control target.&nbsp; Figure 4 (t1-t8) shows the results of applying the indicated magnetic field vector (arrow) to control the arc distribution over an approximately 8s period. Figure 4 demonstrates the rotation of the arc centroid around the electrode surface as intended .&nbsp; The overall distribution of the arc during the period is displayed as &lsquo;B on&rsquo; while &lsquo;B off&rsquo; provides the arc distribution without any control.
