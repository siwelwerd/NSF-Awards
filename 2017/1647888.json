 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial impact of this project will be to create a depth vision system that accelerates\r\nthe transition to intelligent automation. The intelligent automation movement is driven by the opportunity\r\nto increase human productivity, and it can be seen in all domains: from Siemen?s self-organizing\r\nmanufacturing plants to Amazon?s proposed delivery drones. This project aims to improve robotic vision,\r\nwhich is currently a limitation to greater autonomy. The research uses innovations in semiconductor\r\nphysics to create time-of-flight depth cameras that reach new levels of spatial resolution and fidelity. These\r\ncameras, in conjunction with rapidly evolving software that uses depth data to model the physical world,\r\ngive robotic systems the human-like abilities they need to perform more complicated tasks in dynamic\r\nenvironments. Robotics will become increasingly effective at the navigation, material handling, and object\r\nmanipulation tasks that are the basis of so many manufacturing and logistics processes. The project\r\noutcomes will advance the state-of-the-art in depth vision technology, and provide a prototype camera that\r\ncan be used to test a variety of challenging object recognition tasks.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project addresses an important limitation in depth\r\ncameras that use the phase delay time-of-flight (TOF) method. Existing TOF cameras use ?pixel-level\r\ndemodulation?: specially designed photodetector arrays where each pixel performs both light detection and\r\ndemodulation. This design limits the modulation frequency, and thus depth accuracy, because the high\r\nfrequency signals create excessive noise and parasitic capacitances. The authors propose an alternative\r\n?optical demodulation? design wherein light is demodulated by a single fast optical shutter, and then\r\ncollected by a separate conventional image sensor. By separating light modulation from light detection,\r\nparasitic capacitances are eliminated and it is possible to reach high frequencies with acceptable power\r\nconsumption and noise. The research program will develop new optical shutters that demonstrate these\r\ncharacteristics, and integrate the shutters into a functioning prototype depth camera. Success will show that\r\nTOF cameras can be produced with substantially higher spatial resolution and design flexibility.",
