 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will fund a full-time technician for three years in the Biogeochemistry Laboratory at the University at Buffalo. The principal investigator is an early-career geoscientist who will conduct research focused on understanding mechanisms of changes in water availability related to climate variability. The laboratory reconstructs past climate by examining sediments that record minute geochemical signatures of past environmental conditions. The studies will be conducted on samples from all around the world, including temperate regions, where large populations and food production occur, and the Arctic system, where sea ice loss will affect precipitation and in turn affect ice sheets and sea level rise. The research results have important societal implications for planning for droughts, floods, extreme storm events, and ice sheet mass loss.  The project will enhance the principal investigator's partnership with the Buffalo Audubon Society for education and outreach, which includes a citizen-scientist program activity for the collection of weekly sediment and precipitation samples.\r\n\r\nThe funding of a full-time technician at the University at Buffalo for three years will immediately increase the research productivity of an early-career geoscientist and establish the basis for long-term support for the position. The technician will be employed in the principal investigator's Organic and Stable Isotope Biogeochemistry Laboratory, which contains state-of-the-art equipment for sample extraction, preparation, and analysis at high spatial and temporal resolution. The laboratory's research goal is to provide prehistorical context for and mechanistic understanding of water-related changes associated with climate change. Potentially harmful consequences, such as droughts, floods, extreme storm events, and ice sheet mass loss, are of high societal and environmental significance, as they affect ecosystem stability, hydroelectric and agricultural production, and ice sheets and sea level rise. The increased research capacity of the laboratory enables more activities in the education and outreach partnership with the Buffalo Audubon Society, which includes teaching diverse groups about the glacial and climate history of New York, involving school-age summer camp groups in sample collection, participating in career days that expose young adults to a broad range of environmental careers, and analyzing samples from a citizen-science program.\r\n",
