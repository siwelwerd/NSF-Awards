 "awd_abstract_narration": "Science DMZs (SDMZ) have been widely deployed in the Research and Education networking community and recognized\r\nas a global best practice for supporting cyberinfrastructure and big data applications. Despite innovations\r\nin performance, security, and management, the SDMZs remain focused on the\r\nsupport of big data projects and cyberinfrastructure. It remains difficult to create physical \"disk\r\nto disk\" or virtual \"scientist to scientist\" connections. Researchers are increasingly interested\r\nin an emerging class of hybrid services focused on turnkey, on-demand integration of private/public\r\nclouds, cyberinfrastructure, scientific resources, and high performance networks.\r\n\r\nThe RECAST project will develop and deploy a regional based Software Defined Science\r\nDMZ (SD-SDMZ) as a mechanism to provide flexible edge services that include traditional data\r\ntransfer functions. RECAST leverages state-of-the-art Cloud and Software-defined networking technologies to transform\r\nan SDMZ --  that was historically focused on high-speed data transfer -- into a Software Defined Infrastructure that offers\r\ncompute and network services in a fully virtualized, programmable and orchestrated fashion. Built upon technologies similar to those\r\nused in modern data centers, this \"cloudified SDMZ\" will  provide a scalable, multi-tenant environment, where\r\neach user or user group can allocate dedicated resources and use the resources in an isolated,\r\nIndependent, and elastic fashion. Embedding this resource in the University of Maryland Mid-Atlantic\r\nCrossroads regional network will allow the SD-SDMZ to leverage rich connectivity to advance\r\ncyberinfrastructure to provide these new and advanced services.",
