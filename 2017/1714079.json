 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research that contributes to the PI's long-term goal of developing a revolutionary material that combines the two concepts of nontraditional material properties and thermal expansion to produce controlled actuation in the resonant region of the material. The researcher will study local resonance, and how it behaves on many scales. As waves are used to excite a structure, there are particular frequencies which match the structure and cause extremely amplified motion; these are the natural frequencies. This type of phenomenon can be seen in earthquakes when building collapse happens seemingly at random, but is tied to the earthquake wave frequency matching the natural frequency of that structure. This phenomenon is known as resonance. This project will look at resonance on a much smaller scale using ultrasonic waves, which are longitudinal waves in the frequency above the audible sound for humans. These rapid waves require a much smaller structure in order to fall into a range where resonance is possible. When resonance occurs, the resulting concentration of the ultrasonic waves can be used to alter the material properties in that region. Earthquake waves and sound waves share similar properties and are governed by similar equations because they are both types of longitudinal waves. Therefore we can look to large-scale concepts to help us understand even very small material structures. The resources and expertise provided by Dr. Chin-Hsiung Loh and his laboratory group at National Taiwan University will be invaluable to the development of these concepts based on the group's extensive knowledge and past work concerning the fundamentals of wave propagation and behavior. In this project, the researcher and Dr. Loh's group will perform experiments and build models that can help predict and further understand local resonance within engineered materials. These materials can then be used to utilize and control waves. The implementation of established earthquake wave theories and simulations into nanomaterials will provide a more unabridged understanding of wave behavior over the broad range of engineering scale.\r\n\r\nThe research impacts of this material and the subsequent consolidation of fundamental wave theories would shift the thinking surrounding the traditionally undesirable side effect of ultrasonic heating into the purposeful field of controlled resistance and selective actuation. By exciting local resonance using ultrasonic waves in a liquid-filled chamber suspended in a soft matrix, it is hypothesized that the liquid can be heated significantly to produce a volumetric thermal expansion. This expansion would undoubtedly cause an outward pressure on the cavity and therefore on the soft surrounding matrix. This actuation would produce a resistive force that could stop deformation of the material structure due to an external pressure. The actuation of the liquid can be predicted through the thermal expansion coefficient, which will allow for the production of a repeatable and tailorable resulting pressure. As a further step in this research, it is the goal of the researcher to develop a nanocomposite with sets of linear chambers having identical resonances. After a particular chamber undergoes deformation, however, it would have a local resonance that is unique and independent of the undisturbed chambers and could be excited individually. This chamber would then undergo isolated pressurization causing centralized actuation limited to the chamber experiencing the deforming external pressure. The research will create a new type of actuation technology along with coupling acoustic wave resonance theory with ultrasonic heat transfer to produce novel wave vibration theories and numerical modeling. The experimental methods and analysis techniques would be unprecedented in the materials engineering field and would open the door for new uses of well-established structural health monitoring and analysis wave sensors. This research project seeks to collaborate across scale, diverse engineering fields, and unique individual backgrounds to create networks for future collaboration and discussion.\r\n\r\nThis award, under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program, supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan.",
