 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the STEM+Computing Partnership (STEM+C) program which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning.  This project will contribute to that effort by engaging young women in computer science as applied to the field of cyber forensics, and the integration of computing in computing-intensive STEM fields. The project is guided by research showing that young women are attracted to careers that improve society; thus, learning the application of computer science to solve cyber crimes, has potential to attract female participation in the cybersecurity field. Students will learn computing skills through an innovative cybercrime system that will engage students in real investigations. The project will teach young women in grades 9-12 a range of essential topics, including forensic science, scientific inquiry, critical thinking, computation thinking, data analysis, basic programming, and ethics in computing. Through an interactive platform, students will act as forensic, cybercrime investigators. Partnering with schools and organizations in Baltimore, New Orleans, and Seattle, the National Girls Collaborative Project, digital forensic experts, private and public sector STEM organizations, and content experts and mentors from industry, the project will build broad support and interest in STEM and computing that has potential to guide students toward careers in STEM and computing, including cybersecurity, a critical national priority.\r\n\r\nThe investigators intend to reach over 600 girls through the project, and will design 30 hours of digital forensic, goal-based scenarios and curriculum along with supporting resources using a Goal-Based Scenario theory and the Investigate and Decide Learning Environment (IDLE) as their instructional framework.  They will design a role-based curriculum in an accessible interface for young women and underrepresented students in STEM, train 18 pilot site teachers to deliver the interactive modules, and recruit mentors and partners from the STEM public, private and government community to encourage the participants to think about STEM-related career paths.  Recruitment will occur through Operation Spark in New Orleans, the Edmonds School District, Core Element, and Maryland Out of School Time (MOST) network.   Facilitators will be recruited from the professional and college student communities, with a goal to recruit women.  The project will be reviewed externally by an advisory board, and the evaluation will include questions about student outcomes, teacher outcomes, facilitator outcomes and mentor outcomes.  Findings will be disseminated through the project website with sections for educators and youth, presented at research conferences and through webinars in coordination with the National Girls Collaborative Project, and through social media.",

To address this overarching research question, this project introduced participants to the fundamental concepts of digital forensic science and cybersecurity, taught them to use tools required to solve real-world investigative scenarios (Missions), and gauged their increased interest in STEM+C. The project team created 30 hours of curriculum for students in grades 9-12, implemented a problem-based learning pedagogical model, developed a Virtual Learning Lab with a backend system to assess participants' progress, and a Virtual Toolkit to support hands-on components of Missions. To enhance participants' interest and engagement, project investigators integrated gender equity strategies and real-world digital forensic tools.  Professional Development instructional materials and training components were provided both virtually and in-person for teachers and facilitators. The culmination of these efforts is an education program entitled the Cyber Sleuth Science Lab (CSSL).\nThe CSSL was piloted in various forms to assess the suitability for in-school and out-of-school settings. The project leadership team conducted focus groups to guide the development of the investigative scenarios and applied an iterative development process to refine each component of the CSSL. Research input was gathered from observation of the participants and through pilot partner and advisory board feedback. External evaluators assessed participants' interest and engagement through pre/post surveys and interviews. CSSL activities also included actively engaging students in research of related careers and educational pathways through a Career Quest. Additional program support was provided for all participants through peer, near-peer coaching, and role model engagement. \nEvaluation surveys and formative/summative assessments found that the majority of student participants in the CSSL program were inspired and engaged by their experiences and developed an increased knowledge and interest. Girls expressed a more substantial increase in confidence than boys in explaining Digital Forensic Science and Cybersecurity. Girls are more motivated by social issues such as safety and privacy, whereas boys seem to be more motivated by career choices. While the project did not formally include a longitudinal study tracking students over the four years, project partners reported that some CSSL students pursued related educational pathways.\nThe learning environments used for this project were primarily co-ed and so supports were created to help girls in these environments, utilizing research-based strategies for gender equitable education (Hughes et al, 2020).

This project extended existing research, creating a problem-based learning pedagogical strategy constructed around immersive goal-based investigative scenarios that combine the theories of cognitive apprenticeship and case-based reasoning (Duran &amp; Dokme, 2016; Bell, 1998; Bell 1996; Norman, 1993; Collins et al, 1989). In addition, the CSSL education program established effective principles for gender equitable instruction that support the SciGirls research-based strategies (Billington et al, 2014; Hughes et al, 2020). This project advances R&amp;D in gender equity in STEM education, growing girls' positive STEM identities and self-efficacy (Hughes et al, 2020).\nBROADER IMPACT \nAcross all pilots, there was an increase in interest among both female and male students in using digital forensic tools to solve problems such as helping someone to recover deleted data or to deal with cyberbullying. A primary motivation stated by students was the direct relevance of the lessons to their everyday lives. These lessons include being better prepared to protect personal privacy, to avoid problems in cyberspace, developing skills and knowledge to help others and conduct digital forensic investigations. All project participants reported a heightened awareness of risks associated with technology use and the complex social justice challenges in Digital Forensic Science, and the experiences of professionals in Cybersecurity careers. All participants gained increased awareness of educational pathways and careers related to Digital Forensic Science and Cybersecurity. \nIntroducing this subject matter in High School provides better support for young women, underrepresented students, and teachers who wish to pursue educational and career pathways and has the potential to strengthen diversity and increase participation in the field of Cybersecurity. \nThe flexible and extensible instructional framework and platform created in this project could be adapted to cover other innovative technology-rich subject matter, which could be applied broadly across STEM disciplines and could be deployed to support a wide variety of educational settings.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daryl K Pfeif"
