 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops the theory and algorithms for autonomous navigation of mobile sensing platforms, such as unmanned ground, aerial, and underwater vehicles, so that the collected information is maximized while constraints on movement capabilities and energy expenditure are accommodated. This work facilitates the use of autonomous robots in environmental monitoring, search and rescue, surveillance and security, among other applications of societal importance. The algorithms are evaluated in field trials using unique gliding robotic fish.  The project provides training for both graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups. Through showcasing at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago and offering of an open-source robotic fish education kit, the project promotes the interest of K-12 students and the general public in science and engineering. The project further facilitates transfer of software and hardware for robotic sensing to the market.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to bridge the gap between the theory and practice in information-driven mobile sensing and to develop a principled theoretic and algorithmic framework for autonomous exploration in uncertain, specifically underwater, environments. The approach exploits the concept of ergodic exploration, where the underlying optimization problem is solved using methods from nonlinear optimal control. The research consists of: 1) Establishing a rigorous theoretical framework for ergodic exploration for guaranteeing solution well-posedness and stability, and developing synthesis methods for real-time control; 2) exploring active probing of flow conditions via auxiliary measurement of tracer agents to mitigate environmental uncertainty; 3) investigating collaborative exploration schemes that strike balance among performance, complexity, and robustness; and 4) conducting field experiments to validate the framework using a group of gliding robotic fish to monitor harmful algal blooms and localize sources of chemical spills.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project developed control techniques for automating exploration for underwater vehicles that operate in uncertain environments, including both environmental and internal uncertainty.  These uncertainties inevitably arise due to not knowing environmental characteristics such as currents in water and turbulence effects ahead of time.  Moreover, even the nominal model of motion in water can include subtle effects due to how water interacts with a surface, meaning that though the physics may be understood in principle, data is still required to make reliable predictions.  The question this project addressed is how a robot should respond to these unknowns in a practical manner.  How should a robot respond to multiple currents in water if it did not know about them ahead of time, and how should it respond to turbulent water if it has never experienced them before? We developed three key ideas as part of the research project. The first was automating exploration in a water domain, to help with applications such as localizing underwater sources of leaking chemical or for finding the source of an unmodeled current.  The second was automating collecting data to build a computational machine learning model with very little data, such as what a robot may need to do if it has never encountered turbulent flow before.  The third was a mathematically technical result that enabled us to impose constraints on computer learning outcomes that made the results physically plausible.  Physical plausibility, though seemingly an obviously desirable characteristic, often only occurs with large amounts of data when using machine learning techniques, and the techniques developed here ensure aspects of physical plausibility even with small amounts of data.  Our results were experimentally implemented with our project collaborators at Michigan State University, indicating that the results lead to dramatic improvement in real systems.  This research will enable robots to be more effective at operating on their own in environments they have not seen before, a key enabler for robotics in future applications such as search and rescue.  \n\n \nThis project developed open-source software that is freely available online and is compatible with the Robot Operating System (ROS), one of the standard software settings for deploying robotic systems.  The work was moreover applied to robotic fish experiments and tabletop robotic manipulation experiments, both of which are important areas in robotics with relevance to environmental monitoring and manufacturing.  Moreover, project research personnel participated in outreach to Chicago-area students in multiple venues, including creating robotic displays at the Museum of Science and Industry during National Robotics Week prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.  During the pandemic, project personnel created virtual outreach for middle school students, engaging thousands of students.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Todd D Murphey"
