 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ferns are commonly thought to be restricted to shady and moist habitats, but notholaenid ferns are adapted to, and have diversified within, the deserts of the southwestern United States and Northern Mexico. Notholaenids ferns become dormant during the dry season but quickly rehydrate and restore photosynthetic activity when moisture returns. This drought adaptation is hypothesized to be related to a waxy substance called 'farina', primarily composed of plant pigments, that form a whitish-to-yellowish layer on the leaf undersurface. When leaves curl up in response to water stress, this leaf surface is directly exposed to sunlight. Two primary functional hypotheses for the waxy layer have been proposed: 1) it acts as a 'barrier' to help reduce water loss from evaporation; 2) it acts as a 'sunscreen' to protect water-stressed leaves from damage caused by overheating and UV-radiation. This study aims to investigate the evolution and function of farina in notholaenid ferns and address a critical gap in understanding how plants cope with drought stress and high solar irradiance by using a combination of anatomical, biochemical, biogeographical, ecophysiological, and molecular phylogenetic approaches. These data will provide new insights into the functional role of farina on fern leaves and drought resistance more generally that may be applied to other plant groups. One graduate student will be trained in a diversity of approaches, and a new undergraduate training module will be developed using ecological niche modeling to investigate the patterns of plant evolution.   \r\n\r\nThis study has three primary objectives: The first is key to understanding the evolution of farina in this group, and involves reconstructing the interspecific phylogenetic relationships among notholaenid ferns using DNA sequences from both nuclear and plastid markers. Objective two will focus on Notholaena standleyi, a widespread species with three well-recognized flavonoid chemotypes. The phylogenetic relationships, flavonoid constituents, ploidy levels, and geographic distribution of these chemotypes will be explored to determine whether polyploidy and abiotic niche divergence have helped to shape their current parapatric distributions. Objective three will investigate the proposed ecophysiological functions of farina by measuring gas exchange rates, water-use efficiency, and photosynthetic-recovery rates after drought treatment, before and after removing the farina. Detailed anatomical and optical properties of farina will also be examined.",

They are characterized by 'farina', a layer of bright-colored (white, yellow, or orange) flavonoids that are deposited on the leaf's lower surface and the gametophytes. By integrating new evidence from molecular phylogenetics, cytology, and ecological niche modeling, we revisited the evolution of this clade, with a special focus on how these ferns diversified in the deserts.</p>\n<p>Using DNA sequences from both the biparentally-inherited nuclear genome and the maternally-inherited plastid genome, we reconstructed robust interspecific relationships among species (Fig. 1). The cloak ferns originated approximately 60 million years ago in the Paleocene and diversified into 37 species, including many infraspecific chemotypes and cytotypes (incipient species that are differentiated by farina color or by the number of chromosome copies). The 'core notholaenids' is the largest clade within the genus, with 30 species. It originated approximately 30 million years ago, and all species express farina in both the sporophytic and gametophytic phases of their life cycle. In addition, their false indusium is not well differentiated. The species outside of core notholaenids all lack one to all three of these traits. One exception is&nbsp;<em>Notholaena standleyi</em>, which exhibits all these three traits and is morphologically almost indistinguishable from a core notholaenid,&nbsp;<em>N. sulphurea,&nbsp;</em>as a result of evolutionary convergence.</p>\n<p>This is not the only case of convergence. We observed that similar vegetative traits, like leaf shape, leaf division, and the density and distribution of hairs and scales, are repeatedly recruited and lost by species that are distantly related. Because these traits are closely linked to their ecophysiology, we believe this phenomenon could be driven by the extreme climate in the deserts. In one of our study cases, the chemotypes G and Y of&nbsp;<em>N. standleyi</em>&nbsp;(Fig. 2) that are distributed in the Sonoran and Chihuahuan Deserts, respectively, are diverged in their habitat, morphology, and ecophysiology (Fig. 3). The chemotype G that is adapted to higher radiation, higher temperature, and lower precipitation, is smaller in appearance, producing smaller and less dissected leaves, and has a lower max carbon assimilation rate. It is also observed that the farina colors and compositions are much different between these two chemotypes than compared with their genetically more distant cousins. The same phenomenon is also observed at a species level?the closely related species tend to have very different farina chemistries. We hypothesized that farina might play a role in their diversification, either by affecting the leaf function or through inhibiting the growth of spores and gametophytes with different genetic backgrounds.</p>\n<p>Another key player in the diversification of the cloak ferns is polyploidization. After carefully comparing chromosome numbers, spore sizes (strongly correlated with their genome sizes), and reproductive modes, we identified many new polyploid species (about 30% more than the current taxonomy) that originated within the clade. In our&nbsp;<em>N. standleyi</em>&nbsp;research (Fig. 2), the tetraploid chemotype P/YG originated from hybridization(s) between an undiscovered diploid mother and chemotypes Y or G father progenitors. Different from all other known chemotypes within the species, these tetraploids are confined to limestone. This shift in substrate preference may be the key to the early establishment of the new polyploid species, by reducing the chance of competition and introgression with their diploid parents.</p>\n<p>In summary, we resolved species relationships among the cloak ferns and reconstructed their evolutionary histories. Polyploidization and the adaptation to different habitats in the deserts are two keys to their speciation, allowing them to diversify without complete geographic isolation. From an evolutionary perspective, the diversity of farina&nbsp; also has an important role in their diversification, but the actual mechanism requires further investigation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/11/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kathleen&nbsp;M&nbsp;Pryer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1701942/1701942_10471650_1659346609906_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1701942/1701942_10471650_1659346609906_Figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The phylogeny of the cloak ferns (clade notholaenid, Pteridaceae) and the evolution of farina\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1701942/1701942_10471650_1659346609906_Figure_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The phylogeny of the cloak ferns (clade notholaenid, Pteridaceae) and the evolution of farina\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The species tree of notholaenids.
