 "awd_abstract_narration": "Active Cooling of Extreme Heat Fluxes via Transient Fluid Flow and Evaporation in Liquid Thin-films\r\n\r\nThis project entails a research and educational program on transient heat and mass transport at liquid interfaces. Transient heat fluxes in cutting-edge technologies can exceed 50 MW/m2, which is nearly the heat flux radiated by the Sun. To manage extreme thermal loads, the State-of-the-Art is to boil and evaporate liquid coolants on micro- and nano-structured heat sinks. However, modern cooling techniques cannot manage extreme heat fluxes under transient conditions. Thermo-fluid transients due to on/off device operation or intermittent exposure to an extreme environment result in highly unstable thermo-fluid behavior, ultimately placing a liquid-cooled device in danger of catastrophic failure via thermal runaway -- i.e., a rapid, uncontrolled increase in device temperature.\r\n\r\nAn integrated research-and-education program is pursued to broaden the institutional curriculum, training, and education on transient processes in modern technologies. A unique summer workshop and academic outreach activities will tap into several well-established STEM programs, facilitating the use of many educational elements -- including in-class projects, demos, videos, and discussions on transient operation and non-equilibrium processes. The technical objective is to identify the fundamental limits of evaporative heat transfer under transient conditions. The main approach is to test if the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) of evaporating thin-films follows the predictions of the kinetic theory of gases. The project will incorporate a combination of time-resolved optical diagnostics to characterize the transient HTC and its dependence on interrelated factors such as vapor quality, superheat, and changes in heater surface structure and chemistry. These transient investigations coupled with steady-state and quasi-steady experiments are expected to reveal previously unexposed key heat transfer processes, increasing both the awareness and knowledge of transient processes in modern technologies, which are vital for new ideas in renewable energy, advanced computing, and nanotechnology.",

The research program and findings herein support the growing interests in soft, microfluidics platforms for applications ranging from wearable electronics to flexible spacecraft radiators. This research-and-education program also facilitated the training and mentorship of students ranging from the high school level to those who successfully defended their PhD dissertations. Correspondingly, the award investigated multiple solid-liquid-vapor systems ranging from the rapid (0.5-2.5 m/s) wetting of fluid droplets on flat-to-functionalized surfaces to the sustainable hemiwicking of various fluids on soft-to-rigid microtextured surfaces to the extreme cooling of local hotspots by confined liquid jets. The results from all these studies indicated that the overall heat and mass transport efficiency is dictated primarily by the maximum rate of liquid meniscus propagation (i.e., the maximum rate of dynamic surface wetting, which is effectively regulated by the chemical kinetics and corresponding surface and intermolecular forces). Then, after the surface of interest is wetted, the cooling efficiency can be further augmented by selective engineering of active (tunable) fluid-surface chemistries, surface textures, and the imposed fluid flow-field. Some of the key findings include: (1) the maximum wetting and hemiwicking velocities are interdependent, scaling rather consistently as <strong><em>v</em></strong><sub>wet&nbsp;</sub>~ 50 x <strong><em>v</em></strong><sub>wick</sub> and are predicted fairly accurately (within 10-50 %) by the analytic wetting models derived in this research effort; (2), unless the elastic modulus (<strong><em>E</em></strong>) of the wetted substrate surface approaches that of human skin (5-150 kPa), changes in <strong><em>E</em></strong> have no systematic effect on the wetting and wicking dynamics; (3) however, for such soft wetting (<strong><em>E</em></strong> &lt; 150 kPa), reduced soft wetting and wicking performances are found to be due to primarily viscoelastic braking of the propagating solid-liquid-vapor contact line; and (4) relatively small jet impingement velocities are needed to enhance the nucleate boiling and two-phase cooling of local, laser-heated hotspots (e.g., critical hotspot heat fluxes approaching 300 W/cm<sup>2</sup> are achievable with inlet jet Reynolds numbers of only Re = 130). Along with the analytical models derived and tested in this work, multiple fluid thin-film and optical diagnostic methods were developed herein. Supporting images are also provided for these selected project outcomes. These findings, coupled with future high spatiotemporal resolution experiments and continuum modeling, are expected to facilitate the subsequent engineering of soft active metamaterials, wearable microelectronics, and coupled heterogeneous thermal management solutions such as flexible heat pipes with uniquely embedded heat and mass transport structures.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/18/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shawn&nbsp;A&nbsp;Putnam</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653396/1653396_10475004_1689688646250_OutcomeFig.1(maximumwettingandwickingvelocities)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653396/1653396_10475004_1689688646250_OutcomeFig.1(maximumwettingandwickingvelocities)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Outcome Fig.1 (maximum wetting and wicking velocities)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653396/1653396_10475004_1689688646250_OutcomeFig.1(maximumwettingandwickingvelocities)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Outcome Fig.1 (maximum wetting and wicking velocities)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Overview of key maximum (upper-limit) droplet wetting and hemiwicking velocity results.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">S.A.Putnam</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shawn&nbsp;A&nbsp;Putnam</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Outcome Fig.1 (maximum wetting and wicking velocities)</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653396/1653396_10475004_1689693314473_OutcomeFig.2(soft-to-rigidhemiwicking)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653396/1653396_10475004_1689693314473_OutcomeFig.2(soft-to-rigidhemiwicking)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Outcome Fig.2 (soft-to-rigid hemiwicking)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1653396/1653396_10475004_1689693314473_OutcomeFig.2(soft-to-rigidhemiwicking)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Outcome Fig.2 (soft-to-rigid hemiwicking)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Key soft-to-rigid hemiwicking results.
