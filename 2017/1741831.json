 "awd_abstract_narration": "As computing has become integral to the practice of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), the STEM+Computing program seeks to address emerging challenges in computational STEM areas through the applied integration of computational thinking and computing activities within STEM teaching and learning in early childhood education through high school (preK-12). This project will integrate computational thinking with biology and chemistry in high school science courses, and conduct research to generate knowledge about: (1) How to create instructional experiences for all high school students that engage them in computational thinking (CT) in their learning of science; (2) What teachers require to effectively provide these experiences as a regular part of their science program; and (3) How to measure student engagement in and learning of CT in the context of science.  The general aim of this project is to expand understandings of how CT can be infused into all high school science courses by examining the needs teachers who want to implement computational science curriculum modules, and researchers who want to measure outcomes of student learning experiences in computational science curriculum modules. \r\n\r\nThis exploratory integration research project will be implemented in three phases (development, pilot, and field trial) and will conduct mixed-methods studies of curriculum adaptation, teacher preparation and support, and measurement of student instructional experiences and outcomes. Three research questions guide the activities of this project: (1) How can computational thinking be operationalized in high school science courses? (2) What do high school teachers need to understand and believe to promote computational thinking in their science courses and to teach science using computational thinking? And (3) How can computational thinking integrated into science instruction be rigorously measured? The development phase will span the first two years of the project, and will result in: (1) Development of four CT curriculum modules: two for high school biology courses and two for high school chemistry courses; and (2) Development of prototype instruments for measuring CT.  The Pilot phase, taking place in year two of the project, will involve four selected teachers who teach science (two biology teachers and two chemistry teachers) and the students in two of their classes each (approximately 200 students total). The Field Trial phase in year three of the project will include a residential institute for 12 participating teachers (six biology teachers and six chemistry teachers). The institute will prepare them to teach the modules. During the year, each participating teacher will enact the modules in two of their science classes, involving their students also as participants in the research (approximately 600). During implementation, project team members will provide guidance to teachers through webinars, user community interactions, and just-in-time support.",

We judged these elements to be key components of CT that could be effectively used in science instruction, communicated to teachers and students, and carried out in high school classrooms.</p>\n<p>Our research and development team at Horizon Research, Inc. and the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics designed four curriculum modules, two in chemistry and two in biology, meant to be used in place of teachers' regular instruction for selected topics. The four modules are: in biology - (1) Cracking the Code: Using Computation to Understand Genetic Disorders; (2) Traits to Phylogenetic Trees: Using Computation to Understand Relatedness Among Organisms; and in chemistry - (3) Orbit Jumping: Using Computation to Understand Atomic Emissions; and (4) The Bonding Triangle: Using Computation to Understand Chemical Bonding. The modules were designed to help high school students make connections between their classroom activities and the work of real-world science. To this end, students use authentic (i.e., those utilized by scientists) computational databases and tools, including Uniprot (<em>https://www.uniprot.org</em>), BLAST (<em>https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi</em>), and Gaussian (<em>https://gaussian.com</em>) to investigate problems, explain results, and generate evidence for concepts they are learning.

Members of the research team observed every class session, took detailed field notes, and videorecorded instruction. Researchers also conducted post-instruction interviews with the teachers following each observation.

The teachers came from schools serving various demographically diverse community types, ranging from rural to urban, and taught a mix of standard and honors classes. These teachers again engaged in professional development during the summer and then were asked to teach the modules to at least two classes of students, to involve approximately 640 students. Five biology and seven chemistry teachers were able to fully implement the modules in their classes prior to complications created by COVID-19 that disrupted other teachers' opportunity to use the modules with their students. Project researchers observed a portion of instruction in each class for each module, for a total of 45 one- or two-day observations. The teachers completed daily instructional logs about their module implementation, and researchers also conducted interviews with the teachers following their completion of the modules. Students completed embedded \"Computational Thinking Check-In\" assessment activities throughout instruction. Data from all of these sources, as well as discussions with the project's Expert Consulting Group and external evaluator, led to final revision of the modules. The four curriculum modules, including teacher guides and student materials, with the Check-In assessment activities, are freely available on the project website (www.horizon-research.com/predicts).</p>\n<p>Data collected throughout the project has led to development of an instructional observation tool and several presentations and manuscripts.
