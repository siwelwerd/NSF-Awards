 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to reveal and characterize the behavior of the flow behind large rotating machines, such as wind or tidal turbines, as well as interactions between such machines. This will be achieved by the combination of a unique experimental flow facility and numerical modeling. Since these machines are typically very large, one needs to accurately account for effects due to inertia and rotation of the flow in model tests and simulations. By using a unique high-pressure flow facility, in combination with state of the art instrumentation, the details of the flow behind a wind turbine will be studied under conditions identical to those of a full scale modern wind or tidal turbine. This work will bridge the gap between previous laboratory research, numerical models, field experiments and the real-world applications, answering open fundamental questions about the scaling of the flow characteristics, as well as the power output and forces acting on the turbine. Furthermore, the numerical component of the project will allow us to perform unique comparisons and evaluation of available models and to improve these modeling approaches further. Improved models can in term result in more cost-efficient designs as well as a better understanding of maintenance guidelines.  \r\n\r\nThe primary objective of the proposed research program is to reveal and characterize the morphology and fundamental scaling of wakes generated by rotating machinery over an unprecedented range of Reynolds numbers. The research will enable a unique insight into the details of wakes created by wind and hydrokinetic turbines, which traditionally has not been possible in controlled environments. The combination of high Reynolds numbers and rotation makes attempts to accurately simulate these flows very challenging. The proposed research will combine a recently developed experimental test facility, a custom designed Particle Image Velocimetry system, and novel nanoscale sensors to enable detailed and accurate characterization of the fluid mechanics within rotating wakes. Focus will be aimed at providing knowledge that can improve our ability to model and predict the performance and interactions between these kinds of machines. The proposed research program will permit us to bridge the current gap between previous laboratory research, numerical models, field experiments and the real-world applications, answering open fundamental questions about the scaling and dynamics of the momentum distribution, turbulent fluctuations, structure and meandering of the wake as well as scalability of conventional research efforts.\r\nThe main objective of the education part of the proposed project is to integrate design into an introductory engineering laboratory course, in order to give the students ownership of the labs and teach them modern engineering tools in an interdisciplinary fashion. The new course will challenge the students to build their own tools and test benches from robust, low cost and open source components to test their ideas and the concepts they have read about.  The format of the proposed laboratory course is such that it can be easily adopted by other educators and will be cost efficient.",
