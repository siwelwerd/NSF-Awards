 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project includes developing an analytical platform is capable of empowering customers with big-data analytical capacity, allow them to design and test clean energy ideas on their own terms at a fast pace using evidence-based machine-learning-enabled algorithms, and to enhance their capability to communicate with stakeholders. By adopting the proposed technology, its users could reduce energy consumption, save financial and physical resources, and minimize environmental impact. The predictive feature of the technology could also allow its users to develop a long-term view about their individual purchasing behavior as well as collective planning actions, and make financially wise and environmentally friendly decisions regarding home appliance purchases, commercial technology deployment, as well as city and regional planning.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project aims to explore the commercial viability of an energy analytics platform that combines big-data management platforms, electricity financial models, machine-learning-enabled data-driven analytical tools, and a 3D visualization interface. The platform is pre-loaded with historical data that allows customers to benchmark their past electricity use patterns. The historical data will also serve as an input to customizable machine-learning algorithms that provide customers the power and flexibility to design evidence-driven actions that fit their electricity consumption needs and forecast the economic, environmental, and social impacts related to the actions in the mid- to long-term. Users of the technology will be able to track and assess their electricity use and expenditures, and any associated capital investments. The technology will also allow its users to see the social and macro-economic impact of their energy-related action by producing outputs on public health, job creation and local GDP growth.",

The team found that the environmental NGOs, philanthropic foundations with a clean energy focus, and local governments with sustainability goals are the most welcoming market segments. Most corporations are not ready to fine-tune investments into clean energy goals, although first movers like Apple, Google, and Facebook, are changing industry discussions. The barrier to entry is too high in the power utility sector.

Two customer discovery insights were particularly impactful: 1. NGO and government customers are sophisticated, and they desire quantitative analytical tools that can help them quickly assess multiple action scenarios with high accuracy. 2. The same customers like impact metrics to include more than just traditional energy and environmental measures. They want to have broader social benefit measures such as the improvement resulting from clean energy actions in public health, job creation, economic development, economic equality, and affordable housing.</p>\n<p>The software product is capable of conducting rapid scenario analyses. The accuracy of the carbon emission assessment tool is over a thousand times better than existing products on the market because the team developed a revolutionary method using both high resolution temporal utility data and machine learning algorithms to forecast future environmental impacts coming from electricity generation. This approach significantly improves upon existing methodologies, expanding the understanding of how public data sources could be connected and utilized to create better analytical outcomes.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the software is capable of assessing a suite of co-benefits related to clean energy actions in order to better articulate the societal outcomes for decisionmakers. For example, the methodology developed by the team to unpack energy burdens at a granular geographic level for all demographic groups is ground breaking. It improves on the classic county-level and metropolitan-statistical-area-level energy burden analysis by drilling down to the neighborhood level and by including all utilities as opposed to just electricity.</p>\n<p>As a result of the successful software development derived from the market discover findings, a new organization with a heavy focus on providing services to municipal governments, NGOs and philanthropic foundations is blossoming.
