 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rhotic sounds in general, particularly the trill, present enormous cross-dialectal variation in Spanish, especially in Puerto Rican Spanish (PRS). This variation has been attested not only on the island of Puerto Rico but also in some Puerto Rican diasporic communities in the U.S. The present project focuses on trill variation in the PRS spoken in Western Massachusetts, specifically in the urban centers of Holyoke and Springfield, where the Puerto Rican diaspora has been present since the 1950s. In these cities we also find some of the highest per capita populations of Puerto Ricans in the U.S. However, this is the first acoustic study of PRS as spoken in this region. Using experimental designs and acoustic analysis, the first purpose of this research project is to provide a comprehensive description of trill variation in Western Massachusetts, uncovering any differences among those realizations found in the diaspora as well as in relevant speech communities in Puerto Rico. As such, the research will contribute to the debate as to whether there are specific mainland varieties of PRS. Furthermore, recent work in PRS suggests that the phonemes /h/ and /x/ are becoming neutralized (e.g. Ram\u00f3n 'Raymond' and jam\u00f3n 'ham' become homophonous). In this vein, a further objective of this study is to understand whether there is evidence for this neutralization in the PRS spoken in Western Massachusetts. This phenomenon will be examined through both production and perception experiments. \r\n\r\nWhile the project is of theoretical importance for the linguistic subfields of laboratory phonology and sociolinguistics, there are also practical implications that should allow for instructors and speakers in general to promote and destigmatize the Spanish of the Latino community in Western Massachusetts and to understand that trill realizations constitute a legitimate variation that exists in Puerto Rico as well as in the diaspora.",

Additionally, it provides greater understanding of the processes that underlie phonemic /r/ and /h/ distinction in production by Puerto Rican Spanish speakers. Previous studies on Spanish sociophonetics have examined rhotic variation on the island and in the diaspora but have not shown a detailed acoustic description and comparison of the backed /r/ ([xa.m&oacute;n]) and /h/ ([ha.m&oacute;n]). Hence, this study is the first analysis to extract center of gravity, skewness and kurtosis measurements to better understand the points of articulation involved in fricative realizations of /r/ and /h/. Continuous measurements are considered since they can reveal more adequately the relationship between the variation found in the acoustic signal and its conditioning factors and to better identify patterns of variation. Consequently, this study adds to the body of research on PRS phonology in the United States. Specifically, it provides substantial contributions on the mapping between phonetic categories and acoustic properties by offering a detail analysis of this mapping for phonemic /r/ and /h/ in Puerto Rican Spanish. Among the current results, center of gravity and skewness successfully offers a multidimensional acoustic alternative for a more accurate explanatory mechanism and richer descriptive adequacy in the analyses of phonemic /r/ and /h/. Therefore, the analyses of those measurements reveal that an acoustic phenomenon could be better understood along a continuum rather than in discrete units typical of segmental analysis.</p>\n<p>This research demonstrates that the incorporation of a new fricative realization (backed /r/), affects the PRS phonological system. Although the difference in center of gravity, skewness and kurtosis means between the backed /r/ and /h/ are significantly different, there are still cases of overlap. That is to say, phonemic /h/ and phonemic /r/, which are generally found in phonemic opposition, might fail to completely contrast in some specific environment: in onset position when phonemic /r/ is produced as a backed /r/. However, since the backed /r/ is produced in a 15% among the overall phonemic /r/ realizations among the current data, it is not accurate to talk about a complete /r/-/h/ neutralization. Moreover, this possible merge is affected by different linguistic (STRESS and FOLLOWING SOUND) and sociolinguistic factors (ORIGIN, GENERATION SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, AGE and TASK). Such potential neutralization that affects the realization of phonemic /h/ and /r/ in specific contexts in a significant way is not an accidental phenomenon that occurs in PRS. Its phonological system undergoes different phonological processes such as the deletion of final /s/ and /n/; or the alternation of /l/ and /r/ in syllable/word final position. Interestingly, many of the neutralized contrasts regarding the Spanish phonology happen in coda position: neutralization of liquids, plosives, nasals or rhotics. However, the merger under study in the current research happens in the onset of the syllable, position where the other phenomena mentioned maintain a phonological contrast. Phonological processes can also be a consequence of language attitudes and identity, such as the velarized /s/ in Madrile&ntilde;o Spanish, a highly-stigmatized feature that conveys Madrile&ntilde;o identity (Wright, 2017). Similarly, the backed /r/ realization is an identity marker used in Holyoke to express Puerto Ricanness, whose more posterior variants might be neutralized with the glottal phoneme /h/ under specific circumstances implying a linguistic change that affects not only the consonantal system of the PRS phonemic inventory but also the Spanish system in general.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, the study of spoken variation also assists in pedagogical issues.

Puerto Ricans in Holyoke maintain PRS variety for identity reasons.
