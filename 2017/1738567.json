 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description\u00a0\r\nComparing the development of distinct types of animal eyes provides a remarkable 'natural laboratory' for understanding how visual systems work, and how animals use visual information to interact with each other and with their environment.\u00a0 This research will study the function of two crustacean species, the mantis shrimp and a copepod, which have vastly different eyes than most other animals. This fellowship will take place in the School of Marine Science and Policy at the University of Delaware, working with an internationally recognized researcher in crustacean visual physiology and behavior. The fellowship will provide training to the PI and a graduate student in techniques that measure changes in electrical output of cells to characterize changes in eye function over the course of development.\u00a0 By studying these two species in particular, and coupling newly learned techniques with the PI's expertise in evolutionary studies through DNA analysis, the proposed research will reveal how developmental changes in visual systems affect the behavior of an animal.\u00a0 The knowledge gained in the project will be integrated into a newly developed course in Sensory Biology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM). In addition, the work will be used to provide summer research experience to undergraduates through two funded UHM NSF funded REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) summer programs, one of which specifically targets the involvement of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students.\u00a0 \u00a0\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nThis fellowship will provide training for the PI and a graduate student in crustacean-specific electrophysiology and behavioral techniques, providing them with the interdisciplinary tools to link molecular evolution with physiological function and behavioral output for a truly integrated research program in visual system evolution. The work will focus on generating novel ontogenetic datasets for two crustaceans with unique eyes, the stomatopod\u00a0Squilla empusa\u00a0and the copepod\u00a0Labidocera aestiva, to investigate the development and evolution of sensory system diversification.\u00a0 Specific project goals are to characterize complex stomatopod and simple copepod eyes using electrophysiology to describe underlying photoreceptor diversity and function, and behavioral assays to establish when particular visual capabilities become functional during development. The addition of two new methodologies for studies of visual system form and function will be transformative for the PI's research program, generating broad, integrative training for both undergraduate and graduate students and making future proposals more competitive through more integrated experimental designs.\u00a0 Conversely, time spent at the University of Delaware will allow for reciprocal training in molecular techniques for members of the host laboratory, thus providing the same integrative training across two institutions. The proposed project will establish a collaboration between leaders in the fields of crustacean molecular evolution and visual physiology, as well as strengthen newly-initiated collaborations with other research units at the PI's home institution.\u00a0\u00a0",

Furthermore, in many crustacean species the visual system changes as different life history stages transition between different habitats.&nbsp; For example, many crustacean larvae live in open ocean habitats and have simpler eyes than the adults they eventually become.&nbsp; In general, the diversity of crustacean visual systems is understudied, with few species being fully characterized across biological scales (e.g. molecular components of vision, photoreceptor morphology, physiology, behavior); even fewer studies investigate all of these components of vision in the larval stages of crustaceans. Within crustaceans, the visual systems of adult stomatopods (i.e. mantis shrimp) contain the most complex array of photoreceptors of any animal. Developmentally, stomatopod species transition from a larval phase with a simple compound eye similar to other crustacean larval eyes to the complex adult eye by building an entirely new retina. Because of this developmental transition from simple larval eyes to anatomically and physiologically complex adult eyes by building an entirely new retina, and because of extensive previous research characterizing the complexity in adult stomatopod eyes, stomatopod crustaceans are a unique system for integrated studies of larval visual systems. The goal of this training fellowship was to learn physiological and behavioral techniques in order to integrate these methods with the molecular research in the Porter lab at the University of Hawai?i at M&#257;noa for fully integrated studies of larval crustacean visual systems, with the specific aim of studying larval stomatopod visual systems.<br /><br />The behavioral and physiological research completed as a part of the fellowship training opportunity has led to the publication of five published peer-reviewed research papers first-authored by graduate students, one perspective article on the importance of studying larval crustacean visual systems, and two book chapters (one on crustacean photoreceptor physiology, one on copepod eye diversity including an undergraduate as a co-author). One of the articles published as a part of this work was featured on the website and the issue cover of the Journal of Crustacean Biology. The methods learned through this training opportunity were incorporated into the training and research projects of two Ph.D. students, one M.S. student, and four undergraduate students. The research completed as part of this fellowship also led to the development of significant collaborative projects and additional submitted grant proposals with Jon Cohen at the University of Delaware, who provided the training in all techniques. The data generated from the funded training research includes spectral sensitivity data, retinal photoreceptor anatomical descriptions, innate color preference data, phototactic behavior, circadian rhythms, and feeding rates for up to four species of larval stomatopods, with a particular focus on larval visual sensitivity to ultraviolet light and its impact on larval behavior.<br /><br />Comparing the development of distinct eye types across crustacean groups provides a remarkable ?natural laboratory? for integrating investigations of the molecular, physiological, and behavioral specializations involved in the development and evolution of both simple and complex crustacean eyes. From these studies, we have described unique optical structures in larval stomatopod eyes; confirmed that larval stomatopod eyes are sensitive to ultraviolet light, with the potential to detect multiple ?colors? of UV light, using anatomy, physiology, molecules, and behavior; demonstrated differences in innate color preferences among larval stomatopod species associated with variations in larval eye complexity; demonstrated circadian rhythms in larval stomatopods with respect to the presence or absence of UV light; and quantified feeding rates relative to differences in light environment of several larval stomatopod species.
