 "awd_abstract_narration": "The behavior of small solid particles such as sand, dust or volcanic ash moving in water or air flows is an important consideration in a wide range of fields.  For example, environmental dust can shorten a jet engine's service life by 90 percent.  State-of-the-art experiments can only collect particle data in highly simplified systems.  A new technique is being developed that uses conventional medical Magnetic Resonance Imaging systems to make quantitative measurements of how particles are distributed in complex systems.  The data sets produced would have broad benefits for engineers, as well as for researchers studying environmental, biological, and fundamental physical systems.  A series of validation experiments will be carried out to complete development of the imaging technique and to establish its accuracy and limitations.  After the technique has been developed, two additional experiments will be performed to demonstrate broad societal benefits of the new measurements: one by assisting the design of more dust-resistant aircraft engines and the other by illuminating how inhaled dust or spray droplets move through the human nose.  Following the successful completion of this project, researchers would have a general method to aid in their understanding of any system where particles are carried by air or water currents.\r\n\r\nPreliminary experiments have demonstrated that Magnetic Resonance Imaging can be used to measure the concentration of microparticles quantitatively and in three dimensions.  The proposed work begins with a detailed set of validation experiments to test the range, resolution, and accuracy of the new experimental method across a range of flow conditions and particle concentrations.  Following the validation experiments, two application-relevant test cases will be employed as test beds for continued development of the technique. The first will explore the behavior of particles in an internal impingement cooling geometry frequently employed in aircraft turbine engine cooling systems.  In the second test case, particle concentration will be measured inside a model human nasal passage.  In addition to developing the technique, the test cases allow for new understanding of particle transport in two disparate fields of significant research interest.  The impact of the project has the potential to extend well past the scope of this proposal, as the technique could prove useful for computational model validation, fundamental particle-laden flow research, or a number of other research areas.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFine particles carried by air or water flows can be very important in a wide range of applications.  For example, medicines can be inhaled as fine powders rather than injected if methods can be designed to allow them to reach deep into the lungs.  Volcanic ash or fine sand drawn into jet engines can cause reductions in service life or catastrophic failure.  Prior to this work, there was no method available to measure where particles went as they moved through complex geometry flow systems.  Typically a researcher would pass air carrying particles through a test part for some hours then cut the part open to see where particles had deposited.  This slow and costly process did not provide any detail on the particles? motions and required a new test part for each experimental test point.  The present work developed a new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) method for measuring the distribution of particles in flowing fluids passing through complex geometries.  The method uses conventional medical grade MRI scanners so it could be applied anywhere such a scanner is available.  The method is based on small disturbances to the magnetic field produced by individual metal particles dispersed in the flow.  The new MRI method was tested in three practical flow situations to demonstrate its versatility and wide applicability.  The first was a complex serpentine passage commonly used for cooling the turbine blades in jet engines.  Previously it was believed that very fine particles would be uniformly distributed inside the flow.  However, the present measurements indicated that a significant fraction of the particles are carried through the flow in high concentration streaks.  The second demonstration experiment examined an in-line separator designed to eliminate sand from air streams before the air enters propulsion or power generation systems.  The measurements showed why the existing design has relatively low particle separation efficiency.  Finally, experiments were performed on an anatomically accurate model of a human nasal cavity with relevance to particle-borne disease and inhalable medicines.  One interesting result is that in order for inhalable medicines to penetrate into the olfactory region (in the upper part of the nasal cavity) they must be introduced near the tip of the nostril.  Particles introduced near the base of the nostril pass through the bottom half of the nasal cavity and never reach the olfactory region.  This conclusion probably depends on the specific way the particles are injected and perhaps on the particle size.  The new MRI method would allow developers of powdered medicine injectors to design effective systems to reach the targeted part of the anatomy.  The specific MRI techniques designed for measuring particle concentration may find application to measuring other medically-relevant quantities in the human body.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/11/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John K Eaton"
