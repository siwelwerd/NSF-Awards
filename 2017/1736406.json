 "awd_abstract_narration": "Neuroimaging techniques, including structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have allowed researchers to investigate the neural bases of developmental changes in cognition. In recent years, it has become more common for researchers to obtain multiple measures of the same individual across development. These longitudinal MRI datasets require special consideration for processing and analysis, yet the field as a whole has not standardized best practices for these datasets, which could be one reason why it is difficult to replicate results across laboratories and research studies. A two-day workshop will be open to 60 developmental neuroimaging researchers and will teach best practices for processing, analyzing, modeling, and interpreting longitudinal neuroimaging data. This will help researchers conduct robust and consistent research on how the brain and cognition change across development. Importantly, this workshop will fund at least nine students or trainees who are planning to, or are directly working with, longitudinal neuroimaging data, providing strong practical skills for emerging research scientists in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience. \r\n\r\nIt is both timely and vital to hold a workshop for researchers in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience to examine differences in longitudinal modeling, statistical processing and analysis, and interpretation. Recent work has uncovered how methodological differences may be adversely affecting replicability in the field of neuroimaging, and there is an increasing drive to validate the processing and statistical techniques that are employed in neuroimaging research. There has also been increasing support for standardization of techniques and reporting criteria, such as the recent Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) protocol for organizing and describing MRI datasets. The overarching aim of this workshop is to teach best practice guidelines for processing, analyzing, modeling, and interpreting longitudinal structural and functional neuroimaging data, which will inform our knowledge of how the brain and cognition change across development. It will address additional statistical concerns specific to longitudinal neuroimaging that also need validation, and consider standardization of techniques and reporting criteria that will improve the comparability of findings. The main outcome of this workshop will be that researchers leave with answers to questions about processing longitudinal functional and structural MRI data and the correct tools to move forward with research in developmental cognitive neuroscience. This type of work has the potential to answer fundamental questions about neural plasticity and sensitive periods of cognitive development through observing neural changes during learning. It is also inherently related to the fields of developmental affective, social, and clinical neuroscience, and therefore has the potential to translate directly to the prevention and treatment of emerging psychopathology. This workshop will push the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience forward to develop robust and precise models that have strong translational applications for public policy.",
