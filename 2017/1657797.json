 "awd_abstract_narration": "Seafloor volcanoes are important dynamic features of our environment both in how they shape the surface of the earth and how they support life at the seafloor.  Seafloor volcanoes are not easily accessible, however.  The Cabled Array component of the Ocean Observatories Initiative provides the infrastructure and instruments to observe an active volcano offshore Oregon, Axial Volcano.  Axial Volcano has erupted in 1998, 2011, and 2015.  This project will add a new, continuously operating instrument, the Self-Calibrating Pressure Recorder (SCPR).  The SCPR can, unlike conventional instruments, provide a drift free continuous estimate of height changes on the summit of Axial Volcano.  The SCPR measurements will aid in understanding the processes occurring within Axial Volcano, and enable forecasts of future eruptions.  These measurements are but one component of a larger investigation at Axial Volcano, and directly complements and supports other research efforts. The project supports the training of a Ph.D. student.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of seafloor volcanoes is much more limited than our knowledge of continental volcanoes. Axial Volcano in the Northeast Pacific appears to be accelerating in its eruption cycle. Eruptions in 1998, 2011, and 2015 have been observed with sparse geodetic coverage.  This coverage is increasing now that the OOI Cabled Array is in operation at Axial Volcano. Uplift rates preceding the two most recent eruptions are much higher than before, indicating an increase in magma supply. This project will install a continuously operating instrument, the Self-Calibrating Pressure Recorder (SCPR) on the OOI Cabled Array.  The SCPR can provide drift free pressure measurements (using an internal drift free pressure reference), which in turn can be used as proxies for vertical deformation.  The vertical deformation measurements can be used to better constrain models of magma eruption volume and recharge rates.  Additionally, the SCPR can serve as a reference station for other geodetic arrays and surveys, including Remotely Operated Vehicle campaign pressure surveys and Autonomous Underwater Vehicle repeat bathymetric mapping.  There are many potential applications of this technology to other disciplines, including physical oceanography for detecting decadal scale processes as well as sea level change.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\nMany geological processes occur on the seafloor, an area difficult to study.  In particular, subsea volcanoes require unique methods to monitor their growth, eruption, and subsequent recovery.  Axial Volcano is one such example off the Oregon-Washington coast.  Geological monitoring has both scientific relevance and applications in monitoring potential natural hazards.\n\nPressure measurements can be used as a form of altimeter, to measure changes in the seafloor height.  However, pressure gauges all drift at a small rate that is still too great for scientific use.  We have addressed this by developing an instrument, the Self Calibrating Pressure Recorder (SCPR).  The SCPR generates a known and accurate reference pressure, which is used to monitor the drift rates of pressure gauge incorporated within the SCPR.  In turn, the calibrated and corrected gauges can produce drift-free observations for scientific study.\n\nIn this project, the SCPR was connected into the Cabled Array of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI).  The NSF-funded OOI program provides the essential infrastructure of power and communications to make the SCPR a real-time continuous instrument. \n\nThe SCPR was deployed in July of 2018, and since then has collected both seafloor pressure and calibration records.  The recalibrated gauges are now drift free with a nominal uncertainty of order 4 mm.  The SCPR has two gauges observing in parallel, which provide both redundancy and an essential check on the reliability of the calibration process.  In turn, the drift-free time series is detecting volcanic inflation at Axial on the order of 42 cm/year from August 2018 to mid-2019.  After mid-2019, a three-month slowdown and subsidence occurred, followed by a return of inflation at a lower rate of 15 cm/year.  \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Glenn S Sasagawa"
