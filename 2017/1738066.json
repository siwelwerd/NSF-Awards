The Board provides objective and authoritative advice on how best to apply the tools of mathematics, statistics, operations research, financial engineering, simulation science, analytics, risk analysis, systems engineering, and decision analysis to practical problems of national importance. Over its nearly 33 years of existence, the BMSA has produced 81 reports. Through its work, the Board strengthens the policymaking process; increases the visibility of, and appreciation for, the mathematical sciences; and identifies growth areas for the discipline.\r\n\r\nThe Board provides objective and authoritative advice on how best to apply the tools of mathematics, statistics, operations research, financial engineering, simulation science, analytics, risk analysis, systems engineering, and decision analysis to practical problems of national importance. It consists of pro bono experts from a broad range of quantitative fields with experience in academia, industry, government, and national laboratories. Board members carry out their work by identifying important steps of value to federal agencies and the mathematical sciences, and then recruiting leading mathematical scientists to participate in workshops, studies, and other activities focused on the technical challenges of federal decision-makers.",
