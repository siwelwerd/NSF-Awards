The project will combine computational and experimental methods to design materials with specific desirable properties. The project will advance fundamental knowledge of complex materials while simultaneously working toward the development of products with valuable commercial applications, such as improved lasers, water treatment, and regenerative medicine. The project will make major investments in South Carolina?s research capacity, acquiring state-of-the art instrumentation and computing capabilities and hiring seventeen new faculty researchers at institutions across the state.  In parallel with its research agenda, MADE in SC will also work to improve Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education capacity in South Carolina through college curriculum improvements and professional development activities for high school teachers.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description \r\nMADE in SC materials development process will use a Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) framework, incorporating an iterative design loop wherein modeling and computation based on initial design constraints provide data that will inform experimental design. Imaging and data visualization of experimental results will lead to insights that can then drive additional modeling work, with the cycle continuing until an optimal solution is achieved.  This MGI-based framework will depend on the resources of the Multiscale Modeling and Computational Core (MCC), which will be established as part of the project.  The MCC will develop modeling capabilities appropriate across length scales (microscopic, mesoscopic, and continuum), and will support the application of these tools to the project?s major research thrusts: 1) hierarchical structures with controlled optical and magnetic properties; 2) stimuli-responsive polymeric materials; and 3) rational design of interactive biomaterials.  These research efforts will advance fundamental understanding of the chemical and physical drivers of observed material properties while also realizing new materials with desirable properties for commercial applications.",

Inter-disciplinary and/or inter-institutional collaborations within MADE      in SC were reported in 22% of publications (Figures 3 (b) and 4). \nResearch infrastructure improvement: Investment of $3.2M in      materials research equipment at seven institutions (three CRUs and four      PUIs) is being used to sustain future materials research in SC.\nSustainability: Materials research was supplemented by successfully securing      over $111M in additional funding, including four NSF RUI, three NSF REU, a      DOE EFRC; six NSF MRI, an S-STEM; four NSF CAREER, two NSF Bridge to      Doctorate, two NIH R01, one NIH R21 and two NSF DMREF awards.\nTranslational research: MADE in SC faculty members      served as co-investigators on 63 patent disclosures (20 granted and three      licensed).\n\n\n\nBroader Impact\n\nEngagement of researchers at all levels: Broad engagement was realized,      incorporating 90 faculty, 24 post-docs, over 140 distinct graduate      students (some contributing multiple years), and over 190 undergraduates.\nInclusive faculty excellence: Faculty diversity      within advanced materials research/education was increased, hiring 17 new      faculty through MADE in SC across five institutions (three CRUs, one PUI, one      HBCU). Six new faculty (35%) were hired from groups underrepresented in      their fields, including five at CRUs. \nBroadening participation: Over $280,000 was invested      in 29 Scientific Advocacy awards supporting diversity initiatives in STEM at      the K-12, undergraduate and graduate level statewide. Additional diversity      initiatives were developed through institutional commitments (Winthrop)      and externally funded programs (Furman). The      first Bridges to the Doctorate programs were offered at Clemson and UofSC,      with Clemsons program focused on advanced materials. Summer      materials science camps engaged 38 HS teachers, including a new      Professional Development course in Materials at Winthrop. Six-week      research experiences engaged 30 teachers, predominantly from SC high      schools serving underrepresented and/or low-income students.\nCurriculum development: New MGI curricula were developed      and delivered at 2-year, 4-year and R1 institutions.\nPartnership with industry: Forty new research and      educational partnerships were established between academic institutions      and industry to serve the SC economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: PrakashNagarkatti\n"
