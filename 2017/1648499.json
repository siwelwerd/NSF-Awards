 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is developing and producing a sustainable ink for the printing industry. Ink is commonly used in a variety of applications, and billions of pounds of ink are produced annually.  The majority of chemicals within ink are petroleum based and are mined from the earth.  These chemicals also are toxic to humans and the environment. Nature has produced a multitude of molecules capable of replacing components currently utilized in ink. While many organisms that produce these replacement molecules are slow growing and require energy sources like sugar, photosynthetic microbes, specifically cyanobacteria, are capable of being engineered to generate some of these replacement molecules in an efficient manner to produce pigments in ink formulations that are safe, renewable and 100% biodegradable. This ink will be used by businesses for printing packaging, marketing material, and other printed products. Developing and integrating these ink products will decrease the overall detrimental impact of traditional inks on the environment and human health. \r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop sustainable ink formulations using engineered cyanobacteria cells capable of generating cellular pigments that will make the cultures optically black in appearance.  These optically black cells will act as pigments that replace mined pigments found in traditional ink formulations. This project uses entire cyanobacteria cells in ink formulations so that extraction of pigments/dyes is not necessary, thus saving energy and reducing cost.  While currently utilized pigments used for ink are minerals mined from the ground such as carbon black, which is a finite material, cyanobacteria are a renewable source of biomass for bio-products, as these organisms leverage sunlight, carbon dioxide, wastewater and land otherwise unsuitable for conventional agriculture to rapidly generate biomass. In addition to the development of renewable cyanobacteria strains considered to be optically black, this project will develop optimal growth conditions as well as techno-economic models leveraging these strains within several subsets of the ink industry.  Using cyanobacteria to produce ink products is a novel application, which will be a major breakthrough for the algal bio-products industry.",
