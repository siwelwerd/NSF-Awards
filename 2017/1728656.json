 "awd_abstract_narration": "The semiconductor industry faces new challenges in the sub-10 nanometer era as scaling will no longer dominate performance improvement for electronic devices.  New materials and combinations of materials provide an opportunity to improve performance and function with minimal change to the device construction. For example, using germanium as the substrate can provide both lower power consumption and faster computing speeds. And using perovskite oxides that are both magnetic and electronic as the functional layer can enable advanced memory devices, integrated optical isolators and spintronic devices.  The research will explore how to grow these crystalline perovskite oxide films directly on germanium.  The research explores an all-chemical growth process that should be scalable, is inherently less costly from a manufacturing cost of ownership, and is based on current manufacturing equipment.  The impact will be in processes to enable future devices that exploit charge and spin.  As well, the researcher engages in an outreach program called \"Alice in Wonderland\" that is aimed at attracting female high-school students to the physical sciences and engineering.  These students from local high schools will spend their summers at the University of Texas at Austin participating in research within a supportive environment.  \r\n\r\nThe overarching objectives of this research are to understand and describe processes that lead to the formation of crystalline multiferroic oxides on Ge(001) with the requisite ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties in a chemical deposition process that is scalable and manufacturable.  The research explores iron-doped barium titantate, with iron levels up to 20 percent, and bismuth ferrite crystalline oxides grown directly on Ge.  The research uses molecular beam epitaxy to prepare well-defined surfaces and atomic layer deposition to grow the epitaxial structures; in situ electron and photon spectroscopies are used to characterize the films and interfaces; and ex situ transmission electron microscopy, and x-ray scattering, magnetic and electrical measurements establish structure-property relations.  The research benefits from the infrastructure, adjacency of related research and expertise the principal investigator brings in atomically controlled growth, materials characterization, surface chemistry, and electrical property measurement.  Specific focus areas for the fundamental studies include: 1) elucidating the reactions and structural changes at the Ge(001) oxide interface that seed crystalline oxide formation; 2) understanding the evolution of structure in the perovskite layer leading to a crystalline film and how the structure depends on process conditions; and 3) establishing the structure-property-function relationships in the context of a multiferroic oxide that features ferroelectric and ferro-/antiferromagnetic properties within a temperature window that is technologically relevant.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe semiconductor industry faces new challenges in the sub-10 nanometer era as scaling will no longer dominate performance improvement for electronic devices.  New materials and combinations of materials provide an opportunity to improve performance and function with minimal change to the device construction. For example, using germanium as the substrate can provide both lower power consumption and faster computing speeds. And using perovskite oxides that are both magnetic and electronic as the functional layer can enable advanced memory devices, integrated optical isolators and spintronic devices.  The research studied how to grow these crystalline perovskite oxide films directly on germanium and silicon.  This research explored an all-chemical growth process that is scalable and is inherently less costly from a manufacturing cost of ownership.  The anticipated impact is on future devices that exploit charge and spin. \n\n \n\nMost microelectronics devices are grown on wafers of crystalline silicon that have a very specific arrangement of silicon atoms.  Future microelectronics devices are also likely to be grown on germanium and the requirements for silicon hold true for germanium.  For metal oxides integrated with germanium and silicon to function properly for the innovative devices, the oxide atoms (ions really) must be organized into a single crystal layer that exactly matches with the atoms of the germanium or silicon on which the oxide is grown.  This is commonly known as epitaxy.  This project studies perovskite metal oxides consisting of barium, titanium, iron, and oxygen that are polar and magnetic.  Imagine a cube with barium ions at the four corners of the cube and titanium ions at the center with a chemical formula of BaTiO3.  As this cube registers with the germanium or silicon surface the barium ions must fit between the rows of germanium or silicon, like stacking egg cartons together.  Barium titanate is slightly larger than germanium or silicon and the cube must compress (or squeeze) in from the sides and this makes it ever so slightly longer, so it is now an elongated rectangle.  During film growth the rectangles keep accumulating and the titanium ions in the center of each elongated rectangle can now move up or down a little and this makes the barium titanate ferroelectric.  By replacing one out of ten (to four out of ten) titanium ions with iron ions the rectangular cubes still form in registry with the germanium or silicon and the iron imparts magnetic properties to the film.  The challenges during film growth are to direct the ions to the correct locations so a single crystal forms that is ferroic and to control the iron oxidation state, so it is magnetic. \n\n \n\nThe studies explored how films assemble into crystalline layers and how the growth processes introduce defects into the films.  Atomic-scale control of thickness and composition is critical since the oxide films need to be around 3 to 10 nm thick.  As a reference, the average width of a human hair is around 100,000 nm.  The studies explored metal oxide film growth using metalorganic molecules that react with the crystal surface.  This chemical approach, known as atomic layer deposition, affords a scalable process for translating the fundamental results into a manufacturable process.  Chemical routes to the growth of single crystal iron-alloyed barium titanate were discovered on germanium and silicon.  The relationships between growth chemistry and film structure and properties were revealed.  Ferroic properties and magnetic properties were measured.  A pathway to a multiferroic films that is both ferroic and magnetic was not found.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John G Ekerdt"
