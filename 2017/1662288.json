 "awd_abstract_narration": "Geckos can rapidly turn on and off the adhesive force of their feet and keep them from fouling during running on dusty walls, while some desert beetles can use their forewings to collect drinking water from fog. Mimicking these natural surfaces could result in novel materials with unique capabilities for numerous applications. In this project, an integrated experimental and computational approach will synthetically reproduce the desired biological features to create a new class of nanocomposites with tunable stickiness and self-cleaning characteristics. The anticipated long-term research outcome is a technical platform for developing the next generation of engineered materials, potentially useful for self-cleaning, sensing, nano-manipulation and assembly, and water harvesting in extremely arid regions, to mention a few. This research involves several disciplines including mechanics, materials science, biology, and nanotechnology. The multi-disciplinary platform will provide opportunities for underrepresented groups to participate in advanced research. Similarly, undergraduate research fellowships will be supported to provide exposure to engineering students to wide-ranging education and skills.\r\n\r\nIn this project, new biomimetic wrinkle graphene-based nanocomposites with tunable adhesion and self-cleaning capabilities will be fabricated by mimicking the unique features of the biological structures found on gecko footpads and beetle forewings. A multiscale atomistic and micromechanics modeling approach will be used to interpret experimental results and to address how the biomimetic features can be translated into enhanced switchability, self-cleaning, and controlled release capabilities. The adhesive force and deformations will be measured with advanced microscopy tools and high-rate image capture, and a physics-based modeling approach will be developed to understand electromechanics of the biomimetic thin films. The modeling and experiments will be integrated to link the nanoscale phenomena to macroscopic performance. The results of this research will provide novel smart materials and a fundamental understanding of switching mechanisms for the design and development of the materials with unique performance features of practical significance.",
