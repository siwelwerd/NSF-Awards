 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy has entered an era of massive data streams, with catalogs containing hundreds of millions of stars and galaxies measured at thousands of time-steps with hundreds of attributes to be analyzed.  To extract knowledge from these large and complex data sets we must account for noise and gaps, and understand if and when we may have detected a fundamentally new physical phenomenon.  The problem is not solely the size of the data, but a basic question of how to discover, represent, visualize and interact with the knowledge that these data contain.  Astronomical data provide a popular testbed for developing methods applicable throughout the physical and life sciences.\r\n\r\nastroML is an open source machine-learning library that addresses all of the challenges, providing a publicly available repository for fast python implementations of statistical routines for astronomy, as well as examples of astrophysical data analyses using techniques from statistics and machine learning.  In the three years since its release, astroML has been installed over 21,000 times.  The current project will further develop astroML into a general machine learning toolkit for the next generation of astrophysical surveys, adding code examples and tutorials, exploiting multicore and multiprocessing hardware, and supporting the second edition of the text \"Statistics, Data Mining, and Machine Learning in Astronomy: A Practical Python Guide for the Analysis of Survey Data\".  Algorithms to be developed include approximate Bayesian computation, hierarchical Bayes, an interface to deep learning algorithms, and modifying the regression and regularization code to account for uncertainties within the data.\r\n\r\nAll developed algorithms will be publicly available, and astroML has already been used in cancer research and analysis of the securities market, and to teach data science in astronomy.  The refactored code can be used to teach both the statistics and software engineering techniques needed for large scale machine learning.",

With catalogs comprising hundreds of millions of stars and galaxies measured at thousands of separate time-steps and each with hundreds to thousands of measured attributes, we now face the  challenge of how to extract knowledge from these large and complex data sets; how to account for the noise and gaps within the data; and how to understand when we have detected a fundamentally new class of event or physical phenomena. This is not just a question of the size of the data it a fundamental question of how we represent, visualize, and discover  the knowledge that these data contain.  In this data-rich era, machine learning algorithms and Artificial Intelligence techniques  will drive many of the discoveries we will make about our universe. This award supported the creation of new algorithms and software to analyze astronomical data sets. Over the period of the award we developed and released a library of software tools, astroML, that can be used for measuring the temporal properties of astronomical sources (e.g. how much stars change in brightness as a function of time), to classify sources based on their images observed at different wavelengths, and to separate stars and galaxies into different classes based on their spectral properties and characteristics. This software library is available as an open source package, enabling other researchers to use, modify, and contribute to the code. All algorithms are accompanied by educational material including an interactive book (see Figure 1) that provides the statistical background for the tools such as Approximate Bayesian Computation (see Figure 2),  a set of worked examples that use current astronomical data sets, and the ability for a user download the code or execute it on platforms such as Google Colab and Binder.  Among the astronomical discoveries we made using these software tools are &gt;100 new asteroids or minor planets beyond the orbit of Neptune. Other researchers have used the library to find planets around nearby stars, to classify radio pulsars from their time series data, and to search for tidal tails of globular clusters within the Milky Way.</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/12/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Andrew&nbsp;J&nbsp;Connolly</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1715122/1715122_10511861_1670822442612_astroML-InteractiveBook--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1715122/1715122_10511861_1670822442612_astroML-InteractiveBook--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"An Interactive book for Machine Learning in Astronomy\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1715122/1715122_10511861_1670822442612_astroML-InteractiveBook--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"An Interactive book for Machine Learning in Astronomy\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The astroML machine learning library provides an interactive book that is rendered in a webpage (including text, figures, and code).
