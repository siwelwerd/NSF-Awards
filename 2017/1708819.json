 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now conceivable to fabricate engineered tissues inside the human body through a \"keyhole\" surgery with a robotic, endoscopic 3D printer.  This long-term vision has broad implications for healthcare; the way in which surgeons replace diseased and damaged tissue could be forever transformed.  This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports a study on the dynamics of material delivery in an endoscopic 3D printer, a necessary step to realize this vision. This award also supports an innovative program for high school students to design an assistive device for patients with a specific ambulation disability.  \r\n\r\nAn endoscopic 3D printer is composed of a rod-like end-effector (to deliver a fluid-phase material through a \"keyhole\" surgical site) and a chain of kinematic elements (to position this end-effector).  With this form-factor, an endoscopic 3D printer will have dynamic coupling between the positioning and material delivery sub-systems of the end-effector (not observed in a standard 3D printer), and a higher fluidic resistance in the material delivery sub-system than a standard 3D printer.  The first research objective is to establish the analytic input-output relationship for the end-effector and compare the output value to a computational model.  To achieve this objective, the established Herschel-Bulkley constitutive model for non-Newtonian colloidal fluids will be used to describe the material while geometric constraints and boundary conditions relevant to an endoscopic 3D printer end-effector will be imposed.  The output (flowrate) prediction from the input-output relationship will be compared to the predicted output value from a multi-physics computational model.  The second objective is to test the hypothesis that the output rise time of a two-degree-of-freedom material delivery actuator (designed to mitigate the higher fluidic resistance) will be significantly lower than the output rise time of a nominal material delivery actuator.  This hypothesis will be tested by experiments. The output rise time for the two different material delivery actuators will be measured by machine vision under dynamic flowrate references.  The third objective is to establish the input-output relationships of the complete endoscopic 3D printer and compare outputs values to an experiment.  To achieve this objective, a quasi-static kinematic model will be used to describe the serial chain of kinematic elements, which will then be coupled with the end-effector input-output relationship established in objectives one and two.  Multiple output predictions (six positions and one flowrate) from the input-output relationships will be compared to measured values from experiments performed on a prototype endoscopic 3D printer.",

This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports a study on the dynamics of material delivery in an endoscopic 3D printer, a necessary step to realize this vision. An endoscopic 3D printer (Fig. 2) is composed of a rod-like end-effector (to deliver a fluid-phase material through a \u2018keyhole\u2019 surgical site) and a chain of kinematic elements (to position this end-effector).

The key outcomes of this project are:\n\nThe dynamics of microextrusion using an endoscopic 3D printer have now been fully described, providing an understanding of critical dynamic properties of such a system.  This enables our team and others to design and build an endoscopic 3D printer and design feedback control systems (Fig. 3) for this hardware for accurate manufacturing of engineered tissues inside the body.\nOur team has built the first ever endoscopic 3D printer for the purposes of printing engineered tissues inside the body (Fig. 2).  This system is designed for the laboratory environment, permitting materials and manufacturing studies in the laboratory in a surgery mimicking setting.  This prototype system was built by a team of graduate and undergraduate students, providing valuable engineering design experience for the student researchers.\nThe dynamic analysis of endoscopic 3D printing shows that the robotic positioning systems are fast, compared to the extrusion axis, and that the extrusion axis is best described by a switched system.  We have described and designed switched feedback controllers for the unique, multi-mode (switched) systems that described endoscopic 3D printing.  Our analysis proves that a switched control scheme is stable and our manufacturing studies demonstrate higher manufacturing accuracy when using this control scheme (Figs. 3 and 4).\nThe first ever prints of biomaterials (gelatin methacryloyl with embedded NIH 3T3 cells) in a laboratory environment have been completed (Fig. 5a).  Endoscopic 3D printing positioning axes are challenged by high mechanical compliance and a cumulative error effect where each robot link contributes to further positioning errors; however, careful calibration permits manufacturing with dimensional fidelity that is sufficient for printing engineered tissues.  The high pressures and stresses in endoscopic 3D printing do decrease cell viability (approximately 80% in conventional D printing of engineered tissues and approximately 70% in endoscopic 3D printing of engineered tissues), but this level of viability is sufficient for impactful biomedical applications.  \n\n\nThe vision of this CAREER award project to build and understand an endoscopic surgical tool to directly build artificial tissues inside living patients through \u2018keyhole\u2019 surgical sites has broad implications for regenerative medicine; the broader impact is that the way in which surgeons replace diseased and defective tissue could be forever transformed.  Endoscopic 3D printing is technology pioneered by this team that seamlessly integrates into standard minimally invasive robotic surgical systems.  The value proposition is the ability to integrate tissue engineering therapeutics into a procedure for improved patient outcomes while maintaining a minimally invasive practice.  The technical plan is complemented with an educational outreach plan to bring undergraduate research students into the lab and be mentored by graduate students and postdocs and the development of a new course on the physics and engineering foundations of 3D printing (additive manufacturing).  Undergraduate researchers were part of the Teaching Engineering to K-8 (TEK8) program at Ohio State where each student completed a summer research program and then translated the project to an educational module for K-8 students.  Five undergraduate students were mentored and all five were from an underrepresented minority group for engineering. Their modules were presented to 100s of K-8 students.  The new graduate level course \"MECHENG 6194 &ndash; Physics and Engineering Foundations of Additive Manufacturing\" has been taught twice and now is taught every two years.  The class attracts students from multiple departments at Ohio State and the online Masters of Global Engineering Leadership program. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David J Hoelzle"
