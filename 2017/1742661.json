 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports travel of graduate students to a multi-disciplinary workshop in 2017 with emphasis on topics related to cyber-security. The travel grant will enable career development and learning opportunities. Attending conferences is an important component of graduate school education for future computer security researchers. Students will have the opportunity to discuss leading edge research with world-class computer security researchers, and establish networks, connections, and mentoring relationships that will serve them well during their research careers. \r\n\r\nThe workshop the graduate students will attend is called the Secure Knowledge Management (SKM) workshop. This workshop deals with topics in machine learning, privacy, trust, risk, and social and economic aspects, and technology domains such as IoT, cloud computing and big data. The requested funds will be used to support student travel awards, and members of underrepresented groups will be especially encouraged to apply. Students will be exposed to the state of the art in cyber-security as presented by experts from both academia and industry. In addition, students will hear about internships and job openings, and have ample opportunity to discuss employment and collaboration with more senior members of the field. The results of the conference, and the awards made possible by sponsors will be made available to the research community.",
