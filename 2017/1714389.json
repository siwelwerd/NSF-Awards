 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multi-megawatt datacenters, while critical to our economy, can pose a\u00a0severe cost, scalability and environmental burden. Imposed/Voluntary\u00a0demand response programs, to address these concerns, mandate dynamic\u00a0power regulation of a datacenter. This requires each of its hundreds of\u00a0thousands of servers to expose and manage knobs for dynamic regulation.\u00a0As datacenters resort to increasing levels of application consolidation\u00a0on high-end servers to reduce their Total Cost of Operation, the\u00a0co-located applications contend for the finite resources at each server.\u00a0While prior research has looked at solutions for alleviating this\u00a0contention for conventional computing resources, co-located applications\u00a0also contend for the dynamically varying power budget, which is becoming\u00a0an increasingly scarce resource. This project intends to elevate power\u00a0to become a first class citizen for explicit management, similar to\u00a0other hardware resources, in the context of current and next generation\u00a0servers hosting multiple applications.\r\n\r\nThis project will specifically investigate the following issues: (i)\u00a0when should server power be regulated? (ii) what amount of the regulated\u00a0power should be allocated to each application, and recursively to each\u00a0of its computing resources? (iii) how should power allocations be\u00a0enforced and isolated? The project will develop evaluation platforms to\u00a0implement and validate the developed research ideas in each of these\u00a0\"when\", \"what\" and \"how\" dimensions, using real datacenter/cloud\u00a0workloads. The research contributions from this project can transform\u00a0the design of server hardware and software, which make their way into\u00a0large datacenters. The project proposes curricular enhancements at\u00a0undergraduate and graduate levels using this research, in addition to\u00a0the involvement of women, minorities and undergraduate students.",
