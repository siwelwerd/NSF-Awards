This is an opportunity for physics graduate students to begin networking across borders. Throughout the conference, students will discuss current research in both formal and informal settings with international peers and professors.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThe CAM2017 workshop is designed for and by graduate students in all areas of physics. Plenary sessions will be given by well-known scientists in their sub-disciplines including Particle Physics, Astrophysics and Nuclear Physics, Condensed Matter Physics, Biophysics, Optics, Atomic Physics, Nanoscience, Computational Physics, and Materials Physics. The plenary sessions will be followed by contributed talks from the students. There will be two panel discussions titled \"Transcending Boundaries: Geographical, Disciplinary & Career\" and \"Transcending Boundaries: Personal and Societal\" highlighting CAM2017s goal to foster student ability to transcend boundaries in physics. A student poster session will round out the scientific program. All students who attend will present their research in either a contributed talk or poster session.\u00a0",

CAM2017 provided a forum for the dissemination of scientific and technical knowledge by both graduate student researchers and established senior scientists. The conference also served as a professional development opportunity for both student attendees and the student organizing committee. The overarching goal of CAM2017, like all CAM conferences, was to encourage new collaborative efforts among early career physicists in North America.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Disseminating scientific and technical knowledge was of primary importance to both CAM2017 organizers and attendees. The conference provided a platform for 93 physics graduate students (from the US, Canada, Mexico and, for the first time in conference history, Cuba) to formally present their research achievements. Student presenters, at varying stages of their academic careers, reported on their contributions to an impressive continuum of physics research covering fields from soft matter to particle physics. In addition to student presentations, 11 established scientists also attended to deliver invited plenary talks and participate in panel discussions. The scientists, a mix of professors, researchers, career experts, and even the directors of national physics organizations, offered a broad range of scientific and professional expertise. The willingness of senior scientists to mingle and exchange ideas benefitted students as much as their delivered plenary talks on topics ranging from the physics of Alzheimer's disease to the Higgs boson.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Conference organizers also aimed to support the professional and scholarly development of graduate student attendees. Toward this goal, the organizing committee arranged an optional peer feedback program for all students delivering an oral presentation. The generation of feedback was facilitated with a standardized peer feedback form probing for both qualitative and quantitative reactions to the presentation. The response to this program was overwhelmingly positive, with several participants even highlighting it as their favorite feature of the conference. To further support student professional development, the program featured panel discussions about the logistics and implications of performing research across boundaries - both literal and figurative. The first panel discussion, \"Transcending Boundaries: Geographical, Disciplinary and Career,\" featured senior scientists discussing their experiences of dealing with and overcoming obstacles that many scientists face during their careers such cultural differences and difficult career decisions. The second panel, \"Transcending Boundaries: Personal and Societal - Life as a Graduate Student in Canada, Mexico, Cuba, and the U.S.,\" was a more informal discussion designed to compare and contrast the everyday experiences of physics graduate students from each of the participating countries.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Entwined with both the scientific and professional aspects of the conference was the overarching goal of CAM2017: to support existing international scientific networks and encourage the development of new international collaborations. Organizers worked toward this goal throughout the entire conference planning process - successfully completing a project together went a long way toward supporting the existing networks among the American Physical Society, the Canadian Association of Physicists, and the Sociedad Mexicana de Fisica. Of particular note is the development of working relationships among these societies and the Cuban Physical Society, which sent both the Society's president and a delegation of Cuban students to the conference for the first time in CAM history. The Cuban delegation's presence seemed to enhance the feelings of international cooperation and friendliness throughout the conference, with many humorously calling for the conference to be renamed (perhaps to \"C^2 AM\") in recognition of Cuba's new home within CAM history.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Aside from encouraging international scientific awareness through the program theme, organizers also approached this goal by carefully cultivating the meeting atmosphere. In particular, they strove to have excellent representation from each of the countries throughout the conference; special care was taken to reflect the diversity of the student participants in the assignments of invited speakers, panelists and student chairs for the plenary and parallel sessions. Participants had many opportunities for networking within this diverse group - from regular coffee breaks to the Welcome Reception and Banquet Dinner. Efforts in this respect seem to have paid off, as reflected in general by the many comments about the friendly conference atmosphere, and in particular by the following selected post-conference comments from student participants:</p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">\"For me, attending the CAM2017 Conference was a unique opportunity to present my work to an international network of colleagues; the event was so inspiring that I am aiming to continue to do quality research that can find a place in the upcoming CAM2019.\"</p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">\"It was incredibly refreshing to go to a diverse and welcoming conference.&nbsp; It stood as a beautiful example for the future of how a conference could be.\"</p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">\"CAM2017 showed that science is a powerful force allowing men and women to transcend frontiers, walls, and prejudices of any kind.\"</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/26/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Amy&nbsp;Flatten</p>\n</div>\n<div
