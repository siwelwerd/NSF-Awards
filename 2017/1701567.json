 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is an interdisciplinary collaboration between mathematicians and computer scientists in an intensive focused research effort to solve a central challenge in cryptography, namely constructing a family of secure and efficient algebraic multilinear maps.  Multilinear maps have remarkable applications in cryptography, such as multiuser non-interactive key-exchange, general functional encryption, fully-homomorphic encryption, and indistinguishability obfuscation. The results of the project are expected to enable a new age of cryptographic systems and open new directions in the field.  The project will train graduate students and postdoctoral associates through involvement in deep modern mathematics research with applications in computer science.\r\n\r\nThe first candidate multilinear maps are inefficient in practice, and have been shown to be insecure for some of the desired applications. This project takes a very different approach from earlier ones. The starting point is the observation that there already exist many natural multilinear maps in arithmetic geometry, arising naturally from the cohomology of arithmetic varieties and motives, and from K-theory. They give a richer class of objects than elliptic curves over finite fields, whose groups of points are widely used in practice for cryptographic key exchange and public-key encryption. The challenge is to find such algebraic structures for which the multilinear maps can be efficiently computed, and for which the associated cryptographic problems (e.g., discrete logarithm problems) are expected to be hard.",

Beyond multilinear maps, we also explored various aspects of isogeny based cryptosystems.  One key question in the area is how to generate a random supersingular elliptic curve without knowledge of its endomorphism ring.  We explored a particular approach that led to some interesting discoveries about the structure of the isogeny graph of supersingular elliptic curves.  This joint work with Jonathan Love won the Selfridge Prize at the Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium (ANTS) where it was presented.  The project resulted in several other results in the area of mathematical cryptography, but the core question of constructing a cryptographic multilinear map remains open.  We made a valiant effort, and the results we generated a long the way made the project a success.  We continue to believe that this elusive algebraic object will eventually be found.
