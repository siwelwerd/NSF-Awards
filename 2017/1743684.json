(ORAU) requests National Science Foundation (NSF) support for selection and attendance of US graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to attend the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) in 2017. The Heidelberg Laureate Forum takes place annually in Heidelberg, Germany, and brings 200 young researchers in the computer and mathematical sciences together from all over the world with a group of typically 30 laureates of the Abel Prize, Fields Medal, Turing Award, and Nevanlinna Prize, and is patterned after the Lindau Meeting of Nobel Laureates in the physical sciences. The ORAU has formalized a partnership with the HLF to organize a U.S. delegation for participation in the meetings. This proposal requests support for a total of 9 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in computer science. \r\n\r\nThe ORAU proposes to support this program by promoting and advertising the opportunity; recruiting from and selecting a diverse pool of applicants; developing and maintaining a program Web site for recruiting, selecting, information and dissemination; coordinating travel and orientation activities for participants, and conducting a follow-up survey to document the program's impact.",
