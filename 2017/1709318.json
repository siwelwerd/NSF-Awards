 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract:\r\n\r\nMetals play essential roles in infrastructural and overall economic developments of our society, as reflected by the fact that the annual global market value of metals is close to a trillion US dollars. During the last five years,  a new class of nano materials called gradient nanostructured metals have emerged as a material class which exhibits an unusual combination of ultrahigh strength, good tensile ductility, enhanced strain hardening, superior fracture toughness and fatigue resistance. However, the current lack of understanding of the underlying mechanisms that control the properties of these materials severely limits our ability to tailor or optimize their properties for specific applications. On the other hand, recent advances in computational modeling and simulation capabilities are providing unprecedented opportunities to advance the knowledge frontier in our understanding of mechanical properties of materials at micro- and nano-scales. The proposed research will take advantage of the cutting-edge multiscale modeling and simulation methods to address the fundamental issues with regard to the mechanical properties and behavior of gradient nanostructured metals. \r\nThe project will train graduate and undergraduate students in state of the art computational techniques. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will address the following questions: What are the deformation mechanisms that control the mechanical properties of gradient nanostructured metals? How to design the gradient micro- and nanostructures to optimize the mechanical responses of gradient nanostructured metals? The problems under study will be tackled via a multiscale modeling approach that combines finite element method, strain gradient plasticity, cohesive modeling, crystal plasticity, dislocation dynamics and molecular dynamics simulations will be used to investigate the deformation and failure mechanisms of gradient nanostructured metals. The technical approach will be based on the experience and theoretical/simulation capabilities developed by the PI. The proposed work will clarify the controlling deformation mechanisms through ultra-large-scale and high-resolution atomistic and dislocation dynamics simulations, interpret the experimental data and phenomena through continuum strain gradient plasticity and cohesive modeling of fatigue and fracture behavior, and guide further research in structural optimization and processing. The ultra-large scale simulations in the proposed work will be performed on the National Institute for Computational Sciences, and the rest of the proposed computational work will be performed at the Center for Computing and Visualization at Brown University. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students in state of the art computational techniques.",

In this project, we have worked closely with experimental groups and adopted a multiscale modeling approach that combines continuum, mesoscale and atomic-scale modeling and simulations to investigate deformation, strength, fatigue and fracture behaviors of gradient nanostructured (GNS) metals. Specifically, we have 1). investigated the unique dislocation structures and activities in nanotwinned (NT) metals to reveal the origins of the temperature dependence, superior strength, fatigue resistance and extra work hardening of NT metals, and provide insights into tailoring the twin structures for the design of next-generation structural materials. For example, we have discovered a new type of correlated &lsquo;necklace&rsquo; dislocation in highly oriented nanotwinned metals, inducing history-independent cyclic response. We have also discovered the formation of bundles of concentrated dislocations in the grain interiors of gradient nanotwinned metals, which contributes to the extra strengthening and work hardening. 2). In the field of nanomechanics, we have used metallic nanowires (NWs) as the platform to systematically study the effects of twin boundaries (TBs) and NWs geometries on the dislocation activities and mechanical properties of metals. For instance, we have revealed that the transition of deformation modes between twinning and dislocation slip can be attributed to the change of surface energy as a function of the cross-sectional shape in single-crystalline NWs. 3). Extending our studies on twin structures, we have also investigated the role of other material microstructures including nanoscale precipitates, solutes, interface affected zone and nanofiller, in modifying the mechanical properties of metals to advance the fundamental understanding of the processing-structure-property relationships for the design of next-generation ultra-high strength and ductility alloys.
