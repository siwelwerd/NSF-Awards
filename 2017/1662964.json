 "awd_abstract_narration": "Thin steel plates are commonly used as structural elements in buildings, bridges, towers, aircrafts, etc.  Due to their slenderness, these plates are susceptible to buckling under shear loading, thus limiting their capacity.  The recent research shows that many existing models do not represent the true mechanics of ultimate shear buckling. This project will investigate and advance the knowledge of shear buckling response, thus leading to improved economy, durability, and safety of structures that use thin plates.  The focus of this study is on steel plates, but it lays the foundation for other materials such as aluminum and composites that can be considered in future work.  This project also addresses the grand challenges recently issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE): (a) significantly enhance the performance and value of infrastructure projects over their life cycles by 2025, and (b) foster the optimization of infrastructure investments for society.  The results will  increase cost efficiency  via decreased material usage; enhance robustness via increased ultimate shear strength; and reduce occurrence of buckling and increased resilience to unexpected loads (e.g. with fewer required repairs) via increased buckling load capacity. \r\n\r\nThe overall objective of this project is to comprehensively investigate the mechanics of shear buckling behavior in steel plates, thus leading to (a) new predictive models that capture the true mechanics, and (b) design modifications that increase economy, robustness, and life-cycle performance.  The research plan involves both nonlinear finite element studies and experimental tests.  A detailed examination of the stress patterns and load redistribution from the elastic buckling stage to the ultimate postbuckling capacity will be the primary focus.  Physical tests will explore new panel configurations, and potential material optimizations will be identified based on finite element mechanics studies.  Experiments will be conducted using facilities at Lehigh University to examine the shear buckling performance of steel plate girder specimens, both with and without bending moment. The data from these tests will be used to directly validate the computational modeling approaches.",

This collaborative research project between Princeton University (PU) and Lehigh University (LU) comprehensively investigated the mechanics of shear behavior in thin steel plates, thus leading to (a) discovering the true mechanics of shear failure, and (b) design modifications that increase economy, robustness, and life-cycle performance.&nbsp; The research plan involved both nonlinear finite element studies and experimental tests.&nbsp; Four full-scale shear experiments were performed on steel plate girders at Lehigh University with a depth of 69 inches, thus representing the deepest (largest) experiments on shear done to-date.&nbsp; Experimental tests validated the numerical models and confirmed the following conclusions of the study:</p>\n<p>(1) Numerical studies of thin plates under pure shear are best examined with panel extension models. These finite element models should include flanges, stiffeners, and panel extensions as the boundary conditions (with longitudinally axially free vertical edges at the ends of the panel) for best correlation with experimental results. The panel extensions extend the girder web and flange a distance half the depth beyond the stiffeners on each side of the web. Such a model produces the best agreement with the experimental literature and also best represents the membrane stresses at the plate edges for a continuous girder section.</p>\n<p>(2) Web out-of-flatness imperfections were measured in the field on twelve plate girders with depths ranging from 0.914 to 2.08 meters. It was found that the maximum web out-of-flatness magnitude in a panel varies with a mean value of <em>d/70</em>. This mean decreases to <em>d/835</em> if all data points collected from each panel are used for the statistical evaluation. The locations of the maximum out-of-flatness do not always correspond to the center of the web panel section, and the shape follows either single, double, or triple waves out-of-plane. The implications of the field imperfection study on the shear strength were examined via numerical analyses.&nbsp; The results indicate that the field-measured out-of-flatness imperfection shapes have larger shear capacity than eigenmode shapes (which approximately represent the deformed shape at shear failure).</p>\n<p>(3) The true shear capacity of a stiffened web panel is limited primarily by the web plate itself. Specifically, the interaction of tension-dominated membrane stress with second-order bending of the buckled shape due to compression effects lead to a<em> web mechanism formation</em>. At this point, the web plate yields through the full thickness across the tension field diagonal where compression-induced second-order bending stresses are high. Contributions to shear strength from the stiffener and flange plates at the boundaries of the panel are relatively minor and occur at very large displacements.&nbsp; The stiffener and flange anchorage load paths are not significantly engaged until <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">after</span> the web mechanism is fully developed. Though the maximum shear load might be higher than that associated with the web mechanism, the increase is not significant (within ~1%) and often occurs at significant additional deformation that can be considered a serviceability failure. Thus, the PIs conclude that <em>the web mechanism formation is the appropriate metric for estimating the web shear capacity.</em></p>\n<p>(4) This research examined a new strategy for increasing the shear capacity of thin steel plates by introducing low-frequency sinusoids (LFS) along the plate's longitudinal axis, with wavelengths on the order of a meter.&nbsp; Substantial increases in shear strength were achieved using LFS webs, improving maximum shear capacity up to 87% over flat webs. The parametric computational study indicated that LFS plates lead to increased shear strength with negligible increase in material. Other notable advantages to this LFS strategy include relatively simple fabrication and eliminating welded stiffeners thus reducing fatigue sensitivity. These advantages imply an economical advantage as well. It is noted, however, that LFS webs will reduce the plastic moment capacity of the section on the order of 25%. LFS designs are thus most efficient in locations with high shear and low moment.</p>\n<p>This project addressed the following grand challenges issued by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE): (a) significantly enhance the performance and value of infrastructure projects over their life cycles, and (b) foster the optimization of infrastructure investments for society.&nbsp; The results proposed cost and material efficiency via LFS enhanced robustness, as well as greater fundamental understanding of shear buckling mechanics and enable improvements in design strategies.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/02/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Spencer&nbsp;E&nbsp;Quiel</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1662964/1662964_10490021_1698785288677_Fig1primary--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1662964/1662964_10490021_1698785288677_Fig1primary--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Experiments and FEM Validation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1662964/1662964_10490021_1698785288677_Fig1primary--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Experiments and FEM Validation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Finite element models were validated with large-scale experimental testing of a plate girders with a 69-in. deep web.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">M.
