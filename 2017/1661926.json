 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports fundamental research on enhancement of material shearing mechanisms in machining processes, using an approach that also controls friction. The chip in metal cutting is treated as a by-product, typically as waste. However, this new approach attempts to use the chip by applying tension and thereby reduce and cancel friction forces in machining. By attenuating friction forces, this new turning process assisted by chip-pulling can enable material removal with much lower cutting effort and energy; provide greater stability margins, longer tool-life, and facilitate high-throughput energy efficient precision manufacturing. A potential mechanism of suppressing the chip-jam with tailored cutting tool geometries is  also likely with the new approach. Collaboration with a partner from US aerospace industry will help ensure the technology transfer. \r\n\r\nThe research focus is to investigate how tension applied on the cut chip during machining processes affects cutting mechanics and dynamics. Effective use of the cut chip requires robust control of its flow. Micro-textured tools will be designed to control and navigate the chip flow to realize application of tension. Analytical models will be developed to understand the link between micro-grooved tool geometry to the chip flow mechanics and chip flow controllability. The effect of applying tension on the cut chip will be investigated. Tension applied to the chip cancels the friction force on the rake face and reduces the cutting effort while improving cutting mechanics. Analytical models and experimental characterization will be performed to understand the effect of pulling the chip on resultant cutting forces, cutting energy, the dynamic relation amongst them, and the limitations. Based on this understanding, chip tension will be introduced as an innovative process control parameter to improve static and dynamic characteristics of the machining process. Machining of precision parts can be realized with lower form errors by minimizing overall cutting forces through chip tension and force control. Reduced machining cycle times and increased material removal rates can be achieved through greater chatter stability margins that can be attained by modulating the chip tension jointly with process parameters.",
