The primary purpose of this previously supported conference series, and in particular of the proposed conference, is to bring together researchers across subfields of Topology, and across generations, to share the latest developments in Topology and related fields. Conferences in this series have been a venue for announcement of numerous landmark results in Topology. The organizing committee will ensure the representation of graduate students, young researchers, women, and researchers from underrepresented groups. All sessions will host a mix of talks by established specialists on one hand and graduate students and early career mathematicians on the other. Talks will be centered on recent advances and techniques, and the future of the discipline. In keeping with tradition, conference proceedings will be published by the peer-reviewed journal Topology Proceedings. Additionally invited talks will be video recorded and shared online. This way, the latest developments in Topology will be broadly shared.\r\n\r\nThe conference will consist of six special sessions: Continuum Theory (dedicated to Sam B. Nadler), Dynamical Systems (dedicated to Jim Rogers), Set-Theoretic Topology, Geometric Group Theory, Geometric Topology, and Topology and Computer Science. There will also be a workshop on Topology and Computer Science geared primarily towards graduate students. The Mary Ellen Rudin Young Researcher Award winner will be formally announced at the conference, and the recipient will be a plenary speaker.
