 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract: The traditional paradigm for materials research focuses on behavior in or near equilibrium. Through two Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs), the Center for Dynamics and Control of Materials extends this paradigm to understand and control how materials behave over times ranging from femtoseconds to weeks, and over dimensions extending from macroscopic to atomic scales. IRG 1 addresses the development and understanding of new composite materials that combine inorganic and organic components. Interactions among these constituents and their responses to their external environment enable material properties to be tuned and reconfigured, leading to applications in rechargeable batteries and filtration membranes. IRG 2 explores new approaches for using light to control material properties. The realization of new phases and quantum states of matter via interaction with light is expected to enable new technologies for computing and communications, and to address long-standing fundamental scientific challenges in quantum control of materials. Through the concept of a Materials Community of Practice, these research activities are closely integrated with new initiatives in education, outreach, and the promotion of diversity. The Center engages elementary school teachers in materials research to improve teacher efficacy and student engagement with science at a formative age, and thereby increase the number and diversity of students interested in science, engineering, and related fields. Outreach to the public via hands-on demonstrations and collaborations between artists and materials researchers brings materials science and technology to new audiences who might not otherwise be engaged. And partnerships with industry and the entrepreneurial community provide participants with experiences and connections to prepare them for success in a broad range of careers.\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract: IRG 1, Reconfigurable Porous Nanoparticle Networks, addresses multifunctional, reconfigurable networks of nanoparticles, polymers, and organic molecules that respond to a range of external stimuli. Fundamental principles are elucidated for understanding and controlling the assembly and reconfiguration of nanoparticles connected by molecular linkers, with theoretical and experimental efforts combining to create unique optical, chemical, or biological materials functionality. IRG 2, Materials Driven by Light, addresses light-matter interactions that lead to material properties not accessible in equilibrium. Phases and ordered states accessed via light-induced perturbations to energy landscapes, topological material behavior enabled by optical excitation, and formation of exotic quantum phases are explored to provide new understanding of and control over optically responsive materials. Advances in research from these IRGs are expected to enable responsive, reconfigurable materials based on integration of nanoparticles and macromolecules for applications in electronics, energy storage, water filtration, photonics, and biology; fundamental advances in understanding and applications of material behavior accessible and controllable using temporally structured light; and new technologies for communications and information processing based on these advances.",
