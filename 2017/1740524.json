 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is in fabrication of improved structures for use in harsh environments. The core technology was originally developed for inexpensive heat shields for space vehicles.  It can now be used for complex heat exchangers or for hot-section components for aviation and power generation engines, or for radiation resistant liners in nuclear applications. In all these applications, the proposed technology can reduce the original equipment cost while improving performance and reliability, or can be used to reduce replacements cost of original metal-based components. When applied to aviation or power generation, the net benefit can in the form of lower emissions from the engines, and lower cost of flying or lower electricity cost due to both lower fuel cost and lower maintenance cost. As the underlying manufacturing technology has significant overlap with that for polymer composite structures such as boat hulls or wind turbines, manufacturing personnel employed in such traditional industries can be easily retrained for manufacturing of high-value added, hot-section components for capital goods such as gas turbine engines for aviation and power generation.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps Project focuses on potential applications of a relatively new type of high-temperature structural materials, known as Polymer Derived Ceramic Composite (PDCC). PDCC fabrication is inexpensive as it involves similar fabrication techniques as other polymer composite structures like wind turbine blades or boat hulls. However, ceramic fiber and special resin are to be used for PDCC. Currently available resin-fiber combinations offer maximum use temperatures between 1200C and 1700C, depending on the choice of ceramic fibers. This maximum use temperature is much higher than creep-onset temperatures of common high-temperature alloys.  The PDCC process is significantly less inexpensive compared to many monolithic ceramics or alternative ceramic matrix composite processes.  Also, use of appropriate molds during formation of the polymeric state can lead to relatively complex shapes. PDCC?s share the typical properties of other ceramics, such as corrosion resistance or radiation tolerance.",
