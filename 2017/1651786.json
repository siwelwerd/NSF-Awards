 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study seeks to investigate the relative roles of downdrafts and surface rotation in the \"seed\" formation of rotation in tornadoes.  This research will lead to explanations of the fundamental processes that lead to the formation of tornadoes in different situations.  Specifically, the role of surface friction will be quantified using several numerical simulations as well as different realizations of friction parameterizations.  In addition to the training of graduate students, this study will engage the public through radio segments discussing the research and severe weather in general.   \r\n\r\nTo investigate these problems, a vorticity decomposition technique will be applied to high-resolution full-physics simulations of thunderstorms as well as to idealized downdraft simulations.  The research will apply a vorticity decomposition technique along trajectories to idealized numerical simulations.  The mathematical treatment of the problem will introduce aspects of differential geometry into the severe storms community and offer a new perspective on the formal description of vortex dynamics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Tornadoes produce the strongest naturally occurring winds on Earth and claim dozens of lives each year in the USA. Although the warnings issued by the National Weather Service are of high quality in terms of lead time and successful in that most tornadoes that occur are warned for, there is still a high false alarm ratio (about 70 %). One approach to improving the warnings is to advance our understanding of the dynamics of tornado genesis and tornado maintenance.  This project addressed the mechanism by which tornadoes form and identified vorticity origins of mature tornadoes in computer simulations.  The main finding is that the mechanism leading to rotation at the surface changes as the tornado spins up.  At first, a downdraft is needed that produces initially horizontal spin at its edges.  This spin is reoriented toward an upright orientation as the air descends, providing seed rotation that can be amplified beneath the updraft of the thunderstorm.  Then, as vortex formation proceeds, and the central pressure in the vortex drops, a downdraft is no longer needed.  Instead, horizontal spin, produced e.g., due to surface drag near the ground, can be tipped into the vertical abruptly at the base of the intensifying vortex.\nWhile both of these processes have been identified previously by different researchers, the current project reconciled the seemingly conflicting results by clarifying that each process is active at a different phase of the vortex development, and highlighted the transition of the mechanism during vortex formation.\nThe results suggest that the well-known three-step process, which involves 1) rotation aloft, 2) development of rotation at the ground, and 3) concentration of that rotation via horizontal convergence, may need to be modified:The region of rotation at the ground needs to be reorganized, as the rotation is concentrated; at the same time the horizontal spin near the surface can be directly scooped up by the vortex.  The modified, 4-step model of tornadogenesis is shown in the attached figure.\nAdditional findings include identification of the vorticity origin of a mature tornado-like vortex using a so-called vorticity-decomposition technique. This analysis also highlights the importance of surface drag as source of rotation. In addition, the spin of the environment may also act as a source of rotation.\nThese results have been published in peer-reviewed journals.\nOne student was funded through this project, who earned his PhD during the project. A radio show (Wild West Texas Weather) was started in collaboration with the student radio station KTXT FM 88.1, in which short \"vignettes\" about severe weather are aired.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Johannes Dahl"
