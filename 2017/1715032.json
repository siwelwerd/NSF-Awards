 "awd_abstract_narration": "For about fifteen years, astrophysicists have known that galaxies generally house supermassive black holes (BHs) at their centers.  Although usually detected only through their gravity, there is another method to reveal otherwise unobservable BHs: stellar tidal disruptions, which are the destruction of a star that happens to pass extremely close to such a BH.  The exciting and innovative techniques already developed to tackle this situation will be extended and improved and will have significant impact across many fields that require numerical calculations.\r\n\r\nOver roughly the last decade, dozens of these Tidal Disruption Events have now been discovered from the luminous flare each one produces.  This characteristic flare gradually decays over a span of weeks to months.  Unfortunately, the old theory has trouble explaining the new data, and its assumptions must be questioned.  Recent work has opened new ways of thinking about these events, but progress has been hampered by the extreme computational demands of conventional numerical simulation methods.  The present team has built a new simulation infrastructure that overcomes these obstacles, and permits high-quality calculations incorporating full general relativity and three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics.  This tool enables three new avenues of research: (1) understanding the nature of both the accretion flow onto the black hole and the ejection of unbound debris after the star is torn apart; (2) exploring how black hole spin may shape the accretion flow and possibly support relativistic jets; and (3) providing quantitative predictions of the light curves and spectra produced.\r\n\r\nSocietal benefits come from training a young scientist in the broadly applicable techniques of large-scale numerical simulation, expanding modern instructional methods in undergraduate physics education, and developing the innovative computing methodology for future public release.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn a typical galaxy, once every hundred thousand years or so a star wanders close enough to the supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center that it is torn apart by the black hole's gravitational tidal force.  The shredded remains of the star are then strewn around the neighborhood of the black hole; when different bits encounter each other, strong shock waves raise the gas's temperature until the debris glows brightly.   Over a period of a few months or years, the flare gradually dies away.\n\n\nSupported by this grant, we set out to clarify the physics governing how these events happen: where the debris goes, how bright the flare is, how long it lasts, etc.  In particular, we sought to determine quantitatively how the properties of the flare depend on the mass of the star and the mass of the black hole.  To accomplish these goals, we needed to improve substantially upon previous practices.  Our calculations used realistic internal stellar structures, rather than simple analytic models.  We found a way to calculate the self-gravity of the star even when it was so close to a black hole that the star's self-gravity was altered by general relativistic effects induced by the black hole. With these devices, we were able to predict reliably the size and shape of the orbits around the black hole on which the debris is placed immediately after the star is dismembered and relate these properties to the stellar mass and the black hole mass.  We found, for example, that the criterion for how close a star must venture in order to be completely dismantled was nearly independent of the star's mass, despite the great range of stellar masses and sizes.  Assembling these results, we found a way to infer the stellar mass and the black hole mass in a particular event through two measurements of the flare, its peak brightness and the temperature of the surface emitting its light.\n\n\nThese studies, however, needed to be extended in order to understand the flare's post-peak fade-out.  Immediately after the star's demise, its remnants remaining bound to the black hole find themselves on highly elliptical orbits around the black hole, all aligned in the same plane.    Astrophysicists have learned a great deal about the dynamics of gas distributed over a set of nested circular orbits in a common plane, but when we began this project, no one knew how these mechanisms would carry over to nested elliptical orbits.  We have taken several major steps to generalize this theory, which involves the rapid growth of turbulence when the orbiting gas is threaded by magnetic fields.  We first showed that small fluctuations in both the velocity of the gas and the magnetic field would grow rapidly, more or less as rapidly as in the case of circular orbits.  We then performed a series of large numerical simulations to explore how those small fluctuations matured into turbulent motions in which the magnetic field became so strong that its effective tension could remove angular momentum from gas closer to the black hole and carry it outward through the disk to more distant gas.   As a result, the orbits of the inner matter both shrink and stretch toward the black hole, and dissipation of the turbulent motions heats the gas.   We also pointed out that because different locations on an ellipse have different distances from its focus (here, the black hole), the gravity that confines matter to a common plane oscillates in strength as a fluid element traverses such an orbit.  Those up-and-down oscillations can lead to motions so strong that the gas suffers additional internal shocks.\n\n\nOur last project in this program is the first-ever comprehensive calculation of how all these pieces fit together over the course of a single event.  This extremely large numerical simulation is at present half-finished.\n\n\nIn addition to our research, we also accomplished a number of things beneficial to broader society.  We trained a postdoc in the techniques of massively parallel computing, an extremely broadly applicable skill.   We developed computational tools useful to our work in astrophysical fluid dynamics, but potentially also of value to studies of fluids in a far wider range of contexts including engineering and medicine.   We helped modernize instruction in physics education at Johns Hopkins University for both engineers and physics majors.  Lastly, we also developed several informational videos for the general public using animated data from our numerical simulations.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julian H Krolik"
