 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arctic is currently warming twice as fast as the global average and this is expected to result in a northward shift in plant ranges. An increase in woody vegetation would reduce surface reflection of light and heat (albedo), and increase atmospheric water vapor, a positive feedback that is currently poorly included in climate models. In the Eastern Canadian Arctic (ECA) stratified sediment in lakes spanning the current interglacial and the warmer previous interglacial, preserve sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) and organic molecules that can be used for reconstruction of past ecosystems and their dependence on temperature and hydroclimate. By combining data from these sediments with modern vegetation studies and climate monitoring, an empirically based ecosystem-climate model will be developed to predict the likely evolution of Arctic ecosystems by 2100 under a range of climate trajectory scenarios. \r\n\r\nThis will be the first integration of sedaDNA-based vegetation records with biomarker-based climate records in lake sediment containing records of a much warmer Arctic. There are few ecosystem studies for the thin soils on crystalline terrain of the ECA. Floristic studies and vegetation-environment analyses around targeted lakes across a strong climate gradient establish the current relation between plant assemblages and summer temperature and define the relation between sedaDNA and nearby plant communities. Temperature loggers in soils, air, and lake- water, and analyzes of DNA and biomarkers in modern soils and lake surface sediment will enhance understanding of promising new molecular proxies and facilitate the development of regional training sets. The project brings together experts and state-of- the-art facilities in Arctic plant ecology, Paleoclimate, sedaDNA, and Organic Geochemistry to derive transformative new insight into the complex interplay between climate and biogeography at high latitudes, and will lead to a robust perspective on the potential response of ecosystems to anticipated future warming across the ECA. \r\n\r\nThe project team is committed to sharing research results with the broader public through outreach among local communities in the Canadian Arctic as well as at home. The team will work closely with Inuit guides and assistants during fieldwork, much of which is near traditional hunting and fishing lands, and will share results with nearby Inuit communities through displays at Parks Canada offices. A strong partnership with Nunavut Research Institute and its affiliated Arctic College has been developed over several decades, and this partnership will be expanded by establishing an interactive lake-monitoring program in collaboration with the Environment Technology Program students and staff of Arctic College. In Boulder, Colorado, a scholarship-supported summer field and lab course for underrepresented high school students will be developed based on paleoecological and paleoclimatic perspectives on climate change. This project will help launch two early-career scientists, one female and one Latino, as well as a career scientist and two postdocs, two of whom are female, and two new graduate students. The laboratory component will support several graduate and undergraduate assistants, who will gain valuable research experience and have the opportunity to complete theses based on their research activities.",

Calibrate leaf waxes, the geological tool we use to reconstruct moisture balance. Leaf waxes are hydrocarbon compounds produced by both terrestrial and aquatic plants and then abraded off the leaves and deposited and preserved in lake sediments. We compared leaf waxes from modern plants collected during vegetation surveys by collaborators (University of Alaska Fairbanks) to leaf waxes extracted from soil and lake surface sediments. 2. Reconstruct the time-dependent evolution of moisture balance for the Holocene and the Last Interglacial across a latitudinal transect, with emphasis on constraining the timing and magnitude of the water cycle response to peak Holocene and Last Interglacial warmth along a transect of lakes from southern to northern Baffin Island.</p>\r\n<p>We learned about the source of leaf waxes to Arctic lakes and the seasonality that leaf waxes reflect. Using modern lake water isotope measurements from throughout the eastern Canadian Arctic, we found that most lakes in this region are not strongly impacted by evaporation but instead reflect precipitation isotope values: lakes in the north reflect summer precipitation isotope values, whereas in the south, they reflect mean annual precipitation isotope values. The hydrogens in leaf waxes produced by aquatic plants growing in these lakes will therefore reflect different seasonality depending on lake location.</p>\r\n<p>We used leaf wax abundance and stable isotope measurements from hundreds of modern plants and modern and ancient soils and lake sediments, as well as mixing modeling to determine which plants contribute waxes to lake sediments on Baffin Island. We found that submerged aquatic plants contribute most mid-chain leaf waxes (i.e. hydrocarbons with 20 to 23 carbons) to lake sediments. These results are different from findings from lake catchments on Greenland, but similar to results from some other Arctic and temperate sites. These conflicting results suggest that leaf wax contributions to lake sediments can vary from one site to the next, and particular attention should be paid to contributions of different chain lengths. We found that a Bayesian mixing model approach is useful to account for uncertainty in these systems.</p>\r\n<p>We also examined wax distributions and stable isotope values in modern plants along the latitudinal transect from south to north Baffin Island. We found that leaf wax distributions are similar within a given plant species, regardless the climate, but that catchment-average wax distributions vary along the transect due to differences in plant community between catchments. Moreover, we examined carbon cycling through the past 12,000 years, the current warm period, at Lake CF8, on northeastern Baffin Island. Using bulk sediment radiocarbon dating, we find that there was significant storage of sediments from a previous warm period about 125,000 years ago. These sediments washed into the lake basin at the beginning of the current warm period. We also find that both terrestrial and aquatic carbon contributed significant amounts of material to the lake sediments, with the terrestrial contribution varying with climate.</p>\r\n<p>For our second goal, we generated leaf wax isotope records from three lakes. Three of these records span the most recent warm period (the past 12,000 years), while two additionally contain samples from the previous warm period around 125,000 years ago. These results indicate that the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which covered Baffin Island and nearby Arctic Canada during the intervening ice age, caused dynamical changes in atmospheric circulation, in addition to covering up key regions that today supply moisture to Baffin Island. There are key differences between the current and previous warm periods, likely related to ice sheet extent.</p>\r\n<p>This project involved multiple early career researchers, including an assistant professor, three graduate students, and five undergraduate students. All students who graduated from this project presented results at disciplinary meetings and continued in careers in the earth sciences, including one who founded the University at Buffalo Science and Health Policy club and who is now working in science policy. The project allowed two graduate students to participate in remote field experiences in Arctic Canada, where they shared research questions and results with Arctic communities. Finally, results from this project are being used in an upper-level Stable Isotopes in Earth Sciences course taught at UB.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/11/2025<br>\nModified by: Elizabeth&nbsp;K&nbsp;Thomas</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1737716/1737716_10503257_1744391279858_IMG_2561--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1737716/1737716_10503257_1744391279858_IMG_2561--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Collecting weather data on Baffin Island\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1737716/1737716_10503257_1744391279858_IMG_2561--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Collecting weather data on Baffin Island\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Devon Gorbey (University at Buffalo PhD 2023) downloading data from a weather station on northeastern Baffin Island.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Elizabeth K Thomas</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Elizabeth&nbsp;K&nbsp;Thomas\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Collecting weather data on Baffin Island</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1737716/1737716_10503257_1744391222401_IMG_2558--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1737716/1737716_10503257_1744391222401_IMG_2558--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Lake sediment coring on Baffin Island\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1737716/1737716_10503257_1744391222401_IMG_2558--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Lake sediment coring on Baffin Island\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Giff Miller (University of Colorado Boulder), Greg deWet (CU Boulder postdoc), Devon Gorbey (University at Buffalo PhD 2023) and Jason Briner (UB) collect lake sediment cores on northeastern Baffin Island.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Elizabeth K Thomas</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Elizabeth&nbsp;K&nbsp;Thomas\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Lake sediment coring on Baffin Island</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1737716/1737716_10503257_1744391167056_IMG_2475--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1737716/1737716_10503257_1744391167056_IMG_2475--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Lake sediment coring on Baffin Island\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2025/1737716/1737716_10503257_1744391167056_IMG_2475--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Lake sediment coring on Baffin Island\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Devon Gorbey (University at Buffalo PhD 2023) and Greg deWet (CU Boulder postdoc) pack up cores collected from lakes on northeastern Baffin Island.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Elizabeth K Thomas</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Elizabeth&nbsp;K&nbsp;Thomas\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Lake sediment coring on Baffin Island</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
