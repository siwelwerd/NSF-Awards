 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to advance our understanding of a fundamental mathematical object called a \"translation surface.\"  From an elementary perspective, translation surfaces can be viewed as a polygon with a recipe for gluing its edges.  For example, gluing opposite sides of a square produces a torus, which is the mathematical name for the shape of a doughnut.  Most spectacularly, these polygons quickly lead to deep mathematics at the frontiers of research and they intersect a wide range of fields including algebra, geometry, and dynamical systems.  Furthermore, translation surfaces have started to appear in mathematical physics with connections to quantum mechanics.  From an educational standpoint, polygons arise in high school geometry and the PI has successfully explained to high school students how to find periodic trajectories of a ball on a rectangular table, using standard reflecting rules, using translation surfaces.  The elementary nature of polygons allows undergraduates to meaningfully experiment with them using software, such as Sage, which is open source software that is freely available on the internet.  The PI has already developed projects for undergraduates concerning translation surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are threefold.  First, the PI will study the geometry of orbit closures of translation surfaces through classification problems.  Secondly, the PI will apply his knowledge of the geometry of orbit closures to resolve questions concerning dynamics in moduli space and on translation surfaces.  He will approach problems concerning the anomalous behavior of Lyapunov exponents of the Kontsevich-Zorich cocycle through a conjecture he proposes.  Finally, he will study the structure of quadratic differentials with higher order poles on finite genus Riemann surfaces, which has applications to mathematical physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe funding resulted in the production of five research papers, 13 invited lectures, and mentoring opportunities for undergraduates and high school students from underrepresented groups in the STEM fields.   The PI investigated the Platonic solids and proved a new theorem about the dodecahedron with Jayadev Athreya ? there exists a straight trajectory on the dodecahedron that starts and ends at the same vertex without passing through any other vertex.  This result was extended in joint work with Pat Hooper, where it was proven that there are infinitely many such trajectories that can be categorized into one of 31 different classes or types.  In order to solve these problems, the joint work introduced new concepts and computational abilities.  This result was reported in mainstream media outlets such as Quanta, Wired, and Vice News.\n\nThe technical findings of the other research projects included classifying surfaces that are glued from polygons, i.e., translation surfaces, with important dynamical properties.  One classification problem resolved a conjecture of Maryam Mirzakhani for translation surfaces with three holes.  A second classification problem resolved a conjecture of several mathematicians by proving that there are no genus five surfaces with very restricted dynamics.  In order to resolve this second problem, the PI and his collaborator Chaya Norton introduced a new technique to the field of translation surfaces that holds promise for resolving many other classification problems.\n\nFinally, the PI mentored undergraduate students from his home institution on research projects related to the Archimedean solids inspired by his work on the Platonic solids.  He also mentored high school students from the STAR Early College School in Brooklyn, NY where the students are from predominantly underrepresented backgrounds in STEM.  He presented his work on the Platonic solids to them as well as potential research projects, which are accessible to students without an undergraduate mathematics background.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/19/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Aulicino"
