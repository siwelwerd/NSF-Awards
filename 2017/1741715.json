 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Asian Technology Information Program (ATIP) proposes to hold a Workshop at SC'17  in Denver, CO, that will provide a balanced picture of key HPC R&D in Japan, China, India, and other Asian countries. It is not easy way for US experts to fully understand what is occurring in Asian countries. This is specifically true for younger US researchers who are not familiar with where to access the best research in Asian countries. Broader impacts will include potential US collaborative efforts in HPC research. More importantly, it enables US researchers to keep abreast of developments in Asia and to incorporate the best ideas in their research in the US. It will also enable funding agencies in the US to keep abreast of the priorities of funding agencies in HPC. \r\nThe Workshop will include presentations, posters, and discussions by Asian researchers from universities, government institutes, and industry in sessions addressing systems, centers, and government plans, progress in components, system software, and applications, and human resource and eco-system development. This balanced program will enable the US research community to gain a more holistic understanding of the current situation and better evaluate potential opportunities for collaboration. As part of this proposal, ATIP will support at least eight young US researchers identified as having a high potential for research interests that overlap with their Asian counterparts and who would normally be unable to attend SC. Members of the international research community have agreed to support attendance by similar students from Asian countries who are anxious to share their ideas and engage in collaborative work. The key aspect of the proposed Workshop will be the unique opportunity for members of the US and international HPC research community to interact and have direct discussions with the top Asian scientists and leading graduate students.",
