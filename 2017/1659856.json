 "awd_abstract_narration": "This new three-year Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Program, Interdisciplinary Research Experiences in Metrology & Non-Destructive Inspection, at Texas A&M University (TAMU) will enhance the knowledge and skill-level of a diverse cohort of undergraduate students  with limited access to research opportunities through empowering, hands-on and interdisciplinary research experiences in both traditional/advanced metrology and non-destructive inspection (NDI) technologies. Metrology, the science of measurement, and (non-destructive) inspection transcends scales, materials, and disciplines; yet, rarely are its salient aspects emphasized. This site is a first-of-its-kind direct response to a specific concern raised by regional industry partners and technical workforce recruiters about the lack of pragmatic metrology/NDI-related knowledge and skills in their incoming regional workforce. The impact of this site will be to create empowered future researchers and a workforce well-rooted in metrology/NDI, and motivate them to pursue advanced degrees; they will become the future pioneers in related STEM fields, and will help foster our nation's competitive advantages and thirst for innovative solutions.\r\n\r\nEach summer, 10 students will be hosted at TAMU, where they will be immersed in hands-on research experiences comprised of a state-of-the-art research project, technical sessions/seminars, lab practice, field tours, and professional-development workshops. This experience will also serve the TAMU upper-level undergraduates and graduate students with invaluable team and personnel management experience. This site will advance scientific knowledge through inter-disciplinary research projects, and help further the field especially in regard to the energy and manufacturing sectors. Five vertically-integrated teams, each comprising two REU students, one senior undergraduate and one graduate student (from TAMU) and a faculty mentor, will work in concert on select research projects over 10 summer-weeks.  This on-site experience will be supplemented with follow-ups for continued interaction, growth, and guidance for pursuing advanced study. Student deliverables include public dissemination of research results, and a follow-up plan tailored to each student's career interests. The impact of this site will be to excite, empower, and educate students, and to enable/inspire them to pursue advanced study and STEM careers.",

Each year, 10 undergraduate students were hosted at Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) and grouped into 5 vertically integrated project (VIP) teams, each comprising of 2 REU students, undergraduate/graduate students (from TAMU) and a faculty mentor, who worked in concert on select research experiences over 10 summer-weeks. During this period, they were immersed in hands-on research comprising of a transformative research project, capsulated technical sessions and complementary lab practice, field tours, research seminars, and professional development workshops; this on-site experience was supplemented with periodic follow-up for continued growth and guidance for pursuing advanced study/careers. Student deliverables included public disseminations of research results.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Over the project duration, 33 undergraduate students whose home institutions span the breadth of the nation (as far as Puerto Rico) were recruited into impactful research experiences at TAMU. Considering the recruited cohorts, the percentage of under-represented groups (URG), which is defined to include both URM (such as black/Hispanic) and women, were in the 30-90% range, with an overall average of 48%. Further, participants from community/technical/liberal-arts colleges varied from 1-3 recruits each year. Altogether, the total numbers (for all years) met the %URG targets.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Considering site performance, an external evaluator developed pre- and post-program surveys to assess whether (i) the site met its recruitment goals, (ii) monitor student gains from the program, and (iii) how the participants perceived the program administration. Participant progression towards graduate school after leaving the REU was tracked by the PI using both LinkedIn and email and then reported to the evaluator. For item-(i), total target numbers were met in terms of recruiting URM/women/limited-STEM-research institutions (community/technical or liberal-arts colleges). For item-(ii), the evaluator particularly noted that the REU program helped students (positively) decide on their future career plans; either to confirm or to advance. A notable gain at the conclusion of each of the summers was that there was no student who was undecided about their future (STEM) careers. Several participants highlighted this impact of the program on their career plans through an open-ended essay; select quotes include: ?This research program has made me want to pursue graduate school more than when I came into it.? ?The REU has helped solidify which career path I want to take.? ??given me confidence in grad school?? ?It has given me insight into research that I didn't have before.? The last two quotes show that the REU program provided both knowledge about research and increased the student?s self-efficacy related to graduate school. The majority of students also indicated a high-level of confidence in doing standard and new technical tasks related to the project. The team-framework was viewed by students as beneficial to both their learning and the research progression. The mixture of different (vertical) researcher levels was perceived to have a positive impact on the research performance, as well as the multi-disciplinarity of the team. For item-(iii), all participants rated aspects of the program administration to very satisfactory at 5.33?0.9 (overall average), based on a Likert scale (where, 6 = very satisfied). Altogether, the evaluator noted that the REU site was highly beneficial to the participants and their future.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">As of the end date of project, ~75% of the REU participants have graduated with their undergraduate degrees, while the rest are still pursuing their coursework. Among the graduates, the majority (~90%+) are either employed in a STEM career or enrolled in a graduate program (M.S./ Ph.D.). Many of the REU students have also successfully published their research results in peer-reviewed conferences and journals.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Altogether, this site helped advance scientific knowledge in metrology/inspection through interdisciplinary research projects and helped to further technologies especially in regard to the manufacturing/energy industry sectors.
