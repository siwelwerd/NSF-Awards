 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project addresses the lack of materials available for advanced 3D printing. 3D printing is and will likely be used to produce products that encompass every aspect of day-to-day life. Current technology is primarily focused on the aerospace and medical fields. New metallic materials and more efficient processing methods are needed to transition to other more ubiquitous markets. This project is aimed at broadening the materials selection through a new production technique that complements existing technologies. The growth of the 3D printing industry will bring very competitive manufacturing jobs back to The United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the feasibility of an innovative reactive additive manufacturing (RAM) process to create a range of materials including nickel metal matrix composites, tungsten carbide composites, and nickel titanium intermetallic compounds. Each material system will be designed, fabricated, and characterized for a range of properties including microstructure, product phases, density, porosity, and hardness. For each of the three materials systems, the iterative development process will include modification of composition and process parameters to determine their effect on the material microstructure and properties and determine the feasibility of the RAM process to produce each material type commercially. The expected outcome of this activity is that the RAM process will be proven feasible for one or more of the investigated materials systems. The results of this work will be developed further and will subsequently lead to commercialization and sales of the novel materials mixtures and RAM process parameters for use in commercial powder bed fusion additive manufacturing systems already in use.",

As AM technology continues to improve, this has opened the door for new industries and applications to take advantage of the design freedom that AM provides. One of the remaining limitations for industry adoption of AM is the limited number of materials currently developed and available for AM in industrial settings. Elementum 3D is contributing to the next evolution and expansion of the AM industry with freedom of materials selection.</p>\n<p>In the Phase I project titled &ldquo;Reactive Additive Manufacturing,&rdquo; Elementum 3D demonstrated use of an innovative Reactive Additive Manufacturing (RAM) process to 3D print previously unavailable high-performance materials. Elementum 3D&rsquo;s RAM process utilizes novel materials formulations which undergo chemical reactions during the additive manufacturing process to form advanced product materials. In the Phase I project, Elementum 3D demonstrated use of RAM to print fully dense nickel metal matrix composites (MMCs) including superalloy MMCs as well as tungsten carbide composites with properties that are appealing to a broad range of industries including energy, aerospace, and tooling. The RAM produced metal matrix composite materials combine advanced ceramic reinforcements with metal alloys to obtain exceptional performance. Additional benefits of RAM such as faster printing speeds were also demonstrated in Phase I; nickel titanium (Nitinol) parts printed with RAM were demonstrated to print more than twice as fast as any other metal material available for laser powder bed fusion additive manufacturing. Faster printing speeds translate to greater throughput and reduced part costs.</p>\n<p>Following an extensive market analysis of the three material systems evaluated in its Phase I work, Elementum 3D determined that development of nickel superalloy MMCs will have the broadest and most immediate impact for the US market and US society. Some nickel alloys including Inconel 625, Inconel 718, and Hastelloy X are printable by laser AM, but these alloys do not have sufficient performance for high-temperature components for gas turbines such as for jet engines and power generation. As a result, AM production of high-temperature turbine blades and stators has not yet been realized. Additive manufacturing&rsquo;s design freedom to maximize efficiency of internal cooling channels coupled with improved high-temperature materials for AM enables manufacture of more efficient gas turbines. The societal benefits of this project therefore include improved turbine fuel efficiencies for the US energy and aerospace sectors, increased part life and safety, reduced greenhouse gas and pollution emissions, and lower energy and travel costs for consumers.</p>\n<p>Figure 1 shows a Phase I prototype of an additively manufactured Ni MMC turbine blade with internal cooling channels that offers the potential for improved turbine efficiencies. Elementum 3D will focus future work on development of RAM based nickel superalloy MMC&rsquo;s for additive manufacturing of advanced high-temperature turbine components.</p>\n<p>Phase I research also demonstrated the ability of the RAM process to improve the printability and microstructure of existing nickel alloys for additive manufacturing.&nbsp; Figure 2 shows SEM images of an industry standard Inconel 625 alloy printed with default process settings next to Elementum 3D&rsquo;s RAM produced Inconel 625 MMC material.&nbsp; Elementum 3D&rsquo;s MMC material has significantly reduced porosity and is expected to offer improved strength and high temperature performance.&nbsp; In addition to introducing advanced new high temperature materials for AM, Elementum 3D&rsquo;s continued work in this area will also support improvement of the existing materials available for AM.</p>\n<p>Metal matrix composites (MMCs) including nickel alloy MMCs evaluated in this project have the potential to offer improved stiffness, strength, hardness, thermal and electrical conductivity, thermal stability, dampening capacity, high cycle fatigue resistance, wear resistance, and elevated temperature properties for high value markets that cannot be addressed by existing materials and processing technology. The materials developed by Elementum 3D will be made available to US-based OEMs and contract manufacturers supporting US-based production of parts and new high-tech manufacturing career paths in the US.
