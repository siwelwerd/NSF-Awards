 "awd_abstract_narration": "The health of most living organisms depends critically on the transport of bio-fluids within and between the organs. In particular, any disruption or deficiency in bio-fluid transport can result in various diseases in the human body. Therefore, the proper understanding of these bio-transport phenomena has a crucial role in the advancement of science as well as bio-engineering. Investigation of the flow behavior (such as viscosity variations) in biological organs requires the availability of a high-end rheometer that can give accurate measurements in order to characterize the flow. This is an award to purchase a rheometer (Anton-Paar MCR 302) for this purpose.  \r\n\r\nBy its fundamental contribution to the understanding of the rheological properties of biological flows, the research activities associated with this awarded Rheometer open opportunities for advances in medical treatments and development of biomedical devices. In addition to the PI's research activities, The University of Texas at Dallas has multiple departments that conduct research on complex fluids and materials that will benefit from the acquisition of this rheometer, including mechanical and biomedical engineering, material science and engineering, chemistry, and physics. Also, the rheometer will be used in more advanced research in collaboration with the medical community. The instrumentation will enhance both graduate and undergraduate education and will expand the research opportunities for students. The rheometer and associated research will be incorporated into existing research opportunities by undergraduates (via UT summer research program) and K-12 outreach activities (via collaboration with High-Technology Education Coalition of Collin County). Special emphasis will be given to the inclusion of female students, minorities, and individuals with disabilities.",
