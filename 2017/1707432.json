Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics.  This award supports scientists at the University of California Santa Cruz in carrying out gamma-ray astrophysics research using an operating observatory and participating in the planning and development of the next generation gamma-ray observatory.  The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is designed to perform high-sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  The University of California Santa Cruz group will work on collection, analysis and interpretation of scientific data from highly-energetic extragalactic sources.  The group will also play a leadership role in the development of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), an international gamma-ray observatory currently in planning stages.  The group plans to develop a citizen science program to engage the public in exploring and analyzing the data from VERITAS.  They will also continue to engage in a broad range of efforts in education and public outreach.\r\n\r\nThe University of California Santa Cruz group will use VERITAS to explore the extreme behavior of two powerful classes of gamma-ray sources, active galactic nuclei (AGN) and gamma-ray bursts (GRB).

These data will also be used to study gamma-ray absorption by collisions with the extragalactic background light to test the cosmological model predictions for star formation and galaxy evolution. Using VERITAS data, the group will study GRB mechanisms and the role they play in high energy astrophysical phenomena.  The group will continue efforts to develop the next-generation Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and will serve in leadership roles within the collaboration.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nVery high-energy gamma rays from cosmic sources can be used to study some of the most extreme objects in the universe, such as active galaxies with massive black holes in the center and gamma-ray bursts from the explosive collapse of massive stars or from the coalescence of two neutron stars, also making gravitational waves.  The research supported by this award has yielded new insights about these topics.   Among the broader impacts of the research are the training of a number of developing scientists from diverse backgrounds.\n\nGamma rays with energy greater than 100 GeV, roughly a hundred billion times as energetic as optical light and ten million times as energetic as X-rays, are classified as very high energy (VHE).  When they strike the Earth's atmosphere, the energy is converted into a cascade of lower energy particles which in turn produce a brief, faint flash of light.  The VERITAS system of four telescopes is designed to collect and focus this light onto specialized cameras capable of recording images 500 million times a second under night sky.  The images recorded by the cameras are used to determine the energy and direction of incoming gamma rays, as well as to distinguish gamma rays from other types of cosmic rays, primarily protons.  The VERITAS telescopes were the primary tool used in this research to study VHE gamma rays from celestial objects.   A few of the key results are summarized in the following.\n\nGamma-ray emission from the active galaxy TXS 0506+056 was detected with VERITAS following the detection of a high-energy neutrino from the same direction with IceCube.  Gamma-ray emission was also detected with other instruments.  Together, the data strongly suggest this active galaxy to be a neutrino source as well as a gamma-ray source, making it the first identified source of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, a significant step for multi-messenger astrophysics, which is the use of types of particles other than light and its electromagnetic counterparts at different wavelengths to study astrophysical sources.\n\nGamma rays from the active galaxy Ton 599 were also detected with VERITAS. At a redshift of 0.725, it is the fifth most distant VHE gamma-ray source.  The data can be explained well with a model where the gamma rays originate a few light-years from the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy and are produced by VHE electrons and positrons moving highly relativistically in jets.  A model associating variable gamma-ray emission to processes in the accretion disk around the black hole works well to describe the distribution of fluxes.\n\nA study of X-ray flux variations from the active galaxy Mrk 421 with data from the Swift satellite found evidence of a recurring pattern after large flares. The pattern matches what would be expected if flares are the results of an intense region (a \"perturbation\") in the jet from the central black hole passing through bright regions (\"knots\") seen in radio with very-long-baseline interferometry. The result can be understood if the radio knots are standing shock waves in the jet, and particles are being accelerated in the shocks as the perturbation passes through.\n\nA study of the active galaxy 3C 66A found that VHE gamma-ray emission from this source can largely be described in the framework of one of the simplest models, contrary to prevailing wisdom that active galaxies of 3C 66A's type require a more complicated model.   A  Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach was used to search the model parameter space more thoroughly than is typically done, revealing parameter choices that can adequately describe the data. \n\nThe Schwarzschild-Couder gamma-ray telescope design introduces a secondary mirror to correct optical aberrations and demagnify the image.  The latter feature also allows compact, solid-state silicon photomultipliers to replace the traditional vacuum photomultiplier tubes as the sensitive elements in the camera, reducing cost and complexity of operation.   A prototype telescope of this design was commissioned and used to detect VHE gamma rays from the Crab Nebula.\n\nThis project provided an opportunity for many developing scientists to get involved in research for the first time or to expand their skills.  Thirteen high school students completed summer research projects with the group as part of the Science Internship Program at UCSC.  Seven undergraduates participated in the research, two of whom continued to graduate study in physics or astronomy; two of whom are now working in the private sector; and several of whom are still completing their degrees.  Two graduate students participated in this research, one completing her thesis research and the other working on research pre-dissertation.  Finally, one postdoctoral scholar made substantial contributions to the research.  In the course of their work on the project, many of the participants at all levels were involved in activities to bring the excitement and value of scientific inquiry to the general public and to younger students in particular.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David A Williams"
