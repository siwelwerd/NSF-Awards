 "awd_abstract_narration": "Magnetic shape-memory alloys are metal alloys that can change shape quickly in the presence of a magnetic field. These materials can potentially provide a more robust replacement for complex, high-precision actuation devices, which can be prone to frequent failure. At present, the application of functional magnetic shape-memory alloys is limited by their high cost and difficulty forming into complex shapes. Additive manufacturing, a method of producing parts with very complex shapes in a layer-by-layer fashion, may provide a solution to this problem. This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports fundamental research to understand the effects of additive manufacturing processing on the properties and performance of magnetic shape-memory alloys. This knowledge will enable the production of magnetic shape-memory alloys with complex shapes that can ultimately be used in high precision, large stroke actuators, and will also facilitate manufacturing other magnetic materials with enhanced properties. The collaboration between a university research team and a global US-based company will support fast transition from basic research to application, and will enhance student training. These exciting materials and processes will be used in outreach activities to increase interest and awareness of K-12 students, their teachers and parents in STEM.\r\n\r\nIt is hypothesized that magnetic-field-enhanced binder jet additive manufacturing will produce complex-shaped, polycrystalline magnetic shape-memory alloys with aligned microstructures and functional properties that are better than currently casted polycrystalline magnetic shape memory alloys. The basic research in this award will focus on defining how magnetically enhanced binder jet printing affects the microstructure and properties of functional magnetic shape memory alloys over several length scales. In order to test the hypothesis, the research team will (A) investigate the fundamental relationships among impurities, composition, functionality, and sintering and printing parameters, (B) quantify the effects of magnetic alignment parameters on anisotropy and functionality in the as-printed and sintered state, and (C) identify major sources of differences between printed and single crystal magnetic shape memory functional actuator components through performance testing on prototype actuators.",

Two of these materials classes are metallic ferromagnetic shape memory alloys and magnetocaloric materials which change their shape or temperature, respectively, due to a magnetic field. Magnetic shape memory alloys can deform up to 12% without the need of phase transformation, which results in extremely fast, precise, and self-limiting actuation. On the other hand, magnetocaloric materials change their temperature several degrees when they are exposed to or removed from a magnetic field as part of a process that is much more energy efficient than traditional cooling. While the functional properties are very promising, manufacturing of these classes of magnetic materials is difficult and borrowed from traditional manufacturing techniques, which are not optimized for these materials.</p>\n<p>In recent years, additive manufacturing has disrupted the traditional manufacturing landscape with advancements being developed at a fast pace. While energy beam-based additive manufacturing methods, which melt raw material during the printing process, are the most prevalent in metal manufacturing, binder jet 3D printing, also known as binder jetting, is starting to find applications in metal manufacturing due to advantages in speed, cost, isotropic microstructure, and lack of thermal stresses in the printed parts. Since as-printed or &ldquo;green&rdquo; parts exhibit densities of 50-65% density, binder jetting requires a heat treatment for densification. The low density of printed parts and heat treatment to densify enables the manufacturing of foam-like porous to fully dense structures with very high detail.</p>\n<p>In this project, our research group with support from our industry partner worked on better understanding how binder jetting and the required densification heat treatment fundamentally affects the microstructure and functional properties of magnetic shape memory alloys and magnetocaloric materials. Additionally, this project investigated how binder jetting enhancements for functional magnetic materials made on two custom-made, small-scale printers affects microstructure, magnetic, and thermal properties of printed structures. The need to build custom printers and make upgrades to existing commercial printers increased the breadth of this project to include binder jetting and printer technology in general (see Figure 1, (a) insert for commercial printer, (b) manual binder jet printer, (c) automated binder jet printer).</p>\n<p>Throughout the duration of this project we were able to fundamentally investigate several aspects of binder jetting and heat treatment of functional magnetic materials including, but not limited to: (1) printing of magnetic materials with preferred magnetic direction (see Figure 1, magnetic alignment) that will enhance the functional properties of magnetic shape memory alloys, such as magnetic field-induced strain, (2) multi-material printing of magnetocaloric materials, which will result in an increased range of cooling and, therefore, an improved application potential of these materials (see Figure 2), and (3) detailed fundamental study of densification of magnetic shape memory alloys during the post-print heat treatment and how heat treatment affects functional properties (see Figure 3).</p>\n<p>The fundamental findings of the studies performed here will build the foundation of further fundamental and applied research leading towards applications of these functional materials with further enhanced properties due to better understanding of the relationship between printing, heat treatment, and printing options, and the microstructures, and functional properties investigated here. The findings will also be transferable to other material systems, and may expand to commercial printing systems. The combination of functional properties and enhanced manufacturing will lead to new classes of powder-independent sensors, improved energy-efficient cooling, and lightweight porous actuators or pumps.</p>\n<p>Throughout this project, four graduate students and dozens of undergraduate students (including several senior design teams winning the yearly design expo) supported the summarized research and were trained on functional materials, enhanced materials characterization, printer design, and advanced manufacturing all of which was supported by our industry partner.
