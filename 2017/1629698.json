 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mercury is responsible for more than 80% of the fish consumption advisories in fresh waters of the United States.  Most of this mercury is released by the combustion of coal and is deposited from the atmosphere near and far from the sources.  Once deposited, the threat of mercury to food webs depends on the extent to which ionic mercury is converted to (1) methylmercury, the form of mercury that is accumulated from plankton to fish and ultimately to humans, and (2) elemental mercury, the form of mercury that is removed from aquatic systems by volatilization.  Mercury is converted to methylmercury mainly by sulfate-reducing bacteria that thrive in aquatic environments deprived of oxygen.  The ability of these bacteria to methylate mercury depends on the form of the ionic mercury -- whether or not its availability to sulfate-reducing bacteria is limited by its association with organic matter or its precipitation as mercuric sulfide minerals.  Mercury is converted to elemental mercury by reduction by a variety of processes for which the influence of organic matter association and precipitation as mercuric sulfide is not well known.  The goal of this research is to assess the role of organic matter and sulfur in influencing the conversion of ionic mercury to methylmercury, the first step in making mercury available to aquatic organisms.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this proposal is to improve understanding of the interactions between mercury, sulfur, and organic matter.  The research is driven by two main hypotheses that investigate the role of sulfur cycling and redox conditions on the reactivity of organic matter to mercury.  The first hypothesis examines the abiotic incorporation of sulfide into organic matter as a function of organic matter composition, and the role of metals on the stability of the newly-incorporated organic sulfur to oxidation.  The second hypothesis addresses the effects of the composition and redox state of organic matter on the reduction of mercury from Hg(II) to Hg(0), and inhibition of the reduction of Hg(II) by complexation to reduced sulfur groups in organic matter and inorganic sulfide.  The hypotheses will be tested by (1) examining sulfide incorporation into organic matter and reduction of Hg(II) to Hg(0) by organic matter using laboratory experiments and field studies at sites in the Florida Everglades and interior Alaska that represent a range of sulfur and organic matter conditions and (2) characterizing sulfur and mercury in these materials by X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy.  These efforts will be enhanced by the use of electrochemistry to study coupled metal-organic matter redox reactions and high energy-resolution XANES spectroscopy to resolve sulfur functionality.  The research goals will be complemented by a high-school teacher training program focusing on the laboratory research and participation in ongoing and new science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education efforts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe focus of this project was to improve understanding of the interactions between mercury, sulfur, and organic matter.  Better understanding of the biogeochemical factors controlling the fate of mercury in aquatic ecosystems is needed to preserve, restore, and sustain these ecosystems.  The major source of mercury to aquatic systems is coal combustion for electricity generation.  Mercury bioaccumulates as methylmercury, which is formed under sulfate-reducing conditions.  The transformation of mercury to methylmercury -- and therefore, the bioavailability of mercury -- is influenced by complex interactions between mercury in the ionic form, sulfur in reduced forms, and organic matter dissolved in aquatic systems.  The research conducted for this project emphasizes the importance of examining interactions of mercury, sulfur, and organic matter under environmentally-relevant conditions, which creates challenges in laboratory techniques and analysis, but which yields information more useful in forecasting mercury behavior.  The major results of this project are described below. \n\nOur first main set of results addressed the interactions of mercury, sulfur, and organic matter.  In the first study, we described the spatial dependence of sulfur chemistry in dissolved organic matter in wetlands of the Florida Everglades (Figure 1).  We used X-ray absorption spectroscopy and ultra-high-resolution mass spectrometry to examine sulfur in dissolved organic matter as function of sulfate in agricultural waters and sulfide in sediment pore waters.  We found that sulfur is incorporated into organic matter predominantly as reduced species that would strongly bind mercury(II). Sulfate input was the main control of sulfur chemistry in organic matter.  The second study quantified the effects of sulfur and organic matter on concentrations of aqueous mercury species (mercury(II) ions, mercury(0), and methylmercury) in Alaskan wetlands of different trophic status (a gradient of bog to fen) to gain insight to processes controlling the dark reduction and methylation of mercury(II) (Figure 2).  The concentration of mercury(II) depended on the dissolved organic matter concentration. The concentration ratio of mercury(0) to mercury(II) exhibited an inverse relationship to the mercury(II) concentration.  We surmised that dissolved organic matter influenced mercury retention in wetland pore waters by complexing mercury(II) and decreasing the concentration of volatile mercury(0).  There was no evidence of mercury(0) abundance limiting mercury methylation.  For the third study, we isolated dissolved organic matter from a sulfidic wetland and quantified oxidation of the reduced sulfur in the organic matter in the dark and light using X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (Figure 3).  The reduced sulfur in the organic matter was not oxidized by oxygen in the dark, but it was rapidly oxidized to inorganic sulfate in the presence of sunlight.  The results suggest that the susceptibility of reduced sulfur in organic matter should be comprehensively evaluated across diverse aquatic environments of differing organic matter composition. \n\nOur second main set of results addressed mercury in biota ranging from water birds to pilot whales.  In the first study, we used high-energy-resolution X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy and isotope ratios of total mercury and methylmercury to elucidate the chemical speciation and isotope fractionation of mercury as a result of internal demethylation of methylmercury in three waterbirds (Clark?s grebe, Forster?s tern, and south polar skua) (Figure 4).  This study documented that demethylation depends on sequestration of mercury by selenium in birds.  A second study extended this approach to examining mercury in giant petrels in Antarctica (Figure 5), provided fundamental information necessary to improve the interpretation of stable mercury isotope data, and showed the need for a revisitation of processes governing isotopic fractionation in biota and toxicological risk assessment in wildlife.  The third of these studies showed that the identity and proportion of the dominant mercury species in pilot whale tissues can be obtained from the bulk variation of mercury-202 isotope values against the extent of demethylation (Figure 6).  We showed that methylmercury is demethylated by transformation to the mercury tetraselenolate complex in the liver, kidneys, muscle, heart, and brain and ultimately biomineralized as mercuric selenide in the liver and kidneys.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/14/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph N Ryan"
