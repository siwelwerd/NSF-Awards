 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address a pressing need for more environmentally responsible coating alternatives in the anti-corrosion market through the commercialization of a novel aluminum-based coating.   If successfully commercialized, the aluminum electroplating process will displace multiple existing anti-corrosion coatings, which are based on toxic metals.  The current market for these coatings is valued at $10 billion annually.  The replacement of the toxic metals with aluminum will eliminate their release into the environment.  The process is also expected to be less expensive than the incumbent technologies.  The reduction in cost arises from decreases in plating solution, waste treatment, and metal costs.  By decreasing the cost of corrosion-resistant coatings, it may also be possible to reduce the flow of plating jobs to less environmentally responsible areas overseas.  For the aerospace industry, which is the initial target market, the availability of the process will mean safer conditions for workers, less environmental impact, and lower costs. In the process of addressing these needs in the coatings market, the research will elucidate a variety of interesting phenomena associated with electroplating of highly active metal species.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is associated with its exploration of aqueous electroplating of highly active metals in the presence of atmospheric moisture and oxygen.  Typically, electroplating of aluminum has taken place from organic solvents such as toluene at elevated temperatures under an inert purge.  The expense and difficulty in scaling this technology has prevented its adoption for many applications, which might make good use of aluminum coatings.  The goal of the project will be to overcome the technical challenges in scaling-up an aqueous aluminum electroplating process for producing aluminum coatings.  Challenges to be addressed include mass transfer, current distribution, and coating quality control in industrial-scale plating baths.  To address these challenges, the project team will work closely with partners in the electroplating industry, ultimately demonstrating the technology at scale in a working commercial plating shop.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nExecution of the project brought the Lumidize technology to readiness for industrial-scale implementation.  The process produces highly adherent aluminum oxide coatings on metal components from aqueous plating solutions.  The use of these coatings to improve paint adhesion and corrosion resistance and replace polluting processes like chromating and phosphating is a known need in the paint pretreatment market.  Lab-scale coating development was the first step and included reduction in the complexity of the application process to reduce cost.  Bench-scale implementation followed, which included execution of the process in small (5-gallon) tanks that mimic additional aspects of those used at the industrial-scale.  Problems encountered during scale-up were resolved, and the coatings were benchmarked against those produced at lab-scale.  The bench-scale process was then demonstrated in the field before additional scale-up to small commercial-scale (100-gallon tanks).  A demonstration was carried out at the 100-gallon scale in the facility of a manufacturer of equipment for the oil and gas industry.  Based on lessons learned during the demonstration, further improvements were made to the process to make it ready for industrial-scale implementation in customer shops, and a plan was created to deliver industrial-scale plating lines to customers within one to two months of a sale.  \n\nA major success of the project was LumiShield?s success in clearly establishing the Lumidize technology?s value proposition as a pretreatment for the transportation and industrial coatings market.  It is now understood that Lumidize is superior to existing technologies in terms of sustainability, versatility, and performance.  Each of these translates to cost reductions for LumiShield?s customers.  The sustainable nature of the process components substantially reduces waste treatment costs compared with phosphate technologies, which produce toxic sludge.  Lack of need for oven drying eliminates an energy intensive process step and reduces greenhouse gas emissions.  Improved performance allows for a thinner pretreatment layer and fewer layers in the coating stack, decreasing material and energy costs. Taken together, these improvements have the potential to make a significant impact on a manufacturer?s bottom line.\n\nAs the project concludes, the company has a complete product, a detailed understanding of that product?s value, a plan for taking the product into the $160 billion paints and coatings market, and a team with the skills and experience necessary to make that plan a reality.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/17/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Luebke"
