The FOCAPO/CPC Conference has a focus on examining where the field of process control and operations is heading in relation to Big Data, Cyber Physical Systems, the Internet of Things, Optimization, and Machine Learning. The organizing committee, which consists of distinguished researchers with a broad range of skills in process systems engineering, will provide for a vibrant and diverse atmosphere that fosters exchange of ideas on research and education. It is anticipated that approximately 15 US-based young faculty and 30 graduate students will receive partial travel support to attend this conference.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe continuing and rapid development of computer hardware and software systems enables advances in the areas of Cyber-Physical Systems, the Internet of Things, Big Data, and Data Analytics by integrating virtual and physical entities through information networks. Furthermore, ubiquitous computation, almost infinite data storage capabilities due to the migration from dedicated servers to the ?cloud?, and new algorithms for optimization and machine learning offer new opportunities for research and development in the area of process systems engineering and control\r\nThe Conference will bring together researchers from academia and industry working in the area of process systems engineering.  The following topics will be explored:\r\n1. The Internet of Things, Big Data, Communication, Machine Learning and Large Scale Computations across the domains of control and process operations.\r\n2. Emerging technologies, areas of research and non-traditional application domains.\r\n3. Integration of strategic, tactical, and operational decisions through modeling, optimization, and control in dynamic systems with uncertainty and stochastic perturbations.\r\n4. Education and workforce development in a rapidly changing global environment.\r\n5. Future directions for industry implementation and academic research.\r\nThe conference will provide a unique forum for academic researchers and industrial practitioners to assess the current status of research in this field and discuss future directions. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe US-based conference participants supported by this grant will have the opportunity to network with leading researchers in the field of Chemical Process Systems Engineering and Control, and to exchange ideas about the current status and future directions in research and education. They will benefit from state-of-the-art reviews and presentations by leading experts and by debating controversial points with their peers. The Conference will provide an opportunity for interaction and cooperation among industrial and academic researchers. This will be especially beneficial to the young researchers and could positively influence their professional development. The Conference will also include workshops on Model Predictive Control, Process Operations, and Machine Learning.",
