 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Asian monsoon covers a region including India, Southeast Asia, and much of China, and is the primary source of water for a large portion of the world's population.  The region also produces a large share of the anthropogenic aerosols worldwide, and several studies have suggested that aerosols, in combination with greenhouse gases and human land use and land cover (LULC) change, have a significant effect on Asian monsoon rainfall.  \r\n\r\nThe objective of this study is to determine the Asian monsoon response to anthropogenic forcing through the analysis of observations as well as model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 5 (CMIP5).  The work includes an examination of model simulations, including simulations forced by individual anthropogenic factors (for instance only aerosols or only greenhouse gas increases), to determine the relative contributions of the different human drivers of monsoon change.  Further work includes simulations with two atmospheric general circulation models to test the monsoon rainfall response to factors including LULC change, and to identify the separate effect of remote sea surface temperature variations.\r\n\r\nThe work has broader impacts due to the large societal impact of changes in monsoon rainfall, particularly given studies which suggest that the region could experience a substantial reduction in agricultural production by 2050 due to climate change.  Work conducted here seeks to identify the underlying physical mechanisms which lead to monsoon change, and determine whether monsoon change occurring in model simulations is consistent with observational evidence. The work thus seeks to provide better guidance on likely changes in monsoon rainfall over the 21st century.",

It is the largest monsoon system in the world with a seasonally reversing wind system and large changes in seasonal mean rainfall. During the summer months, the monsoon winds blow from the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal into the interior of Asia, bringing in warm and moist air, which is responsible for the heavy summer rains that fall over much of the continent. During the winter months, the monsoon winds reverse direction and bring dry and cooler air from the interior of Asia, resulting in little precipitation in the region. There are many uncertainties in how Asian monsoon responds to human-induced climate drivers (greenhouse gases (GHGs), aerosols, land use and land cover (LULC)), our project aims to answer this question through the analysis of observations as well as outputs from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project - Phase 5/6 (CMIP5/6) models, and through well-designed atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments. In particular, we aim to gain a thorough understanding of the various physical pathways by which anthropogenic forcing impact the Asian monsoon system to determine the robustness of model-based future projection of Asian monsoon changes.</p>\n<p>The most significant results coming out of this project is that the Asian monsoon responds to both the anthropogenic aerosols and greenhouse gases.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the two effects oppose each other with enhanced rainfall due to GHGs and decreased rainfall due to aerosols, the resulting impacts are far from linear (Fig. 1). The monsoon rainfall changes due to aerosols are much stronger than that for GHGs. This is so because the response to greenhouse gases are dominated by thermodynamic effect of increasing atmospheric moisture due to warming and the circulation driven responses are negligible, while in the case of aerosols, it is the change in monsoon circulation that dominates the monsoon rainfall changes while thermodynamics contributes in the same direction. The project further examined the slow and fast processes that affected the monsoon rainfall due to aerosols and GHGs forcings and how extreme rainfall are impacted by these processes, as well as the different aerosol species, such as sulfate aerosols, black carbons and organic carbons in impacting Asian monsoon circulations and rainfall (Fig. 2).&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, this project trained two PhD students with each publishing (or soon to be published) six peer-reviewed journal articles, plus one master thesis paper (also published, Fig. 3) from a third PhD student. The project also helped the advancement of two junior scientist's career through the interaction and supervision of the PhD students' research as well as general project participation. The research products helped a better understanding of the anthropogenic forcing of the Asian monsoon system as well as its future projections, and the uncertainties in the projections that can help decision makers better prepare for the future challenges in the water management and agricultural practices in the impacted regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/26/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mingfang&nbsp;Ting</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1607348/1607348_10465176_1677434820064_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1607348/1607348_10465176_1677434820064_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1607348/1607348_10465176_1677434820064_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Relative Importance of Greenhouse Gases, Sulfate, Organic Carbon, and Black Carbon Aerosol for South Asian Monsoon Rainfall Changes.
