 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will advance our understanding of the process of speciation, the splitting of one species into two. This process is the fundamental source of biodiversity and yet is still not well understood. This project will help us understand the genetic, behavioral, and morphological changes that allowed new species to fully differentiate from one another. The research focuses on fruit flies, which have long served as a model organism for studies of genetics. The researchers will study three species of fruit flies that diverged from a common ancestor species only in the last 5,000-16,000 years.  By studying closely related species, it is possible to tease apart which genetic changes led to the original separation versus which changes happened afterwards. In particular, the project will identify what genetic differences are associated with differences in mating behavior and morphology that restrict or even prevent interbreeding between newly diverged species. The project will provide research experiences for undergraduate students at two liberal arts colleges and train them in DNA sequencing and genetic analysis.  Further, the research findings will be used to train high school teachers and develop science educational workshops in upstate New York and western Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will test the hypothesis that chromosomal inversions have caused divergence and speciation in the Drosophila athabasca species complex by testing two key predictions: 1) Chromosomal inversions contain Quantitative Trait Loci for divergent male courtship song and female mating preferences that are responsible for sexual isolation between these taxa. 2) Chromosomal inversions show greater sequence divergence compared to genomic regions outside of the inversions. This study will directly test if chromosomal inversions harbor phenotypes that cause sexual isolation and thereby instigated reduction in gene flow between nascent species, thus facilitating the process of genomic divergence and speciation. Two datasets will be collected: inter-species crosses to genetically map behavioral speciation phenotypes and population genomic data covering the entire geographical range of each behavioral species.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, we set out to understand the causes of speciation in the Drosophila athabasca species complex, focusing on the influence of chromosomal rearrangements and speciation phenotypes (male courtship song and female preference) on the speciation history.  We have sequenced genomic markers from populations expanding the entire range of Canada and east USA (encompassing the entire species range) and have created hybrid families for genetic mapping purposes (including locations of chromosomal rearrangements).  This species complex was considered one of the fastest known speciation events, with near complete reproductive isolation developing in only 5,000-16,000 years.\n\nOne of the most important results from our work has been the recalibration of the speciation time &ndash; we re-estimated speciation time using genomic markers (rather than mitochondrial DNA).  Our new estimate of speciation time puts the species complex about one order of magnitude older than previous estimates.  This means that the Drosophila athabasca complex is in line with other fast speciation events, at around 200,000 years.  We also show that the reproductive isolation between the three subspecies is nearly complete throughout the species range, with no evidence of higher reproductive isolation in areas of overlap (i.e. no reproductive character displacement).  Due to the well-defined barriers to gene exchange between all subspecies (male courtship and female choice), and lack of evidence of large hybridization in areas of contact (sympatry), we elevate the subspecies to full species and name them: Drosophila athabasca (previously West-Northern subspecies), Drosophila mahican (previously Eastern A subspecies) and Drosophila lenape (previously Eastern B subspecies).\n\nWe also produced hybrid families and mapped the speciation phenotypes, male courtship song and female mate preference.  Male courtship and female mate preferences are considered the speciation phenotypes because sexual isolation is exclusively due to divergent female mate preferences for conspecific male song.  Our mapping results were surprising; we showed that chromosomal inversions span the entire X chromosome (perhaps a combination of multiple overlapping inversions) and parts of the autosomes.  The consequence of these inversions is that the X chromosome never recombines between species.  That is, the second-generation hybrid offspring has X chromosomes that represent the original (non-recombined) chromosomes from pure species.  This lack of recombination made precise mapping difficult, and we were not able to pinpoint the exact gene locations for male courtship or female mate choice, both of which have loci located on the X chromosome.  The X chromosome explained 18.82% of the variance in female mating preference, with other chromosomes (2, 3 and 4) explaining, 6.54, 16.06 and 10.17% of the variance respectively.  For male courtship the X chromosome explained 25.5% of the variance with other chromosomes (2, 3 and 4) explaining 11.69, 6.48 and 8.39% of the variance respectively.  Each chromosome had a single location associated with both male courtship and female mate choice, but this might be due to inversions also present in these autosomes.  We presented these results in conferences. We plan to incorporate additional results from mating families and hybrid populations before publication of complete results in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\nAs part of our broader impacts, we trained undergraduate students throughout the project, participated as discussion leaders in teacher training workshops and volunteered teaching evolution for underserved girls in schools throughout the Berkshires.  Our undergraduate students wrote thesis based on data they collected and presented results in international conferences. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/07/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Luana S Maroja"
