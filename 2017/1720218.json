 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the age of high power computing, random simulation, or sampling, of Levy processes and infinitely divisible distributions is key to finding numerical solutions to many complicated problems in those fields. In addition to their ubiquitous application in finance and insurance, Levy processes and infinitely divisible distributions are extremely useful in a wide range of fields of physical or social science, technology, engineering, and industry, such as turbulence, laser cooling, internet traffic, communication or server queues, equipment maintenance, health hazard monitoring, and clinical trial.  The project aims to make advances in Levy processes through development of novel approaches, with emphasis on high dimensional situations. The results of the project will be integrated into course material to attract students with diverse backgrounds to research on random sampling and its applications in other fields.\r\n\r\nThe lack of closed-form distribution functions is one of the most serious hurdles to the random sampling.  This project proposes to build on the so-called \"embed-and-extract\" approach developed by the PI to exact sampling of the first exit event of a large class of univariate Levy processes and a so-called \"Poisson-gamma-normal\" approximation for approximate sampling of univariate infinitely divisible distributions.  Based on these preliminary findings, the goal of the project is twofold. The first goal is to develop new random sampling methods for the multivariate processes.  Second, the project will develop refined or new ideas and methods to sample for the univariate processes.  To achieve the goal, the project will investigate the issue of random sampling from two aspects.  First, exact sampling methods will be developed for the first passage event or first exit event of a Levy process.  These random events play an important role in applications as well as in theory, but at present, the knowledge on their exact sampling is very limited, especially for multivariate processes.  Second, high-precision approximate sampling methods will be developed for infinitely divisible random variables as well as Levy processes, with the emphasis on easy implementation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnder the support of the award, several signicant results were obtained on the properties and sampling of stable processes and stable distributions.  These processes and distributions are among the most important Levy processes and infinitely divisible distributions.  One group of results address the following quesitions: when does a process reach a critical level, or reach either a critical high level or a critical low level, and what happens to the process up to that moment?   The events are known as \"first passage\" or \"first exit\" events.  The quesitions appear in many applications, for example, the wear of a device over time can be modeled as a stochastic process.  It is of signiciant importance to predict when the wear reaches a certain critical level, and it is useful to simulate the wear process at and/or prior to that critical moment.  The investigation focused on one-sided stable processes with index greater than 1.  The findings included detailed formulas of the probability distribution of the time when a critical level is reached as well as the values of the process at and/or prior to that moment of time.  The findings also included a procedure to simulate the first passage event of a one-sided stable process with index greather than 1.  Another group of results focused on multivariate stable distributions.  These distributions are often used to model random phenomena that involve multiple random quantities exhibiting long-tail in distribution.  Although very useful, multivariate stable distributions are still poorly understood.  The main finding was that spherical harmonic analysis, a type of generalization of Fourier analysis to high-dimensions, can be an effective approach to multivariate stable distributions.  Using this approach, for the first time, some explicit formulas for probability distributions become available for a large class of multivariate stable distributions.  With the help of spherical harmonic analysis, it also became possible, at least conceptually, to simulate some complicated multivariate stable distributions.  These results open the door for future research to get deeper understanding of multivariate stable distributions, find more effiient simulation methods for multivariate stable distributions and for multivariate stable processes, and devise more sophisticated applications of them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/17/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Zhiyi Chi"
