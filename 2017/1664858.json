 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goal of this project is to develop quantitative methodology for detecting geometric and topological features in point clouds extracted from (histology) images.  Of particular relevance, this project considers the setting of prostate cancer classification, which is based on a pathologist grading of histology slides using the Gleason grading system.  These pathology slides are a source of biomedical big data that are increasingly available as archived material.  Developing these quantitative methods will be a significant advance towards a (semi-)automated quantification of prostate cancer aggressiveness.  This award supports an interdisciplinary team of investigators in computational mathematics, computer science, biomedical engineering, and pathology to develop mathematical and computational tools based on topological descriptors and machine learning in order to distinguish between different morphological types of prostate cancer.\r\n\r\nThis research will develop quantitative topological descriptors (e.g., persistence diagrams and summaries) that describe natural histologic phenotypes in prostate cancer, in order to provide explanatory information to assist in providing improved diagnostics/prognostics and insight into the best course of treatment for the patient. This will be accomplished through developing graphical models via unsupervised machine learning that increase our understanding of prostate cancer subtypes. The long-term goal is to develop imaging biomarkers that better identify indolent from aggressive prostate cancer compared to existing, subjective, and variable human observer analyses (i.e., the Gleason score). This project takes steps towards a novel quantitative methodology for prostate cancer classification, as well as towards developing topological methods for statistically distinguishing different types of glandular architectures.",
