 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phenology--the rhythm of the seasons--drives the progression of vegetation through its annual cycles from dormancy to activity and back to dormancy. Phenology is thus critical for many ecological processes. It also directly influences ecosystem productivity and the production of many goods and ecosystem services on which human society is reliant. Importantly, phenological rhythms are highly sensitive to year-to-year variability in weather, but they can also in turn influence weather itself. Thus, there are feedbacks between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere that are phenologically-controlled. This project will use imagery from a network of digital cameras--the PhenoCam Network--to track vegetation phenology at high spatial and temporal resolution across North America, from tundra to the tropics. Together with sophisticated computer simulations, this project will then investigate phenologically-controlled ecosystem-atmosphere feedbacks across a climatic gradient from the Southwest, through the Great Plains, and into the Northeastern US. The question this project seeks to answer is, How much influence do these feedbacks have on how ecosystems work, and at what spatial and temporal scales? This question is important from the point of view of managing and sustaining healthy ecosystems. Public participation in scientific research will be achieved through collaboration with the Harvard Forest Long-Term Ecological Research Project's Schoolyard program and the Summer Research Program. Through these efforts this project will contribute to the education and training of traditionally under-represented groups. This project additionally includes interdisciplinary training and research opportunities for graduate-level students and three postdoctoral research associates. Imagery and data from PhenoCam will continue to be made publicly available, in near-real time, for research and education.\r\n\r\nThis project strives to understand the role of phenology in mediating ecosystem-atmosphere coupling and feedbacks at multiple spatial and temporal scales. The researchers will apply a macrosystems approach by integrating simulation models and observational data to investigate cross-scale interactions and emergent phenomena. First, they will use data from the PhenoCam network, a continental-scale phenological observatory, to develop improved models of vegetation phenology. Then, they will conduct a hierarchy of computer simulation experiments to investigate interactions between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere/climate system that are controlled by phenology. Specifically, this project investigates: (1) How does phenology regulate the strength of ecosystem-atmosphere coupling across a continental-scale ecoclimatic gradient? (2) How does the seasonality of ecosystem-atmosphere coupling vary within and across this gradient? and, (3) How do coupled ecosystem-atmosphere dynamics influence ecosystem function at local to continental spatial scales and seasonal to interannual timescales? The researchers will derive phenological metrics by applying image analysis methods to time series of digital camera images from PhenoCam. Formal model selection criteria will be used to test and evaluate different model structures for the phenology of key plant functional types. The researchers will tackle their key science questions using a sophisticated earth system model with prescribed and prognostic phenology scenarios. These analyses will be complemented by empirical, data-driven analyses fusing PhenoCam data, satellite remote sensing, daily meteorological data and gridded reanalysis products, and micrometeorological measurements of ecosystem-atmosphere fluxes of CO2, water and energy from AmeriFlux sites. Camera and flux data from NEON sites will be incorporated as these become available. Broader impacts from this project will target formal and informal science education, the development of scientific infrastructure, and training of the next generation of interdisciplinary earth system scientists.",

An interesting finding was that while we expect that spring in grasslands will occur up to two weeks earlier within 100 years in temperature-limited sites, the timing will not change significantly for water-limited sites.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-family: Avenir; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none;\">We used site-level PhenoCam data to explore how energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere is influenced by phenology.

Curated and quality-controlled phenological data products derived from the imagery were documented in peer-reviewed publications and shared with the broader research community. Our open data-sharing policy resulted in over 100 papers using phenocam data being published by researchers not associated with this grant. Data from PhenoCam were included each year in NOAA's annual State of the Climate report. Finally, PhenoCam data were central to the NSF-funded NEON Phenology Forecasting Community Challenge.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-family: Avenir; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; display: inline !important; float: none;\">Second, the project contributed to training the next generation of scientific leaders.

Teachers learned about the science of phenology, how PhenoCam imagery and data can be used to track ecosystem responses to climate change, and existing resources available through PhenoCam.

This motivated us to use high-frequency digital camera imagery from the PhenoCam Network to develop new models of phenology and then use these models to investigate the potential impacts of rising temperatures and altered precipitation patterns on phenology. An interesting finding was that while we expect that spring in grasslands will occur up to two weeks earlier within 100 years in temperature-limited sites, the timing will not change significantly for water-limited sites.\n\n\nWe used site-level PhenoCam data to explore how energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere is influenced by phenology. We found that phenology influences the \"roughness\" of the surface, which has a large impact on energy exchange, and that phenology impacts the movement of water from the land surface to the atmosphere in all but the most severely water-limited systems. We also used PhenoCam imagery to evaluate new satellite data products, which enabled rigorous quantification of uncertainties in these data.\n\n\nThere were two key broader impacts of this project.First, the project expanded the PhenoCam Network into a full-fledged, continental-scale observatory. Digital imagery from over 800 cameras at research sites located from Alaska to Puerto Rico and from Hawaii to Maine was made publicly available, in real-time, through the project web page. Curated and quality-controlled phenological data products derived from the imagery were documented in peer-reviewed publications and shared with the broader research community. Our open data-sharing policy resulted in over 100 papers using phenocam data being published by researchers not associated with this grant. Data from PhenoCam were included each year in NOAA's annual State of the Climate report. Finally, PhenoCam data were central to the NSF-funded NEON Phenology Forecasting Community Challenge.\n\n\nSecond, the project contributed to training the next generation of scientific leaders. We organized a series of \"PhenoTeach\" workshops for 14 K-12 teachers, many of whom were associated with Schoolyard programs at NSF-supported LTER sites. Teachers learned about the science of phenology, how PhenoCam imagery and data can be used to track ecosystem responses to climate change, and existing resources available through PhenoCam. They designed lesson plans to leverage these resources, which were shared with the group, and made available through the PhenoCam web page. One teacher, who works with 280 6thgrade science students, reported that their students were extremely enthusiastic about engaging with phenocam data, and one student even commented that \"This is the funnest thing we've ever done in this class!\" Two of the teachers presented posters at the annual meetings of both the Ecological Society of America and the American Geophysical Union. Classroom visits to local schools and training workshops for scientists and resource managers on how to use PhenoCam imagery for research and monitoring applications further broadened the impact of our project.The project also provided exposure to cutting-edge research and cyberinfrastructure for severalcommunity college students and undergraduates who were employed as research associates,and wholly or partially supported six postdocs and two Ph.D. students, who participated in a large, cross-disciplinary team-based science project.Postdocs trained through this project have moved on to a range of career tracks, including university faculty positions, as well as academic and private sector positions. \n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: MarkAFriedl\n"
