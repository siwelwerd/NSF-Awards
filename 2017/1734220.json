 "awd_abstract_narration": "A challenge for our visual system is being able to focus on information important for our current task, while also being responsive to unexpected events.  For example, when driving, if one is looking carefully for a street sign, one should also be able to stop to avoid a car pulling out from a side street. To address this challenge, our brain uses an attentional system that monitors the environment for important information and decides what should be focused at each moment in time. The proposed research will investigate this attentional system, using experiments that examine behaviors and brain activity, as well as with a computer model that integrates other findings from many different labs. This model will help researchers to better understand how brainwaves are related to both the activity of brain cells and behavior when visual attention is engaged. The model will be made publicly available in a format that anyone can run on their own computer, so that other researchers can use it to help advance our understanding in many important areas, such as how cars and other automated systems will be able to navigate and interact safely with the world. Finally, this work supports educational efforts aimed at engaging undergraduate students with a highly technical approach to scientific investigation and funds outreach efforts in high schools to give students the opportunity to develop a greater interest in neuroscience and robotics.\r\n\r\nThis work builds on decades of research into the nature of visual attention, which has generated a large volume of data about how the brain processes information. Based on this work, the researchers have created a computational model of attention that attempts to simulate how the brain chooses which pieces of information to attend. To validate this model, they will conduct a series of eight new experiments that test specific predictions of the model. These tests will provide information about how the different layers of neurons in the model should communicate to most closely approximate the human brain's attentional system. The final model will be compiled into a version that can be downloaded by other researchers or educators. This model will provide a polished graphical user interface, allowing novice users to explore how the simulated attention system works, and how brainwaves are generated. A further objective will be to develop a new kind of experiment that tests the delay between vision and attention. The data from this paradigm will give scientists crucial details about how the human visual system temporarily holds information while determining what to do with it.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nAttention is a foundational component of vision, without which our visual world would be an impenetrable jungle of information. Humans and machines alike have to deal with the challenge of paying attention to the appropriate objects and at the appropriate points in time.\n\n\n\n\nFor example when driving, if one is looking carefully for a street sign, one should also be able to stop to avoid a child suddenly running in front of the car. To address this challenge our brain possesses an attentional system that monitors the environment for important information and decides what should be focused at each moment in time.\n\n\n\n\nScientists study how the human mind deploys attention with many approaches. Some studies focus on behavioral data, such as how quickly someone can detect an object, or how distracted they are by an irrelevant object. Others focus on neural data, such as brain waves that tell us how long it takes for our attentional system to find a target.\n\n\n\n\nThis project builds a new computer simulation of visual attention that explains in detail how neural activity in the brain allows our attention to rapidly focus on targets, while excluding some distractors, but still permitting the most important critical ones, like a child crossing the street, to capture our attention. This model also explains key aspects of neural data, by simulating the specific shape of brainwaves that occur when observers are asked to detect targets. By integrating behavior and neuroscience, our computer simulation allows more kinds of data to inform the models function, and therefore improves its match to the brains mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\nExamples of our findings from this study include the fact that rapid attention operates primarily in two dimensions, collapsing depth like a pancake. We also discovered that once we attend to an object, attention may be cut off abruptly if the object abruptly changes color. We built a deep learning model of how attention directs working memory to remember certain features and discovered also that memory for the location of an object has an inherent advantage over memory for other features like color.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Training:\n\n\n\n\nAs a result of this project, we completed several distinct lines of empirical research resulting in 17 peer reviewed publications over the course of six years as well as numerous presentations at conferences and universities at locations around the world. The research has also supported the research of over twenty students, including two PhD dissertations. These students come from a wide variety of backgrounds, such as psychology, computer science, aerospace engineering, information sciences and will go on to jobs in industry and academia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutreach:\n\n\n\n\nThis project has also supported the development of the Neuromatch organization, a non-profit educational initiative that has created high quality training in critically important technical disciplines such as Computational Neuroscience, Climate Science, and Deep Learning. Our virtual courses have been available for four years now, having started in 2020 at the start of the global pandemic. During that summer we played a key role in helping over one thousand students around the world, with hundreds in the US, develop their careers despite the disruption of the lock down. Since then we have expanded our number of courses and have reached over 10,000 students so far, while also producing teaching jobs for hundreds of instructors to manage our virtual classrooms. Our waiver system ensures that students without the ability to pay the entry fee are able to attend.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/06/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: BradleyPWyble\n"
