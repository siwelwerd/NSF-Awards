 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, from the University of California San Diego (UCSD) creates an extension and expansion of their current I-Corps Site. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\nThis Site is the outcome of a Type II proposal from UCSD. There are two types of I-Corps Site proposals: Type I - Type I proposals are submitted by institutions that have not had prior funding as an I-Corps Site; Type II - Type II proposals are submitted by institutions that have had prior funding as an I-Corps Site. The UCSD Type II project proposed continuation and expansion of USCD's existing I-Corps Site, expanding target teams from 30 to 50 annually, integrating collaboration with the existing StartupXX program to nurture female entrepreneurs, adding leadership and team dynamics workshops in collaboration with an existing center on campus, and extending mentoring for I-Corps teams by six months. The Site also builds on a solid track record of success from first round I-Corps Site funding. The extensions to the existing Site are well-conceived, with clearly defined goals, and push the envelope of programming with the requested new funding. Their Site effectively leverages and integrates complementary existing programs, across disciplines, in a strong campus and regional ecosystem.",
