Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Thomas Polstra is \"Measuring and Relating Singularities in Prime Characteristic Commutative Algebra and Algebraic Geometry.\" The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Utah, and the sponsoring scientist is Karl Schwede.",
