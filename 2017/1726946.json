 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, acquiring a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster and an ancillary Parallel File System, aims to be able to fulfill the demand for computationally intensive data analysis and simulation resulting from the increased scale and complexity of biological and biotechnical data. The underlying work addresses the challenge created when  analyzing, managing, and relating this type of information generated by the interdisciplinary distributed center in the state (BioSNTR: Biochemical Spatio-Temporal Network Resource). The HPC cluster supports the BioSNTR's data analysis research activities, which spans the disciplines of genomics, optical microscopy, satellite imaging, computational chemistry, and electrical, and mechanical engineering; in fact, it will be a hub for BioSNTR, a distributed research center across the state created by another NSF-funded project that has resulted in 10 new tenure-track hires across SD. This center has acquired new optical microscopes that can produce massive amounts of data, requiring intensive computational reconstruction methods driving pressing need for local HPC resources. A previous MRI enabled the creation of a next generation gene sequencing facility that, coupled with BioSNTR hires in bioinformatics, drives the need for expanded HPC capabilities for a range of genomics applications. BioSNTR aims to link advanced imaging with next generation sequencing to connect the system-level genotype to phenotype. The HPC platform is essential for realizing the integration of large data sets. Additionally, the South Dakota Image Processing Laboratory (IPLab) would benefit from this equipment. \r\n\r\nEngineering applications include satellite and fluid dynamic computation. IPLab develops novel techniques to account for atmospheric anomalies that adversely impact spectral reflectance signatures measured from land features. Future work includes extensive computational processing of Landsat scenes for climatological analysis (3 to 4 million data sets). Estimates indicates that this work will consume all the processing power within the current cluster for an entire year. Simulating efficiencies in energy power systems relies heavily on high parallel processing. Bioscience and biotechnology have entered a new era in which the new instrumentation transforms the scale of complexity of biological data. These instruments produce expansive information about organismal phenotype/function and genotype, thereby creating a computational challenge in analyzing, managing, and relating this information. Beyond the more traditional disciplines, the instrumentation will facilitate research in emerging areas. Examples include data intensive research methods to analyze high frequency financial transactions within economics, and journalism research using data mining techniques to study the characteristics of social factors that contribute to collaborative conversational tendencies.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe instrumentation allows inclusion of parallel computer processing into the graduate courses within the biological, chemical, and statistical science and enhances the development of curriculum within the Computer Science program. The new cluster leverages a recently-funded REU site focused on early undergraduate students from tribal and community colleges. The investigators are able to coordinate yearly training workshops in transcriptomics and image analysis in collaboration with BioSNTR. These will be open to students, researchers, and faculty throughout the state.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nScientific discoveries at South Dakota State University (SDSU) and its collaborators have been positively impacted as a result of the acquisition and deployment of a new High-Performance Cluster and Parallel File System instrument.  Without this capacity, institutional researchers would not be able to solve problems that demand high computational clock cycle and large memory resources.\n\nResearch personnel within the SDSU Image Processing Center are now able to accomplish further study into the development of novel techniques enabling necessary corrections for atmospheric and radiometric anomalies observed within satellite sensors that measure the spectral radiances off of the earth's surface.  Such radiances are converted to spectral signatures to give scientists an indication of temporal and spatial changes occurring within our Biosphere.  Specific contributions involve management and policy decisions within the study areas of deforestation, wind and soil erosion, vegetative health and urbanization.\n\nResearchers and students within Mechanical Engineering can now compute Parallell Direct Numerical simulations of three-dimensional Navier-Stikes equations to study single jet impringing in cross air flow within jet engines.  Within Electrical Engineering researchers are using the new cluster to design synthetic datasets to be used in large-scale (million of homes) energy simulations with high-fidelity to the individual energy device (e.g., dishwasher).  Funding of this project for the cluster instrument was necessary to accomplish solutions to these design problems.\n\nWithin the area of Plant Science, SDSU researchers are advancing imaging and systems biology approaches to measure phenotypes and genotype by sequencing to provide genetic analysis of abiotic stress tolerance in grapevine.  This research group expects to continue extensive use of the new cluster for this and large-scale transcriptome and network analysis to study rootstock effects on grapevine shoots.  Another plant related research project enabled by this instrument involves the sequencing of plant genomes to provide genetic information for the improvement of modern wheat varieties that can adapt to stressful growing conditions while maintaining and increasing yield.  Both areas are realizing growth in research to address the current and future food needs of a growing population. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/01/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Adelaine"
