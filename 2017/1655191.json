 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nature abounds with organisms that display bright colors, yet it is not always obvious why. Some animals evolve to advertise to potential predators that they are poisonous (warning coloration). Different toxic species may converge on the same color pattern, giving both an advantage by more effectively advertising to predators. This is known as M\u00fcllerian mimicry, a focus of interest because it involves multiple phenomena that lie at the heart of our understanding of evolutionary processes. The genetic basis of mimicry is of special interest, because it provides a window into how these key evolutionary processes unfold. This research will focus on discovering the genetic underpinnings of M\u00fcllerian mimicry in a species of poison frog that has undergone an evolutionary radiation across different geographic regions of Peru. In each region, the mimic poison frog has evolved a different color pattern (such as stripes, bands, or spots), to resemble another species in that region. The evolution of these new color patterns may be driving reproductive isolation between populations of the mimic poison frog, leading to speciation and the creation of new biodiversity. The project is a collaborative endeavor between researchers at three large public universities and will involve broad participation by undergraduate and graduate students, and a postdoctoral scientist. The results of the project will be used to enhance K12 education through classroom presentations, public lectures and museum displays.\r\n \r\nThis project focuses on four specific aims: 1. Identify key genetic factors involved in color pattern development in the mimic poison frog by investigating differential gene expression across developmental stages and color pattern morphs, using next generation sequencing to produce stage-specific transcriptomes for each morph, which will be assembled to analyze patterns of differential gene expression. 2. Identify the causal gene(s) underlying differences in color pattern between morphs using genome-wide marker arrays (exome capture sequences) to screen transition zone samples (from three transition zones) and enable admixture mapping to discover candidate genes. 3. Test the association of specific candidate loci with color pattern using multigenerational pedigrees. 4. Test specific hypotheses regarding selection and demographic processes in the transition zones and between mimics and models, using new analytical tools. Together these complementary, mutually reinforcing approaches will elucidate the genetic underpinnings and population genomics of color pattern evolution and diversity in this mimetic radiation of poison frogs.",

The Neotropical poison frogs of South and Central American are famous for their brilliant coloration, which advertises to potential predators that they are toxic. In this region of Peru, one species, the mimic poison frog, Ranitomeya imitator, evolved to look like other species it encountered as it expanded its range (from southern Peru). This phenomenon is known as Muellerian mimicry, and it occurs because toxic species benefit from reduced predation if they evolve to resemble other toxic species. The mimicr poison frog is one of a small number of vertebrates that have been found to participate in this type of mimicry. This project focused on discovering the underlying genes and genetic mechanisms that enable this kind of mimicry to evolve. The genes underlying and enabling mimicry have been well studied in Heliconius butterflies (whose distribution, conincidentally, is concentrated in the same region of Peru), but until now we have not had similar studies of vertebrate mimicry. An important result of the many studies of mimicry in Heliconius butterflies is that the genes that mimics used to acquire resemblance to their model species came through introgression, that is, the mimics acquired the genes to mimic their model species by interbreeding with them. How general this mechanism is remains unknown because, as noted, other systems have not been available for comparison. In this work, using a variety of molecular evolutionary genetic and genomic approaches, we were able to demonstrate that the genetic mechanisms producing similar color and pattern in the mimic poison frogs evolved independently from those in the model species, and were not obtained through introgression. This provides the first hint that the genetic mechanisms underlying mimicry in vertebrates may be quite different from those in invertebrates, although much more research must be done before such broad generalizations can be confirmed (or refuted). Our evolutionary genomic analyses also allowed us to inffer that natural selection drove the genetic changes that caused different populations of R. iimitator evolve to resemble different model species. This is consistent with the mechanism of Muellerian mimicry, which Fritz Mueller proposed in 1878 (one of the first mathematical models developed in biology). This project involved sequencing amphibian genomes, which are notoriously large (far larger than human genomes) and very difficult to sequence for a variety of reasons (especially their complex structure involving vast regions of repeating sequences). To mitigate this problem, we used a procedure (exome capture) that allowed us to focus our attention on those regions of the genome most likely to contain the genes controlling color pattern development. This allowed us to solve an intractable problem that has plagued researchers working on organisms with large genomes, and we expect this approach will prove useful to other researchers in future. Using these genomic methods, we were able to identify a series of specific genes affecting specific aspects of color pattern development in the mimic poison frog. To confirm these effects, we cross-bred different morphs (striped and banded) of the mimic poison frog, to produce a multigenerational pedigree. This allowed us to test the association between allelic variation in each candidate gene and variation in specific aspects of color pattern, and we were able to confirm that the candidate genes we had identified through genomic analyses did indeed control specific aspects of color pattern development in these frogs. Some of these genes were familiar, as they have been implicated in the control of color pattern in other vertebrates (e.g. mc1r, well known for its role in controlling melanic (dark) coloration and patterning). However, some were genes that had not previously been implicated in the evolution of coloration, and hence provide new targets for investigations into the genetics of color pattern. In addition to these outcomes, this project has entailed many other avenues of investigation, including transcriptomics, gene expression, gene network analysis, histology, toxicology, dietary analysis, and even microbiome analyses.
