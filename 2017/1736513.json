 "awd_abstract_narration": "Subduction Zones are geologic faults that begin offshore where one tectonic plate slides beneath another.  Due to friction along the fault some of the down-going plate motion is slowly transferred to the upper plate which bends and contracts storing the motion.  Occasionally, this built-up motion is rapidly released as an earthquake and displaces the sea floor causing a tsunami.  The Cascadia subduction zone offshore northern California, Oregon and Washington and the Aleutian subduction zone offshore Alaska have generated large earthquakes and tsunami in the past and will do so again.   Measuring where and how fast this slow build-up occurs can improve understanding of the potential hazard.  This requires offshore seafloor sensors to collect data, and in the past, ships to access this data.  In this project, new methods will be develop and tested that use fewer instruments and remotely-piloted, self-powered sea surface vehicles, rather than ships, to lower the cost of data collection.\r\n\r\nThis is a one-year project to  implement acoustic upload of data from the sea floor to a wave- and solar-powered sea surface vehicle, and test a new lower cost method of collecting GPS-Acoustic data in shallow water (< 200 m) using a single seafloor transponder.   An onboard computer will be programed to control the acoustic ranging system to operate in modem mode.  A pressure sensor embedded with a transponder will be deployed offshore SIO to test the upload capability at varying ranges and depths.  In addition, a transponder will be deployed offshore SIO and the sea surface vehicle will be operated remotely to circle the transponder for up to two weeks collecting GPS-Acoustic data.   We will then evaluate if repeatability of positioning in shallow water is comparable to the existing GPS-Acoustic approach where data are collected from the center of an array comprised of three or more transponders.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTwo facts have limited scientists\u2019 ability to track the deformation of Earth\u2019s crust from plate tectonics and earthquakes: one, 70% of the planet is under the oceans, and two, signals from Global Navigation System Satellites cannot penetrate sea water.  Consequently, most measurements of crustal deformation, which rely largely on precise GPS measurements, are limited to land.  Developments over several decades beginning in the 1990s that advanced methods combining acoustic ranging to seafloor devices and GPS positioning of an ocean-surface platform have made it possible today to obtain cm-accuracy coordinates of seafloor positions.  Until recently this required the use of expensive, large research vessels.  In the work funded by this project, an unmanned self-powered ocean-surface vehicle known as a Wave Glider was fitted with the GPS antennas and acoustic ranging hardware to autonomously collect the data needed for geodetic quality surveys of permanent seafloor makers.  This has revolutionized seafloor geodesy and made it possible to track the motions of the plates where they build up strain that can cause huge offshore earthquakes and tsunami.  The technology developed has now been commercialized, making the equipment and technique available to researchers worldwide.\n\n \n\nA key outcome of this technology development is the establishment of seafloor geodetic sites in both the Cascadia subduction zone (offshore Washington, Oregon, and northern California) and in the Alaska subduction zone offshore the Aleutian Island chain.  Repeated measurements at those stations over many years will reveal where the subducted oceanic plate is locked to the overriding continental plate, building up strain that can lead to a large earthquake and/or a tsunami.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: C.
