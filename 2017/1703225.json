 "awd_abstract_narration": "Navigation technologies are an increasingly important component of everyday life in an ever more dynamic and complex world. One limitation of these technologies is that they are optimized for a specific spatial scale. Another limitation is that they do not use the knowledge of previous navigation to compute new paths, essentially starting from scratch every time they are invoked. Recent evidence shows, however, that the mammalian brain has evolved to use multiple spatial navigation scales in parallel, and to use spatial memory to improve path planning. How these scales are used and what advantages such uses provide are still unknown. This project hypothesizes that multiscale spatial navigation is crucial in large and cluttered environments. Experiments recording from the neurons of the \"brain GPS\" system of the rodent (an excellent and efficient spatial navigator) seek to elucidate the basic principles of memory-based multiscale spatial navigation. These experiments will inform new algorithms that will be implemented on a computer to simulate complex multiscale spatial navigation, mimicking the neural computations of the brain. The simulations will then be tested and improved on actual autonomous mobile robots navigating in challenging complex environments.\r\n\r\nThe project will use wireless high density neural recording technologies allowing for parallel recording of large populations of individual neurons. Optogenetic techniques will be used to manipulate the activity of these neurons and study their impact on the behavior and spatial memory of the animal. The multiscale pattern of neural activity will be used in the development of a mechanistic computational model, which will be tested in new and arbitrary simulated environments, and generate predictions as to how the neural system might succeed or fail. Finally, the simulations will be ported onto a mobile robot, where the algorithms can be tested and improved when the robot is faced with real sensor noise and unreliable world features.",

We built the largest rodent maze in the world in which neurons from the brain GPS system can be recorded wirelessly. We found that the coding properties of &lsquo;place cells&rsquo; are fundamentally different in the megaspace than in other traditional mazes (Figure 1). Neurons are multi-field and multi-scale and their coding properties quantitatively adjust to the overall size of their environment when it is varied. This property was found at all levels of the hippocampus, from the most dorsal levels, to the most ventral ones. We also found that these neurons become active again in a sleep period immediately following the task, and that unlike in smaller spatial environments; this reactivation appears largely random and unstructured, save perhaps near the maze boundaries.&nbsp; In a different set of experiments, we also showed that contrary to the now well-established findings that ventral hippocampus is not involved in simple and small environments, learning task with complex features such as obstacles indeed recruit the ventral hippocampus (Figure 2). This finding led to the new hypothesis that both dorsal and ventral hippocampus areas contribute to spatial learning and memory in complex tasks or large environments. In parallel, and using the data collected, we built several biophysical computational models of the CA3 circuits involved in spatial navigation testing possible mechanisms related to the emergence of multi-scale and multi-field structure as the size of the environment increases.</p>\r\n<p>We developed and assessed a multi-scale dorso-ventral spatial model for navigation and path learning in cluttered environments, comparing the results of different distributions (Figure 3). We evaluated the spatial model and experimented with physical robots in relation to their robustness and the effect of noise on path navigation and learning. We analyzed multiple place cell distributions in open and cluttered environments with different place cell field distributions, e.g., single-scale uniform distributions, multi-scale globally uniform distribution, multi-scale global and local uniform distributions, and multi-scale non-uniform distribution (Figures 4, 5). The assessment compared different quantitative metrics, primarily learning time and path optimality. Overall, results show that in general the non-uniform layer configurations reach the shortest paths, i.e. path optimality, faster than uniformly distributed cells. Additionally, uniform layers that initially learn faster using fewer cells, produce significantly worse path optimality ratios than non-uniform layers during final trials (Scleidorovich, Fellous, and Weitzenfeld, 2022).</p>\r\n<p>These studies establish the role of the dorso-ventral axis in spatial navigation in large or complex environment, and suggest new neural coding schemes that might have significant consequences for future theoretical and experimental work.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 12/11/2024<br>\nModified by: Alfredo&nbsp;Weitzenfeld</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1703225/1703225_10520254_1733929984013_Fig5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1703225/1703225_10520254_1733929984013_Fig5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Place cell distribution type samples\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1703225/1703225_10520254_1733929984013_Fig5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Place cell distribution type samples\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(A) Uniform single-scale, 20 cm cells, 14 x 10 grid.
