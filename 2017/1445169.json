 "awd_abstract_narration": "Putkonen/1445205\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award supports the study of a large body of ice that is buried beneath approximately a meter of debris in the Ong Valley of the Transantarctic Mountains of East Antarctica. Preliminary analyses of this material suggest that it could be over a million years old.  Most glacial ice contains tiny air bubbles that have trapped the atmospheric gases and other atmospherically transported materials existing at the time that the ice was deposited such as plant pollen, microbes and mineral dust.  Samples will be collected from this buried ice mass, down to a depth of 10 meters, and cosmogenic nuclide concentrations both in the overlying debris and in the till contained in the ice will be measured. This site could contain some of the oldest ice on Earth and studies of the material contained within it may help researchers to better understand the processes involved in its survival for such long periods of time. This work will also help inform scientists about the processes involved in the development of landforms here on earth as well as those on Mars where similar dirt covered glaciers are found today.\r\n\r\nSamples of the buried ice will be collected in Ong Valley and analyzed to determine the cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in both the overlying debris and in the mineral matter suspended in the ice. The combined analysis of the target cosmogenic nuclides (Beryllium-10, Aluminum-26, and Neon-21) will allow the age of the ice to be uniquely determined and will enable determination of the rate that the ice is sublimating. The intellectual merit of this research is to unequivocally determine the age of the ice and the sublimation rate of the ice in Ong Valley, Antarctica and to better understand if this an uniquely Antarctic process or whether it could exist elsewhere on earth or on other planets.  The work may also lead to the recognition of the oldest buried ice ever found on Earth and would provide a source from which direct information about the atmospheric chemistry, ancient life forms, and geology of that time could be measured.  The broader impacts of this work are that it will be relevant to researchers in a number of different fields including glaciology, paleoclimatology, planetary geology, and biology. Several students will also participate in the project, conducting Antarctic field work, making measurements in the lab, attending meetings, participating in outreach activities, and producing videos. A graduate student will also write a thesis on this research.  The results will be published in scientific journals and presented at conferences. The project requires field work in Antarctica.",

The primary objective is to drill into this ice, collect shallow ice cores, and use the chemistry of the sands in the ice to date the ice. Secondary objectives of the project are to further understand the glacial history of Ong Valley and the processes that actively shape the valley today, which has a unique environment that is extremely cold and dry.</p>\n<p>Through this project, we have furthered our understanding of the glacial history and the unique environment of Ong Valley, Antarctica. We successfully collect two shallow ice cores and analyzed the quartz sands from the cores in the lab. We determined there are at least two buried ice bodies in Ong Valley. The upper one has an age of 2.95 +/- 0.22 million years, and the lower one is 4.3-5.1 million years old. These are the oldest ice bodies to be directly dated on Earth. By measuring the concentration of certain isotopes of beryllium (Be-10), aluminum (Al-26), and neon (Ne-21) in quartz from boulders in Ong Valley, we determined the age of many glacial deposits, the oldest of which are 7 million years old. We measured the grain size distribution, organic carbon content, and salt concentration in glacial tills and from soils from the hills above and beyond the glacial limit. We found that grain size, organic carbon, and salt values increase over time in the soils in Ong Valley due to dust settling, mechanical fracturing of the rocks, the lack of liquid water in the valley, the slow erosion of the surfaces by the wind, and the overturning of the soils. We also measured the bulk geochemistry of the till and hill samples, and isolated zircon sands from these samples. We use the Uranium-Lead age of the zircon sands to identify the source of the glacial tills and look for changes in the source area over time, which would indicate a change in the flow of the Argosy glacier that deposited these tills. We find similar zircon ages and chemistry in all the glacial tills in Ong Valley, which indicates the Argosy Glacier flowed the same way for 7 million years as it deposited these tills. These findings help us better understand the distinct and extremely cold and dry environment of Ong Valley, which is similar to the conditions found on the surface of Mars. We also identified a source of glacier ice that is very old, but easy to reach, and can help us understand ancient climates on earth. Similar buried ice bodies have been found in Antarctica, but none have been directly dated. Coring into these ice bodies and dating them will help extend our understanding of past climates on earth.</p>\n<p>This project focused on providing research training for early scientists. Three high school students, eight undergraduate students, and one visiting international graduate student were trained in laboratory methods and analyzed samples for this project. One undergraduate student was a member of the 2017 field team and spent two months in Antarctica. Two undergraduate students graduated with honors in Earth &amp; Environmental Sciences by completing a senior thesis project on samples collected for this project. Two undergraduate students were first-author presenters of their results at national geoscience conferences, and eight undergraduate students were co-authors on projects presented at national and international conferences.
