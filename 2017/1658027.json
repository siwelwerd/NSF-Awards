 "awd_abstract_narration": "The large-scale circulation of the ocean also known as the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) comprises a series of shallow and deep water currents that transport mass, heat, carbon, and nutrients around the globe. The Samoan Passage, which carries the majority of the transport in its deep northward branch, is an important element of the Pacific Ocean circulation system. Recent observations supported by a previously funded NSF project have identified a previously unknown split of the flow between a deeper eastern channel and multiple shallower, western pathways within the Samoan Passage complex. Additional changes such as a warming and weakening of the flow through the passage have also been observed over the past twenty years, which supports the need for long-term observations.  This project will examine the dynamics of the flow through the Samoan Passage in detail using a combination of observations, theory and numerical models. Currently, there are no deep ocean monitoring system deployed in the Pacific MOC and this project has the potential to aid in the development of an observing system that can complement the one currently deployed in the Atlantic. Climate models predict a weakening of the global overturning circulation, which could be confirmed or refuted with these observing systems. The knowledge gained from the proposed work can likely be applied to similar deep passages and fracture zones around the world. Two early career scientists, summer undergraduates, a graduate student and a post-doctoral researcher will gain valuable training in modern methods used in oceanography through this project.  Diverse outreach activities are planned to engage the public with the results and knowledge gained from this project through collaborations with a modern dance company, and the Birch Aquarium and a high school in San Diego.\r\n\r\nExtensive measurements collected under previous NSF funding, including a combination of moored time series and deep towed measurements will be used to study hydraulic effects on the flow in the Samoan Passage. Strong turbulent mixing was observed as the flow passes through and over various constrictions and sills, thereby substantially altering its water mass characteristics. The recent measurements indicate hydraulic criticality of the flow through the Samoan Passage, at least at one major sill. The three specific objectives of this project include: investigating the influence of hydraulic processes on mixing and friction at various sills, studying hydraulic criticality and implications for transport and partition of the flow through and around the Samoan Passage, and informing an efficient monitoring strategy for the flow through the Samoan Passage. As a result of this project, hydraulic theory will be improved and observationally validated, making it applicable to dense overflows in other passages and to the flow in the multitude of fracture zones that are believed to be important drivers for abyssal upwelling.",

The shallowness of the Bering Strait means that no deep water is formed in the North Pacific. Rather the deepest water in the North Pacific has flowed northward from the Southern Ocean. This northward deep western boundary current is funneled through several gaps in a submarine ridge extending from Fiji to Tahiti. The majority of the flow goes through the approximately 100 kilometer wide Samoan Passage (Fig. 1). As the deep North Pacific is about 20% of the global ocean volume understanding the volume transport and changes in water properties through this choke point is important to understanding the global ocean and climate. &nbsp;This project follows on from NSF-funded observational effort that resulted in an extensive bathymetric, moored, hydrographic, and turbulent mixing dataset. The purpose of project covered by this report was to continue the analysis of the observational data as well as use numerical and theoretical models to better understand the dynamics of the deep flow in the Samoan Passage.</p>\n<p>This project found that the homogeneous temperature and salinity characteristics of the 800 m thick deep western boundary current reaching the entrance were significantly altered as the flow transited the Samoan Passage. The bottom temperature increased by 55 millidegrees C and the high salinity signature associated with North Atlantic Deep Water was eroded away (Fig. 2). Microstructure profiler measurements reveled a spatially complex mixing regime driven by the underlying bathymetry (Fig. 3). The highest levels of mixing were observed at the hydraulically controlled northernmost sill in the eastern channel (labeled P5 on Fig. 1b), which corresponded to the largest changes in water mass properties (temperature and salinity). Other mixing hotspots were found to have different dominating physical mechanisms. As far as we could tell from the observations the mixing in the Samoan Passage is surprisingly consistent with time. This included short term variations such as tides, as well as longer term variability in the volume transport though the Samoan Passage.</p>\n<p>Our long-term moorings at the southern end of the passage showed similar patterns of variability, including tidal and annual oscillations in transport, to a monitoring array deployed 20 years earlier. Over that period the temperature of the dense flow increased by 0.02 degrees C. There is also a suggestive, but not statistically significant, decrease in volume transport.</p>\n<p>An idealized theoretical model was used to investigate the partitioning of Deep Western Boundary Current transport. On average about 6 Sv (1 Sv = one million cubic meters per second) goes through Samoan Passage and about 3 Sv is goes around the Manihiki Plateau. The water reaching the North Pacific via the Samoan Passage undergoes significant mixing (Fig. 3) and water mass modification (Fig. 2), whereas the water going around the Manihiki Plateau does not. A hydraulically control point, such as several sills in the Samoan Passage, restricts the amount of downstream transport. In a simple system like a river, this results in elevated water levels upstream of the dam or weir. &nbsp;In the case of the Deep Western Boundary Current the hydraulic control points in the Samoan Passage appear to govern the amount of dense water diverted around the Manihiki Plateau.</p>\n<p>Current climate models are unable to accurately reproduce the mixing, and hence water mass modification, in choke points unless custom algorithms are implemented. &nbsp;This has been done for other choke points like the Denmark Strait in the North Atlantic. Our observations and analysis lay the groundwork to develop such an algorithm for the Samoan Passage. Further they suggest that long-term monitoring of the transport would be possible with a small number of carefully placed moorings.</p>\n<p>Broader impacts of the Samoan Passage project included public presentations describing our work and inspiring young people at events in Samoa, Hawaii, San Diego, and Seattle, and the education of 2 Ph.D. graduate students and 2 postdocs. Additional co-PI Larry Pratt co-taught a two-week class for 5th and 6th grade students that used dance to convey Samoan Passage specific as well as general physical oceanography concepts through dance.
