 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site will support a diverse group of computing majors in a mentored research experience in computational robotics, including components emphasizing professional and academic skills development and community building. The primary population of target students will be sophomores and juniors from undergraduate-serving institutions in the southeast. The project will encourage these students toward graduate study and research-oriented industry positions, and provide essential preparation for these career paths. It will be an excellent opportunity for ten undergraduates to participate in research projects each year. The emphasis on applications of computing in robotics is supportive of the growing social need for such expertise. The selection process for these students will promote the inclusion of underrepresented groups through targeted publicity and outreach efforts.\r\n\r\nResearch conducted by the students will lead to more effective approaches to robot perception, control, and interaction. The research also includes projects rooted in areas such as software engineering, security, and automated reasoning that are often overlooked by the contemporary robotics community, but crucially important for the deployment of reliable, trustworthy robotic systems. The research projects will be organized around the observation that \"Robots Change Everything.\" That is, every aspect of a computer system, from the design and engineering of its software, to its interactions with humans, to its core functions of perception and movement, is deeply impacted by the way robots must interact with the physical world.",
