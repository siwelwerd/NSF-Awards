 "awd_abstract_narration": "Whatcom Community College's project, \"STEM Excellence through Engagement in Collaboration, Research, and Scholarship (SEECRS),\" will provide scholarships for 36 low-income, academically talented scholarship awardees pursuing associate degrees in biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, geology, and physics. The project's leaders will deploy strategies that promote success in STEM, help students complete associate degrees, and promote transfer and completion at four-year institutions. Project activities will include STEM degree planning, faculty mentoring, and research and internship opportunities all united using a guided pathways approach. The program will help meet a national need to attract and provide access to students who do not typically pursue, persist in, or earn STEM degrees. It will serve as a model for other community colleges.\r\n\r\nThe SEECRS project aims to: (1) Improve students' STEM self-identity through a STEM Scholars Academy and course-based undergraduate research experiences; (2) Increase STEM recruitment and retention; (3) Increase the rate of STEM degree completion for WCC students; (4) Increase the transfer rate of STEM students to four-year universities; and (5) Develop an adaptable model for implementing a STEM guided pathways approach. Project goals are an 85% one-year retention rate, a 60% three-year graduation rate, and 75% three-year graduation or transfer rate. The project will address a knowledge gap by examining the extent to which a guided pathways approach provides a coordinated and supported STEM experience that increases student success and positively shifts students' STEM self-identity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThe STEM Excellence through Engagement in Collaboration, Research, and Scholarship (SEECRS) project at Whatcom Community College (WCC) sought to create coordinated systems level approaches to supporting under-resourced students as they navigate challenging STEM academic pathways. This effort brought together stakeholders from across the campus who previously had no formalized working relationships. In doing so we addressed systemic barriers and fostered a culture of collaboration and mentorship. We were able to: (a) create new opportunities for students to find a sense of belonging in STEM contexts, (b) build opportunities for students to engage in cognitively authentic approximations of practice that started with Course-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) in STEM and grew into the development of a showcase of student learning that now extends across campus, (c) development a STEM specific cohort building course that serves as a model for subsequent cornerstone experiences for Guided Pathways implementation, (d) implement a faculty mentoring model that provides learning opportunities for faculty and students alike. \n\n\n\n\nCentral to the SEECRS program was the idea that students need opportunities to build a sense of belonging in STEM. We provided multiple opportunities for students to construct robust STEM identities that were aligned with personal identities, supported by mentors, and strengthened by engaging in research. These opportunities were woven throughout the program. Participants were initially placed in a cohort building class that focused explicitly on identity development, with students asked to reflect on why they were pursuing a future in STEM, and how their intersecting personal identities were assets in STEM contexts. There was a focus in this class on creating a sense of community that validated students' efforts to create a future in STEM.\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, each scholar was paired with a faculty mentor to create supportive narratives and mentoring relationships that have proven important in discipline-specific identity construction. Scholars were also provided support for summer research opportunities at WCC and other regional university research laboratories. The programs focus on relationships proved vital in supporting students during, and after, the COVID-19 pandemic with many relying on personal networks established in SEECRS to support them through the social isolation that many experienced just as they matriculated to university or graduated into an uncertain workplace. \n\n\n\n\nWhile the SEECRS program establishes a strong model for supporting under-resourced students in pursuit of STEM at a 2-year community college, there are some elements that stand out as particularly informative. First, the members of the program team found that getting suitable applicant pools was a challenge. Many scholars the program was designed to support did not apply for the scholarship. We found that well-resourced students were the ones seeking out the financial support and mentorship that the grant provided. The research group worked with internal institutional research team members to develop a more targeted and informed applicant recruiting process. While all students had the opportunity to apply for the SEECRS program, finding a method to extend an invitation to those qualified for the program improved our applicant pool and helped our team recognize that some students who are capable of successful careers in STEM may not see themselves as qualified when compared to their better resourced peers.\n\n\n\n\nThe insights learned in how we build out cohorts of scholars are complimented by a shift in how we conceptualized our mentorship model. Initially we felt as if our mentoring model was uni-directional, with faculty imparting knowledge about STEM and higher education to mentees. By the fourth year of the program, faculty were sharing how they were also learning, gaining insight into students experiences from these relationships. Over the course of this program, mentors also recognized how working together to align mentorship approaches and to better understand STEM program requirements strengthened working relationships within and across departments. \n\n\n\n\nBeyond the outcomes achieved at the individual and cohort levels, the SEECRS program supported the systemization of CUREs at our campus. When SEECRS started, a few STEM faculty were exploring CUREs as elements of their courses. SEECRS scholars stepped into these research opportunities and helped build out more robust programs. The CUREs model includes a student showcase, where students research posters were shared with the campus population. Over the course of this grant, additional STEM and non-STEM disciplines joined the student showcase event as it grew, first as an expanded poster session, and now as a week-long celebration of student work that includes the performing arts, STEM, and humanities disciplines. \n\n\n\n\nThe SEECRS program has been impactful at the individual, cohort, and college levels, establishing a model for supporting students as they pursue a future in STEM by targeting opportunities for students to develop a sense of belonging in STEM disciplines. At the same time, SEECRS has improved our institution's ability to learn from our students and to support systematized research across our college.\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/22/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: TommasoAVannelli\n"
