 "awd_abstract_narration": "To meet the needs of the STEM workforce, as well as to continue to have an educated citizenry, undergraduate mathematics instruction must be effective for all segments of the population. This project will center on college algebra for students who are blind or visually impaired (BVI) and those who have other print disabilities. These populations have historically been underserved by college mathematics pedagogies. Investigators at Auburn University at Montgomery (AUM) have developed an innovative, evidence-based method of mathematics instruction and assessment, called Process-Driven Math (PDM), which substantially reduces barriers to participation for this population. The PDM method is based on an interactive auditory/verbal exchange of language between the student and a human intermediary who functions as both reader and scribe. For this project, AUM is partnering with Rice University, Auburn University, and Bridge Multimedia to investigate the benefits of PDM for teaching as well as assessing student learning. The research and development activities will focus specifically on college algebra courses, with related attention to algebra courses at schools for the blind. Those activities will be conducted at four institutions of higher education, including one two-year college, and three state schools for the blind. The project will be conducted by a multi-disciplinary team with expertise in mathematics, mathematics education, special education, education research, and mathematics accessibility.\r\n\r\nThe specific objective of the project is to further develop, test, refine, and prepare Process-Driven Math for scaling to improve mathematics learning for all students (students with and without disabilities; STEM and non-STEM majors). The enormity of syntax in algebraic expressions creates barriers (e.g., cognitive load) for many students with disabilities who access their mathematics by listening to it. The PDM method employs chunking, which reduces the cognitive load on working memory for mathematics students who are BVI. Inherent in the method are bases in Universal Design for Learning (providing various methods of engagement, representation, action, and expression) and User-Centered Design (engaging users to gain firsthand perspectives of their needs and desires in order to design and develop tools that will optimally meet their needs). The research will address questions related to students' mathematics self-efficacy, students' mathematical errors, students' perceptions of mathematics education, and how college faculty tend to approach teaching mathematics to students who are BVI. Using a mixed-methods approach with self-efficacy assessments, learning assessments, focus groups, and interviews, the study will consider variables such as: students' majors (STEM versus non-STEM), students' disability status demographics (students with disabilities [blind/visually impaired or other print disabilities] compared to students without disabilities), instruction using PDM vs. Nemeth (or other mathematical braille), and use of user-centered design.",
