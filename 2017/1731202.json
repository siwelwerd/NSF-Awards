The theme of the conference is Green Chemical Engineering and a special emphasis will be placed on Chemical Engineering yielding environmental benefits. The organizing committee, which consists of distinguished researchers with a broad range of skills in chemical engineering, will provide for a vibrant and diverse atmosphere that will foster exchange of ideas on research and education. It is anticipated that approximately 35 US-based researchers will receive partial travel support to attend this conference.\r\n\r\nGlobal challenges related to depletion of nonrenewable energy resources, climate change, environmental pollution, and population growth are creating a need for the development of green and sustainable manufacturing technologies. The three-and-half-day technical conference will feature invited plenary and keynote lectures, oral presentations, two plenary discussion panels, one forum and a poster session. The conference will emphasize not only the role of chemical engineers in the development of sustainable chemical and energy processes, but will also explore the frontiers of Chemical Engineering research and the fundamental principles that are needed to tackle these challenges. The US-based conference participants supported by this grant will have the opportunity to network with leading researchers from China and exchange ideas about the current status and future directions in research and education. They will benefit from state-of-the-art reviews and presentations by leading experts and by debating controversial points with their peers. The meeting will also provide an opportunity for interaction and cooperation among industrial and academic researchers.  The organizers plan to give special consideration to young or junior faculty members from U.S. Universities. Female and under-represented minorities will also receive special consideration. The conference will address global challenges with potentially significant benefits to society.",
