 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical abstract: \r\nThe National Science Foundation chooses the research that it funds based on Intellectual Merit (the potential to advance knowledge) and Broader Impacts (the potential to benefit society). Scientists recognize that the Broader Impact merit criteria as defined by NSF are essential for building the public support necessary for science to flourish. This project supports a website that will consolidate the wide range of broader impact activities in Condensed Matter Physics, a field that has had a transformative impact on society, leading to the development of transistors, computer memory and light emitting diodes (LEDs). By acting both as a resource and a repository, it will make the implementation of broader impact activities both more efficient and effective. The wide range of broader impact activities include scientific breakthroughs, patented inventions and start up companies made possible by NSF funding. It also features the work of scientists who are enthusiastic ambassadors for their field, giving public talks, increasing diversity, developing scientific curriculum for students and teachers, and inspiring the next generation to pursue careers in science. \r\n\r\nTechnical abstract: The Broader Impact merit criteria as defined by NSF are essential for building the public support necessary for science to flourish. Condensed matter physicists (CMP) have made transformative impacts on our society that are often invisible to the public. Communicating the societal benefits of this research is often a challenge because CMP consists of many independent research groups for whom effective engagement in the public arena is not necessarily a forte. Other broader impact activities, such as engaging K-12 students and teachers to increase scientific literacy and strengthen the workforce in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields, may be very effective; but are often isolated and short in duration. A recent workshop on broader impacts attended by PIs supported by the NSF Condensed Matter Physics Program, resulted in the formation of a committee to advance the broader impacts of the CMP community in ways that go beyond what an individual group can accomplish on its own. This project funds the first initiative from this committee, the creation of a website to increase the visibility of CMP and to make the implementation of broader impacts more efficient. The site has two sides, a public side for communication of exciting scientific discoveries and their enabling technologies to the broadest audience and a private side for communication about broader impact activities among condensed matter researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResource and Repository II aimed to improve and extend  www.funsizephysics.com, a website created to publicize exciting new developments in condensed matter physics to the tax-paying public.  The unique character of this website  is that it incorporates research descriptions written for a broad audience by the researchers themselves, unlike many other science blogs and websites.  The major changes we made were \n\n(i) to optimize the existing website: We did this by changing the look, by increasing the linkages between contributions and strengthening the section on the Fundamentals.  The newly redesigned home page is shown in figure 1.  THe Fundamentals section is exactly what it sounds like-it describes fundamental phenomena . \n\n  (ii) to present current and ongoing NSF-funded research to the public in ways that engage a broader audience of non-experts:  We did this by looking for both recently published research  as well as university or national lab press releases or write ups on the research, becasue the latter were  targeted for a more general audience.  Reaching out to the scientists involved, we suggested that they could start to write for Funsizephysics by using the more general press release.  We then helped shepard them through the porcess.  One of our first attempts at doing this was the article on Ferromagnetic Liquids Take Shape shown in figure 2 .   \n\n(iii)We are still working on making  the website a resource for NSF PIs to develop best practices for outreach activities to K-12 students and the general public.\n\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal was  to change how condensed matter physicists communicate with the public.
