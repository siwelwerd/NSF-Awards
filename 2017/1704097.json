 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless communication technologies in the ocean are critical to scientific, commercial, and national defense operations, and yet are still primitive, especially with respect to their data rates and reliability. This project develops new underwater acoustic communications and networking strategies to improve network efficiency in the harsh ocean environment, through underwater in-band full-duplex (IBFD) acoustic networks. The project creates a vertically integrated research experience for both undergraduate and graduate students by exposing them to interdisciplinary research. Through partnerships with local communities, the project investigators develop outreach programs to attract future students, especially those from minority and under-represented communities, to STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project is to develop innovative acoustic IBFD networks that contain: 1) spectrally efficient physical layer receivers capable of acoustic-specific self-interference cancellation, and 2) cross-layer protocols allowing enhanced network efficiency via IBFD. Guided by a cross-layer, interdisciplinary methodology, the project includes four research tasks: 1) Interference cancellation through acoustic-specific methods; 2) Prototyping of acoustic IBFD modems and networks, 3) Field experiments to evaluate acoustic IBFD communications and networking, and 4) Development of cross-layer simulation and optimization toolboxes. To maximize outcomes, this project leverages a range of existing instruments, resources, tools, and design experiences from the research team.",

Underwater acoustic networks have been widely discussed to support monitoring our marine environment, exploring the ocean resources, and responding to man-made disasters. The current acoustic networks suffer from low data rates and long network delays. This project examines the feasibility of in-band full-duplex (IBFD) acoustic communications for the underwater environment. IBFD communications, analogous to listening while talking in human conversations, supports concurrent transmissions between pairs of acoustic modems. This capability, if feasible, will significantly improve communication spectral efficiency and network throughput. The core challenge is how to suppress the self-interference caused by self-transmissions while the device listens for incoming signals.</p>\n<p>This project used an experimental-based approach. A series of field tests were conducted to systematically characterize the self-interference for different frequencies, source-receiver ranges, and transmitter directionalities. We analyzed experimental measurements and reported characteristics of the self-interference channel, including intensity profiles, coherence time, and delay span.</p>\n<p>Based on the reported channel characteristics, we developed a multi-layered recursive least squares (m-RLS) algorithm for time-varying channels as the ones in the self-interference link. The m-RLS estimator has multiple RLS units, each of which is used to estimate and eliminate the misadjustment of the previous layer. It is shown that the mean squared error (MSE) of the m-RLS estimation can be minimized by selecting the optimum number of layers. In highly dynamic environments such as the underwater acoustic channel, the m-RLS estimator has significant advantages over the traditional single-layered RLS one.</p>\n<p>Two major lake experiments with a pair of full-duplex nodes were deployed to collect IBFD acoustic measurements in 2021. These experiments were the first of their kind for acoustic IBFD.

Using the experimental data, we demonstrated IBFD acoustic communications at two ranges, 80 and 200 m in a lake environment. The developed received significantly outperformed the traditional method, where the interference-symbol interference and self-interference are addressed separately.</p>\n<p>We worked closely with the instigators from the University of Alabama to analyze experimental data and develop new algorithms.
