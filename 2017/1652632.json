 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research aims to understand the role of the movement of waves through the mucosa of the larynx (voice box) during phonation (the formation of sounds). The mucosal wave is the flow-induced elastic wave that propagates in the superficial layer of the vocal fold. Through the wave motion, it controls the glottal air pulses, which form the primary sound source of the voice. Yet, the fundamental questions of how vocal fold biomechanics and flow loading determine the mucosal wave properties, how the mucosal wave properties affect the glottal flow dynamics, and how the flow dynamics determine the voice outcome, remain elusive. This research aims to answer these questions through an integrated computational study. A high fidelity computational model will be developed that describes voice production in all its complexity, including neuro-muscular stimulation, glottal aerodynamics, flow induced vocal fold vibrations, acoustics and their highly complex nonlinear interactions. The computer model will be validated against experimental data that has previously been collected from in vivo canine specimens. The cause-effect relationship between the mucosal wave properties, glottal flow dynamics and voice outcome will be systematically and quantitatively studied through parametric studies.  This research will greatly advance the current state of knowledge regarding voice production, including how voice is controlled.  This knowledge will allow better understand how we use and control our voice. It will also enable development of diagnosis metrics for mucosal wave related voice diseases, determine the adjustments to the vocal folds to restore or improve a damaged voice, and predict the outcome of the adjustment. It can also help people who use their voices excessively (e.g. teachers, telemarketers) by providing them with the knowledge for how to efficiently use and control their voices, with the goal of avoiding damage. Strong collaborations with the University of Maine Communications & Speech Disorders Department will include the development of multidisciplinary courses focusing on speech and the introduction of the developed voice simulator into the educational and training program for future practitioners in speech pathology as well as education for speech disorder patients.\r\n\r\nThe mucosal wave propagates through the superficial layers of the vocal fold.  It is induced by flow and controls the movement of air through the glottis, which then produces the sound during speech and other forms of phonation.   More importantly, its strong interaction of this elastic wave with the glottal flow generates complex flow patterns and morphologies, such as dynamic flow separation, intraglottal vortices, vortex shedding, shear layer instabilities and transitions to turbulence. All of these factors significantly enhance the complexity inherent to the voice. The foundational questions that will be addressed focus on vocal fold biomechanics, glottal flow dynamics, and how the dynamics of the wave affect the production of the voice.  This will be addressed through an integrated multiphysics computational study.  The integrated educational component involves strong collaboration with the Department of Communication and Speech Disorders.  A multidisciplinary course will be developed to educate both speech pathologists and engineers on the underlying biomechanics of speech.  In addition, the simulation system developed will be directly employed in the training of speech pathologists and in the education of individuals suffering from speech disorders.",
