 "awd_abstract_narration": "Traits of species that evolved to serve one function but were later modified by evolution to serve a new function are known as exaptations. While there are many examples of such traits, the process by which they evolve is still poorly understood. This project will advance our understanding of how evolution reshapes the genetic blueprint of species traits to create new, novel innovations. Traits associated with gliding and flying, like feathers, are some of the most notable examples of exaptations. Unfortunately, most gliding species are already highly specialized, making it difficult to study the process by which exaptation has occurred. Geckos, which are the focus of this research project, are an exception. Geckos have evolved gliding structures multiple times from flaps of skin used in camouflage and there are multiple species that together represent the complete transition from general to highly specialized gliding ability. These evolutionary replicates allow the researchers to test whether exaptation of particular traits follows predictable patterns and also provide a means of measuring how form and function interact to affect rates of evolution. This research will provide research training to undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoc in genetic, morphological, bioinformatic, and image analysis methods. The public also will be engaged by developing an educational program at the Sam Noble Museum that will feature age-appropriate information and learning activities related to gliding in geckos.\r\n\r\nThis research will determine the consequences of gliding-associated exaptations of geckos within a context of evolutionary relationships. Two primary research questions will be addressed: (1) whether gliding structures represent exaptations that evolve in a predictable way, and (2) whether these traits or the associated functional shift represent key innovations leading to shifts in the rate of evolution in the affected clades. The PIs will address these questions by combining field, laboratory, and computational approaches. Fully resolved evolutionary trees will be estimated for gliding geckos and related lineages. Structural variation in gliding and non-gliding geckos will be surveyed using a combination of external observation, diceCT, and histology. Developmental similarities among gliding taxa will be assessed by analyzing embryonic morphology and developmental gene expression patterns in a set of exemplar taxa. Relative cryptic and gliding performance values will be measured by both observing live animals and by experimenting with models to document the functional shift from camouflage to gliding. Phylogenetic comparative analyses will be employed to identify patterns of phenotypic and lineage diversification and their relationships to morphological and functional change in this group. A significant volume of new DNA sequence data; morphological data, including numerous full-body CT scans; and performance data will be produced and be of broad interest and use to the scientific community.",

This evolutionary adaptation for non-powered aerial locomotion in geckos is believed to be an example of an exaptation, or a trait that originated with one function but was later co-opted for a new function. For geckos capable of gliding, it is hypothesized that extra flaps of skin evolved originally for crypsis or obscuring the outline of an animal from potential predators in the wild. Unfortunately, for many examples of exaptations, the functional and developmental mechanisms that have led to the evolution of such significant phenotypic changes remain poorly understood. To address these questions, we employed an integrative approach that brought together scientists with backgrounds in gecko systematics, genomics, vertebrate function and kinematics, developmental genetics, experimental ecology, phylogenetics, and biodiversity science to study the repeated evolution of gliding within geckos. The major objectives of the study were to determine whether gliding structures represent an exaptation that evolves in predictable ways and whether the independent evolution of gliding capacity represents a key innovation that led to shifts in the tempo of evolutionary change in the respective gecko lineages.</p>\n<p>Although impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, a large international research expedition was supported by this grant, aimed at collecting relevant functional data critical for testing hypotheses of functional performance of crypsis versus gliding among gliding and non-gliding gecko species in the Philippines in Southeast Asia. Gliding and crypsis performance, and morphological and ecological information, was collected in the field for several target gliding and non-gliding species of geckos. The project will result in the first high-quality genome assemblies for multiple gliding and non-gliding gecko species. Furthermore, to explore function and crypsis as it relates to gliding-associated traits, we developed true-to-life 3D models of gliding and non-gliding gecko species to measure relative cryptic and gliding performance with both animals in the wild in Southeast Asia and through designed experiments with 3D models of focal species. To date, research supported by this award has resulted in 26 peer-reviewed publications and new educational and technology tools and resources. Ongoing analyses of whole genome, morphological, and functional data from natural experiments, will test hypothesized functional and developmental mechanisms implicated in the evolution of gliding in geckos.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Broader Impacts</em></strong><strong>.</strong> Research expeditions conducted in the Philippines involved five research faculty from three US Universities, one staff curator and one collection manager from the Sam Noble Museum, one MS and three PhD graduate students, and three undergraduate students from the US. Two of the undergraduate students from OU went on to pursue graduate degrees, and one secured a Fulbright Fellowship for an international research project in the Philippines, because of their exposure to international field research experiences supported by the grant. International expeditions also resulted in the collection of nearly 400 vouchered amphibian, reptile, and invertebrate specimens and associated datasets from multiple sites in the northern Philippines, including nine distinct species of geckos (two of which are new, undescribed taxa).</p>\n<p>Significant, biological and evolutionary themed education, technology, and information resource tools resulted from this project. Multi-year biodiversity science Mobile Museum Visit programming was carried out with a Title I elementary school in Norman Oklahoma and a novel education outreach initiative (ArtEDGE) was co-led in partnership with the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art at the University of Oklahoma. Digital 3D models resulting from this project have been made publicly accessible via online repositories. These true-to-life 3D models of gliding and non-gliding gecko species have been used in ongoing research and outreach initiatives, and the models collectively have been downloaded and viewed more than 6,000 and 23,000 times, respectively, to date. In partnership with the Sam Noble Museum, the project completed the production of a mobile education Discovery Kit, entitled ?Geckos on the Go.? The education kit was developed for K12 classrooms to engage students early in school and assist K12 teachers in improving STEM education and interest in an EPSCoR state. The kit is now available to be checked out for use in classrooms around Oklahoma and includes a curriculum of activities designed to meet the Oklahoma Academic Standards for Science (OASS) and Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Field-based implementation of camera trap experiments for local predation pressure studies were implemented as research experiences in the undergraduate classroom for two upper division University of Oklahoma courses. Finally, the project, in partnership with the NSF INTERN supplement program, supported a non-academic professional internship with the Oklahoma City Zoo for a Ph.D. graduate student, resulting in the establishment of the state?s first conservation headstart program for the Texas horned lizard, a species of conservation concern. The conservation program has gone on to support the ongoing thesis research of three additional Master?s graduate students at OU.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/02/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Cameron&nbsp;D&nbsp;Siler</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1657648/1657648_10485641_1698944409543_IMG_0831--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1657648/1657648_10485641_1698944409543_IMG_0831--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"International Expedition to Southeast Asia\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1657648/1657648_10485641_1698944409543_IMG_0831--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"International Expedition to Southeast Asia\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">International expedition to the northern Philippines in Southeast Asia.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Cameron D.
