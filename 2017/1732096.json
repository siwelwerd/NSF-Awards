 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will involve technique development and exploratory research to examine the mechanism and dynamics of gas bubble formation at electrode interfaces and their effects on aqueous-phase electrolysis and photoelectrochemical reactions related to solar fuel production.  State-of-the-art x-ray and optical scattering techniques will be combined with data analytic methods and novel catalyst synthesis techniques to relate modes of bubble evolution to catalytic activity at unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution. The resulting understanding will aid in optimizing the design of hierarchically structured photocatalytic devices for efficient conversion of abundant resources such as water and carbon dioxide to solar fuels needed for a sustainable energy future. \r\n \r\nThe research will utilize high speed microscopy and scattering experiments to develop a statistical understanding of electrolytic and photolytic bubble evolution. X-ray microscopy data will be used to develop a model for bubble growth, coalescence, and detachment from continuous and patterned electrocatalytic interfaces. This model will inform the understanding of measurements of correlations between gas bubbles evolving from electrodes using image analysis from microscopy measurements and light scattering measurements. This research aims to develop a methodological approach for studying catalysis via reciprocal space measurements on heuristic systems such as TiO2 photocatalysts and Pt electrocatalysts on Si. The ultimate goal is to utilize bubble correlation spectroscopy as a general technique in combination with precision synthesis of catalyst structures to minimize the impact of bubble interference on solar fuels catalysis.  In addition to advancing critical sustainable fuels technology, the project will provide undergraduate and graduate students with cross-disciplinary training in advanced spectroscopic methods, data analysis techniques, and catalyst synthesis, as well as providing a highly interdisciplinary environment for high school and undergraduate students to learn how to work in a team to advance scientific knowledge.",

The objective of this project funded by this NSF EAGER award was to develop new characterization methods to study the role that the structure of electrocatalytic and photocatalytic interfaces on conversion efficiency and catalytic activity when the products of the reaction are gas bubbles. The presence of bubbles on the surface influence the efficiency of energy conversion by blocking active surface area and generating unwanted reflection.  However, the dynamical behavior of bubble evolution is dependent on the concerted catalytic activity underneath and the interactions of neighboring bubbles at the interface. Bubble evolution and the effects on catalysis should be considered as a collective, statistical phenomenon when describing the kinetic effects on extended or structured electrocatalytic and photocatalytic structures. Specifically, the aim was to develop an approach that can relate measurements of the collective modes of bubble evolution to a quantitative measure of catalytic activity.\n\nIn the period of funding, we focused on building our capabilities for measuring and analyzing the operando dynamics of electrocatalytic interfaces and photoelectrodes.  We made significant progress along a number of directions relevant to the intellectual merit of the proposed work.  We have built a specialized, high-speed microscope for imaging bubble evolution dynamics at rates corresponding to the current densities of interest to solar-to-fuels applications (1-100mA cm-2). We also integrated a CNC router/mill to build application-specific electrochemical cells for in situ experiments.  This allows us to study the dynamics on a wide range of electrochemical and photoelectrochemical interfaces.  We have also developed a machine-learning approach to analyzing the movies of these experiments to track the interactions and coalescence dynamics between bubbles on the surface in order to develop a model to describe the relationship between current density and surface bubble presence.  We will continue these efforts to explore the kinetics of gas evolution on textured surfaces, nanostructured semiconductor-electrocatalyst interfaces, and structured semiconductor photoelectrodes like silicon microwire photocathodes. \n\nThe broader impacts of this work include the training of graduate students in computer-aided design for working with the CNC mill and Python programming for analyzing data.  The application of the knowledge generated by this work can influence the design of technologies relevant to solar energy conversion and the displacement of fossil fuel use.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/31/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert H Coridan"
