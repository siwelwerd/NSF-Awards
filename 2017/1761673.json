This data will serve as a key resource for understanding how such large and\u00a0sustained flooding and rainfall events could have occurred, and how critical infrastructures should be designed. Further, HydroShare is used by over 130 institutions, and having the information related to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma centrally available will have allow research related to these events to be more easily conducted, as well as facilitate creative and unanticipated use of this data.",
