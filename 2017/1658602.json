 "awd_abstract_narration": "Transportation systems are undergoing a major restructuring to introduce the next generation of electrified and autonomous vehicles. These vehicles are less energy-intensive, require less maintenance, and make driving more convenient. This international research experience for students (IRES) project intends to provide a strong fundamental background, practical hands-on research experience, and exposure to a transnational research environment on next generation electrified and autonomous transportation systems to U.S. undergraduate and graduate students. Dr. Alireza Khaligh from the University of Maryland at College Park (UMD) will lead 15 American undergraduate students as they conduct eight weeks of research at Istanbul Technical University (ITU) from 2017 to 2019. The program will enhance the students practical and theoretical understanding of power electronics, motor drives, controls, energy storage systems, power management, autonomous vehicles, and sustainable transportation.\r\n\r\nThis three-year U.S.-Turkey IRES program will engage American undergraduate and graduate students in an eight-week intensive, summer research experience focused on autonomous and electrified transportation systems. It is intended to nurture a globally engaged STEM workforce to meet the emerging needs of U.S. automotive and energy industries by educating and exposing young and talented students to a transnational research. Students will benefit from an international research and educational experience at a critical stage in their careers. They will receive high quality mentorship by world-renowned experts. The integration of activities for faculty, undergraduate and graduate students from ITU and UMD is expected to sustain long-term collaborations between institutions. Special efforts will be made to recruit talented students from underrepresented groups and institutions with limited research opportunities.\r\n",
