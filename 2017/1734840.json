 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation project will address the complex ways in which the lateral, or riverbank, boundaries of a river impact the river's form. This includes how tributaries and hillslope erosion processes contribute sediment, and how laterally confining features such as roads, railroads, and bridge abutments alter both sediment contributions and channel morphology by modifying the flow regime of the river, thus altering the effectiveness of the river to erode or deposit material. This project will also provide new insights into how river shape and form is organized in terms of the distribution of sediment type, as well as channel width and depth in the downstream direction. The student will focus on investigating the role of tributaries and hillslope erosion processes as sources of additional sediment, and riverbank constrictions as locations where human activity has altered the natural river flow, often degrading habitat for culturally and environmentally important aquatic and riparian species. The findings of this project will contribute to the understanding of how rivers respond to changing lateral conditions. This information can be used in river restoration projects to enhance the health of river ecosystems.  Additionally, the information gained from the research has the potential to inform future construction along rivers by providing a more thorough understanding of the importance of the link between a river and its floodplain. The methodologic approach to this project is designed to be low-cost and widely accessible, with the objective of showing the wide applicability of this approach to river conservation and restoration efforts across the country. As a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement award, this project will also provide support to enable a promising young scholar to establish a research career.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on deepening the \"sediment links\" concept. This theoretical approach frames river tributaries as sediment links, creating a series of distinct river sections, defined by local changes in channel slope and gravel size. The student proposes that lateral channel constrictions can be thought of as \"sediment breaks\" within this context, as places where the increase in shear stress at the channel bottom, due to a lack of floodplain access during high-flow events, will result in a similar morphologic change as sediment links, but due to an increase in erosion, rather than a surplus of supply. The methods used in this project research include the use of a small unmanned aerial system as well as underwater photography to generate primary data which will be used to quantify particle size distributions, channel depth, and channel width. Existing aerial imagery and LiDAR data will be used to classify channel constriction severity using accepted definitions. The data sources will be used to address several research questions relating the severity of channel constriction to the magnitude of departure in channel morphology variables from a natural control reach. The research questions will also further analyze the relationship between tributaries and local changes in channel morphology and patterns of water surface roughness and velocity vectors. This research will be conducted along the Rogue River in Southern Oregon, USA but its findings will be broadly applicable in other river systems.",

The premise of the study is that depending on the process a channel could get wider or narrower, the size of the rocks larger or smaller, and the slope steeper or gentler. And, depending on the location, this could have detrimental impacts on habitat for endangered and threatened species. This research examined approximately 200 kilometers of a river in Southern Oregon, USA to explore these questions. We found that the natural processes and human activity that we predicted would change the shape of the river did have an impact in a variety of physical properties of the river (such as width, depth, and slope). However, the relationship between the variables was complicated. Much of the complication we attribute to the historic impact of human activity including the presence of (no removed) dams, and a legacy of mining.In the context of natural processes, our findings suggest that time plays an important role in whether or not there is physical evidence of a change in how the channel looks. For example, a landslide may have a large impact on channel form today even though it occurred ten to hundreds of years ago, if not longer. This represents what we call a time-less signal; one where a single event creates a lasting change to the channel. On the other hand, a tributary may deliver sediment to the main channel during every flood event. However, depending on the amount of water in the main channel, this contribution of new gravels may or may not create a quantifiable change in the shape of the channel; what we call a time-bound signal.Human activity has a more complicated impact on channel form because it is so hard to separate what is influencing the channel today (for example, a levee with a road on it) from what has happened in the past (mining and dam construction). In some locations, it is very clear that human activity has done things like decrease the width of the channel. In others, it is less clearly. Overall, the most notable impact of human activity is the decrease in variability in channel form. What we mean is that in the more natural portions of the river, the depth, width, and slope all change frequently as you travel downstream. Not always by very much, but some. In the areas where the floodplain is dominated by human activity these same variables do not change very much as you travel downstream.This work has improved our understanding of how rivers change as they move downstream. These include the conceptual models of downstream hydraulic geometry and the sediment links theory. In addition, it is possible that this work may lead to more efficient river restoration.
