 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) is a cornerstone of data infrastructure for social science research in the United States. The study has used a series of surveys to gather information on US families since 1968. Children and grandchildren from the original PSID families now participate as well; the result is data that follows families through several generations. The long time span allows scientific investigation of questions about how people and families grow and change over time. This includes the study of economic outcomes such as employment, income, and wealth, research on how early life experiences affect employment and health in adulthood, research on how U.S. families cope with the needs of aging family members, and work that examines how key economic variables like consumption and employment are affected by broader businesses cycles and unanticipated events. The research team will collect two new waves of data, will expand data collection focused on young adults and on better measures of internet use and employer characteristics, will evaluate pilot results of using web-based tools to administer the survey, and will expand its data collection efforts to include recent immigrant families to study questions about how immigrant families assimilate into the United States. The project promotes the national interest by maintaining U.S. leadership in science, by making data available to a broad community of researchers interested in understanding American families, and by providing necessary data to evaluate the long-term impacts of past policy decisions at the federal, state and local levels of government. \r\n\r\nThe PSID is the world's longest running household panel survey. Through its long-term measures of economic and social well being, the study allows researchers and policy analysts to investigate the dynamism inherent in social and behavioral process. The long panel, genealogical design, and broad content provide scientists a unique and powerful opportunity to study change within the same family over decades. Collecting additional waves of data from the PSID families contributes to scientific understanding of the dynamics of economic and social behavior. The extended time series of data supports new and systematic investigation of a myriad of questions in the full range of scientific disciplines that study how humans grow and change over the life cycle. This includes the study of economic outcomes (for example, the changes that occur across business cycles such as the Great Recession and changes in response to increased international economic competition), the study of intergenerational transmission of wealth and income, and the study of how income and health in adulthood and old age depend on early-life experiences. Consistent measures over time are important for accurately estimating the dynamics of these behaviors. Gathering data from the same families over a long time period improves the precision of the measurement as multiple measures are collected within the same families as well as from multiple families over a period of decades. The investigators will carry out numerous innovations and enhancements while maintaining core data collection for comparability. This includes new content on internet usage, job search behavior, characteristics of daily employment and of employers and more data collection from young adults. It also includes adding families to the study who have emigrated to the U.S. since 1997; linkages to valuable administrative data; and implementation and evaluation of web-based delivery of the core survey. The PSID creates broader impacts in many ways. It is used by an interdisciplinary community and is increasingly important in health research. The data archive is used to inform public policy; at least nine federal agencies use PSID data. The PSID is also an important resource for teaching and learning. The data are free and publicly available, and are widely used by graduate and undergraduate students. The award funds a number of web-based outreach activities that will make the PSID an even more valuable tool for teaching and learning.",
