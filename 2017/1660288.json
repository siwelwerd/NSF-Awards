NSF support will facilitate the participation of 18 early-career cartographers from the U.S. As has been demonstrated in follow-up reports from Americans who have been supported with previous travel grants to other major international meetings, such forums offer numerous opportunities for meeting professional colleagues from many other nations, for hearing ideas and information from a broad range of different perspectives, and for participating in discussions that frequently result in successful research collaborations.\r\n\r\nIn cartography as in many other scientific fields, advances in research and education increasingly rely on the development of international collaborations that bring together skilled scholars and educators from many different nations. International contacts and collaborations develop through many different means, but one of the most successful has been the biennial meetings of the International Cartographic Association (ICA). The ICA has been the primary international forum for cartographic research since 1959, and it currently involves over 80 countries. Early-career scholars seeking travel support will be expected to submit their papers for publication in the conference proceedings and will be presenting papers at the conference. In addition to making presentations, American participants at the ICC are encouraged to become involved in the work of ICA commissions and working groups, thereby furthering their potential to build contact networks and be exposed to new ideas on the cutting edge of contemporary cartography and geographic information science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe NSF grant supported 13 US early career scholars for $1,000 each for a total of $13,000 to present a paper and/or poster at the 28th International Cartographic Conference in Washington DC, USA from 2-7 July 2017.  The NSF grant also supported three early career scholars (up to a maximum of $2,000 each) for a total of $5,000 to present a paper and/or poster at the 29th International Cartographic Conference and 18th General Assembly in Tokyo, Japan from 15-20 July 2019.  All NSF funds have thus been spent.\n\n \n\nEarly career scholars are students and those, who completed their Ph.D. degree within the last 5 years.  In addition to publishing in the conference proceedings and presenting a paper, early career scholars met and exchanged ideas with a wide variety of foreign colleagues and reported a wide range of benefits to their careers.  Their scholarly achievements in terms of publications of peer-reviewed articles and the writing of grant proposals influenced by their ICC participation have been impressive.  All early career scholars made important international collaborations and some included conference material into their teaching.  ICC participation provided new ideas for some early career scholars? thesis and dissertation research and facilitated the progress towards tenure and promotion.  For maturing and mature U.S. scholars, who also participated at the Washington DC and Tokyo ICCs, but were not funded by this NSF grant, ICC experience has been an important influence on their careers as leaders in the U.S. cartographic research community and has provided a mechanism for international leadership.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe evidence of return from this NSF grant and its impact on research and scholarly development is compelling in research innovation and on long-term development of research leaders in cartography.  Without listing the records of the early career, maturing, and mature scholars that resulted from the ICC participation, one is convinced that with about 30-40 U.S. scholars attending the ICC every two years, the impact on the field is significant.  Current ICA Commissions address cutting-edge research and participation in the ICC allows American scholars to be a part of this leading research.  The United States National Committee (USNC) to the International Cartographic Association (ICA) works hard to draw in new participation, especially among early career scholars and under-represented groups (women, ethnic minorities, and persons with disabilities) and foster their development as the future leaders in research and international dissemination of cartographic information.\n\n \n\nSummary of Outcomes\n\nThe importance of early ICC attendance on cartographic research and leadership among United States scholars is significant and compelling.  Of the total of 31 early career scholars, who attended the Washington DC ICC in 2017 (13 early career scholars supported from this grant plus 18 early career scholars reimbursed from left-over funds from a previous NSF grant with the award number: 1461597), 29 attended an ICC for the first time, one had previously attended one other ICC, and one had previously attended two other ICC?s.  The record of these 31 early career scholars in terms of publications, grant proposals, collaborations, etc. that resulted (directly or indirectly) from the Washington DC ICC participation is truly impressive.  In total, this record includes: 31 papers published in the Washington DC ICC proceedings, 51 papers published or forthcoming in peer-reviewed journals, two book chapters published, and one National Science Foundation (NSF) grant awarded.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/08/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Leitner"
