 "awd_abstract_narration": "This RCN-UBE network project seeks to increase opportunities for undergraduate students to develop quantitative skills and participate in high-throughput discovery research. This network addresses the need to educate undergraduates, graduate students, researchers, and faculty in massively-parallel and high-throughput (HT) approaches that are becoming increasingly common in research and industry. Educators committed to increasing exposure of students to new techniques and datasets will work with researchers to develop educational case studies using a series of resources developed by experts in high-throughput research and case-based learning. Researchers using HT techniques will learn at the workshops from experts in academia and industry. This collaboration will empower faculty to develop and implement case HT studies in undergraduate education and promote applied quantitative skills including descriptive statistics and use of online 'big data' databases and tools. The network will disseminate these case studies broadly and work with other RCN-UBE programs to integrate the resources created in STEM courses and curricula across the country and world.\r\n\r\nThe network team will use a series of workshop meetings to bring together the STEM education community, with a focus on faculty from diverse institutions and researchers using or learning HT approaches. The workshops will foster the exchange of ideas and increase awareness of the importance of HT techniques in scientific research and the STEM education community. This research and educational network includes primarily undergraduate institutions, early career teaching faculty, and national and international researchers to create impactful educational materials to demonstrate the transformative power of HT approaches and teach underlying quantitative skills. The resulting inquiry-based case studies will engage students in authentic research and better train future scientists and engineers for jobs in modern molecular biology. Undergraduate students will analyze novel data sets and develop quantitative skills, while network participants will enhance their research and teaching through provided HT technical workshops and the development of case studies with teams of network-trained faculty and postdoctoral \"Case Fellows\". This project provides training opportunities for a diverse group of undergraduates, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, researchers, and educators. The products of the HITS RCN-UBE will be widely disseminated and available on the web to encourage faculty to adopt, adapt, assess, improve and create case studies that demystify high-throughput approaches and data sets.\r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO), Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources (EHR), Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/). This project is also co-funded by the Division Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) in the BIO directorate.",

The High-throughput Discovery Science &amp; Inquiry-based Case Studies for Today's Students (HITS) Research Coordination Network in Undergraduate Biology Education (RCN-UBE) aimed to improve students' quantitative skills and participation in high-throughput discovery. Educators worked with researchers to create case studies that explain high-throughput approaches and promote discovery science, reinforcing STEM concepts and quantitative skills in the college classroom. Five annual workshops, a virtual community with over one hundred participants, and online resources promoted high-throughput research and its integration into the classroom. The HITS network created a consortium of thirty-eight institutions committed to implementing these educational tools in biology courses and curricula. The network also raised awareness of the opportunities to engage students in learning about and designing high-throughput approaches. The collaborations between researchers, institutes, companies, and educators resulted in a dozen case studies and articles describing the network and implementation of high-throughput case studies and spinoff projects. Aware of the potential and widespread use of high-throughput approaches, HITS community members continue to develop lessons and resources to bring cutting-edge technologies to various courses and institutions, impacting undergraduate and graduate education.</span></span></span></p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/28/2023<br>\nModified by: Carlos&nbsp;Goller</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1730317/1730317_10505749_1701060794931_HITS_RCN_logic_model_2023--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1730317/1730317_10505749_1701060794931_HITS_RCN_logic_model_2023--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"HITS Logic Model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1730317/1730317_10505749_1701060794931_HITS_RCN_logic_model_2023--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"HITS Logic Model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Logic Model for HITS Project</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carlos C.
