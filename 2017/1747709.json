 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part I\r\n\r\nAlthough indigenous peoples are internationally known as \"water protectors\", indigenous voices and perspectives are sparse in hydrology, where only a handful of academic scholars represent a small fraction of the broad spectrum of indigenous cultures and tribal nations in the United States. Though few in number, these indigenous scientists play a key role in bridging the communities of western scientific research and indigenous knowledge. These scholars have, individually, explored this bridging role through their own research and education activities, but larger questions remain unresolved and require synthesis efforts. To this end, the project centers on a symposium of scholars designed to formulate a vision for hydrology research and education centered on Native American perspectives and indigenous water knowledge. Such a meeting has never taken place before. The proposed ?Symposium on Indigenous Water Knowledge and Hydrologic Science? will be held at the Salish Kootenai College in Pablo, MT during August 2018. Symposium objectives include: 1) defining research and education priorities in the hydrologic sciences that are relevant to indigenous peoples in a rapidly changing world; 2) establishing a network of indigenous hydrologists, other scholars, and traditional knowledge holders of water; and 3) identifying educational needs and tools to support integration of indigenous perspectives in hydrology. A key long-term goal of this project is to build and maintain a scholarly community that is simultaneously connected to the cutting edge of hydrology and related disciplines and firmly rooted to indigenous knowledge and pressing water-related issues of tribes today.\r\n\r\nPart II\r\n\r\nThe \"Symposium on Indigenous Water Knowledge and Hydrologic Science\" will bring together hydrologists and others in August 2018 at Salish Kootenai College in Pablo, MT to address key questions regarding the water-related research and education needs of tribal communities that can be answered with solutions rooted in indigenous knowledge systems. The symposium will also address the role of indigenous knowledge in crosscutting, water-related research. Participants will develop a vision and action plan for integrating indigenous perspectives and knowledge into hydrologic science and related disciplines.  Symposium organizers and participants are well equipped and ideally positioned to address these topics and to bridge indigenous communities with each other in a collaborative manner. The project has implications for broadening participation of Native Americans in hydrology and related disciplines.  Approximately 1000 Native American hold degrees at any level in the geosciences (including Earth, atmospheric and ocean sciences) and Native American hydrologists constitute a small fraction of this number. Tribal colleges and minority serving organizations work in a variety of ways to increase representation of Native American hydrologists in the workforce and academia, but indigenous voices remain few. The symposium will include discussions of culturally responsive education materials and specific opportunities for participants to provide leadership in areas related to professional development of Native American hydrologists. The symposium will thus enhance and support efforts to increase the number of Native Americans pursuing degrees in hydrology and related fields. Student participants will be actively engaged to foster involvement and enthusiasm in the upcoming generation of indigenous hydrologists. Symposium participants will include faculty from research institutions as well as tribal colleges, with tribal college faculty making up  25%-30% of participants.",

The major goals of this grant were to integrate Native American perspectives and Indigenous knowledge into hydrology research and education; and build and maintain a scholarly community that is connected to the cutting edge of hydrology and related disciplines and firmly rooted to Indigenous knowledge and pressing water-related issues of tribes today.&nbsp; Leading up to the planned Symposium, the project team began to build a network by connecting with Indigenous hydroscientists, students, tribal environmental professionals and tribal water protectors. The project team developed a website to provide key information about the Symposium at <a href=\"https://nativehydro.weebly.com/\">https://nativehydro.weebly.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>The NSF-funded Symposium was held 1-4, August 2018 at Salish Kootenai College (<a href=\"http://www.skc.edu\">www.skc.edu</a>) in Pablo, MT to discuss Indigenous perspectives on water, water-related challenges, best practices, and Indigenous participation in academic hydrologic sciences. The <em>?Water in the Native World: The intersection of hydrology and traditional knowledge?</em> Symposium<em> </em>gathered 36 indigenous researchers, practitioners, community activists, elders and allies at the tribal college located on the Flathead Indian Reservation. Holding the Symposium on the Flathead Indian Reservation provided a first-hand learning experience on an excellent tribal case study on how one tribe approaches education and tribal management of tribal waters. Breakout groups discussed how to bring Indigenous views and priorities into scientific discourse and decision-making. A visioning exercise encouraged participants to contemplate the role of a scholarly network in achieving these goals. The network was named ?Native Hydro Network.?<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>The Symposium was preceded by a special issue of the <em>Journal of Contemporary Water and Education</em> (<a href=\"http://ucowr.org/journal-issue-archives/163\">http://ucowr.org/journal-issue-archives/163</a>) focusing on tribal perspectives in water resources. Several participants and members of the Native Hydro Network published their work in this inaugural issue including topics of water quality disparities, climate change, tribal perspectives, and water management. Two webinars were held highlighting the papers and nearly 100 virtual attendees joined. A second special issue focusing on tribal waters for the <em>Journal of Contemporary Water and Education</em> will be published in April 2020 entitled ?Water in the Native World.? These two special issues are critical to not only compiling cutting edge hydrology research conducted in tribal communities but also filling a large research gap in this area.</p>\n<p>To share highlights of the Symposium and water challenges facing Indigenous peoples, a 5 minute video was produced. This video is an outreach and science communication tool to engage tribal communities as well as scholars and others who might be unaware of such challenges. The video aims to consider how Indigenous knowledge contributes to hydrology and what unique research questions Indigenous hydrologists are poised to address (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFXnrGt0OxQ\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFXnrGt0OxQ</a>).</p>\n<p>The project built a strong Indigenous network at the American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting by connecting with Indigenous scientists and inviting Indigenous knowledge holders to attend and present. The strengthening of this network began in 2017 by hosting a session entitled ?Native Science: How Indigenous Perspectives Inform Environmental Science and Policy.? This momentum continued in 2018 and 2019 and will continue to expand beyond the life of this project. Key products from Indigenous network development include an opinion piece in 2018 entitled ?In Honor of Native American Heritage Month: A Challenge to AGU to Include Indigenous Perspectives in Science?

The Symposium findings were summarized and the Gold King Mine Spill on the Navajo Nation was discussed.
