 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most critical infrastructures have evolved into complex systems comprising large numbers of interacting elements. These interactions result in the spread of disruptions, such as delays, from one part of the system to another, and even from one infrastructure to another. Effective tools for the analysis and control of real-world infrastructures need to account for the underlying dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe key insight in this research is that by learning data-driven models of infrastructure networks, and using these models to determine dynamics-aware recovery algorithms, we can greatly improve the resilience of critical infrastructure networks. We propose to address these challenges by:\r\n1.\tLearning and validating scalable representations of real systems from data. By considering continuous states, and by modeling the time-varying nature of connectivity as switching between network topologies, we propose to obtain a class of switched linear system models. Multilayer network models will be developed to account for airline networks, and multimodal systems.\r\n2.\tCharacterizing resilience, both for the system as a whole, and in terms of individual nodes (e.g., susceptibility to network delays). The metrics to evaluate resilience will encompass both steady-state and transient behavior.\r\n3.\tUsing the identified models to design optimal control algorithms that can enable recovery from disruptions, taking into account network dynamics, the uncertainty in operating environments, and the costs of decisions to restore service at various levels, at various times.\r\n\r\nThe results of the research will be validated using operational data, thereby yielding a set of tools for system diagnostics, analysis, and recovery. \r\n\r\nImproving and maintaining critical infrastructures are among the grand challenges identified by the National Academy of Engineering. The proposed research will develop techniques grounded in network science, machine learning, and systems and control theory in order to effectively design and operate infrastructures. The development of common frameworks and abstractions for these infrastructures will enable the study of their interdependencies. With the rapid growth of intelligent infrastructures, the proposed research will benefit society, and also help attract and train the next generation of engineering professionals.",

Our methods provide a complementary metric to conventional aviation delay benchmarks, and help quantify off-nominal system performance.

We addressed the challenges encountered in complex queuing networks (for example, including other congestion hot-spots such as runway crossing queues, as well as departure fixes in the terminal airspace) in order to develop computationally tractable optimal control algorithms, to evaluate the impacts of uncertainty on airport surface traffic management, and to achieve the robust control of arrivals into queuing networks.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Empirical approaches for analyzing the equity of congestion pricing schemes: </strong></em>The final research thrust dealt with road transportation in congested urban areas. Although congestion pricing is believed to effectively regulate traffic, its practical implementation has often been held back by concerns that it disproportionately and adversely impacts low-income groups. We conducted one of the first empirical analyses of the equity impacts of congestion pricing schemes. We analyzed the impacts of two price increases to the congestion charge on different income groups in Central London, making use of the Synthetic Control method and data from the UK National Travel Survey. Our findings estimate that the highest income earners contributed to more of the revenue than the lowest income earners, making the scheme progressive in the scale of its equity impact. Although high-income travelers appeared to drop more charge-eligible trips as the price increased, their total trips to Central London did not decrease, suggesting that they were able to substitute with nonchargeable modes of travel. By contrast, low-income travelers saw large declines across both chargeable and non-chargeable modes, revealing a much lower rate of substitution. Finally, our analysis illustrated that as the congestion charge continued to increase over time, the charge-eligible trips that remained were increasingly inelastic and less responsive to the price increases. These findings highlight an important equity consideration that must be addressed with income specific policies such as rebates or tax credits.</p>\n<!-- @font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-469750017 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; \tmso-font-kerning:1.0pt; \tmso-ligatures:standardcontextual;}p \t{mso-style-noshow:yes; \tmso-style-priority:99; \tmso-margin-top-alt:auto; \tmargin-right:0in; \tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; \tmargin-left:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} --><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/03/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Hamsa&nbsp;Balakrishnan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
