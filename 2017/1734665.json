 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports empirical research to examine the planning of bikeshare (i.e., bicycle-sharing) systems in the United States, focusing on Philadelphia (PA), Austin (TX), and Oakland (CA). Bikeshare systems are typically partnerships between municipalities and provider firms in which a network of automatic docking stations is available to the public on a subscription basis. They are one of the fastest-growing transportation technologies in America, with currently over 200 systems in operation or planned, and they have become enormously popular as part of a sustainable urban development strategy. However, their users are disproportionately white and affluent, even in diverse cities. The goal of this project is to explain these disparities through an analysis of the socio-spatial shaping of bikeshare systems by a network of actors; the network includes contracting firms, planners, city officials, and consultants. The results of this project will have substantial policy relevance for urban planning, public administration, and transportation engineering. Research products include the presentation of findings at academic and professional conferences and to the public at large, publication of findings in key peer-reviewed journals and a monograph, journalistic articles and research briefs aimed at practitioners, the training of a graduate research assistant, and contributions of findings and collected data to organizations focused on sustainable mobility and inclusive transportation policy.\r\n\r\nThe main hypothesis of this research project is that the requirements of public-private partnerships embed spatial inequalities into the sociotechnical organization of bikeshare systems thereby limiting their capacity to act as a more generalized element of urban environmental governance. While many studies of the fast-growing sector of urban shared mobility systems focus on their technological novelty, this research foregrounds the social and political forces that work through such systems, with broad implications beyond bikeshare. Through interviews, site observation, GIS analysis, and archival research, the study pursues three main objectives. It will assess how data about existing social, economic, and spatial factors shape the technical process of bikeshare system design, particularly station location. It will also investigate the role of partnerships between governments and bikeshare providers in this shaping process, and its effect on the capacity to accommodate equity concerns. In addition, it will examine the planning, use, and evaluation of stations at the system edge, and the responses of other actors, including residents, businesses, institutions, and community organizations, to these stations.",

Bikeshare systems consist of public bicycle fleets organized in a network of docking stations with automated kiosks, launched by public-private partnerships between city governments, bikeshare operators, and corporate sponsors. These services address several urban issues simultaneously: they are an inexpensive way to encourage active transportation, increase access to mass transit, reduce traffic congestion and carbon emissions, and promote economic development and inter-urban competitiveness. In the United States, however, bikeshare has struggled to expand beyond its disproportionately white and middle-class user base. Our research highlights the way that funding constraints largely limit bikeshare system coverage to central business districts and adjacent gentrifying neighborhoods, places that are often already well-served by public transit, while lower-income neighborhoods of color in need of improved transit options often fall beyond the service area. While some hope that new \"dockless\" systems that use GPS-connected bicycles and scooters will improve accessibility, these services also tend to concentrate in urban cores, while their aggressive, venture capital-fueled expansion threatens the viability of existing public bikeshare services altogether.</p>\n<p><strong>Methods</strong></p>\n<p>The PI conducted the following fieldwork components in Austin, Philadelphia, and the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as Portland (OR) and New York, between January 2018 and July 2019.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Interviews</em>: 75 (public and private sector bikeshare planners, consultants, managers, community outreach coordinators, bicycle advocates, etc.) &nbsp;</li>\n<li><em>Field observation</em>: Site observation, public outreach events, local government meetings, etc.</li>\n<li><em>GIS and descriptive statistics</em>: Demographic and economic changes in bikeshare service areas, station-based and \"dockless\" usage rates.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Findings</strong></p>\n<p>Our study identifies several key elements that contribute to the concentration of bikesharesystems and usage in central business districts and gentrifying residential areas (see Figs. 1-3), and constrain efforts to overcome this inequality:&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Feasibility studies</em> estimate the most suitable areas for bikeshare service, including population density, destinations, and transportation infrastructure, as well as more \"subjective\" considerations like serving supportive local businesses or increasing access in low-income neighborhoods.
