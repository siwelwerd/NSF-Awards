 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mass spectrometry plays a major role in many areas where molecular measurements are critical, such as the life sciences, the environmental sciences, energy, security, etc.  Important characteristics of a mass spectrometer include the resolution and accuracy with which it can determine molecular masses and the range of masses accessible, as well as practical instrumental features such as size, weight, power consumption, and cost.  With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Dr. Scott McLuckey and his group at Purdue University seek to develop a conceptually new and simple means for mass analysis that combines impressive performance capabilities with potentially small size, low weight, low power consumption and relatively low cost.  The work promises to make high performance mass spectrometry much more widely accessible to scientists across a wide range of fields, while providing valuable training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nDr. McLuckey is developing a relatively small electrostatic linear ion trap based on opposing ion mirrors.  The instrument will be useful for high-performance mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry applications either as a component of larger systems or as a stand-alone device.  The work targets mass resolution in the tens of thousands in analysis times well under one second, with capabilities for tandem mass spectrometry experiments using several dissociation methods.  The net result will be a highly flexible and powerful tool that is simple enough to be built in academic laboratories for support of specialized experiments.  It may also be attractive for commercial development to support a wide range of commonly performed experiments.  Possible application areas range from field measurements (including extraterrestrial applications) to laboratory-based measurements that require high mass resolution and mass accuracy at relatively low cost.  The relative ease with which dual-ion mirror devices can be fabricated will also facilitate the adoption of this technology in specialized research tools that are constructed to address research problems that cannot be addressed with commercially available instruments.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe questions What is it? and How much? are fundamental to addressing many scientific issues at the atomic and molecular level. These questions, for example, are central to monitoring the environment, food purity, human health, etc. Among the most powerful tools available for addressing these questions is mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry allows for the measurement of the masses of individual atoms and molecules. In the case of molecules, mass measurement with high accuracy allows for the determination of elemental composition. This can greatly simplify addressing the question of What is it?. However, the way atoms in a molecule are bound together can give rise to different structures, referred to as isomers. It is often critical to be able to identify which isomers are present, which is not possible via mass measurement alone. In these cases, isomers can often be distinguished on the basis of how they fragment. The technique of tandem mass spectrometry, which determines the fragmentation patterns of molecules, can often be used to provide information about the molecular structure. In combination with the elemental composition, tandem mass spectrometry is among the most specific means for answering the question What is it?. The signal levels obtained via mass spectrometry can be used to address the question of How much?.\n\n\nTandem mass spectrometers are large, bulky, and expensive instruments that are usually designed by commercial manufacturers to be used for particular types of problems. This project focused on developing a very simple means for performing mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry with very high levels of performance that allows for researchers to construct their own instruments to address a wider range of scientific issues. The approach involved the generation of charged molecules via one of a variety of existing techniques followed by their injection into a region with two opposing ion mirrors. Molecule-ions bounce back and forth within the device, much as photons bounce back and forth between two optical mirrors facing one another. In this case, the frequencies with which ions bounce back and forth are determined by their masses. By measuring the frequencies, therefore, it is possible to measure the masses of the molecule-ions. In this project, we were able to demonstrate that masses can be determined with high resolution and accuracy using a simple dual ion mirror geometry. The ability to isolate ions with high resolution for subsequent fragmentation and product ion measurement (i.e. tandem mass spectrometry) was also demonstrated. The net outcome of the work is a novel means for generating mass and structural information with a highly flexible platform that can be tailored to many problems in the molecular sciences.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/07/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: ScottAMcluckey\n"
