 "awd_abstract_narration": "Native grasslands once covering millions of acres across the US have been reduced to a tiny fraction of their former distribution. These remaining grasslands play important roles in the cycling of carbon and nutrients, biodiversity, and as sources for restoration. The health and seasonal dynamics of the remaining native grasslands in the central US are controlled by the amount and timing of rainfall. Across the central US rainfall variability is predicted to increase, with greater frequencies of extreme wet and dry years expected. Grasslands are likely to be particularly sensitive to such changes, with evidence that these systems may be more sensitive to wet versus dry years. However, studies rarely include assessment of extreme years. This Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant (DDIG) award, will experimentally assess the sensitivity of the grassland composition, carbon cycle, and nutrient cycling to rainfall extremes within an intact semi-arid grassland system. The research results will be valuable to natural resource and land managers in managing or restoring native grasslands. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained and participate in the research. \r\n\r\nThis research project aims to advance a fundamental understanding of how ecosystems will respond to predicted increases in environmental variability and extremity. The grassland ecosystem's response to rainfall extremes is hypothesized to be non-linear and bi-modal. A novel experimental treatment is proposed to expose semi-arid grassland to a large gradient of growing season precipitation that will be able to detect nonlinearities in response variables that are otherwise not detectable in few-factor experimental design. The research will allow assessment of the comparative sensitivities of key carbon cycle components to dry versus wet years, and how this sensitivity may change when precipitation transitions from moderate to extreme deviations from mean levels.",

With funding from NSF, we conducted an experiment within an intact semi-arid grassland in northern Colorado during the summer (May &ndash; early September) of 2017. Our experiment simulated a gradient of growing season rainfall that gradually transitioned from the most extreme drought to the wettest year on record. In response to our experimental rainfall gradient, we quantified the sensitivity of forage production, plant biodiversity, and losses of carbon to the atmosphere within this grassland. We found forage production to increase linearly with precipitation, but that losses of carbon to the atmosphere tended to saturate, with both process most responsive to extreme wet versus dry conditions. We also find that under these wettest conditions, the growth and prevalence of exotic plant species undesirable to cattle as forage may be facilitated. This suggests that plant biodiversity and forage productivity within this grassland will be highly sensitive to future precipitation variability and in particular extreme wet years. These findings improve predictions of how semi-arid grasslands will respond to future changes in rainfall patterns. By better understanding the sensitivity of these ecosystem attributes to rainfall variability, land managers, ranchers, and policy makers will be better equipped to make informed decisions that maintain the health and services of central US grasslands and rangelands in light of a changing climate.
