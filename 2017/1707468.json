 "awd_abstract_narration": "The conference \"Finite Dimensional Integrable Systems\" will take place at the Centre de Recerca Matematica , Barcelona,Spain on July 3-7, 2017.  The goal of the conference is to bring together leading experts in the field, along with researchers in the early stage of career and graduate students, in order to survey recent progress in the field of finite dimensional integrable systems, to present open problems, to outline new directions of research, and to foster new collaborations. The NSF award will defray the travel expenses of attending the conference for PhD students, young researchers, and participants from the USA with no current NSF support, including members of under-represented groups. \r\n\r\nThe practitioners in the field use so many different mathematical tools that sometimes they are not aware of what is happening in other subfields of the theory of completely integrable systems.  This conference will bring together experts in mathematics and in mathematical physics with the aim of exchanging information, fostering collaboration, and attracting junior researchers to the area.  The talks will focus on topics such as integrability criteria and obstructions to integrability (topological, dynamical, and differential Galois obstructions), integrable geodesic flows and natural Hamiltonian systems, superintegrability, dynamics of rigid body, nonholonomic mechanics, quantum integrability and quantization procedures, applications of finite dimensional integrable systems in mathematical physics and celestial mechanics, discrete differential geometry and integrability, computational and experimental methods and others.  Additional information on this conference can be found at http://www.crm.cat/en/Activities/Curs_2016-2017/Pages/Finite-Dimensional -Integrable-Systems-in-Geometry-and-Mathematical-Physics.aspx",
