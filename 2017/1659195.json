 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. The REU program has both scientific and societal benefits integrating research and education. The Undergraduate Research on Immigration Policy REU Site will provide undergraduate researchers with training in social science research methods related to issues facing the U.S. Mexico border region, particularly in the El Paso/Las Cruces area. With political debates about the border taking center stage, more on the ground research is needed to truly understand the nature of enforcement measures and their impacts on border communities in a highly dynamic and complex region. Students will learn techniques for collecting and analyzing qualitative and quantitative data as they collaborate with local organizations engaged with immigration and border enforcement debates. The goal is to produce research that is highly relevant to local needs, rather than academic research based purely on theoretical concerns. Students will explore topics related to border enforcement at the ports of entry, interior checkpoints, enforcement between ports and relationships between law enforcement, and the larger community. This project will help to produce the next generation of applied social scientists for the academy, in government, and the private sphere, while also contributing to the literature on immigration policy.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to fill a gap in existing literature regarding the local impacts of state and federal policies regarding immigration and border security, while preparing undergraduate students (especially underrepresented students) to pursue academic STEM studies and careers using Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR). The program has three main goals: 1) Further develop CBPR as a framework for education and research methodology; 2) Provide students the research skills necessary for conducting CBPR; and 3) Provide students with opportunities to conduct quality CBPR by involving them in interdisciplinary research projects related to the social impacts of immigration policy and to share their findings in scholarly venues. Student activities will be grounded within a ten-week summer program comprised of seven methodology workshops, faculty mentorship, a field trip and collaborative research resulting in written and visual products.",

Broader impacts:the program enhanced participation of women and underrepsented groups in social science research. More than 600 students applied to our program.
