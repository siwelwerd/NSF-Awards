 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project targets the fabrication of X-ray focusing devices for high photon energies in the range from 10 keV to >100 keV, necessary for imaging, microtomography, and elemental and structural analyses of materials in spectral ranges and at resolutions unavailable today. Their primary use is in high-end synchrotron radiation facilities and in X-ray microscopes with X-ray tubes sources in specialized industrial and research environments. They form a special class of high-value consumables, with a functional life time of ~2.5 years, with capabilities to address the global market segment worth about $1M today for low and average performance diffractive focusing devices, to more than $4M, if the unprecedented performance devices will be developed. Availability of such focusing devices will enhance the scientific understanding of structure of matter at the nano-scale and the interplay of structure and functionality for applications ranging from drugs development to materials science, nano-electronics, biosciences, forensics, battery and energy research, investigating terrestrial soils or cosmic dust, the kinetics of ultra-fast chemical reactions, advanced catalysts, and others. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is twofold. First, the innovative method of fabrication is a combination of top-down and bottom-up processing. It includes the atomic layer deposition onto batch-fabricated cylindrical silicon precursors of sequences of low and high absorption and refractive index materials, with well-controlled layer thicknesses varying from few nm to micrometers according to the Fresnel zone rules, followed by polishing the wafer to form membranes with focusing devices embedded into them. Hundreds of zone plates can be produced on one wafer, minimizing the processing costs per device. Second, the method is extendable towards depositing sequences of more-than-two material layers, which enables the fabrication of step-wise graded index kinoforms ? devices with single foci and of ultimate diffraction efficiency. Phase I will address these issues by effectively assessing the capabilities for individual key processes and will prove the fabrication feasibility, while Phase II will deal with the fabrication and testing of prototypes with long runs of atomic layer deposition processes, as necessary for functional devices.",

Yet, it is imperative to image and analyze the properties of matter and devices at the nanoscale to understand the underlying causes for their altered characteristics. This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project proved the feasibility of batch-producing groundbreaking X-ray focusing devices capable of unprecedented resolutions of 5 nm and possibly better, with spectral ranges from 10 keV to more than 100 keV. Such high-energy X-ray beams are mainly produced in synchrotron radiation facilities, but can also be produced with X-ray tubes. &nbsp;The demand for such high-energy X-ray sources is highlighted by the massive amounts of spending on new X-ray facilities worldwide and on advanced laboratory sources. Many synchrotron sources are currently undergoing costly upgrades to enable higher resolution X-ray microscopy via higher coherence and higher brilliance beams.&nbsp; Similarly, several companies are developing specialized X-ray tube sources with high brilliance microstructured anodes for the same purpose.&nbsp; However, all of these new sources lack adequate lenses to take maximal advantage of their beam quality for applications requiring focusing. Traditional Fresnel zone plate lenses are fabricated by high resolution electron beam lithography and etching or electroplating. The resolution limitation comes from the size range and aspect ratio of the zone plate nanostructures, required to be sub-10 nm and more than 100:1, respectively. The current fabrication techniques are at the limits of capabilities and life cycle ripeness, with little perspective for improvements. By contrast, the technology developed in the present project is completely disruptive, was proven to easily meet and overtake the devices requirements for current and future X-ray sources, and has the potential to dominate the market for many years to come.</p>\n<p>Figure 1 displays our innovative fabrication method, which starts from etching cylindrical pillars into silicon and applying a sidewall smoothing procedure.&nbsp; The method continues with atomic layer deposition (ALD) of a sequence (&ldquo;nanolaminate&rdquo;) of low and high absorption and refraction index materials around the pillars, with well-controlled layer thicknesses varying from few nm to micrometers according to the Fresnel zone rules.&nbsp; These layers form the diffractive lensing structures, without the use of costly and performance-limiting electron beam lithography or etching. Next, by applying a filling (Cu) material and polishing the wafer, we form membranes with focusing devices embedded into them as shown in Fig. 2a. Figure 3(c) shows a silicon wafer containing thousands of devices produced by our method.&nbsp; It illustrates how zone plates can be batch-produced this way on one wafer, thus minimizing the processing costs per device. Potential hurdles of the method, including the fabrication of very smooth, &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; cylindrical precursors and the deposition of high/low refractive material with precisely controlled layer thicknesses for the diffractive lenses, were successfully overcome. The roughness of cylindrical precursors&rsquo; sidewalls after smoothing was measured as 0.61 nm (rms) and nanolaminate layers down to 5 nm thicknesses were achieved as seen in Fig 2b.
