 "awd_abstract_narration": "Invasive species are an increasing threat to native ecosystems, agriculture, and forestry. This research addresses fundamental questions about how the environment, habitat, local life history, and local physiological traits interact to determine the geographic range of gypsy moths. Introduced from Europe to Massachusetts in 1869, gypsy moth now occurs over nearly a million square kilometers of eastern North America, extending from Minnesota to North Carolina. It is a highly damaging pest of hardwood forests, causing extensive economic and ecological damage to public and private property, as well as negatively impacting the forest products industry. In some parts of its range, gypsy moth is spreading rapidly across the landscape, while in other areas, the invasion front is static or retracting. So far, only one-third of susceptible forest types in the United States have been invaded, leaving large portions of the country still at risk. This project addresses how the invasive potential of a species can change along its leading edge and how a changing environment can determine whether ranges expand or contract. This research also includes training and outreach components that will reach a wide range of student learners, educators, and community stakeholders.\r\n \r\nThe objective of this project is to use patterns of expansion, stasis, and contraction at gypsy moth range limits to examine how local changes in gypsy moth traits influence the potential for future spread. Specifically, the project tests for range-wide variation in tolerance to high and low temperature extremes, local adaptive changes in those physiological limits, and how these traits interact with temperature to influence invasive spread under predicted changes in regional environments. To determine how temperature extremes impact the survival and growth of populations from across the invasion front, experiments will be performed to quantify temperature-dependent growth rates, critical thermal limits, and temperature-specific metabolic rates. Additionally, the effects of current and future environmental conditions will be tested using growth chambers programed with region-specific current and future temperature regimes. The effects of current overwintering conditions at the range extremes on hatching success will be tested by deploying egg masses from a range of populations at both the northern and southern range edge. Publically available climate data, as well as the exhaustive sampling effort by state and federal agencies that annually measures the abundance of gypsy moth along the entire 2000 km range edge, will be used to examine future spread potential. These experimental approaches, combined with information on the current distribution and spread rate will lead to a greater understanding of traits underlying the success of invasive species and help to identify areas that may become more or less susceptible to invasions in the future.",

The outcomes of the project provide one of the first regional-scale studies of how the traits of an invasive species can change across a wide geographic range in response to temperature. We studied the moth </span><em>Lymantria dispar</em><span> and how changes in growth, development, survival, and energetics relate to local climates and its spread across eastern North America. As a result, we better understand its potential to invade climatic regions previously thought to be inhospitable for this species to complete its life cycle. When </span><em>L. dispar</em><span> arrived in Medford, Massachusetts in 1869,&nbsp; it could feed on local trees nutritionally similar to European species and thrived in a climate similar to its native range. We used a series of laboratory-based experiments to compare the thermal performance (metabolism, growth, and tolerance to extremes) of multiple wild populations, and found patterns indicating thermal adaptation to local climates across its North American range. Specifically, we found evidence that populations from the northern extreme of the invasion front have evolved better tolerance to colder temperatures, while southern populations have evolved better tolerance to warmer temperatures. In addition, along the invasion front from north to south, populations show variation in metabolic rates consistent with this pattern. Using an experimental investigation of growth under climate-warming scenarios, we demonstrated that environmental conditions are predicted to generally improve for this species&nbsp; in the next 50-100 years, even at the southern invasion front where temperatures can exceed optimal for this species. Taken together, our results indicate that </span><em>L. dispar</em><span> (i) has a broad thermal tolerance that allowed the species to spread across eastern North America after its arrival; and (ii) has adapted in colder and warmer climates in the extreme northern and southern parts of its invasive range. Our work demonstrates a likely general dynamic for most invasive species: even small amounts of variation in growth and development traits can allow invasive populations to evolve new capacities as they encounter increasingly divergent and possibly novel conditions. The broader impacts of this project for biology include understanding the role of thermal tolerance and adaptation in shaping the limits for invasive species spread. For students, the project has provided research and training opportunities for </span><span>17</span><span> undergraduates and 3 graduates across three universities. For the researchers, it has provided a catalyst for two early-career scientists to advance their research programs and has facilitated the educational development of other college instructors through multiple Faculty Mentoring Networks and the development of new curriculum resources.
