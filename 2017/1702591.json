 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses low-cost photovoltaic (PV) thin film technology that can offer alternative methods to integrating solar energy technology into building envelops. The integration of solar-harvesting components into the building envelope is a transformative route to capturing solar energy for electricity generation while lowering effective solar cell installation costs and improving building energy efficiency. Widespread adoption of this approach is limited by difficulties associated with mounting traditional solar cell modules around buildings due to cost, architectural impedance, and aesthetics. This fundamental research project addresses low-cost luminescent solar concentrator (LSC) film technology that is highly transparent in the visible light spectrum enabling integration onto windows, glazing systems, and siding in the building envelope. The technology is virtually invisible on glazing while offering additional renewable electricity generation for the building. The project will leverage the research results for outreach activities including the development of solar concentrator kits, deployment of sustainable energy technologies across campus, and increasing the scientific awareness of renewable energy technologies for undergraduate students and pre-college students. The fundamental knowledge gained of these luminescent systems will also have potential in enhancing traditional solar cells, and light emitting diodes.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this fundamental research is to investigate novel phosphorescent nanoclusters and fluorescent organic salts, and exploit their properties to enable widespread affordable net-zero-energy building technologies. By modifying the bandgap and the discontinuity of states between molecular orbitals it is possible to tune the solar harvesting of these materials outside of the visible light spectrum (e.g. ultra violet, UV region) into the near-infrared (NIR). The excitonic character and structured absorption of the targeted materials will be designed to produce luminescent solar concentrator architectures that selectively and efficiently harvest UV and NIR light by waveguiding deeper-NIR emission to high efficiency solar cells. The film system will absorb and emit energy around the visible spectrum. The project will integrate fundamental understanding of chemical structure-properties, exciton-harvesting, photon management, and morphology-property relationships with optical and lifetime engineering necessary to produce a viable solar pathway. Stokes-shift engineering of luminophores will be investigated to optimize the optical efficiency and realize large-area scalability.",

Transparent luminescent solar concentrators (TLSC), a key class of transparent photovoltaic (TPV) technologies, selectively harvest the ultraviolet (UV) and/or near-infrared (NIR) portion of the incident solar irradiance, and optically transport the solar energy conversion to edge-mounted photovoltaic cells by waveguided photoluminescence (PL) &nbsp;(<strong>Figure 1</strong>A and B). With the transition from fully opaque (0% transparency) to fully transparent (~100% visible transparency), the theoretical efficiency of single-junction TLSC is only moderately reduced from 33.1% to 20.6% (Figure 1C and D), while the structural simplicity enables the highest levels of visible transparency and aesthetic quality up to 90%.</p>\n<p>Three classes of fluorescent organic molecules (cyanine dyes, non-fullerene acceptors and BODIPYs) were successively designed, synthesized, and modified as luminophores for NIR selective-harvesting TLSCs to improve the corresponding photoluminescence quantum yields, increase Stokes shifts, enhance the NIR spectral coverage, and suppress the reabsorption losses (<strong>Figure 2</strong>). The power conversion efficiency (<em>PCE</em>) of the corresponding NIR-selective harvesting TLSCs were improved from 0.4% to 1.5%. To maximize the light harvesting in the invisible portion of the solar spectrum for higher <em>PCE</em>s, massive-downshifting nanoclusters (NC) with surface ligand modification were synthesized and combined with organic molecules into a dual-band TLSC system as UV and NIR selective harvesting luminophores. The resulting TLSCs are the first demonstration of this type of device which can selectively harvest both UV and NIR ranges and exhibit a record <em>PCE</em> over 3% (<strong>Figure 3</strong>) with high average visible transparency (<em>AVT</em>) over 75% and color metrics suitable for window applications.</p>\n<p>TPVs and LSCs are more complex than traditional PVs and require greater care to correctly characterize their photovoltaic performance and aesthetic quality. Another major contribution to this field was the development of standardized characterization and reporting protocols for TPVs and LSCs (<strong>Figure 4)</strong>. In these works, we highlight the best TPV/LSC characterization protocols using example examples. Key figures of merit to evaluate the visible transparency and color metrics of TPV/LSC devices are described and detailed description of the methods to characterize, calculate, report, and validate device outlined. Importantly, these methods and standards are now being widely recognized and adopted by the TPV/LSC research community. Moreover, a framework to comprehensively analyze TLSC aesthetics was built: photoluminescence of the luminophores is incorporated to evaluate the corresponding impact on the key figures of merit for aesthetic quality.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a practical method to seamlessly integrate these TLSCs onto arbitrary surfaces was developed for future deployment (<strong>Figure 5</strong>). &nbsp;Waveguide trapping is typically disabled when LSCs are directly and seamlessly integrated onto surfaces that are highly absorptive or scattering (Figure 6, top-right). To overcome this challenge, a highly transparent polymer film with low refractive index (?low-<em>n</em> film?) was integrated between the TLSC waveguide, which effectively restores the device photovoltaic performance.
