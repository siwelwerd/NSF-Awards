 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a new research tool to enable improvements in the design process for combustors and engines. Exploiting the same principle that creates the bright colors of fireworks, this method uses light emission from hot metal atoms and their combustion products to measure the temperature and other combustion parameters. This method is simpler and cheaper than existing optical techniques and will advance both research and development applications. This project will study exactly how the brightness of the light emission at a range of colors is linked to the temperature and the composition of the fuel-and-air mixture. This knowledge then allows the use of digital photographs of the light emission for the desired measurements, even with three-dimensional resolution. This project will also create a platform for the engineering participants to integrate the research work with several efforts that aim to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion. For example, a project that develops new guidelines for introducing engineering concepts at the high school level is underway in collaboration with the School of Education. In addition, students involved with the research can benefit from an affiliated translational research program that supports the adaptation of university research results to commercially viable solutions.\r\n\r\nThis project will use the spontaneous light emission from thermally-excited combustion products of an alkaline earth metal, specifically those of strontium, to develop a diagnostic tool for measuring temperature and equivalence ratio in high-temperature, high-pressure environments. Applications of this technique will enable advances in three-dimensional imaging diagnostics, enhance the fundamental understanding of combustion, and support the development of advanced combustion technologies by lowering the complexity and the cost of experiments. The physical processes that control the light emission depend on a range of factors and the influence of these factors will be studied to enable the quantitative analysis of the light emissions from the flames. The fundamental studies will be carried out in laboratory burners and optically accessible research engines. This effort will result in a model that can quantitatively describe the light emission under combustion conditions. Then, experimental applications for measurements will be demonstrated in modern direct-injection engines. These experiments will make use of borescopes as well as multiple high-speed cameras or light-field cameras, which can facilitate novel three-dimensional imaging.",

The light emission is bright red and the same light that we enjoy in fireworks. Upon close inspection, it turns out that light of various wavelengths, i.e. colors is emitted and when separately recorded, the measured light intensity for each color can be processed to accurately determine information about temperature. This method only requires some visual access to the measurement area and works for very high temperatures and pressures, as they are present in reciprocating internal combustion engines, gas turbines, or rocket engines. The simplicity of the method will allow convenient implementation not only in one-of-a-kind research projects but also in industrial development and application laboratories. Demonstration measurements in an optical direct-injection engine that ran on ethanol fuel show how engine operation stability deteriorates for fuel lean and fuel rich conditions. Measured temperatures for such conditions vary much more strongly from one engine cycle to the next, inducting that the power output is not as stable.
