 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry, Xiaopeng Li of the University of South Florida and his coworkers will design and synthesize ligands with well-defined geometry and multiple coordination sites and characterize the 2D and 3D supramolecular structures resuling therefrom.  A wide variety of biological molecules (such as DNAs and proteins) have very complex structures and 3-dimensional (3D) architectures that are important for their biological functions.  Inspired by nature, Prof. Li conducts research to develop self-assembly strategies to creating complex chemical structures with unique properties.  Of particular interest is the preparation of metallo-gels with self-healing properties that may be useful in batteries.  This project is expected to provide an excellent platform for interdisciplinary research training of postdoctoral associates, graduate students, and undergraduate students, especially underrepresented minorities.\r\n\r\nThe targeted metallosupramolecular structures are envisioned to result from the coordination of metal ions (e.g., Zn(II), Fe(II) and Pd(II)) by the designed  multitopic ligands. The research team will prepare metallo-gels and explore their potential applications as self-healing materials and binder materials of batteries.  The level of complexity is often attained by self-assembly of structurally simple subunits (or building blocks) which have specific functionalities and geometries to direct their assembly into sophisticated structures of precisely controlled size, shape and properties.The Li research group aims to gain insights into the fundamental chemistry principles that control supramolecular self-assemblies and to prepare novel materials with unique properties.",

Due to the highly directional and predictable feature of coordination, metal-mediated self-assembly acts as a powerful tool to mimic nature's activities and to construct various 2D and 3D supramolecules. However, unpredicted assemblies often appear because organic ligands are much more flexible than expected, and metal ions allow considerable deviation. The major project goal is to utilize Density of Coordination Sites (DOCS) as a new design strategy to precisely control the assemblies. Within the past four years (no cost extension for another year), this project has resulted 16 publications with PI as corresponding. Briefly, in the 2D self-assembly, we constructed concentric hexagon, supramolecular stars, snowflakes, Sierpi&#324;ski triangle, rosettes, Kandinsky circles and fractals through either direct or stepwise self-assembly. Expanding self-assembly from 2D to 3D, we assembled more sophisticated supramolecular structures, ranging from ring-in-ring to sphere-in-sphere, from 2D to 3D Stars of David using multitopic pyridine ligands. In addition, we have been actively exploring the hierarchical self-assembly of precisely controlled 2D and 3D supramolecular architectures to deliver self-healing, white-light emission and antimicrobial materials.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts. In the collaboration with Johnson at MIT, Stang at University of Utah, Yang at East China Normal University, Sessler at University of Texas-Austin, Cozzolino at Texas Tech, Zheng at Kent State University, we studied a series of metallo-macrocycles, metallo-cages and organic catenane with 26 publications on Nature, JACS, PNAS and Nat. Chem. 14&nbsp; graduate students, undergraduate students and high school students and two postdoctoral scholars have been working on the project. All of these scholars have the opportunity to present their research at ACS national meetings and the Florida Annual Meeting and Exposition conference (FAME). Alejandro Cisneros, a junior chemistry student, was included as co-author in our recent concentric hexagons paper on JACS because of his contribution in ligand synthesis and self-assembly. Sammy Shihadeh, also a junior chemistry student, was included as co-author in our recent paper of supramolecular nanocages on Macromol. Rapid. Commun. Alexander Filosa, a senior chemistry student received the best Poster Award on the FAME in 2018. Note that each year only four undergraduate and graduate students receive this award. Undergraduate students mentored by the PI received many awards, including Dean Martin Outstanding B.A. Chemistry Major award and Graham Solomons Departmental Scholarship by Sandra Khalife in 2018, and Joseph Stanko Inorganic Chemistry award by Owen O?Grady in 2018. Their research experience has an enormous impact on their career decision. For example, Owen O?Grady joined University of Florida in fall 2018 as a graduate student in chemistry. More recently, Kandinsky-inspired supramolecular architectures with high antibacterial activity attracted multiple media reports with broader impacts in both the sciences and arts fields. Several high school and undergraduate students contacted the PI to join the lab for research, including Ellie Ngo (Largo high school, International Baccalaureate program), Jonathan Piccolo (USF, public health), and Abraham Kellman (USF, Chemistry).
