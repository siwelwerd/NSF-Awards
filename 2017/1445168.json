 "awd_abstract_narration": "Putkonen/1445205\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award supports the study of a large body of ice that is buried beneath approximately a meter of debris in the Ong Valley of the Transantarctic Mountains of East Antarctica. Preliminary analyses of this material suggest that it could be over a million years old.  Most glacial ice contains tiny air bubbles that have trapped the atmospheric gases and other atmospherically transported materials existing at the time that the ice was deposited such as plant pollen, microbes and mineral dust.  Samples will be collected from this buried ice mass, down to a depth of 10 meters, and cosmogenic nuclide concentrations both in the overlying debris and in the till contained in the ice will be measured. This site could contain some of the oldest ice on Earth and studies of the material contained within it may help researchers to better understand the processes involved in its survival for such long periods of time. This work will also help inform scientists about the processes involved in the development of landforms here on earth as well as those on Mars where similar dirt covered glaciers are found today.\r\n\r\nSamples of the buried ice will be collected in Ong Valley and analyzed to determine the cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in both the overlying debris and in the mineral matter suspended in the ice. The combined analysis of the target cosmogenic nuclides (Beryllium-10, Aluminum-26, and Neon-21) will allow the age of the ice to be uniquely determined and will enable determination of the rate that the ice is sublimating. The intellectual merit of this research is to unequivocally determine the age of the ice and the sublimation rate of the ice in Ong Valley, Antarctica and to better understand if this an uniquely Antarctic process or whether it could exist elsewhere on earth or on other planets.  The work may also lead to the recognition of the oldest buried ice ever found on Earth and would provide a source from which direct information about the atmospheric chemistry, ancient life forms, and geology of that time could be measured.  The broader impacts of this work are that it will be relevant to researchers in a number of different fields including glaciology, paleoclimatology, planetary geology, and biology. Several students will also participate in the project, conducting Antarctic field work, making measurements in the lab, attending meetings, participating in outreach activities, and producing videos. A graduate student will also write a thesis on this research.  The results will be published in scientific journals and presented at conferences. The project requires field work in Antarctica.",

In previous fieldwork in Ong Valley, a valley located in a rugged area of the central Transantarctic Mountains, we discovered that the apparently rocky valley floor was actually only a thin layer of rocks and debris covering buried glacier ice. Based on some existing information about the age of the surface material, it was possible that this ice had been buried in the subsurface for millions of years. If true, this would be important, not only because of the bizarre and fantastic phenomenon that ice, normally considered ephemeral on Earth's surface, can survive in this location for millions of years, but also because of the possibility that the ice might contain samples of Earth's atmosphere from the long distant past.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br />Our goal, therefore, was to determine how old the Ong Valley buried ice is, and to try and learn something about how it was formed and why it has been preserved for so long. We did this by drilling into the ice to collect undisturbed samples from up to 10 m (30 ft) below the ice surface, and applying geochemical dating methods to mineral sediment within the ice to determine the age of the ice. We found that the ice is at least 3 million years old, but it is actually composed of a mixture of ice of different ages, and some of the ice may be up to 5 million years old. This is interesting and potentially important for a number of reasons. First, again, it shows that survival of near-surface ice for geologically long periods is possible. Second, although we did not attempt to extract atmosphere from bubbles within the ice, obtaining millions-of-years-old atmosphere may be possible with additional drilling to deeper depths in the ice. Third, if this ice has been in Ong Valley for 5 million years, it has survived several periods in the geologic past during which global climate was warmer, in particular a period near 3 million years ago when atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and global temperature were similar to today. If ice remained frozen through this period, this limits the potential temperature increase in Antarctica during this period, which may be relevant to predicting future climate, ice sheet, and sea level change.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/20/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gregory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Balco</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1445168/1445168_10465289_1650475391916_ONG_2974--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1445168/1445168_10465289_1650475391916_ONG_2974--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Aerial view of Ong Valley\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1445168/1445168_10465289_1650475391916_ONG_2974--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of Ong Valley\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Aerial view of Ong Valley, looking south.
