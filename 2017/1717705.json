 "awd_abstract_narration": "A longstanding goal in artificial intelligence is to develop smart systems that interact well with humans.  Advances in sensing and machine learning are increasingly allowing computers to infer mental states, raising questions about how agents might use those inferences to adapt to human partners.  This project will systematically address how to design and evaluate \"affect-aware\" systems that adapt their behavior based on estimates of their users' emotional experiences.  The team will first look at the effectiveness of current strategies that vary the difficulty of educational tasks and games based on inferred affect.  They will then develop new strategies that take into account both individual personality and dynamic characteristics of the physical environment.  Finally, they will evaluate these strategies, paying particular attention to what happens when systems act on incorrect inferences about affect.  These studies will help pave the way toward self-driving cars, conversational assistants, and virtual reality characters that consider affect when interacting with people, ideally leading to better experiences and outcomes.  The team will also develop new interdisciplinary courses in human factors and human-computer interaction, connecting with industrial partners to help train students in both the practice and research of these kinds of adaptive systems.  Further, they will do public outreach about these systems and use them to provide summer research experiences for K-12 and community college students, focusing on those from groups traditionally underrepresented in computing.\r\n\r\nThe project will be structured as a series of lab studies, using spatial cognition games and robot-assisted motor rehabilitation tasks as testbeds that allow the team to directly manipulate task difficulty and measure enjoyment/engagement and performance/learning outcomes.  The team will first collect training data with people using the testbeds at randomly selected difficulty levels and reporting the perceived level of difficulty as too easy (bored), too hard (frustrated), or about right, while capturing heart rate signals, skin conductance and temperature, electroencephalogram (EEG) data, and environmental factors including light, time of day, and room temperature.  These will be used to train affect recognizers using a variety of machine learning methods: linear discriminant analysis (including a Kalman adaptive version), support vector machines, neural and Bayesian networks, and random forests.  Using a common adaptation strategy that adjusts difficulty up or down one step, the team will measure the enjoyment and performance outcomes that affect-aware recognizers achieve both with and without considering environmental factors, comparing those to a baseline strategy that adapts difficulty based only on task performance.  During these experiments, the team will also collect data about users' personality characteristics and use those to develop individualized recognition models and adaptation strategies for different personality types. These individualized models and strategies will be evaluated by comparing them to the baseline data from the first experiment.  Finally, they will compare the outcomes of these systems with those from a \"best-case\" system controlled by humans and a \"worst-case\" error-prone system that chooses adaptation strategies randomly, looking at those induced error rates along with the natural error rates captured during the other experiments to determine the effect of recognition and adaptation error on satisfaction and task outcomes.",

For example, an affect-aware robot that realizes that its owner is experiencing stress during a task could offer to assist with that task, but could leave them alone with the task if they are enjoying it. However, while many possible applications for such systems have been identified (e.g., intelligent cars and planes, air traffic control, rehabilitation, wearable robotics, and simply entertainment), affect-aware systems have not yet become widely popular. One reason for this is that it is difficult for such devices to adapt to a variety of different users and situations without making mistakes; another reason is the lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness of such devices.</p>\n<p>This project first developed several novel software approaches for recognizing human psychological states from physiological measurements (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance, brain waves). One example of these novel software approaches was an algorithm that takes the user's personality and other characteristics into account as part of the psychological state recognition process. Another example was an algorithm that tries to independently estimate the user's psychological state as much as possible, but pauses the task and asks the user about their psychological state if it does not feel confident in its own estimate; it then uses the learned lesson to update its recognition rules for the future. Tested on previously recorded data, these algorithms outperformed state-of-the-art algorithms - they were able to more accurately recognize humans' psychological states from physiological measurements. The algorithms can be used in many different applications of affect-aware systems, and can thus improve the ability of machines to recognize humans' psychological states in a variety of settings.</p>\n<p>The developed psychological state recognition software was then connected to intelligent decision-making rules that dynamically adapted  the difficulty of a computer-based task (computer game or arm  rehabilitation exercise) in response to the user's psychological state. The effects of the novel software on user experience and task performance were measured and compared to results obtained with state-of-the-art algorithms, with a human manually changing the task difficulty, and with purely random decision-making. The novel software was able to provide a better user experience than state-of-the-art software, and was also more effective than a human manually adapting task difficulty. This demonstrated that such intelligent affect-aware systems can adapt task difficulty and achieve positive results without the need for human guidance, underscoring their practical potential.</p>\n<p>A follow-up analysis of the collected data found significant correlations between the accuracy of psychological state recognition in an affect-aware system and its actual effect on the user's experience with such a system.
