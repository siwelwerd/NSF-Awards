The three goals of the workshop are to: 1) Review and revise the Draft Curriculum Framework for the AP in Engineering. 2) Define the Role Organizations Play in the Pilot. 3) Development of Training Objectives for the Pilot Teachers.  \r\n\r\nThis workshop will bring together approximately 36 participants from the following sectors within the education and engineering enterprises: 1) Deans from Schools and Colleges of Engineering; 2) College Board; 3) K-12 STEM teachers and district level leadership; 4) community college and four-year faculties; 5) consulting, technology, and manufacturing industries dependent upon engineering talent; 6) informal education programs; 7) policy-makers; and 8) public and private funders.  The participants would convene to: 1) review and revise the Draft Curriculum Framework for the AP in Engineering; 2) plan the criteria and recruitment of high schools to participate in the pilot; 3) define the role organizations would play in a pilot of the AP in Engineering; 4) development of a professional development framework for the pilot teachers; and 5) discussion of the role of a Learning Management System (LMS).",
