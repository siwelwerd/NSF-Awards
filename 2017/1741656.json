 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will develop novel components and integrate them into a device that will serve as the key building block of a secure communication network with advanced capabilities based on the principles of quantum mechanics. It will address the pressing need for secure communication at long distance scales while employing minimal resources using novel theoretical schemes. The approach is based on the development of new, high-quality light sources capable of producing many quantum-correlated (entangled) photons at a high rate; these light sources will be integrated into a device that is capable of directing the photons on a microchip and reliably guiding them to optical fibers for long-distance transmission. The entangled photons encode information that cannot be intercepted without the sender or receiver becoming aware of this. Such a capability will greatly impact society and national security and help maintain U.S. leadership in information and communication technologies. Beyond communications, the developed components and know-how will impact other highly influential quantum technologies currently being pursued, including quantum computing. In addition to fundamental science, technology and engineering developments, the PIs are committed to recruiting and training the next generation of scientists and engineers, with an emphasis on diversity and interdisciplinary education through K-12 learning activities and summer programs.\r\n\r\nThis program combines novel ideas in quantum communications with cutting edge solid-state quantum technologies to achieve on-chip integrated devices for the realization of a quantum communication network. Transformative quantum repeater technologies will be developed based on multiphoton entangled states. Central components include: (i) novel emitters hosted in two-dimensional materials, which provide high-yield single-photon emission with a level structure ideal for spin-photon and multiphoton entanglement, (ii) defect centers in diamond that offer spin-photon interfaces, room-temperature capability and a long-lived nuclear spin quantum memory, (iii) chiral waveguides for efficient photon extraction and spin-spin entanglement on-chip, and (iv) theoretical designs for novel quantum communication implementations, including the deterministic generation of all-photonic quantum repeaters using minimal resources. These components will be integrated together to form quantum photonic circuits that offer significant novel capabilities in communications. The pursuit of the proposed goals will lead to advances in key device components for a broad range of quantum communication technologies as well as offer a path to the near-future realization of secure quantum communication at long distance scales.",
