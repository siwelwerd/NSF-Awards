 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric blocks are quasi-stationary large-scale anti-cyclonic circulation patterns in the upper troposphere that interrupt the westerly jet steam circulating in mid-latitudes. Due to their relatively long lifetimes of up to several weeks, blocking flows are capable of making weather systems that migrate along the westerly jet become stagnant over the same regions, sometimes causing extreme events such as heat waves, droughts, and floods. This project, building on the PI's Ph.D. dissertation research, investigates the connection of extratropical blocks to the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO), a prominent intra-seasonal (30-60 days) form of variability in the tropical atmosphere. A linear inverse modelling (LIM) approach is used to identify tropical diabatic heating anomalies associated with MJO that can evolve into blocking flows in the extratropics. \r\n\r\nThe research could be beneficial to regional decision makers by demonstrating how blocking events in a given region can be traced back to MJO events in the tropics, thus enabling advanced warning of blocking events and their impacts. In addition, the project supports a postdoctoral researcher who is at the beginning of her scientific career, thereby providing for the future scientific workforce in this area.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Weather in the midlatitudes is driven by a wide range of variability, including large-scale circulation patterns such as the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern and atmospheric blocking.  These large-scale patterns are important to predict accurately and well in advance because they impact temperatures and precipitation throughout North America and beyond.  Weekly to seasonal sources of predictability for these midlatitude patterns can be found in the tropics and are associated with heat released by deep organized convection.  Two important such \"heat sources\" are the stationary and persistent El Ni&ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the 40-50 day eastward propagating Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO).  A goal of this project is to better understand how ENSO and the MJO impact the PNA pattern and atmospheric blocking.  This is an important step towards improving their weekly to seasonal prediction.  \n\n The role of tropical heating and the midlatitude circulation on the development and growth of the PNA pattern is investigated using what is known as linear inverse modeling (LIM).  LIM approximates the dynamics of a system by using its observed statistics.  Results from this study yield three main results. 1) From the tropics, the PNA pattern optimally grows due to the interference of MJO and ENSO heating.  From the midlatitudes, the PNA grows from the interference of opposite-signed midlatitude circulation anomalies &ndash; one slowly varying that is coupled to sea surface temperature (SST), and one that varies more quickly and is weakly coupled to SST.  2) A LIM excluding variability strongly coupled to SST, such as ENSO, is developed, and the MJO is found to optimally lead to PNA growth as well as a Northeast Pacific circulation anomaly that travels westward to become part of the PNA pattern.  3) Importantly, PNA growth is found to be non-normal.  This means that it is not easy to partition PNA variance, and this result is likely not unique to the PNA.\n\n The MJO impacts not only the PNA pattern, but also monsoons, hurricanes, global temperatures and precipitation, as well as atmospheric blocking.  A block is characterized by a persistent high-pressure system that is associated with weather extremes such as flooding, drought, and sudden long-lasting cold snaps.  The MJO significantly alters atmospheric blocking throughout the Northern Hemisphere and this impact depends on whether there is a La Ni&ntilde;a, an El Ni&ntilde;o, or neutral ENSO conditions &ndash; an important relationship to understand for the predictability of blocking.  Furthermore, there is the possibility of a two-way interaction between the midlatitude circulation and the MJO.  Preliminary results using the LIM suggest that the midlatitude circulation can impact the heating associated with the MJO.  When the MJO is examined without the midlatitude circulation in the LIM, there is less MJO growth.  This interesting result is being examined further.      \n\n Overall, this award has furthered the understanding of weekly to seasonal variability important for midrange prediction. These timescales include persistent weather, such as the weather extremes associated with atmospheric blocking.  Prediction in weekly to seasonal timescales are quite difficult, yet crucial for agriculture, transportation, and other regional and global long-term planning, as well as the comfort and safety of society.  This work is a step closer towards closing the predictability gap in these timescales.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/28/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephanie A Henderson"
