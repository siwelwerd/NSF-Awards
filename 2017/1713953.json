 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is the development of a new method of treating Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS). This technology utilizes a new type of therapeutic agent, called ?polymer lung surfactants?. RDS is a life-threatening condition that occurs primarily in infants who are born prematurely.  The cause of RDS is the lack of chemical compounds called lung surfactants in the infant?s lungs. Currently, the standard treatment for RDS involves injection of animal-derived lung surfactant compounds into the patient?s lung. However, this animal-derived treatment has major drawbacks: (1) the harvesting process carries the risk of pathogenic contamination; (2) these conventional lung surfactants (containing proteins susceptible to denaturation) require sophisticated delivery procedures that can only be practiced in locations where skilled healthcare professionals and advanced care facilities are available. Due to these factors, RDS remains a serious problem, particularly, in under-developed countries. These significant drawbacks of the current methods offers a potential opportunity for the new polymer lung surfactant technology developed here.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps project will develop a fully synthetic material (polymers) as a cheaper replacement for costly lipid-based formulations for treatment of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Lung surfactant plays a critical role in the lung?s ability to process air by lowering alveolar surface tension. For potential lung surfactant applications promising candidate materials have been identified that are capable of replicating the surface-tension-lowering properties of natural lung surfactants. The research will advance understanding of how certain polymers are able to produce extremely low air-water interfacial tensions under dynamic compression (similarly to the natural lung surfactant) and what molecular factors contribute to these behaviors.",

The original intention of this I-Corps project (1/2017 ? 6/2018) was to validate the commercial potential of this PLS technology in treating neonatal RDS (NRDS). However, it was discovered that the barrier for entering the NRDS market2018 is very high because of the small prevalence of NRDS (40,000 per year in the US) and also other pre-existing drugs (e.g., Survanta, Curosurf, Infasurf). Further investigation led us to identify an alternative market for PLS: acute RDS (ARDS). The size of the US ARDS market is far greater ($13B per year), and currently we have no standard therapeutics for this disease. This discovery led us to pivot on our overall strategy. Further study validated the product-market fit between the PLS technology and the ARDS market. The present grant also enabled us to (i) establish partnerships with experts in the field and (ii) develop a regulatory strategy and a business plan.

Mortality averages 40% with high morbidity in those that do survive due to lack of effective treatments. The Polymer Lung Surfactant (PLS) formulation developed as a result of this work is a first-in-kind therapeutic that will go beyond the mere supportive role of current treatments, reducing patient mortality, morbidity, and time in intensive care unit (ICU) by restoring and maintaining lung function throughout the ARDS treatment process. With ARDS accounting for an estimated 7% of all ICU beds, PLS therapy will also improve hospital resource availability. The company that can deliver this solution would benefit from a lack of competition in the ARDS market, which is valued at an estimated $3.4 billion in the US alone. Aerosolizing PLS would further expand the societal impact of the therapeutic as the first non-invasive treatment for ARDS and neonatal RDS (NRDS) by eliminating the need for intubation. This could serve as a preemptive measure for patients with high risk factors for ARDS (i.e. sepsis) and provide therapeutic benefit to all preterm infants.

The life-saving treatment using therapeutic lung surfactants has further potential in annually treating 265,000 premature infants that have mild respiratory distress, and 190,000 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) adult patients (US patient populations).
