 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students successfully completing high quality\r\ndegree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)disciplines. Particular emphasis is placed on transforming STEM education through innovative recruitment and retention strategies and experiences in support of groups\r\nhistorically under-represented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity provides support for postbaccalaureate\r\nstudies in STEM programs leading to the STEM doctoral degree.\r\n\r\nThe University of Connecticut (UConn) is the host site for the 2017-2019 Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) program for the Northeast Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (NELSAMP) under the leadership of this institution. This is the third post-baccalaureate program at the institution that supports a graduate student cohort of underrepresented minority (URM) STEM Ph.D. students from LSAMP campuses across the nation. \r\n\r\nThe BD Activity provides extensive training in specific STEM disciplines as well as professional development and guidance that promote peer mentoring and leadership in the scientific community. Students receive rigorous academic and research training experiences that support completion of the Ph.D. and the transition to a competitive career in academia and industry. Over the duration of the project and beyond, the BD program at UConn serves to increase the number and quality of students from underrepresented groups completing STEM\r\nPh.D. degrees and entering the STEM workforce. Formative and summative evaluation will occur with the summative evaluation including a comparison group to assess impact of the program interventions on student outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe long-term impact of the BD activity is reflected in America's STEM workforce, both academia and in industrial research and development. By nurturing future STEM leaders, the value added is seen in the visibility of underrepresented minorities in\r\nscience and engineering, increasing representation and providing role models and motivation for the next generation.",

The BD funding enables UConn to expand and concentrate the NELSAMP\u2019s continuing efforts to increase the number of qualified students pursuing and completing advanced degrees in STEM areas.  The premise for BD funding is that the diversity of perspectives, backgrounds and experiences of the BD Fellows affords new avenues for resolving social, economic and technological challenges that currently limit the U.S.  This proactive, intensive, results-oriented campaign to recruit, prepare, mentor, train and support doctoral candidates from traditionally underrepresented populations in the STEM fields is specifically tailored to help foster major breakthroughs in meeting some of society\u2019s challenges.\n\n \n\nThe suite of activities offered through the BD Activity include cohort meetings among BD Program participants, focused plans of study and detailed roadmaps of academic milestones, K-12 mentoring/outreach opportunities, career preparation, and professional development instruction in teaching, communication and research ethics.  The BD Activity also supports the development of a dedicated Husky STEM BD website containing informative material describing the BD Activity, FAQs, a schedule of planned activities, and short summaries of prospective BD research projects and faculty advisors.\n\n \n\nBD Faculty Advisors are required not only to advise the BD Fellows but also to serve as engaged, hands-on mentors.  BD Advisors commit to fostering their Fellow\u2019s participation in skills-building workshops and training courses, as well as to provide financial support beyond the two-year BD funding period.\n\n \n\nThe BD program officially began in the fall of 2017 with six Fellows enrolled.  Five of the Fellows were new entrants into the BD program, while one student started during the spring semester of 2017.  Over the next two years ten more students were enrolled into the BD program, bringing the total number of participants to 16.  Two students graduated with their master\u2019s degree in 2018, and two students ended up leaving UConn &ndash; one of whom continued their PhD at another university.  The remaining 12 students remained in the program during the initial years of their PhD program. \n\n \n\nThe 2017-2020 BD program served 13 males and three females, seven blacks and nine Hispanics.
