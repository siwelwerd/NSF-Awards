 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mathematics faculty members and educational researchers are increasingly recognizing the value of the history of mathematics as a support to student learning. This collaborative project, involving seven diverse institutions, will help students learn and develop a deeper interest in, and appreciation and understanding of, fundamental mathematical concepts and ideas by utilizing primary sources - original historical writings by mathematicians on topics in mathematics. Educational materials for students will be developed at all levels of undergraduate mathematics courses, and will be designed to capture the spark of discovery and to motivate subsequent lines of inquiry. In particular, the student projects to be developed will be built around primary source material to guide students, including pre-service teachers, mathematics majors, and other STEM discipline majors, to explore the mathematics of the original discovery in order to develop their own understanding of that discovery. Mathematics faculty and graduate students from over forty (40) institutions will participate in the development and testing process, thereby ensuring a large national network of faculty with expertise on the use of these educational materials. The impacts of the materials and approaches to implementing them will be investigated in terms of teaching, student learning, and departmental and institutional change.  \r\n\r\nThe TRIUMPHS project will employ an integrated training and development process to create and test approximately fifty (50) student projects, which will include (1) twenty (20) primary source projects (PSPs) designed to cover its topic in about the same number of course days as classes would otherwise and (2) thirty (30) one-day mini-PSPs.  In addition to the well-researched benefits of engaging students in active learning, particular advantages of this historical approach will involve providing context and direction for the subject matter. Important goals of the TRIUMPHS project are to (a) hone students' verbal and deductive skills through studying the work of some of the greatest minds in history and (b) invigorate undergraduate mathematics courses by identifying the problems and pioneering solutions that have since been subsumed into standard curricular topics. Through intensive, research-based professional development workshops, the TRIUMPHS project will also provide training in various aspects of developing and implementing PSPs to approximately seventy (70) faculty and doctoral students. By working collaboratively to develop PSPs while training faculty across the country in their use, the investigators will ensure that these educational materials are robustly adaptable and proactively disseminated to a wide variety of institutional settings, while simultaneously developing an ongoing professional community of mathematics faculty interested in teaching with primary sources.  An evaluation-with-research study will provide formative and summative evaluation of the project, as well as contribute to the general knowledge base of (i) how student perceptions of the nature of mathematics evolve, (ii) how students' ability to write mathematical arguments changes over time, and (iii) how to support faculty in developing and implementing this research-based, active learning approach.",

Because PSPs are freely available by download from the TRIUMPHS website [https://blogs.ursinus.edu/triumphs/], an unknown additional number of instructors have used PSPs in their classrooms. TRIUMPHS's workshops and minicourses on the instructional use of PSPs further strengthened the development of human resources by providing participants with training on the use of student-centered instructional practices in undergraduate mathematics.\nStrengthening future undergraduate mathematics instruction by providing graduate students with co-teaching and mentoring opportunities under the direction of experienced PSP instructors.\nTRIUMPHS has provided six mathematics doctoral students and three mathematics education doctoral students with co-teaching experiences that involved the teaching of ten different courses in which PSPs were used. A workshop specifically designed for graduate students at New Mexico State University also provided 24 future mathematics faculty members with a unique training experience in the pedagogy of PSPs.\nStrengthening the discipline of mathematics education through the addition of strong mathematics education researchers to the professoriate.\nFour mathematics education doctoral students received mentoring in qualitative research methodology over the course of the grant, with one of these four producing the only PhD in the History and Pedagogy of Mathematics / Research in Undergraduate Mathematics Education domain in the US for many years.\nExtending the STEM education knowledge base regarding the effects on students and instructors of innovative teaching approaches and faculty training supporting the adoption of more student-centered classroom instruction.\nUsing data provided by our official site testers and the students enrolled in their courses, TRIUMPHS's ongoing Evaluation-with-Research study is contributing to a general understanding of:\n   * how to best support faculty in developing and implementing an active learning approach such as that represented by PSPs;\n  *  the effects of studying mathematics from PSPs on students' worldviews, or perceptions about the nature of mathematics, as well as their learning of \"meta-discursive rules,\" or the overarching standards that govern the ways in which experts carry out the practice of mathematics; and\n  * students' challenges with a PSP learning experience and the contribution of those challenging experiences to their mathematical growth (e.g., increased confidence in doing mathematics) using theoretical lenses from psychology that have application in mathematics education research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jerry M Lodder"
