 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urban, suburban and exurban environments are important ecosystems and their extent is increasing in the U.S.  The conversion of wild or managed ecosystems to urban ecosystems is resulting in ecosystem homogenization across cities, where neighborhoods in very different parts of the country have similar patterns of roads, residential lots, commercial areas and aquatic features.  Funds are provided to test the hypothesis that this homogenization alters ecological structure and functions relevant to ecosystem carbon and nitrogen dynamics, with continental scale implications.  The research will provide a framework for understanding the impacts of urban land use change from local to continental scales.  The research encompasses datasets ranging from household surveys to regional-scale remote sensing across six metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) that cover the major climatic regions of the US (Phoenix, AZ, Miami, FL, Baltimore, MD, Boston, MA, St. Paul, MN and Los Angeles, CA) to determine how household characteristics correlate with landscaping decisions, land management practices and ecological structure and functions at local, regional and continental scales.  This research will transform scientific understanding of an important and increasingly common ecosystem type (?suburbia?) and the consequences to carbon storage and nitrogen pollution at multiple scales. In addition, it will advance understanding of how humans perceive, value and manage their surroundings. The award will leverage an extensive, multi-scale program of education and outreach associated with ongoing LTER and/or ULTRA-EX projects. Activities include K-12 education and outreach to community groups, city/regional planners, natural history museums, state and local agencies and non-governmental organizations. Graduate students will participate in a Distributed Graduate Seminar in Sustainability Science (DGSS) initiated by NCEAS and the University of Minnesota Institute on Environment.",

This outcomes report describes the activities of Dr. Polsky on this award. Dr. Polsky had two primary sets of activities: to lead the cross-site statistical analysis of the household telephone survey data for the full sample of households in the project's six metropolitan regions, and to assist in the analysis of various subsets of the same household survey. In addition, Dr. Polsky undertook an offshoot effort to lay the foundation for cross-site analysis of water budgets vis-a-vis lawn watering policies. Specifically, this effort entailed compiling high spatial and temporal resolution datasets of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. These data have been processed for the metropolitan Miami region. Overall, this project contributes to the systematic study of urban areas in the US, and whether or not the form of and motivations for residential development are unfolding similarly in different places, and whether or not that development -- whatever its form and motivations -- is leading to similar environmental outcomes in different places. Findings linked with the work involving Dr. Polsky suggest that there are some similarities and some differences. Specifically, our national household survey suggested similarities in lawn fertilizing (63 percent of respondents) and lawn watering (79 percent). But these activities may differ with age of homeowner. For example, in Los Angeles, 66 percent of younger residents fertilized their lawns, while 73 percent of older residents did. In Minneapolis-St. Paul, the percentages were similar to those in L.A.: 68 and 76 percent, respectively. Those age-based differences suggest heterogeneity, but the location-based similarities suggest homogeneity.
