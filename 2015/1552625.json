 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation uses the Grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID) funding mechanism to support quick-response research on natural or anthropogenic disasters and similar unanticipated events. The project at Dillard University is in response to the event on  May 19, 2015, when a severely corroded section of an oil pipeline ruptured along the Gaviota coast in Santa Barbara County, California. It has been reported that approximately 105,000 gallons of crude oil spilled; 21,000 gallons of which spilled into the Pacific Ocean. A nine- mile long oil slick was created in the Pacific Ocean and nearby beaches were contaminated.  This project will characterize a cohort of microbiological markers and toxic components associated with the oil spilled on the California impacted shorelines and will make comparisons with the effects of the dispersants used in the Deepwater Horizon oil releases into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.\r\n\r\nThe specific goals are to: identify and quantify airborne microorganisms using traditional and culture independent technology; to assess microbial loads concurrently by direct microscopy, viable plate counts, and broad-range polymerase chain reaction analysis; to make recommendations relevant to best practices for remediation;  and to involve undergraduate students in all aspects of the research project. The study of the impacts on ecosystems at the lowest trophic levels should reveal indicators to guide remedial actions. This project will help lay the groundwork for the ecological and epidemiological survey of oil spill impacted regions, thus advancing information for the public.",
