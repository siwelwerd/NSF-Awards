It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition, maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nScientists studying the earth?s oceans rely heavily on hydrographic data collected from research ships, especially in regions that are undersampled by modern profiling floats.  Global, repeated hydrographic surveys of the world?s oceans have been carried out for decades by diverse organizations.  The Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP) currently provides coordination of an international effort to survey the oceans repeatedly in a systematic way, obtaining high-quality data that are readily available to the scientific community and public.\n\nThis project contributes to GO-SHIPS by having acquired and refurbished instruments (lowered ADCPs, or LADCP) used by GO-SHIP investigators to measure ocean currents during the surveys.  At each survey station,  the LADCP attached to the measurement package lowered from the ship makes measurements of the speed and direction of the currents with depth, while the main instrument package is measuring ocean properties such as temperature and salinity, and collecting water samples for later analysis on board the ship. In addition to measuring the ocean current speed and direction, the LADCP data can be used to estimate the energy available to vertically mix waters in the ocean, important for understanding the ocean?s role in the climate system.\n\nBecause GO-SHIP is international in scope, there are sometimes two overlapping or  simultaneous ongoing hydrographic survey cruises, requiring a pool of ADCP instruments sufficient to support two cruises.  This project has contributed to the establishment and maintenance of the pool of ADCPs that are integral to the GO-SHIP measurement program.\n\nFor more information about GO-SHIP, visit: http://www.go-ship.org\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/09/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bruce A Huber"
