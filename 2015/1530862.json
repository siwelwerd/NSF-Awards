The AUC will support the research programs of seven different laboratories and be available to other users within the university and neighboring institutions. At USU, the instrument will be used to provide hands-on training in cutting-edge molecular techniques to undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral researchers, and become an integral part of the educational and outreach efforts in the Chemistry and Biochemistry department. \r\n\r\nThe analytical ultracentrifuge will be used to study the in solution properties of macromolecular complexes including determining accurate molecular weights, heterogeneity and stoichiometry. At USU, the analytical ultraentrifuge will be used to support the research of the PI and Co-PI's to investigate: (1) the mechanism of action of ATP-dependent motor proteins; (2) the assembly of Type III secretion systems in pathogens; (3) the oxidation based control of proteins; (4) the assembly mechanism of RNA; (5) the Iron protein cycle; (6) antimicrobial action of amphiphilic aminoglycosides; and (7) the development of therapeutics for Amyloid Diseases.",
