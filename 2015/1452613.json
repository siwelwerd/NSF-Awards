A process known as Algal-Sludge Granule treatment uses larger particles which can be separated from the wastewater and, because of their size, settle more easily. The proposed process would occupy a smaller treatment footprint than many algae-based wastewater treatment systems and has the potential to be used as a bioenergy feedstock. The merits of this process make it compelling for adoption as a secondary treatment approach. However, this novel process is still in the early stages of development and much more knowledge is needed to understand the aggregation and function of these cross-kingdom granular biofilms. The PI will work with a teacher from the Clarke Schools for Hearing and Speech to build technical literacy in hearing-impaired students, using the highly visual components of Algal-Sludge Granules to teach concepts of mass-balance, environmental contamination and water and wastewater treatment. During the grant period as many as 60 undergraduates per year (300 total) could participate in new project-based learning and there is potential for more than 500 hearing-impaired students to gain exposure to environmental engineering curricula. \r\n\r\nThis proposed research will demonstrate: 1) the mechanisms of initial granulation, 2) the structural integrity of different granule morphologies and how physical characteristics relate to performance and microbial ecology, and, 3) the resiliency of Algal-Sludge Granules under conditions of stress. Before the discovery of Algal-Sludge Granules, using granules cultivated with both microalgae and bacteria in treatment systems was unprecedented. Large granules of phototrophs and bacteria are rarely observed in the environment. This study is an investigation of the characteristic and performance of a unique microbiological system where eukaryotes and prokaryotes exist through symbioses. This fundamental investigation will improve the understanding of cross-kingdom microbial interactions in a biofilm aggregate but also provide valuable information to advance a promising treatment technology towards implementation. At the point of initial granulation, the coordination of bacteria and phototrophs, by correlating the expression of quorum-sensing signaling molecules and lecithin proteins with dissolved oxygen concentrations, will be studied. The physical characteristics of three common Algal-Sludge Granule phenotypes by observing granule morphologies and measuring their yield strength in response to physical stresses imposed by a nano-compression instrument will be documented. The relation of the physical characteristics to microbial ecology through DNA-based molecular techniques and performance of different Algal-Sludge Granule phenotypes in bench-scale reactors will be studied. The functional redundancy and diffusion resistance leads to Algal-Sludge Granule resiliency under conditions of stress by investigating chemical fluxes using liquid-ion exchange and amperometric microsensors and correlating any changes in treatment performance to shifts microbial ecology will be demonstrated. The resulting data will build knowledge that will help inoculate, operate and validate Algal-Sludge Granule treatment, advancing Algal-Sludge Granule process toward implementation. This study will also define the relationships between phototrophs and bacteria in the context of meeting wastewater objectives, which until now is largely unexplored.",
