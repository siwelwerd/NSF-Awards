 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crustose coralline algae (CCA) are calcifying algae that are important to coastal stability, beach formation, and coral reef structure. There is growing concern that these organisms are sensitive to global climate change, which will have important consequences for coastal and reef stability. Despite their significance and sensitivity, their basic photosynthetic and calcification mechanisms are not well understood. In this project, the fellow will establish a better understanding of these mechanisms by studying CCA specimens along a latitudinal gradient in the Northeast Atlantic. The research will be conducted at the Max Planck Institute for Marine Microbiology in Bremen, Germany within the Microsensor Research Group led by Dr. Dirk de Beer. The activities and results of this project will be shared on a Blog and Facebook page to enhance public awareness of the project. Furthermore, the fellow will facilitate development of a Virtual CCA Research Group to foster communication among scientists world-wide working with CCA which will elevate the impacts of this project to a global scale. \r\n\r\nBoth field sampling and laboratory experiments are used to pursue the goals of the project, which are: 1) to determine the environmental factors influencing the stable carbon isotope signatures of Lithothamnion spp. along a latitudinal gradient, 2) to determine the plasticity of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) uptake mechanisms in response to light and temperature and 3) to determine how photosynthesis and calcification are linked to DIC uptake mechanisms. The latitudinal gradient consists of eight sampling locations in the North Atlantic from Svalbard to Cape Verde in the east and from Florida to the Caribbean in the west. The stable carbon isotope signatures of collected samples are measured to determine the plasticity of DIC uptake along the latitudinal gradient in relation to environmental conditions measured at long-term monitoring stations. In the lab, microsensors are used to measure pH, oxygen and calcium fluxes within the diffusive boundary layer (DBL) at the surface of the algae. Because DIC uptake depends heavily on the DBL, microsensors provide a unique method for determining the effects of temperature and light on photosynthesis and calcification within the microenvironment at the interface between the external seawater and the algal surface. Successful completion of the project will provide the first study on latitudinal patterns and the flexibility of DIC uptake mechanisms in a calcifying macroalga and will improve the scientific knowledge of the relationship between DIC uptake, photosynthesis and calcification under changing environmental conditions and across biogeographical ranges.",

As ecosystem engineers, they form extensive beds in shallow marine environments that provide important habitats and nurseries for marine organisms and contribute to carbonate sediment accumulation. There is growing concern that these organisms are sensitive to rising carbon dioxide levels, yet little is known about their physiology. Therefore, the main goal of this project was to establish a better understanding of how rhodoliths obtain the carbon they need for photosynthesis and calcification, and how these mechanisms are affected by different environmental conditions. I found that the carbon uptake mechanisms of rhodoliths in the northeast Atlantic are flexible and depend on environmental conditions, mainly dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations in the seawater. Arctic rhodoliths have unique physiological mechanisms that facilitate calcification and reduce the loss of inorganic carbon during long periods of darkness. Some rhodoliths are even able to take up organic carbon and nitrogen to supplement their energy demands. High carbon dioxide levels did not have a strong effect on photosynthesis, and the algae were able to maintain a chemical microenvironment on their surface conducive to calcification. The results of this project show that rhodoliths are robust organisms that optimize the use of available dissolved inorganic and organic compounds through flexible physiological mechanisms. This is an important first step in understanding the physiology of rhodoliths and why they have such an extensive biogeographical distribution. Additionally, the results suggest that some rhodoliths may be less sensitive to high carbon dioxide levels than previously thought. Results from this project and other researchers working on coralline  algae will be published in a special issue on coralline algae in the  open access journal Frontiers in Marine Science.</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of the project include the establishment of the Coralline Algae Network.
