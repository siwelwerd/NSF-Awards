 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biological processes function through extremely complex interactions of macromolecules that take place over an enormous range of timescales and molecular specificity. Controlled modification of biomolecules enables scientists to explore living systems, engineer new biological functions and generate new biomaterials. Currently the speed and selectivity of the reactions that modify (label) proteins in living and non-living systems limit the ability to study protein dynamics, processing and interactions as well as to engineer novel protein function. Development of an ideal reaction for labeling proteins that is selective in biological conditions and is fast enough to compete with natural biological processes will overcome many of the current limitations. Amino acids are building blocks of proteins and they are inserted in a precisely defined sequence during protein synthesis. Thus, genetically encoding a modified amino acid that contains the needed labeling reaction components and is incorporated into a protein allows for site-specific modification of proteins and enables many new research avenues and potential biotechnological applications.  In this project, a modified amino acid carrying a tetrazine group (which meets the demands of an ideal labeling reaction) will be incorporated into proteins.  The speed and specificity of reaction of this tetrazine-protein in both living and non-living systems permits coupling with a variety of markers targeted for different selected functions. This platform for expansion of the genetic code will be incorporated into undergraduate courses as an approach to teaching chemical biology and to illustrate how engineering the chemical modification of biopolymers is both possible and critical for understanding and manipulating their function.  An annual workshop will be held for high school science teachers and researchers (undergraduate, graduate and post-graduate)  to learn genetic code expansion methodology. \r\n\r\nThe ideal bioorthogonal ligation will be developed and key functional groups will be site-specifically incorporated into proteins via genetic code expansion. Tetrazine containing amino acids will be designed and synthesized to be highly reactive with strained trans-cyclooctene functionalities bearing labels, but selective unreactive with other cellular components. Tetrazine-amino acids will also be genetically incorporated into eukaryotes and prokaryotes and characterized. Tetrazine-protein stability and reaction rates will be measured for labeling and dimerizing proteins in vivo at sub-stoichiometric concentrations of label. This reaction has the potential to transform protein studies and protein engineering because it will be quantitative in vivo on biological time scales of seconds to minutes and at biological concentrations of tetrazine-protein and label. To demonstrate the utility of this bioorthogonal labeling reaction in vivo, key functions integral to two-component signaling systems will be switched on and off with precise control to understand their mechanism of regulating transcription.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.",
