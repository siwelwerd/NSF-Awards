 "awd_abstract_narration": "A free boundary is an interface between two materials like oil and water.  Another example is the curve outlining the wake of a boat. Yet another is the interface between plasma and ordinary matter in a fusion reactor.  Remarkably, the same mathematics of free boundaries that describes these physical phenomena can be used to design optimal shapes.  For example, when one wants to enclose an oven or pipe with insulating material, there is a shape that is optimal in the sense that the sum of the cost of insulation and the cost due to heat loss is minimized. Moreover, even farther from physics, one can seek optimal ways to divide data sets into yes/no regions according to rules that minimize the errors, that is, false positive or false negative identifications or diagnoses.  The overarching goal of this project is to reduce the complexity of the problem of searching for these optimal shapes.  The expectation is that there are broad classes of situations in which the optimal divider (free boundary) resembles a straight line or plane at an appropriate scale.  In those cases, one can be confident of finding a near optimal shape quickly.  In addition to conducting his own research, the PI has served and will serve as faculty advisor for research projects by dozens of undergraduates and high school students in programs at MIT.  Moreover, he has posted videos and lecture notes of a widely viewed single variable calculus course on MIT's Open Courseware site. He is currently working on an on-line course to be disseminated by MITx.\r\n\r\nFree boundaries arise as the interface between materials in which the materials retain some energy.  Typically, space is divided into level sets of some quantity like temperature or pressure.  In contrast, the interface represented by a minimal surface lives in an ambient space that is empty.  Despite this difference between these two types of interfaces, there are profound connections between them.  The main goal of this project is to show that interfaces and level sets of least energy for a wide variety of problems are as simple as possible. The PI proposes that the level sets of optimizers resemble parallel planes in that these surfaces are connected and cleanly separated. Usually, methods from the more developed theory of minimal surfaces have guided the study of free boundaries, but here ideas from the theory of free boundaries will guide the study of minimal surfaces. The proposal also gives a pathway to proving analogous simple behavior of level sets of the least energy Neumann eigenfunction for a convex symmetric domain.  This would yield an important case of the longstanding ``hot spots'' conjecture of J. Rauch.  A second project is to identify the cases of equality in the celebrated Alexandrov-Fenchel inequalities in convex geometry.  The PI will use a geometric approach based on establishing new properties, of independent interest, of the Brenier (optimal transportation) mapping. A third project is aimed at developing a highly accurate description of localization of eigenfunctions and quantum tunneling, relevant to the design of LEDs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the main outcomes of this project concerns shapes of free boundaries and minimal surfaces. Free boundaries correspond to interfaces between materials like oil and water or plasma and its surroundings.  Minimal surfaces, which are studied using different,  but analogous,  techniques,  correspond to interfaces like soap bubbles.  Quite apart from physical models, a mathematically related type of interface is one that divides a data set into yes/no regions according to rules that minimize false positive or false negative identifications or diagnoses.  Moreover, as the research in this project has shown, understanding the shapes of free boundaries and minimal surfaces leads to new approaches to the shapes of eigenfunctions via their contour lines.  \n\nA centerpiece of the theory of free boundaries is an estimate from the 1980s for the so-called Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman functional, which leads to connectednees, smoothness, and stability of free boundaries. The PI proved the analogue of this estimate when the ACF functional is restricted from all of space to a convex cone.  An important feature of the new inequality is that, in addition to it being best possible,the extremals (cases of equality) are identified with input functions whose  level sets are hyperplanes.  The PI also proved theorems that extend classic results from the 1970s for area-minimizing surfaces defined on all Euclidean space to ones that are confined to convex domains.  The most important qualitative property he established is that the surfaces are connected, and the most important quantitative property is called a Harnack inequality.  \n\n\nThe PI proposed in his paper ``The Two Hyperplane Conjecture\" that Harnack inequalities for minimal surfaces and free boundaries should have parallels for level sets (contour lines) of eigenfunctions.  He related these results to two long-standing conjectures, the ``Hot Spots\" conjecture concerning the first excited eigenfunction of a convex domain and the KLS hyperplane conjecture concerning the corresponding eigenvalue.  After that publication, the PI discovered a new variational principle that says that from one level set of an eigenfunction to the next, the flux decreases the same way mean curvature flow decreases surface area. This has opened the possibility of sharp Harnack inequalities using geometric methods analogous to the brilliant work of Hamilton and Perelman on mean curvature flow and Ricci flow, resolving the Poincare Conjecture.   The  PI has begun pursuing this prospect by finding new geometric invariants of level sets which match the structure of level sets of eigenfunctions.\n\nIn other directions, the PI wrote two papers about shapes of eigenfunctions and distribution of eigenvalues in disodered media that were already in the works under the preceding grant.  These introduce a new effective potential, called the landscape, which accounts for effects of quantum wells and quantum tunnelling.   New numerical work shows that in two dimensions, this effective potential predicts the shape of the ground state eigenfunction to 13 orders of magnitude.  Finally, the PI proved quantitative stability theorems for the Brunn-Minkowksi inequality and Freiman sum-set inequality, showing that when the inequalities are close to equality, the corresponding sets are close to the extremal configuration. \n\n\nAs for broader impacts, the eigenvalue estimates arising from the PI's study of the effective potential have already significantly improved numerical methods that simulate the performance of LEDs (semiconductors composed of GaN doped with Indium).  The PI is participating in the interdisciplinary Simons Collaboration on Waves in Disorder, with a primary focus on shapes of eigenfunctions and how these predict the performance of LEDs.  In another direction, the KLS Conjecture mentioned above is motivated by questions in theoretical computer science. \n\n\nDuring the grant period, the PI supervised one NSF postdoctoral fellow, Max Englestein,  and supported four graduate students, Jackson Hance, Ricardo Grande Izquierdo, Ethan Jaffe, and Hong Wang. He supervised research by five MIT undergraduates directly and, in addition, organized and supervised well over 100 summer research projects from 2016 to 2020 for high school and undergraduate students in MIT math programs known as RSI, SPUR, SPUR+, and UROP+.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David S Jerison"
