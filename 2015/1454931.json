 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern society is critically reliant on rotation sensing technologies, as evidenced by gyroscopes which regulate cellular phones, ships and airplanes, and global positioning system satellites. This CAREER project aims to meet the continuing demand for better optical sensing of mechanical rotation currently posed by a variety of fields such as nanoscience, precision measurement, remote sensing, and quantum computing. The activity addresses these demands by combining powerful sensing paradigms from the field of linear motion detection with the ability of light to carry orbital angular momentum. It will provide theoretical solutions which can be implemented using available technologies. The ultimate objectives of this research are to develop techniques for measuring mechanical rotation at the quantum level, and thus to identify and to circumvent the limits placed by quantum mechanics on the sensor capabilities. These activities are concomitant with strong technological impact on society, since they aim to establish the route for taking rotation sensor technology to its limits.\r\n\r\nThis research project will investigate the sensing of nanomechanical rotation in the quantum regime. The proposed sensors will find hitherto undetected torques created by the electromagnetic vacuum, characterize rotational quantum states of macroscopic mechanical systems, allow the nondestructive study of quantized superflow in quantum gases, and measure the rotation of single atoms. The main ideas will combine the established techniques of vibrational optomechanics with the capabilities of optical beams carrying orbital angular momentum. The specific methods will draw on the toolbox of quantum optics and atomic physics techniques. The research program will be integrated with an education plan which includes collaborative visits for students to the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, introduction of the orbital angular momentum of light into the undergraduate Quantum Optics laboratory at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), and exhibition of rotational toys to the public vis-\u00e0-vis the yearly Imagine RIT event as well as the Science Saturdays at the Rochester Museum and Science Center.",
