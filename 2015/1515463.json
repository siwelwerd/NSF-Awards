 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ambient air pollution is a major environmental risk factor responsible for millions of premature mortality worldwide. Epidemiological studies investigating the relationship between air pollution and adverse health outcomes often use government-run, central air monitors to assign exposures to study subjects. This approach is limited, especially in urban settings, where air pollution levels can vary substantially between times (e.g. morning rush hour vs. noon) and between short distances (e.g. near highway vs. nearby park). Small, inexpensive, and mobile smartphone monitors with location tracking capabilities offer a new approach to measure air pollution levels and obtain accurate personal level exposure assessments. In this proposed project, a novel smartphone technology will be utilized to measure fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations in Seoul, South Korea. The project will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Ho Kim, an expert in air pollution epidemiology and statistics, at Seoul National University.\r\n\r\nThe collected data from this project will additionally be used to create a prediction model using land use regression methods, where geographic variables such as highways and parks are used to predict air pollution concentration levels. The large volume and robustness of smartphone-generated data can improve the spatiotemporal predictive powers of prediction models by increasing their spatial resolution and allowing inclusion of time-varying variables. The constructed model will also be compared to results from New York City, providing a unique opportunity to evaluate factors commonly or uniquely contributing to elevated air pollution levels in two major metropolitan cities. In exploring a brand new, state-of-the-art technology that has not been tested or assessed in current literature, this project has the potential to greatly impact future environmental epidemiology study designs and provide a better understanding of advantages and limitations of smartphone monitors. This award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.",
