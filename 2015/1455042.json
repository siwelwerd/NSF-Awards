 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will use the latest observational and theoretical techniques to determine the basic properties for disks of gas and dust around young stars and extend existing circumstellar disk models to include a more physically realistic disk structure.  Planets form out of flattened disks of gas and dust that surround young stars. It is thought that the dust in these disks grows and eventually forms rocky planets, or cores which accrete gas to become gas giant planets. The PI and her team will test existing models by measuring important properties of the dust and gas in over 100 circumstellar disks around young stars. She will use new and archival data from several ground- and space-based telescopes and then use the data to improve the planet formation models.   This project also has an educational component focused on the lack of women in permanent STEM positions, particularly minority women. The project will create a mentoring program for women postdoctoral research scientists to help increase the number of women that go on to attain permanent positions in STEM. The program will be based on mentoring circles that meet on a regular basis to help members set development goals and teach skills to meet the goals.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe project has three main research goals, which are to 1) determine the basic properties (ie, dust sizes and settling, mass accretion rates) for disks around young stars, 2) extend the circumstellar disk model to include more physically realistic disk structure, and 3) create models of circumplanetary disks embedded within circumstellar disks.  The work will be carried out by modeling Spitzer infrared and Herschel submillimeter spectra of 100 disks, obtaining new U-band photometry of 400 young stars, modifying a circumstellar disk model to incorporate spatially variable disk structure and using it to do detailed fits of seven disks with SMA/ALMA archival data. The group?s circumstellar disk model will be adapted for use with circumplanetary disks and then compared with observations obtained from the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and ALMA.",

This work resulted in 12 peer-reviewed publications.\n\n \n\nWe used circumstellar disk simulations to model broad-band spectral energy distributions and ALMA (sub)millimeter images to identify and constrain the properties of ring substructures in disks.  We reported that not all disks are entirely optically thick in the (sub)millimeter and so disk dust masses have been underestimated in the literature.  We also used ALMA data of the dust continuum and (sub)millimeter emission lines to study the connection between disk chemistry and disk dust properties.\n\n \n\nWe studied how mass from the protoplanetary disk accretes onto the central star using optical light curves and simulations.  We created synthetic light curves to compare to the optical data to explain the cause of variability in these systems.  We also measured the rate at which matter is accreted onto the stellar surface and the details of the hot spot that forms on the surface of young stars.\n\n \n\nThe broader impact goal of this project was to help increase the retention of minority women in Astronomy and women in STEM.
