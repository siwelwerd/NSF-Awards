 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the \"Rocky Mountain Dynamical Systems Conference,\" held on June 8-11, 2015, in Provo, Utah. The mathematical field of dynamical systems provides fundamental ideas and tools for the modeling, analysis, and prediction of complex phenomena. Theoretical development in nonlinear dynamics has been in the forefront in many areas of scientific endeavor such as environmental fluid dynamics, geophysical flows, climate dynamics, networks of neurons, genetics, and physiology.  The purpose of this conference is to nurture high quality scientific activity, to strengthen scientific collaboration, and to stimulate interest among young scientists, students, and those from underrepresented groups working in the field of dynamical systems.  \r\n\r\nAs the discipline of dynamical systems has matured, it has divided into many subfields such as smooth, topological, complex, Hamiltonian, symbolic, ergodic, etc. However, solutions to important dynamical problems increasingly require techniques from various areas of mathematics, and progress in the field will be catalyzed by more collaborative research. The conference will not focus on a specific area of dynamical systems, but instead will invite speakers from diverse areas in the subject.  This will help provide a venue to develop collaborations from various research areas within dynamical systems.\r\n\r\nConference web page:  math.byu.edu/~tfisher/sites/rmdsc15index.html",
