The confirmed speakers are  Alessio Figalli, Nader Masmoudi, Vitali Milman and Laure Saint-Raymond. The award  gives young researchers without other funding the opportunity to participate at the conference.  The organizing committee plans to strive to make this funding opportunity known to the target groups by mailing lists, posters and advertisements in professional organizations. More information will be made available at http://www.math.umn.edu/conferences/riv_fabes/",
