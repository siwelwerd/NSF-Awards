 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proton is one of the building blocks of everyday matter, with protons in the core of every atom.  The proton is in turn made of subnuclear particles known as quarks and gluons.  The project supported by this award will improve our understanding of the proton's internal structure, with a focus on the dynamical behavior of the constituent quarks.  High-energy particle accelerator facilities at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) will be used to perform the research.  A beam of protons will be accelerated to high energy and strike a liquid hydrogen target; the nucleus of a hydrogen atom is comprised of a single proton.  Measurement of the particles produced in the collisions will provide information on the behavior of the quarks in their parent protons.\r\n\r\nThe efforts supported by this award will additionally serve to increase diversity among young scientists trained as nuclear physicists.  Training the next generation of nuclear physicists is critical to maintain expertise relevant to the nation's energy and defense needs and to continue advancing both applied and non-applied research in nuclear physics and technology.  In each year of this award a student from Mount Holyoke College, an undergraduate institution for women, will be given the opportunity to perform summer research in nuclear physics at Fermilab.  Furthermore, this award will provide tuition, salary, and travel support for an African-American graduate student.  In addition to supporting his dissertation research, he will receive support to travel once per semester to his alma mater, Howard University, a historically black university, to speak with current physics undergraduates about his experience and progress pursuing a Ph.D. in nuclear physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe proton is one of the building blocks of everyday matter, with protons in the core of every atom.  The proton is in turn made of subnuclear particles known as quarks and gluons, as well as antimatter particles known as antiquarks.  The project supported by this award improved our understanding of the proton's internal structure.  High-energy particle accelerator facilities at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) were used to perform the research, as part of the SeaQuest experiment.  A beam of protons was accelerated to high energy and struck targets of liquid hydrogen, liquid deuterium, and solid carbon, iron, and tungsten.  The nucleus of a hydrogen atom is comprised of a single proton, that of a deuterium atom of a proton and a neutron, and the nuclei of carbon, iron, and tungsten have increasing numbers of protons and neutrons.  Measurement of the particles produced in the collisions provided information on the behavior of the quarks and antiquarks in their parent protons and neutrons.  In particular, this project discovered that there is an asymmetry in the types of antiquarks in the proton for antiquarks carrying as much as 45% of the proton's momentum.  This experimental result has prompted new questions about what generates this asymmetry, which are still being explored theoretically.\n\nA second aspect of the project supported by this award studied how quarks and gluons, when scattered at high energies, produce new bound states such as protons and other particles that interact via the strong nuclear force, known in general as hadrons.  The Large Hadron Collider accelerator facility at the European Centre for Nuclear Research (CERN) was used to perform the research, as part of the LHCb experiment.  A measurement was performed to investigate how scattered quarks produce new bound states and compared to similar measurements for scattered gluons.  It was found that high-energy scattered quarks produce conical sprays of new bound states that are narrower than those produced by scattered gluons.  It was additionally found that quarks are more likely than gluons to produce a bound state carrying a very high fraction of the momentum of the original scattered quark or gluon.  Higher-energy scattered quarks produced more new bound states than lower-energy quarks, with nearly all of the additional particle production very close to the original direction of the scattered quark.\n\nThe efforts supported by this award furthermore served to increase diversity among young scientists trained as nuclear physicists.  Training the next generation of nuclear physicists is critical to maintain expertise relevant to the nation's energy and defense needs and to continue advancing both applied and non-applied research in nuclear physics and technology.  Over the course of this award, four students from Mount Holyoke College, an undergraduate institution for women, were given the opportunity to perform summer research in nuclear physics at the University of Michigan.
