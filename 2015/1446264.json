 "awd_abstract_narration": "A Comprehensive Multi-Scale Study of the Impact of Capillary-Held Water Films on Fluid Motion, Transport and Mass Transfer in the Unsaturated Zone\r\n\r\nThe knowledge resulting from the project could ultimately lead to improved models for a wide range of unsaturated phenomena important to practical hydrologic, agricultural, and environmental applications, including prediction of water infiltration into soils and flooding during heavy rainfalls, remediating polluted soils and groundwaters, and movement of fertilizers, pesticides, etc. When water drains out of a porous medium, films of water remain behind on solid grain surfaces.  For this reason, water films are ubiquitous in the unsaturated zone under dry conditions, and they play a central role in a wide range of phenomena.  Although the magnitude of water film area is substantial, sustained mass transfer at air-water interfaces depends on the extent to which films on solid surfaces are  hydraulically connected and mobile enough to be replenished from bulk porewater.  Recent information has shown that water films on solid grain surfaces are likely orders of magnitude thicker than previously thought, and that their configuration and thickness are dominated by the roughness of solid grain surfaces.  The implication of this finding is that flow and transport in water films on solid grain surfaces are likely far greater than previously thought.  However, very little quantitative information is available on how flow and transport occur in grain surface-associated water films.  This project is aimed at addressing this critical knowledge gap.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed work will combine experimental work spanning a range of cutting-edge techniques with a modeling effort to arrive at a quantitative, predictive understanding of the behavior of capillary-held water films in the unsaturated zone. Experiments and simulations will be conducted at scales ranging from the nanoscale to the grain cluster scale. Stereoscopic SEM will be used to create highly detailed surface roughness maps of real grains and grain clusters, and confocal microscopy techniques will be used to study the impact of external inputs (capillary pressure, evaporation) on dynamic film configuration, flow, and advective transport. Work will be focused around four tightly-coupled tasks designed to test the hypotheses of the work, and then explore the implications of the observed sub-pore-scale film phenomena on REV and field scale behaviors.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was centered on exploring the role of movement in water films on transport in unsaturated porous media.  Water films are present throughout the unsaturated zone of the subsurface, and dominate a range of phenomena that occur there.  Recent evidence suggests that capillary-held water films are likely substantially thicker than previously thought, suggesting that motion in capillary-held films may play an important role in transport and mass transfer in the unsaturated zone.\n\nThe project explored the effect of water films through a range of experiments and numerical simulations, ranging from the grain surface scale to the continuum scale.  Experiments at the grain surface scale explored the effect of grain surface morphology on the wicking of water onto initially dry surfaces, finding that both flow rates and flow patterns on individual grains were predicted by the arrangement and magnitude of surface roughness.  Evaporation experiments on single grains showed that evaporation-driven flow at the grain scale led to flow towards high points on grain surfaces, a behavior that was attributed to the spatial mismatch between evaporative water loss and the film configuration dictated by capillary forces.  The effect could be predicted through numerical simulation.\n\nAt the grain cluster scale, it was observed that evaporation-driven flow produced complex, constantly-changing flow patterns in unsaturated grain clusters, but ultimately drove flow towards contact lines where the air/water interface met the solid surface.  This phenomenon is an important factor that can lead to deposition of suspended nanoparticles and colloids on grain surfaces during evaporation, even under conditions where the surface chemistry favors high nanoparticle mobility.\n\nFinally, at the continuum scale, it was found that long term evaporation appears to change the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation, with drainage capillary pressure-saturation curves gradually approaching imbibition curves after hundreds of days of evaporation.  The rate of evaporation and accessibility of a porous medium to evaporative mass transfer were observed to have a strong impact on this behavior.  The results of the work conducted for this project may ultimately improve our ability to predict unsaturated and multiphase flow-related phenomena at a range of scales in natural and engineered porous media.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/04/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tohren C Kibbey"
