Microemulsions are solutions of aggregated surfactants in water, and they are used in pharmaceutical drug delivery to increase solubility, reduce toxicity, and control the rate of drug release.  Polymer gels are water-filled networks of thread-like molecules, and they are used in gel chromatography and membrane filtration to separate molecules.  Fibrous gels shrink or swell in response to changes in the liquid between the fibers, which strongly affects their function in ways that are not understood.  The investigators will use an optical technique to measure rates of molecular movement in microemulsions and polymer gels.  Data will be compared with theory to improve theoretical models for these complex systems.\r\n\r\nThe diffusion of a hydrophobic solute in the presence of micelles or surfactant aggregates will be measured.  In such systems, localized interactions in the interior of the aggregates strongly affect diffusion rates of the solute and the surfactant.  Strong solute-matrix interactions also occur in polymer gels, in which polymer fibers hinder solute motion, and solute molecules may induce gel swelling or shrinkage.  Diffusion rates in microemulsions and shrinking and swelling in polymer hydrogels will be measured by holographic interferometry, an optical method for monitoring changes in concentration in transparent solutions and gels.  Taylor diffusiometry, solid phase microextraction, single-photon counting fluorescence spectroscopy, and osmometry will also be used to measure physical properties needed to compare data to theoretical descriptions of these processes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe movement of molecules through liquid solutions is an important part of many processes, both within physiological systems such as the human digestive tract, and in industrial processes.  Understanding the features of molecules, and interactions between molecules, that determine how fast they move is important to developing many new technologies.  For example, it does little good to ingest a medication that does not move through the lining of the digestive tract and into the bloodstream, either because the molecule does not dissolve in water-based solutions or is rejected by cells of the stomach and intestinal walls.  In this research project, we studied how interactions between specific types of molecules affect their rate of diffusion, or movement through liquids that is not caused by flow.  \n \nThe molecules we studied were surfactants and hydrophobic solutes.  The surfactant molecules are partially hydrophilic, or ?water-loving?, and partially hydrophobic, or ?water-hating.?  In a water-based solution they therefore form spherical ?micelles,? in which the center consists of the hydrophobic part of the surfactant and the outer shell the hydrophilic part.  These micelles are naturally forming, nanometer-sized containers with a central core that is capable of carrying hydrophobic molecules that are normally not soluble in water.  Their presence therefore permits hydrophobic molecules to dissolve in water, a very useful property since many drugs and food flavors are hydrophobic.  Because the hydrophobic solutes in these micelles are nearly all closely interacting with with hydrophobic part of the surfactant molecules, the movements of these two types of molecules through water solutions are closely coupled in surprisingly complicated ways.  We measured these effects experimentally, and developed a new theory that describes our results very successfully.\n \nThe experimental data we obtained, and the theory that explains it, were presented in national scientific conferences, and were reviewed and published in archival, scientific journals such as Langmuir, Soft Matter, and the Journal of Fluid Mechanics.  That work will therefore add to the foundation for future work of its type.  All of the funding for this project was used for equipment and supplies for the work, and to support one post-doctoral researcher, and one graduate student who will complete his doctoral dissertation by March 2021.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ronald J Phillips"
