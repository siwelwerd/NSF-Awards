 "awd_abstract_narration": "Residential segregation is an important reality for different demographic groups in the United States.  Yet we do not know whether such segregation extends to the places where people go during the course of their daily lives.  We also do not know how everyday travel to different neighborhoods affects individuals and groups in ways that might increase or diminish segregation.  This research seeks to address these gaps by studying segregation in motion, throughout people?s daily routine activities in relation to neighborhood experiences.  We ask three fundamental questions: (1) do the areas where people go during the course of their days vary demographically and by the type of neighborhood where they live?; (2) do the areas that different social groups go to during their days vary systematically in terms of their available resources and social diversity?; and (3) how do people?s experiences of the neighborhoods they go to, including how welcome they feel and how they perceive access to resources, vary by their race, ethnicity, economic status, and the type of neighborhood they live in?  \r\n\r\nTo address these questions, we will implement and evaluate an app for smartphones to collect \"live\" information on people's movement and neighborhood experiences as they happen.  We will assess the feasibility of obtaining immediate explicit and implicit (nonconscious) measures of experiences in a place using the smartphone app.  Pilot data will be collected for a small set of respondents.  We will use these data to develop measures of mobile segregation and indicators of how people, in the moment, perceive their surroundings and opportunities in the places they go.  Detailed evaluation of the app, its use in the field, and the ability to gain cooperation with the selected sample will allow us to determine whether the methods for collecting dynamic data during the course of everyday social life can be used in larger representative samples.  Using cutting-edge mobile technology to collect such data will overcome the risk of recall biases in research that uses surveys or daily diaries to measure how people spend their time and experience their surroundings.  \r\n\r\nThis research will have broad impacts in a several important ways.  Obtaining data on how people explicitly and implicitly experience the places they visit, and how those experiences encourage or discourage them from going to certain locales, can help inform policy interventions that incentivize contact across demographic groups.  The open source smartphone app developed in the course of this research will be shared with other researchers to advance knowledge on the connections between social, spatial, and cognitive processes and should have broad application beyond the specific study of social segregation in daily life.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSegregation by race, ethnicity, and income in the neighborhoods where people in the United States live is substantial with many well-known consequences.  This project developed and tested a software application for use on mobile devices (an app) to determine whether such segregation in the places people live extends to segregation in the places they visit in the course of daily life.  The app also collects information about people?s personal experiences in those places, and their reflections about the effects of these everyday social and cultural experiences.  Do members of some social groups regularly go to places where they feel more unwelcome or out of place, and what effect does this have on their access to opportunities and resources in those places?\n\nOur app collects three types of data.  First, it obtains global positioning system (GPS) data throughout the day as respondents carry out their regular daily activities to collect information about their spatial locations.  Second, the app prompts respondents to answer brief 2-3 minute surveys up to four times per day about their perceptions of the place they are in and their feelings in that location at that time.  Third, the app prompts respondents to complete tests of implicit measures of feelings of comfort at home, work, or in other locations several times a day; these tests should capture feelings about place that are outside of conscious awareness and control.\n\nWe successfully conducted a pilot test of our app with 20 individuals to evaluate its use on people?s own mobile phones.  These participants included an equal number of men and women.  Participants were White, Black, Latinx, and Asian, and lived in both low and high poverty neighborhoods.  All participants used the app for seven days during which the three types of data the app collected was uploaded automatically to a highly secure server. \n\nOur pilot study demonstrated the possibility of gaining cooperation from a diverse set of community members for participation in this type of in-depth, weeklong research project.  It also showed two key findings.  First, we can map where people go across a full week and we find substantial variation in the types of places that people in a diverse sample visit.  The small number of individuals in the pilot sample did not allow us to examine segregation in daily movement by race, ethnicity, and economic status, but the pilot shows the potential for this type of research in future studies.  Second, we find that individuals? implicit feelings of comfort vary across the different places people are when they take the implicit (beneath their awareness) test.  This is an important new finding showing that implicit feelings of comfort are not stable traits of individuals.\n\nThis project also has broader impacts. The successful development of the app demonstrates that daily, in-the-moment, data connected with information on where people go, can be collected over extended periods.  We anticipate that this type of information can inform policy interventions to reduce inequalities beyond those centered in where people live.  We also facilitate and encourage future research by making the open-source smartphone app developed in the course of the project publically available for others to build on.  We anticipate others can use the app in studies of where people go and how they socially, culturally, and cognitively experience the environments where they spend time (https://github.com/profjanne/NSF1520778public).  Finally, this project sought to promote diversity in the social sciences through training graduate students and advancing the career of co-investigators.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/07/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lauren J Krivo"
