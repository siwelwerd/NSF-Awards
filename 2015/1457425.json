COSEPUP has a charge 'to deliberate on initiatives for new studies in the area of science and technology policy, taking especially into account the concerns and requests of the President's Science Advisor, the Director of the NSF, the Chairman of the National Science Board, and the chairmen of key science and technology-related committees of the Congress.' Its work has addressed issues of critical importance to Federal Agencies and the Nation. \r\n\r\nKey issues that COSEPUP is addressing or has recently addressed include maintaining the excellence of human resources for U.S. science and engineering research, promoting effective management of U.S. federal research investments, and ensuring research integrity and the responsible conduct of research. Since its inception, the National Science Foundation has supported COSEPUP activities. This award will provide funds for core support of COSEPUP, to continue its work as an independent advisor on issues relating to national science and technology policy.\r\n",
