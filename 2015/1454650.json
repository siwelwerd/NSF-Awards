 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program grant will study post-disaster housing recovery, using the micro-level of households' reconstruction decisions. It examines how those decisions are affected by a confluence of quantifiable internal and external control variables and propagated to influence community recovery. Anticipated exponential increases in future extreme events coupled with the growing population in disaster-prone regions has created an urgent need for better understanding of the process of disaster recovery and more effective strategies to enhance it. While many studies have focused on assessing the economic impacts of disasters or estimating its losses on a macro-level, very few, if any, have focused on modeling the collective actions taken by households which is deemed to be the key to community-wide recovery. The results from this research will have a broad impact, as they can be instrumental to the members of recovery assistance framework in prioritizing and integrating policies to enhance post-disaster recovery. The multidisciplinary nature of this research and its diversified pedagogy together with its embedded social interaction protocols will allow for a more effective research, teaching and a broader involvement of underrepresented groups as well as multiple stakeholders in related research. \r\n\r\nThis research is aimed at contributing fundamental knowledge on the collective nature of households' community-wide recovery. This research will develop a GIS-enabled agent-based behavioral model of collective post-disaster housing recovery by capturing the micro-level dynamics of households' behavior within a broader socioeconomic context of their community. Both internal and external control variables will be examined. Internal control variables include households' demographics, social networks, experience, socio-economic, psychosocial factors, and disaster exposure. External control variables refer to activities that can influence households' recovery decisions and include the activities of members of the recovery assistance framework aimed at restoring economy and lifeline infrastructure and providing financial incentives along with any housing recovery activities by neighbors creating spatiotemporal effects. The project will integrate agent-based modeling, GIS, and game theory to help decipher the impact of households' interactions on the collective recovery of an affected community. This bottom-up approach will allow for simulation of interactions among households to mimic real events. These simulations will enable policyholders to assess the efficacy of their recovery policies through the developed model. The behavioral model will be modular, scalable, and can be easily extended to any type of disaster.",

More specifically, prior to development of the agent-based model, sensitivity of households to various recovery-triggering cues was explored in which they were clustered into three groups each making recovery decisions based on either \"reconstruction of community assets\" (e.g., churches, schools), \"reconstruction of neighboring housing units\", or \"restoration of infrastructures\". The next step was to examine the influence of various householder-specific attributes such as demographics, and socioeconomic status on driving the householder into one of the preidentified groups. Once householders were characterized by how they would make recovery decisions, the agent-based framework was developed, calibrated/verified, and validated using real data from Hurricane Sandy. In RECOVUS the recovery process starts with checking for households' recovery affordability (flood insurance, FEMA assistance, etc.), and continues with aacounting for the group they belong. The next is their decision to either reconstruct, wait, or sell which is calibrated using real data. These outcomes can readily be used to explore the sensitivity of community recovery through various interventions and collectively help with an enhanced community recovery.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/18/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ali&nbsp;Nejat</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
