 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Measurement & Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Paul Flowers of the Department of Chemistry & Physics at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke is developing new devices and protocols for the chemical analysis of very small samples. This research creates new tools and methodology for microscale chemical analysis that offer advantages in analysis time, cost and sample size requirement relative to comparable existing techniques. The project employs undergraduate assistants selected from a diverse population that is 16% American Indian and 33% African American, engaging significant numbers of students in ethnic and racial groups that are presently underrepresented in the nation's scientific workforce. Curricular laboratory activities directly related to the research are being developed and integrated into existing chemistry courses at the sophomore and senior levels, significantly broadening the educational impact of the project.\r\n\r\nSpectroelectrochemistry (SEC) refers to the simultaneous application of spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques and typically involves making spectral measurements on samples undergoing electrolysis. Since the first reports of SEC in the 1960s, these techniques have become well-established tools for characterizing the redox properties of chemical species and elucidating the mechanisms of electrode processes. A more recent and growing effort is directed towards the use of SEC as the basis for quantitative chemical analyses, essentially replacing the chemical reagents used in conventional assays with an inert, nonexpendable electrode. Professor Flowers'group has previously developed a prototype device that permits SEC analysis of sample volumes well below one microliter, roughly two-orders of magnitude lesser than any other reported device. In this project, the basic design of this prototype is being adapted to permit flow analyses of microliter and sub-microliter samples. Simple polymer casting techniques are being utilized to fabricate these flow cells, and their performance is being evaluated using voltammetry, coulometry, chronoabsorptometry and voltabsorptometry. In parallel to the device fabrication work, microscale assays that exploit SEC measurement strategies are being developed for selected compounds of biological and biomedical relevance.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe discipline of analytical chemistry is broadly concerned with the development of instruments and methodologies for chemical analysis, tools that are essential to nearly every area of science and technology.  Microscale techniques capable of analyzing very small sample volumes are increasingly important for many applications, and a considerable, on-going research effort is directed towards increasing the inventory of such techniques.  This NSF-funded project involved the design and characterization of novel devices for the chemical analysis of microscale samples, and the development of new quantitative methods for metabolites and pharmaceuticals in various sample matrices.  These new devices and methods employ a measurement strategy called spectroelectrochemistry, SEC, that entails measuring spectroscopic signals (for example, light absorbance) for samples undergoing electrolysis.  Though SEC methods are well established for fundamental studies of electrolysis and related phenomena, their use in quantitative chemical analysis is much less common.  Potential advantages associated with using SEC techniques for such purposes include improved selectivity and decreased analysis time, cost, and chemical waste.\n\nIntellectual Merit.  A novel microscale SEC device that permits the analysis of sample volumes as low as ~0.3 &micro;L was designed, fabricated and characterized.  This device is constructed using common materials and lab equipment, accommodates convenient syringe-loading of samples, and can completely electrolyze minimum-volume samples in ~ 3 min.  SEC assays for several substances were developed during the grant period, including acetaminophen in pharmaceutical products and human serum; vitamin C in nutritional supplements and fruit juices; and uric acid in human urine.  The analytical performance of these new assays was generally demonstrated to be comparable to existing assays with regard to sensitivity and selectivity, and superior with regard to analysis time, cost, and chemical waste.  At the end of the grant period, four separate manuscripts describing the work summarized here were being prepared for submission to peer-reviewed journals.  Also, a curricular lab experiment for sophomore analytical chemistry related to this project's research was developed and published in a peer-reviewed chemistry education journal.\n\nBroader Impacts.  This project was conducted by the PI and undergraduate research assistants in the on-campus laboratories of the UNCP Chemistry &amp; Physics Department, which offers only baccalaureate degrees in Chemistry.  Over the duration of this award, sixteen (16) undergraduates were engaged in the project, contributing their efforts to the design and execution of experimental work; the archiving and analysis of experimental results; the preparation and presentation of poster summaries; and the drafting of journal manuscripts.  These undergraduates represented a diversity of ethnic backgrounds, including one (1) American Indian; six (6) Black / African American; four (4) Asian; and five (5) White.  At the conclusion of this award, seven (7) of the student assistants were continuing their undergraduate studies and nine (9) had graduated.  Of the graduates, two (2) began doctoral degree programs in chemistry; two (2) began doctor of pharmacy programs; one (1) began a doctor of medicine program; and four (4) secured employment in industry.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/04/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul A Flowers"
