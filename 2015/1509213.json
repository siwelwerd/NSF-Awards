 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to synthesize certain ideas coming from two rather distinct subjects in geometry and topology: persistent homology, which was created as a tool for studying the topological structure of data sets; and symplectic Floer theory, which concerns certain properties of the geometric transformations (\"Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms\") that underlie classical mechanics. Despite their different origins, it has recently been appreciated that persistent homology and symplectic Floer theory share key algebraic structures, and the time is ripe to exploit these parallels and apply the insights gained during the separate developments of these two subjects over the last several years in order to learn more about each of them. In particular, methods from persistent homology will make it possible to prove new results about a natural geometry on the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms and about the relationships between the fixed points of different Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms. \r\n\r\nThe starting point for this work will be recent results that adapted the construction of \"barcodes\" from persistent homology to the context of Floer theory over Novikov fields by using a novel approach involving non-Archimedean singular value decompositions, and proved a version of the Bottleneck Stability Theorem for these new barcodes. Building on this algebraic foundation, the investigator expects to express and generalize the notion of extended persistence in a way that allows one to streamline arguments involving action windows in Floer theory; among other things this may lead to new proofs of Conley conjecture-type results and generalizations of recent work on autonomous Hamiltonians. The project will also study the properties of certain symplectic capacities built from filtered Floer-theoretic invariants, leading to new relations between lower bounds for the Hofer norm and the properties of periodic orbits of Hamiltonian systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe first contribution of the project was a long joint paper by the PI and his then-graduate student Jun Zhang which showed, in very general terms, how to understand certain constructions in symplectic topology using the perspective of persistent homology--a tool that had been developed in the very different discipline of topological data analysis.  This philosophy has since been fruitful both within the context of the rest of the project and in work by others; in practice, it often allows one to quickly identify the particular information that can be useful in solving a given problem even in situations where the way that the information is usually presented is rather opaque.  \n\nA major theme in the rest of the project concerned relationships between the different ways of embeddding one shape into another in the context of symplectic geometry.  Inspired partly by persistent homology, one can define a distance between shapes based on the notion that two shapes A and B are close to each other if there are symplectic embeddings that fit either one of the shapes into a slight dilation of the other.  In fact there are two different natural definitions of this distance, distinguished by whether or not one asks for the two embeddings (of A into a dilate of B and of B into a dilate of A) to be compatible with each other in a natural way.  A surprising discovery of the project was that although the two possible definitions appear quite similar they sometimes lead to dramatically different results--it can happen that A is extremely close to B using one of the definitions but is extremely far away from B using the other.  The distinction between these distances led to the discovery, in joint work of the PI with his then-postdoctoral advisee Jean Gutt, that, for many four-dimensional shapes A such as a cube as depicted in the figure, there are ways of embedding A into a dilation of itself that are \"knotted\" in the sense that the image of the embedding cannot be deformed back into the original version of A without leaving the dilate of A that contains both of them.  \n\nThe project was a key part of the training of three doctoral students.
