 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical: This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to California Institute of Technology is to explore new strategies for the design of tough, soft, protein-based materials.  The materials of interest are hydrogels, polymeric materials that are highly swollen by water.  Like the soft tissues of plants and animals, hydrogels exhibit a wide range of interesting and useful properties, including - most importantly - the capacity to respond to chemical and physical signals by changing shape and volume.  But synthetic hydrogels are not very tough; in many cases it does not require much energy to cause them to fail.  This project exploits the power of genetic engineering to design new protein-based hydrogels that show improved toughness.  Artificial genes are used to encode protein sequences that dissipate energy upon deformation; the dissipated energy is then no longer available to cause the material to fail while in use.  Improvements in toughness will lead to new applications of hydrogels in drug and gene delivery, tissue engineering, cell encapsulation and adhesion.  The project provides important educational, training and outreach opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.  Additionally, the research activities of this project will be integrated with the \"Genes to Gels,\" program at Caltech that will introduce high school students and teachers to research at the interface between the biological sciences and materials science. These high school students and teachers from the public schools in the greater Los Angeles area are expected to gain greatly with this hands-on research experience. \r\n\r\nTechnical: Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks of high water content. While their physical and chemical properties vary widely, most hydrogels form soft, elastic materials. This makes them excellent candidates to replace the natural extracellular matrix in soft tissue engineering and in vitro cell culture.  But the same properties that make hydrogels appealing for these applications can also lead to brittle materials.  This project uses genetic engineering to program the assembly of artificial protein hydrogels, with a specific focus on improving toughness.  Genetic methods provide a level of control of chain sequence that is still not possible in conventional polymer synthesis, and the ease of sequence variation allows detailed exploration of the molecular processes that determine gel toughness. The toughening strategies developed in this work will establish general, broadly useful approaches to the design of tough, pliable materials.  The project engages students at all levels from high school to graduate study, and includes science teachers drawn from high schools throughout the Los Angeles basin.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit. This project introduced a new approach to the engineering of soft materials with well-defined physical and biological properties.  Artificial proteins were created by expression of artificial genes in bacterial cells, and linked together chemically to form elastic gels.  The mechanical properties of the gels were controlled by folded protein domains that provided additional points of interaction between individual chains.  Because they are sensitive to small changes in the sequences of the genes, the strengths of the inter-chain interactions could be programmed in remarkably predictable fashion.  The rates at which the gels relax in response to applied stress could be varied by a factor of 10,000, and complex relaxation behavior could be engineered by inclusion of more than one sequence variant in each gel.  Attachment of dyes to the proteins converted the folded domains into optical sensors of mechanical stress; color changes in the gels could be used to map local unfolding of the chains in response to mechanical deformation.  The gels were also used to explore the role of extracellular matrix signals in controlling the differentiation of pancreatic progenitor cells for use in treatment of Type I diabetes.\n\nBroader Impacts. Artificial proteins show promise as materials for use in surgery, cell transplantation and regenerative medicine.  An important element of this project was a collaboration between the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, CA, and City of Hope in nearby Duarte, CA.  Specifically, the project examined the use of artificial protein matrices to control the differentiation of pancreatic progenitor cells for use in the treatment of Type I diabetes.  The fate of such progenitor cells was found to be acutely sensitive to biological cues encoded into the protein matrix.  Further exploration of these phenomena may lead to new technologies for the production of cells that release insulin in response to elevated glucose concentration.\n\nAll of the artificial genes developed in the course of this work are available to other investigators upon request, and provide a resource for scientists and engineers who wish to pursue the development of protein-based biomaterials.\n\nThe project supported three graduate students who earned Ph.D. degrees at the California Institute of Technology, and who are now pursuing postdoctoral research at Yale University, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Army Research Laboratory.  A summer program supported by the project introduced high school students and teachers to important concepts in materials science and biotechnology, and provided hands-on experience in protein design and expression, and in analysis of soft biomaterials.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/26/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David A Tirrell"
