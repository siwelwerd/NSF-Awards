 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support a workshop to develop a historical gazetteer on Franz Josef Land.  Such a gazetteer is essentially a document of accurate place names and historical data that will synthesize 139 years of expedition accounts into a single source of historical geographic data.  The workshop will bring together key international researchers from the US and Europe, whose work has documented the history of exploration in the islands of Franz Josef Land, to develop international toponymic (place name) guidelines.   Four undergraduate students will also attend.  Defining both the derivations of historical place names, as well as identifying consistent practices in the use of current place names, will contribute to the utility of scientific observations in this region. \r\n\r\nThe broader significance of the project is the development of international standards for place names and historical geographic research in the region.  The project the participation of US undergraduates will contribute to training the next generation of geographic scholars.  The results of the workshop will contribute to the development of a scientifically sound historical gazetteer for use by future scientific researchers (geographers, ethnographers, ethnohistorians, biologists, natural historians, archaeologists, etc.).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThe Place Names of Franz Josef Land: \n\nthe historical geography of an archipelago of polar explorers\n\n \n\nProject Outcomes, from 1 January-31 December 2017\n\n \n\nPI: P.J. Capelotti\n\n \n\nThe islands of Franz Josef Land, part of a vast Russian Arctic preserve, will soon see the development of an infrastructure for science and tourism.  The conception of a cooperative international toponymic project to produce a comprehensive historical gazetteer of the islands was the subject of a workshop held in Oslo, Norway, in May, 2015, supported by the National Science Foundation.  This workshop discussed both historic and current historical and archaeological exploration of the archipelago, as well as the ways in which a future research project might develop the first synthetic English-language nomenclature for the Franz Josef Land archipelago. \n\nThe results of the workshop led immediately to a cooperative international proceedings publication, with UiT The Arctic University of Norway partnering with Penn State University to publish Proceedings of a Workshop on the Historic Place Names of Franz Josef Land (doi:  http://dx.doi.org/10.7557/scs.2015.3.)  This publication is a collaborative arrangement between Troms&oslash;?s Septentrio Conference Series (2015:3), The Polar Center at Penn State University, and the Department of Anthropology at Penn State University as No. 32 in their Occasional Papers in Anthropology. \n\nIn this, a major emphasis was to explore the idea of a web-based Franz Josef Land place names hosting arrangement with a Norwegian university or with the Norwegian Polar Institute itself.  Given the international history of discovery and exploration of these polar islands, existing maps, charts and written descriptions convey a mass of variants for given geographic features.  These can include correct forms of place names written in a different language, as well as obsolete and historical names.  Defining both the derivations of historical place names, as well as identifying consistent practices in the use of current place names, will contribute to the unity of scientific observations as the future exploration and management of Franz Josef Land unfolds, and provide a basis for international cooperative cultural and scientific projects in the islands.\n\nBecause half a dozen invited specialists could not participate in the Oslo workshop, we completed this project with a potentially useful amount of funding remaining in the workshop grant.  We proposed (and were granted) an extension to the original workshop grant period, to 31 December 2017, in order to employ this remaining funding for presentation of the results of the workshop at the ICASS-IX meetings in the June, 2017, in Ume&aring;, Sweden, and at Scott Polar Research Institute at Cambridge, UK, in this same month.  At ICASS, the PI co-hosted a session (Session 14.1: The Formation of Northern Spaces: Field-sciences, Place-Names, Heritage and Tourism), with Dr. Urban Wr&aring;kberg of UiT, the Arctic University of Norway.  At Scott Polar, the PI?s presentation led to further research into the place-names of islands on the north coast of Svalbard and the possibility of an international collaborative project around the first recorded observations (in words and photographs) of these islands, from 1873.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/05/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter J Capelotti"
