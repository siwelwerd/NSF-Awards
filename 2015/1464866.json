 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abundant rainfall is one of the reasons that tropical forests are so diverse and productive.  Climate change is predicted to shift the length and intensity of the dry seasons that most tropical forests experience. Understanding how these forests will respond to climate change therefore requires that we investigate the responses of tropical trees to drought. From temperate forests, we know that drought responses vary, not only among tree species, but also within species: populations of the same species from different sites can show different responses to drought, increasing the capacity of the species as a whole to persist when climate changes. However, we know very little how drought responses may vary within tropical tree species.  This project will measure the variation in response to drought within tropical tree species in Panama, where current rainfall varies from site to site across the isthmus from the Pacific to the Atlantic.  To contrast responses of trees in populations from sites with different amounts of rainfall, researchers will combine physiological measurements and genetic analyses with field experiments on the growth and survival of seedlings transplanted between sites.  Results will show whether variation is determined by genetic or environmental factors, and which plant traits underlie drought response. This will improve our ability to predict how tropical forests will respond to global climate change. \r\n\r\nThis project is important to society because tropical forests harbor the majority of the Earth's terrestrial biological diversity and provide people with valuable products and ecosystem services. The information generated by the project will be useful for conserving biodiversity and for managing forests to maintain production of commercially important timber species.  Besides making findings available to the scientific community, the project will disseminate findings to local managers and stakeholders in a symposium.  In addition, the project will strengthen the workforce for science by training young biologists.",

Annual rainfall and dry season intensity vary widely in the tropics, leading to pronounced spatial variation in water availability, which influences forest type and tree species distributions. Shifts in precipitation patterns are one of the main consequences of global climate change projected for the tropics. Thus, a mechanistic understanding of variation in tropical tree responses to water availability is critical for understanding and predicting shifts in species distributions, diversity, and ecosystem functioning in tropical forests.</p>\n<p>In a previous research project, we found that tropical tree species can differ widely in their sensitivity to drought and that a species&rsquo; drought resistance determines its distribution and abundance at local and regional scales. However, in order to understand and predict how species will respond to drought conditions, it is also critical to know whether different populations of the same species show different responses to drought. Therefore, the overarching goal of this project was to assess within-species variation in tropical tree species&rsquo; drought responses. We achieved this goal using common garden and reciprocal transplant experiments that involved growing &gt;4000 seedlings of 16 species in the greenhouse and then transplanting them to multiple sites across a strong rainfall gradient in central Panama.</p>\n<p>In the reciprocal transplant experiment, seedlings from each population of our 16 focal species were planted at 2 or 3 sites across the rainfall gradient (wet, intermediate and dry sites), depending on each species' distribution (i.e. seedlings were not planted outside of the range of their species, e.g. seedlings of species encountered only on the wetter side of the gradient were transplanted to intermediate and wet sites, but not the dry site). In that experiment, we had expected to find that seedlings from drier populations would perform better at the dry site compared to seedlings from wetter populations, indicating local adaptation to drier conditions. Contrary to our prediction, local populations did not grow or survive significantly better at their home site compared to non-local populations at any of the three transplant sites over the 1.5 years of the experiment. These results from the reciprocal transplant experiment suggested that seedlings from drier sites are not better adapted to drought.</p>\n<p>However, we also conducted a common garden experiment at a site in the middle of the rainfall gradient in which seedlings from all populations of all focal species were planted. This experiment involved two treatments: an irrigated treatment in which seedlings were watered during the four month dry season, and a dry treatment in which any rain was prevented from falling directly on seedlings during the dry season to maximize seasonal drought effects.&nbsp; This experiment spanned two dry seasons, the second of which corresponded with a strong El Ni&ntilde;o dry season in Panama. Analyses after the first dry season suggested no significant differences among populations in their response to the treatments. However, after the end of the second (more severe) dry season, we detected a significant difference between populations for species whose distributions included the driest part of the gradient: compared to seedlings from intermediate populations, seedlings from populations at the dry side of the gradient were less negatively impacted by the dry treatment. This suggests that, for some species, populations at the driest part of the rainfall gradient are better able to tolerate strong drought conditions compared to other populations of the same species located at wetter sites.</p>\n<p>In addition to enhancing understanding of how droughts shape tropical forests, our project provided support and/or training and research opportunities for two postdoctoral researchers, three graduate students, three undergraduates, and nine research technicians. Due in part to the experience gained through this project, three of the research technicians were accepted into international Master&rsquo;s degree programs in biology. Furthermore, the knowledge generated by this study will be useful for designing management, restoration, and conservation strategies to preserve tropical forest diversity and ecosystem services under present and future conditions, and for carbon offset programs that seek to mitigate effects of climate change through reforestation and forest preservation (e.g. REDD+). In particular, the results will help inform strategies of how best to select seed sources for use in tree planting efforts (e.g. for restoration or forestry plantations).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/31/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Liza&nbsp;Comita</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1464866/1464866_10244438_1532975525563_2014-09-0807.32.11--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1464866/1464866_10244438_1532975525563_2014-09-0807.32.11--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Seedlings being transported to transplant site\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1464866/1464866_10244438_1532975525563_2014-09-0807.32.11--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Seedlings being transported to transplant site\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Seedlings ready for transport from the greenhouse to the transplant sites.
