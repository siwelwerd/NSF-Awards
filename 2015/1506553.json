 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nIn addition to the novel properties of metallic glasses, including strengths greater than steel, high hardness and resistance to corrosion, they can be thermo-plastically formed, in much the same way that a glass blower forms traditional silicate glasses. This allows them to be molded into complex shapes using a process that is not possible for conventional alloys.  To realize their full potential, however, new methods are needed for the quick identification of potential metallic glasses to meet emerging technological needs.  A property, fragility, corresponding to the change in the liquid viscosity with temperature, is frequently taken to correlate with glass-formability. However, the microscopic meaning of fragility is unclear; it appears to correlate with the rate of structural change of the liquid with cooling below the melting temperature.  These structural changes can be measured by scattering high-energy X-rays from liquids that are levitated in a high-vacuum environment, avoiding reactions between the liquid and its container. Using a novel facility these are extended to neutron scattering studies at the Spallation Neutron Source, the most intense pulsed neutron source on Earth, allowing a direct comparison between structural changes and liquid flow.  The insights gained from this work lead to an improved ability to predict glass formation and a deeper understanding of the process of glass formation itself, which remains a key unsolved problem in condensed matter science.  Following the guidelines of the Materials Genome Initiative, the results also yield new structural and physical property data for computer modeling, necessary for advanced materials development.  The research is an integral part of the scientific training of both graduate and undergraduate students, and contributes to the PI's ongoing outreach activities to regional secondary school teachers, which are focused on discussions of common materials to convey basic scientific principles to students.         \r\n \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\nWhile metallic glasses are now poised for many novel technological applications, new methods are needed to rapidly identify and develop new glasses to meet changing demands, as well as to probe the fundamental nature of glass formation.  Fragility, related to the temperature dependence of the viscosity, frequently correlates with glass formability.  However, the microscopic origin of fragility and why it may be important for glass formation are poorly understood.  Fundamental investigations of the relations between liquid structure and flow and how these are related to the glass transition and glass formation can illuminate this.  Based on recent work from this research team: (i) fragility is reflected in the rate of structural ordering with temperature, (ii) a high temperature crossover in the viscosity, Tcoop, is related to the onset of cooperative flow and (iii) Tcoop is strongly correlated with the glass transition temperature, Tg, confirming that glass formation is the final step in a cooperative process that actually begins at a much higher temperature.  Some key questions emerging from these results are: (i) Is chemical or topological ordering more closely related to fragility?  (ii) What is the structural relation to the onset of cooperative flow?  (iii) How can Tcoop and a high temperature measure of liquid fragility be best used to develop new search approaches to identify good glass-forming liquids?  These questions can be addressed by elastic and inelastic neutron scattering studies on levitated liquids using a new electrostatic levitation (ESL) facility constructed by this team for use at the Spallation Neutron Source.  The high intensity of the SNS allows measurements to be made in shorter times and hence to deeper liquid supercoolings. These data can be correlated with measurements of the liquid viscosity at high temperature, giving a deeper understanding of fragility from a better understanding of the connections between topological/chemical ordering processes and liquid dynamics, and the processes that connect Tcoop with the glass transition. Clues can also be found for glass formation in the high temperature liquid, giving new search schemes to identify good glass formers, beyond the insight-guided trial and error or combinatorial methods commonly used.  Relations between liquid ordering and glass formability are of broad interest to the glass community, extending beyond metallic glasses to the silicate and chalcogenide glasses as well.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhen you hear the word glass, what probably comes to mind is window glass or glass bottles and vases. Less well known are metallic glasses.  When first discovered more than a half century ago, the liquid had to be cooled at up to one million degrees per second to form them.   Within the past 20 years, however, families of metallic glass have been discovered that can be formed with cooling rates more like those of the traditional silicate glasses.   These are poised to emerge as potentially important new technological materials.  They have many desirable properties, including high hardness and large tensile strengths, and they can be molded into intricate shapes by plastic forming, which is not possible for crystalline metal alloys.  There are, however, several problems that first must be addressed.  The number of bulk metallic glass formers is currently limited to only a few alloy families.  To be practically important this number must be increased and methods must be developed to enable the design of metallic glasses that are optimized for particular applications.  Current approaches for predicting glass formability, however, are empirical and only partially predictive.   A practical goal of our research was to develop new methods for predicting glass formation based on the properties of the liquid alloys at high temperatures.   To achieve this, it was necessary to better understand how liquid properties correlate with the glass transition temperature (i.e. the temperature where a liquid turns into a glass) and glass formability. With decreasing temperature the viscosity of a liquid (i.e. the resistance to flow) changes by many orders of magnitude.  A key concept is liquid ?fragility,? which characterizes the rate of this increase in viscosity and is frequently believed to correlate with glass formation.   However, the microscopic origins of fragility are unknown.   Our research has focused on determining that origin, linking structural ordering in the liquid to the change in viscosity, and then using the properties of the high-temperature liquid to determine glass formability.  \n\nWhen cooled below their melting temperature metallic liquids crystallize easily if held in a container.  Our studies were, therefore, made using the technique of electrostatic levitation (ESL), which removes the need for a container.  In ESL, the liquids are levitated by placing them in a large electrical field.  The sample position is determined by illuminating the liquid using a high intensity light-emitting diode and detecting its shadow, which is used to adjust the electrical field to maintain the sample?s position.   The liquid viscosity is measured by perturbing the electric field to cause the shape of the liquid to oscillate and measuring the time for the oscillation to cease when the perturbation is removed.  The viscosity was correlated with the decay of the local structure of the liquid, obtained from inelastic neutron scattering studies using an ESL that we designed and constructed for the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.   The structural ordering in the liquid with decreasing temperature was determined from high-energy X-ray scattering studies and elastic neutron scattering measurements.  Our results prove that at a temperature near the melting temperature (called TA) the rising viscosity with decreasing temperature reflects a process where local structural atomic fluctuations become cooperative over an increasing length scale, eventually terminating at the glass transition temperature.   We have also shown that the microscopic origin of fragility lies in the character of the interatomic potential.   Based on the deeper understanding of the connection between dynamics and structure that have emerged from our studies, we have developed a new, accurate, method for predicting the glass transition temperature of a metallic alloy from measured properties of the high temperature liquid.  We have also developed a method to predict glass formability and have identified the importance of the liquid structure for this, which has not been included in any existing method. \n\nIn addition to the basic scientific and applied importance of this research, it has played an integral part of graduate and undergraduate training.  It has contributed to the PI?s ongoing outreach activities with regional high school and middle school teachers, using the science of materials to provide a more approachable platform for the study of physical principles.  It has also been the subject of several presentations given to popular audiences.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth F Kelton"
