 "awd_abstract_narration": "****TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nThis project will investigate sub-structure in the superconducting energy gap of very clean samples of multi-gapped superconductors such as magnesium diboride (MgB2) and some iron-based superconductors. The energy gap is a key feature in the study of these novel materials and the results of these experiments can help validate existing theories, provide new data, and contribute to a better understanding of the role of gap distribution in multi-gapped superconductivity. Experiments will involve high-resolution tunneling spectroscopy made possible by cooling samples to low to very low (sub-Kelvin) temperatures and using high-resolution techniques of data acquisition. Samples will consist of thin film Josephson junctions to be obtained from several collaborators who are world leaders in the fabrication of high-quality samples. This research will be carried out at a primarily undergraduate institution, where undergraduate research is rapidly growing. This project will support the training of undergraduate and pre-college students and open physics research opportunities for women and minorities in a liberal arts environment where majority of students are women.\r\n\r\n****NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT****\r\nThis project supports the experimental study of superconductors in a primarily undergraduate institution. The energy gap of a superconductor is an important property that enables us to better understand and apply these novel materials. While many superconductors have only a single energy gap, this research will probe, to very high resolution, the energy gap of multi-gapped superconductors such as magnesium diboride and some of the recently-discovered iron-based superconductors. This will be made possible by using very clean thin film Josephson junctions obtained from research collaborators who are  world leaders in the fabrication of high-quality samples.  The samples will be cooled to temperatures close to absolute zero and probed using tunneling spectroscopy and high-resolution data acquisition techniques. The results will help validate existing theories and provide new data to better understand multi-gapped superconductivity. This project supports the education and training of undergraduates in solid-state physics in a liberal arts setting where sixty-four percent of students are women. Undergraduates will receive training in low-noise electronics, cryogenics, and materials characterization skills needed for graduate studies or work  in physics and many STEM fields. Furthermore, the educational component of this research makes possible a three-day summer science camp for middle school girls. The camp is designed to enhance the interest in science through interactive experiments and demonstrations of real-world physics, role-playing activities, laboratory tours, and other hands-on activities.",

We measured the superconducting energy gap of superconductors - a key property that allows us to better understand and apply these novel materials to real-world applications. The materials studied are novel because while most conventional superconductors have a single energy gap value, multi-gap superconductors such as magnesium diboride (MgB<sub>2</sub>) and the recently-discovered iron-based pnictides have two or more values.</p>\n<p>To obtain sharp signals in the form of peaks in conductance, measurements were made on very clean thin film Josephson junctions and single crystals obtained from collaborators, at temperatures close to absolute zero. Measurements on all-MgB<sub>2</sub> junctions consisting of two MgB<sub>2</sub> films separated by a thin insulating layer (MgB<sub>2</sub>/I/MgB<sub>2</sub>) showed that while the top&nbsp; and bottom superconducting MgB<sub>2</sub> electrodes were made of the same material, their energy gaps were different, which we attributed to slight differences in conditions during their fabrication process. We used a mathematical model to quantify the two gap values. Measurements on MgB<sub>2</sub>/I/Sn and MgB<sub>2</sub>/I/Pb heterojunctions which consist of a multi-gapped superconductor (MgB<sub>2</sub>) separated from a single-gapped superconductor such as tin (Sb) or lead (Pb) were also performed. We found that results depend on how the MgB<sub>2</sub> film was deposited on the substrate. When deposited on substrates with a slight tilt, the MgB<sub>2</sub> formed films with columnar or terrace geometries, so that superconducting current flowed in two directions. This resulted in two flavors of&nbsp; superconducting current and produced two sets of multiple peaks (pi and sigma energy gaps) which can be remarkably fit to a simple theoretical model we developed. We used modeling to extract energy gap values of MgB<sub>2</sub> and either Si or Pb to very high resolution. We also analyzed histograms of superconducting-to-normal switching events in the heterojunctions exposed to microwaves to study quantum effects in a large superconducting device. This led to the first experimental demonstration of microwave resonant activation in multi-gap superconductors. Finally, we measured the energy gap of an iron-based superconductor called Ba-122 in the form of single crystals doped with different concentrations of potassium, phosphorus and cobalt. Some of the resulting energy gaps values are similar to values observed by other researchers in the community. Measurements showed sensitivity to the way crystals are contacted using tiny drops of silver paint (sometimes known as point-contact spectroscopy). More than a dozen undergraduates received training in vacuum systems, cryogenics, low-noise electronic measurements and data analysis. Many presented talks and posters at national physics conferences. Many graduates now have STEM jobs or pursued graduate studies in physics and chemistry. Finally, the research opportunities made possible by the project helped lead to establishing a B.S. Physics program and a BS/MS Physics (4+1) Program.</p>\n<p>The project also supported several years of the Physics Wonder Girls Summer Camp,&nbsp; a free, week-long physics camp for high-performing middle school girls, many of whom come from diverse communities and underserved school districts. The novel camp was designed by the PI and implemented with a small crew of mostly women physics majors in response to research indicating the loss of interest in STEM among girls during middle school years. This was done by providing a safe, nurturing environment for 8<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> grader girls to pursue their interest in STEM, and engaging them with STEM \"best-practices\" activities such as project-building, hands-on experiments, talks by women scientists, industrial and laboratory plant tours and a capstone presentation where campers present their favorite demo to a community of family and friends. The camp has impacted over 130 middle school girls and has been featured on three network news and published in a national physics magazine.
