 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Jill Marshall has been granted an NSF EAR Postdoctoral Fellowship to carry out a research and education plan at the University of California, Berkeley, in collaboration with the University of Colorado, Boulder. She will develop numerical models to describe the effect tree roots have on soil production. The investigation is important across a broad range of problems in critical zone science, from understanding landscape evolution to quantifying soils sustainability. The investigation will use data collected at three Critical Zone Observatories (Eel River, Boulder Creek, and Southern Sierra CZOs) that have patches of terrain with thin to no soils and bedrock exposures. This enables quantitative observations of tree roots growing in fractures across sites underlain by different lithologies and fracture patterns. The development of a biomechanical soil production model will allow for improved insight into the role of vegetation in soil sustainability and resilience. The education plan, based in Round Valley, CA (a rural region in the Eel watershed encompassing the Round Valley Indian Tribal Lands) has two components: multi-age field-based science activities directed at the school district's students and a LiDAR workshop for the Tribes' Natural Resource Department. The educational plans were developed with extensive community input and these synergistic activities meet the community's needs of expanding access to science activities and providing tools for future endeavors.\r\n\r\nResearch in this project will test the hypothesis that depth-dependent soil production is a function of root pressures, variations in root density with depth, and tree sway modulated by rock properties. To develop a geomorphic transport law that describes how and why soil production rates vary with depth, this project will combine Discrete Element Method simulations incorporating bonded grains, rock properties, and field-derived values for root pressures at the bedrock interface from data collected at the three Critical Zone Observatories. A suite of bedrock-impeded tree roots will be monitored with force sensors to measure external root pressures generated from growth, diurnal fluctuations due to tree water fluxes, and torque about the tree base from wind and snow events. Hydrologic routing, net primary productivity, carbon storage in soils, and mineral supplies for the geochemical reactor are all linked to rates of soil production. By including tree-driven processes in a geomorphic process law for soil production, this project will enable numerical experiments that explore how the presence and absence of vegetation control surface and near-surface processes and landscape form.",

However, despite soil&rsquo;s importance we still do not have a way to predict what controls how thick our soil is or the rates at which the underlying solid bedrock is converted into soil (soil production). We do know that a myriad of processes including chemical and physical weathering (e.g. water dissolving minerals and ice wedging rock apart) contribute to the breakdown of solid bedrock into the soil we depend on. Observations of tree roots lifting sidewalk slabs, occupying cracks, and prying slabs of rock from cliff faces have led to a general belief in the power of plant growth forces. Additionally, we can see the conversion of rock into soil in the roots of many an overturned tree. These common observations have led to conceptual models with trees at the center of the soil genesis process in thin-soil settings. This is despite the observation that tree throw is rare in many forested settings, and a dearth of field measurements that quantify the magnitude of growth forces. While not all trees blow down, every tree grows roots, inserting much of its mass below ground. Not only do trees insert themselves into rock in thin-soil settings, but their above-ground mass can exert forces on the below-ground rock when the wind blows. The goal of this project was to better quantify the mechanisms by which trees convert rock into soil, with the ultimate goal of developing a way to predict what controls the rate of soil production in diverse settings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project resulted in some of the first ever measurements of the forces trees exert on weathered bedrock. By basing the research at two different locations within the National Critical Zone Observation (CZO) network, the research allowed for contrasting and comparing how varied tree species of different sizes and shapes responded to differences in precipitation, solar radiation, rock properties (e.g. hardness and fracture density) forest structure and wind patterns. We used a novel technique to quantify tree-driven forces, embedding very thin, small force sensors at the bedrock-tree interface (See Figures). By combining these near-continuous force measurements with tree sway data and available CZO data on precipitation, solar radiation, and wind speed, we quantified the magnitude and frequency of tree-driven soil-production mechanisms from two contrasting climatic and lithologic regimes in the montane forests of snowy Colorado (Boulder Creek CZO) and in the old growth forests of rain-dominated northern California (Eel River CZO).</p>\n<p>Preliminary data suggests that in settings with relatively thin soils, trees can damage and detach rock due to daily water/sap fluctuations, wind response and precipitation events. Surprisingly, our data suggests that forces from roots and trunks growing against bedrock are insufficient to pry rock apart or damage bedrock although much more work is needed in this area. The frequency, magnitude and style of wind-driven tree forces at the bedrock interface varies considerably with tree species and tree size. This suggests that tree properties such as mass, elasticity, stiffness and branch structure determine whether trees respond to gusts big or small, move at the same frequency as large wind gusts, or are able to self-dampen near-ground sway response to extended wind forces. Our measurements of precipitation-driven and daily fluctuations in root pressures exerted on bedrock suggest that these fluctuations may impart a cyclic stress fatigue that over the lifetime of a tree could considerably weaken the enfolding rock (over timespans of ten thousand to a million days depending on the species). Combined, our results suggest that wind-driven root torque and water uptake may be the primary mechanisms driving bedrock erosion and soil production in thin soil settings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;One of the most exciting outcomes of this research is how it has mobilized cross-disciplinary discussion and hypotheses regarding the coupling between water uptake by trees, tree physiology and root-generated forces over time. We are using these preliminary results to drive additional research aimed at a more detailed understanding of the interplay between water availability (in both soil and bedrock), forest dynamics and wind in generating soil from rock. Ultimately, we plan to leverage these results and expanded research questions to develop a model describing how the sum of all of the physical weathering mechanisms aided by chemical weathering generates soil at a predictable rate and how those rates vary with climate and other factors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/26/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jill&nbsp;A&nbsp;Marshall</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1452694/1452694_10361438_1506480039919_P6260129--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1452694/1452694_10361438_1506480039919_P6260129--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Quantifying tree-driven forces\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1452694/1452694_10361438_1506480039919_P6260129--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Quantifying tree-driven forces\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Force sensor installation at the base of a massive Douglas fir tree where the trunk is pinned against a bedrock outcrop (Eel River CZO).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jill A.
