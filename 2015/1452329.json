 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gravity waves (GWs) originating from lower atmospheric sources can lead to large accelerations of the background flow through wave dissipation or breaking. The accelerations produce secondary GWs with longer wavelengths, allowing them to propagate farther upward into the ionosphere. Here, through interaction with the ionospheric plasma, they are visible in the form of optical signatures in red line (630 nm) images, and are often referred to as traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs). \r\n\tA broad array of optical imagers will be used to triangulate the lower atmospheric sources for F region GWs, quantifying the GWs by numerically modeling the same optical signatures, and then using this quantification to ray-trace the secondary GWs to reveal their altitude profile of momentum deposition. This effort will connect two critical points on the coupled path: from the lower atmospheric source to momentum deposition in the mid to upper thermosphere.\r\n\tThis project will include outreach to students at rural high schools where the instruments will be deployed. It will also provide undergraduate students opportunities to participate in data analysis and interpretation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, we examined the properties of traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) during geomagnetically quiet times.  These are times when the Sun is quiet, and so activity in the ionosphere is caused by waves from below.  The TIDs we examined mainly propagated in the \"F region\" of the Earth's ionosphere, which is located at and above approximately 190 km above the Earth's surface.  The waves which created the TIDs are called atmospheric gravity waves (gravity waves, for short), and they do so by moving ions up and down the Earth's magnetic field lines.  Gravity waves are specific types of waves in the Earth's atmosphere, and are created from sources like wind flow over mountains (e.g., orographic forcing), and deep convection (e.g., thunderstorms).  We examined so-called \"secondary\" and \"tertiary\" gravity waves from orographic forcing and deep convection in this project.  Here, \"secondary\" gravity waves are created when and where the original gravity waves break, and \"tertiary\" gravity waves are created when and where those secondary gravity waves break or dissipate from viscosity.  (Honey and molasses are also viscous fluids.)  We looked at lidar and satellite data, model data and theory, and found that secondary and tertiary gravity waves from wind flow over orography may be important drivers of TIDs during the winter, and that primary and secondary gravity waves from thunderstorms may be important drivers of TIDs during the summer.  Analysis of GOCE satellite data over the Southern Andes during the winter supported this hypothesis, because many of the extracted gravity waves had horizontal phase speeds that were much larger than the sound speed below ~100 km above the Earth's surface; such large speeds could have only been achieved if these gravity waves were created in the thermosphere more than ~120 km above the Earth's surface.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/20/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sharon L Vadas"
