 "awd_abstract_narration": "Particle accelerators are a critical scientific and industrial tool in many fields, from probing the structure of matter at its fundamental levels to industrial radioisotope production, medical radiation therapy, and security scanners.  In the past two years, the first demonstrations have been conducted of a revolutionary new approach that combines the fabrication methods of the microchip industry with modern lasers to greatly shrink the size and cost of particle accelerators.  This opens the door to creating a future generation of miniaturized \"accelerator on a chip\" devices that could be used to produce pulses of radiation on unprecedentedly short time scales, shorter than one millionth of a billionth of a second.  Such accelerators of the future could open new avenues of scientific research, including the potential for making \"molecular movies\" that reveal the inner workings of some of nature's fastest events.  Students working in this program will receive an education of unrivaled depth by interacting with faculties from multiple scientific fields as well as the diverse communities of researchers at Stanford, UCLA, Tel-Aviv University, and SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory where much of the experimental work will take place.\r\n\r\nThis project is a three-year collaborative program to advance the concept of a laser-powered nanofabricated dielectric laser accelerator (DLA) with the ultimate goal of making compatible ultra-short pulsed radiation sources.  This approach has been colloquially referred to as an \"accelerator on a chip.\"  The different essential components will be developed by the collaborating groups, including theory, design, and laboratory demonstrations at Stanford University, Tel-Aviv University, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, and University of California Los Angeles. The development of the particle source and low-energy accelerator for these tests will occur in close collaboration with Erlangen University, Germany.  The theory of DLA radiation schemes will be developed for potential short-wavelength coherent radiation sources based on high-harmonic (super-radiant) emission and free electron laser amplification schemes with femtosecond to attosecond pulses.  The NSF program will support the research of one graduate student in this field, working on design, fabrication, and testing of these concepts in conjunction with faculty, scientific staff, and students at the collaborating institutions to provide an unparalleled and multi-disciplinary educational experience.",

The ultimate goal of the Accelerator on a Chip is to make ultra-short pulse x-ray radiation for scientific studies and imaging applications.\n\nThe work was funded by the NSF in collaboration funding from the Moore Foundation in a discovery research effort called Accelerator on a Chip International Program, or ACHIP.  (See web site at ACHIP.stanford.edu)\n\nThe program explored plasmonic accelerator structures made of thin films of gold on glass.  Recent progress toward DLA accelerators has demonstrated an acceleration gradient of 850 MeV/m in fused silica structures.  Further, recent experiments demonstrated waveguide coupling of the laser to the accelerator chip.  This opens the door to practical realization of an accelerator on a chip that fits within a shoebox.\n\nFifty scientists and engineers from Europe, US and Asia have joined the international research collaboration in support of DLA acceleration.  We thank the NSF for funding the work on Plasmonic structured DLAs.  Laser driven DLA accelerators have now been demonstrated electron acceleration in glass, sapphire and silicon.  For nearly 100 years accelerators have been engines of discovery and are well known for their kilometer size.  In the future we foresee accelerators on a chip that will become engines of discovery in x-ray microscopy, electron diffraction for crystal structure determination and a reliable and cost effective source of electrons for medical applications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/04/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert L Byer"
