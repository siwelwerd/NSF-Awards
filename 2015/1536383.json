 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate why previously thriving Norse settlements in Greenland collapsed or were abandoned in the early 15th century.  The project will provide new insights into the regional paleoenvironment of southwest coastal Greenland as well as how past societies responded to environmental change.  It will provide a test of competing hypotheses, some of which posited that the settlements collapsed because of deteriorating climatic conditions associated with the onset of Little Ice Age cooling, but others have argued that the Norse Greenlander settlements were victims of cultural and socioeconomic factors unrelated to environmental conditions.  More broadly, the project will enhance understanding of societal fragility in the face of ecological change, and it may provide new knowledge that can be employed by the Danish and Inuit residents of this region as well as residents of other semi-polar environments in the U.S. and elsewhere.  The project will provide an excellent education and training opportunity for an undergraduate research assistant.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\nThe project will seek to identify what environmental conditions may have contributed to the collapse of the Norse settlements in Greenland.  The doctoral student will analyze high-resolution records of human occupancy, temperature, and precipitation using organic geochemical proxies, also known as biomarkers, which were extracted from lacustrine sedimentary archives adjacent to Norse ruins at three locations in southwestern Greenland.  He will reconstruct the history of human occupancy and paleoenvironmental conditions at a multi-decadal scale for the past 1,500 to 2,000 years.  He also will analyze human biomarkers to reconstruct shifts in dietary patterns as a response to changing environmental conditions.  The project will blend geography, geology, archaeology, and geochemistry to produce findings that include the integration of paleoenvironmental and human occupancy reconstructions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe cause of the demise of the Norse in Greenland during the 15th century has long been the subject of debate. Some researchers have argued that cooling associated with \"the Little Ice Age\" was the likely cause of the collapse of the colony, while others have suggested instead that the Norse were undone by external socio-economic and political factors that were beyond their control. To date, a satisfactory resolution of this matter has been hampered by the lack of local records of either temperature or precipitation from the Norse settlement regions in SW Greenland. Many of the previous arguments have been based on ice core records from the summit of the Greenland ice sheet, hundreds of miles away from where the Norse were living.\n\nThe goal of this project was therefore to provide on-site climatic information, by analyzing lake sediments from in and around the Norse settlements, to reconstruct climate during the time of colonization and the subsequent settlement demise (Figure 1).  The temperature reconstruction from Eriksvatnet (the site where Erik the Red is thought to have established his farm) is based on specific organic molecules called branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers, or brGDGTs. These compounds are produced by bacteria, and the distribution of these brGDGTs in sediments has previously been shown to be related to local air temperature. Our record from Eriksvatnet lake (Figure 2) is one of the first biomarker based temperature reconstructions from Greenland.\n\nThe temperature reconstruction from Eriksvatnet (Figure 3) suggests that the Norse arrived in Greenland during a period of relatively warm temperatures, and that temperatures were declining during the period of abandonment in the 15th century. It must be noted here however, that the dating of this lake sediment record has proven to be highly challenging; it is based on a radiocarbon chronology, but some samples have yielded reversed, or out of order, dates, which reduces our confidence in the timing of events.
