 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to examine how an individual's experiences influence his or her beliefs and how these, in turn, impact intertemporal decisions.  Understanding how experiences and resulting beliefs impact future choice contributes to the national health through application to questions of medication adherence and health outcomes (e.g., how patient' uncertainty about illnesses might affect adherence choices.)  The project also contributes to national prosperity and welfare through the provision of integrated in-class and laboratory training of graduate students and undergraduates in advanced programming and Bayesian Cognitive Modeling. The research program also seeks to advance diversity in STEM fields through outreach focused on attracting women and underrepresented groups to the academic setting, and continued post-degree mentoring, e.g., outreach to pre-college organizations serving underrepresented minorities and organizations promoting retention of women in science.\r\n\r\nOur beliefs about the regularities of our environment shape our understanding of the world, and in turn, influence our cognitive processes and behavior. Beliefs are important not only for recalling the past and making decisions in the now, but also for making predictions about the future. People develop well-calibrated beliefs based on their life experiences. However, subjective experiences leading to individual differences in beliefs have also been found to bias decision processes. Time preference (placing greater value on earlier outcomes by discounting the utility of later outcomes) is one example where human choice and behavior is influenced by strong individual differences, as well as changes within the individual. While Discounted Utility, the accepted model of normative intertemporal choice, assumes consistent assignment of discounting rates in time preference (i.e., stable individual difference), it has been suggested that people might exhibit a change in time preference due to beliefs about the uncertainty in the environment. An important question that remains unexplored is: what is the effect of changes in the environment on subjective beliefs and the influence of changing beliefs on memory and decision making under uncertainty (e.g., predictions for the future). This research provides a new framework for inferring individual differences via the integrated application of Bayesian analysis to Bayesian models of cognition. This integrative approach makes it possible to infer individual differences in the underlying parameters of the Bayesian cognitive model, and can be used to address how changing beliefs influence how and what we remember, and the value of future outcomes. The theory driven goal is to challenge the assumption of a constant discounting rate, and instead assume that the rate changes, but that the system for determining the rate remains consistent. The integrative approach makes it possible to implement and compare multiple competing cognitive models of the effect of individual discounting rates on time preference.",

The project sought to empirically test and model how people use environmental information in retrieval from memory, and decision making in general. This leads to several questions: <em>What knowledge of the regularities of their environment do people bring to the task of remembering</em>? <em>How do people integrate this information with episodic memory</em>? <em>What happens when memory is characterized using naturalistic stimuli versus experimentally constrained stimuli that controls for prior knowledge</em>? i.e., does this change the interpretation of the memory system?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For example,&nbsp;<span>we have investigated the ?stickiness? of people?s prior expectations. While previous research suggests that people use a belief accumulated over all encountered evidence, this may only apply to incremental changes. For more clearly delineated changes, people may use multiple beliefs?one for the overall evidence, and one for the most recent set of stimuli?when recalling events from memory and making judgments. We found that predictions for proximal and distant future states, as well as recall are differentially biased as a function of delineated changes in the underlying stimulus distribution. A Bayesian framework utilizing a mixture component, combining an overall belief with a more recent belief, provides a good explanation of behavior in tasks with clearly delineated changes.</span></p>\n<p><span>Furthermore, subjective experiences lead to individual differences in beliefs that may bias decision processes. We investigated people?s ability to make predictions for illness statistics, a domain where people a like to have subjective experiences and compared their judgments to the Bayesian optimal prediction determined from real-world distributions. Evaluating predictions for both acute and chronic illnesses, we found that for acute illnesses, people were able to estimate both the median duration and the shape of the distribution of illness durations. For chronic illnesses, people correctly estimated the shape of the distribution, but overestimated the median duration, suggesting that personal experience with an illness may be important for prediction accuracy.</span></p>\n<p>Another domain we investigated is the well-known cultural and individual differences in beliefs. For example, in the domain of color&nbsp;we evaluated people?s color naming preferences, that is their expectation for hue values associated with their preferred color labels, using a standard US population. We found that people?s color naming preferences were consistent with the universal color terms, namely red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple and pink. This behavior is well described by a Bayesian cognitive model. We then&nbsp;investigated memory for color in the indigenous Tsimane' of Bolivia. Interestingly, no term for 'yellow' exists in their language, perhaps due to the rarity of yellow in their environment. We found that memory regressed to the universal color terms except for orange and yellow hue ranges which regresses towards red. This suggests that environment shapes color expectations and differentially influences memory. Lastly, we&nbsp;investigated the development of color knowledge and meta-memory in children. Children?s subjective experiences are limited relative to adults.&nbsp;A question of interest to developmental psychologists is whether children possess such metacognitive skills.
