 "awd_abstract_narration": "The design, upgrade, and real-time operation of a power network are all contingent upon sev-\r\neral optimization problems that are hard to solve due to two main reasons: (i) the nonlinearity\r\ninduced by the laws of physics, and (ii) the presence of integer variables. The existing solvers\r\nfor energy-related optimization problems either make potentially conservative approximations or\r\ndeploy general-purpose local-search algorithms to handle the non-convexities, which may incur\r\ntens of billions of dollars annually. The general intractability of power optimization problems has\r\na direct impact in the practice of energy efficiency, and this is arguably one of the most fundamen-\r\ntal issues that hold back the power engineering. The primary objective of this project is to address\r\nthis non-convexity issue by developing high-performance optimization techniques that can be ap-\r\nplied to a broad set of nonlinear energy problems. This work is expected to produce significant\r\nbreakthrough in nonlinear optimization at large and nonlinear energy optimization in particular.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The results of this project can be utilized for the design, modernization, and\r\noperation of many power grids around the world. This project will have a significant impact on\r\nthe power industry by revolutionizing their energymanagement systems, leading to the following\r\nimmediate benefits: (i) reducing the electricity cost through a cheaper way of dispatching and\r\ndelivering power, (ii) decreasing the likelihood of power outages by optimizing the reliability\r\nand robustness of the grid, and (iii) reducing gas emissions by optimally utilizing the sustainable\r\nenergy. This project has major outreach activities for a local school, where more than 85% of the\r\nstudent population are significantly underrepresented in STEM-related fields. Management of \r\nnonlinearities in real time is especially important to the economics of trying to use more renewable\r\nenergy sources; thus work on this challenge may be crucial to our ability to accomplish this in an\r\naffordable way.",
