 "awd_abstract_narration": "What neural processes allow humans to perceive and experience different colors? The operation of human color vision has been among the most extensively investigated topics in the scientific study of human visual perception, yet its neural basis remains elusive. This project aims to investigate a new theory that could help to explain how the perception of different colors emerges from neural activity. Understanding the mechanisms of color perception is important to designing successful artificial vision systems and visual displays, as well as to understanding the basis of visual problems.\r\n\r\nThough many aspects of color vision are well-understood, attempts to find specific neuronal-level correlates of the various components of a color percept have failed. Specifically, psychophysics research has shown that there are three aspects to the perception of a color: 1) hue, 2) color purity (the difference between a \"saturated\" color and a pastel one), and 3) brightness, and researchers have long assumed that these properties result from relatively early-stage neural processing, at the level of neurons that specialize in reacting to these properties of a visual stimulus. However, existing research has failed to find consistent evidence that specific neurons specialize in reacting to these properties of a color percept. In this project, a new theory will be investigated that could help to explain how the three properties of color percepts emerge from neural activity. The new theory under investigation in this project is that the properties of color perception (hue, purity, and brightness) emerge from complex interactions among networks of neurons, involving competition in some cases and cooperation in others. In this way, the three color percept properties are emergent properties of complex neural activity, rather than being represented at the level of specialized neurons. In the project, the investigator will carry out sophisticated computational modeling of the proposed complex neural interactions in an effort to explain existing data patterns in the literature.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEmergence is an important aspect of nature.  For example, bird flocking emerges from rules about how each bird spaces itself from its nearest neighbors.  Similarly, perceptual attributes might emerge from simple rules governing collective interactions of billions of individually stupid neurons.  Emergence in cognitive science is poorly developed.  My project treats fundamental aspects of color vision (hue opponency and chromatic brightness) as emergent properties of interacting neurons.\n\n \n\nHue Opponency\n\nHue opponency is one of the fundamental attributes of color vision.   Red and green are called opponent because both colors can?t simultaneously be perceived in red-green mixtures.  Similarly blue and yellow are opponent.  I hypothesized that cortical color opponency could result from competition between wavelength-sensitive neurons.\n\n \n\nHue Outcome 1.   I created average observers for red-green and blue-yellow hue opponency, based on many old studies and forgotten dissertations.  Average observers are useful to vision researchers and I expect these will prove useful.  This outcome was published in the Journal of the Optical Society of America A (JOSA A).\n\n \n\nHue Outcome 2.   I created models in which neurons compete for the right to fire.  Winner-Take-All (WTA) cognitive models usually employ Integrate-and-Fire approximations instead of good models of spiking neurons.  I used a modern version of the Nobel Prize-winning Hodgkin-Huxley model instead.  It is more complicated, but worth the effort, because it led to Hue Outcome 4.  I found two ways to create WRA competition from mutually inhibiting neurons.  One uses slow synapses and the other fast (synapses are connections between nerves).  The differences between these models suit them for solving different kinds of problems; other researchers should find these options useful.  This outcome was published in JOSA A.\n\n \n\nHue Outcome 3.   I used a WTA model (Outcome 2) to model red-green color opponency (driving my model neurons with previously published macaque neural spike rates).  These models produced sensible looking opponent spike rates.  However to get long-wavelength redness spike rates right, I had to build it from a certain combination (called an envelope or MAX operator) of macaque neurons.  This outcome was published in JOSA A.\n\n \n\nHue Outcome 4.   I discovered a way to create a MAX operator using mutually excitatory Hodgkin-Huxley neurons.  To make this work, I had to incorporate a slow leak of potassium through the modeled nerve membrane.  This outcome was published in JOSA A.\n\n \n\nHue Outcome 5.   For roughly 160 years, cognitive scientists wondered about the relationship between neural activity and human perception (Fechner?s Inner Psychophysics).   When I compared opponent spike rates (Outcome 3) to the perceptual results (Outcome 1), I found model spike rates could be predicted roughly as the cube root of perceptual sensitivity times stimulus intensity.  Interestingly, something similar was predicted earlier (on other grounds), but their prediction was widely disbelieved.  This outcome was published in JOSA A.\n\n \n\n \n\nChromatic Brightness\n\nWhen electric light was new, lighting engineers struggled to understand the effectiveness of different spectral lights.  Is blue light as effective as yellow?  How do we find out?  Two approaches gauge spectral effectiveness: studying appearance (how bright does it look?) or studying performance (how well do I see in it?).  Appearance says that reds and blues are pretty effective.  Performance says you need a lot more red or blue to see well than you do yellow.  Let?s call appearance \"chromatic brightness\" and let?s call performance \"luminance\". \n\n \n\nChromatic Brightness Outcome 1.  It has long been thought that chromatic brightness is a mathematical combination of hue opponent channels (like Hue Outcome 1) and luminance.  I thought that too, until I found that\n\n \n\nChromaticBrightness = a*Luminancen\n\n \n\nWhere n is about 0.86 and the fit is beautiful.  So chromatic brightness is not a combination of hue and luminance; it is a simple amplification of luminance, triggered by, but not dependent on hue strength.  This was unexpected and forces me to think differently about chromatic brightness.  This outcome was published in Scientific Reports.\n\n \n\nChromatic Brightness Outcome 2.  In my nonNSF time I studied multisensory interactions.  Under some circumstances the presence of one kind of sensory response amplifies the other sensory response, e.g., a dim light looks brighter if a sound comes from the same direction.  It turns out that amplification can be predicted with surprising accuracy as\n\n \n\nAmplifiedResponse = a*UnamplifiedResponsen\n\n \n\nWhere n is 0.82-0.87 for various perceptual and neural systems.  This is the same law that worked for chromatic brightness.  This unexpected connection between sensory interactions and color vision should have been anticipated because sensory amplifications were first discovered in visual and infrared interactions in rattlesnakes.  Biologists call this multisensory integration, but I?d argue that this multispectral interaction is a kind of color vision.  My new result, combined with my work on synchronizing and amplifying neural networks, suggests deep connections between binding theory, sensory integration and color vision.  This consilience should be cherished.  This outcome was published in Scientific Reports.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vincent A Billock"
