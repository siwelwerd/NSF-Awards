 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rate at which a single processor in a computer can execute instructions has not changed much in years, and major technological breakthroughs will be required to double the current best rates. On the other hand, the rate at which the network can deliver data is increasing rapidly and is expected to grow by an order of magnitude in the next few years. Because of the widening gap between the rate at which the network can deliver data and the rate at which a processor can process the data, it is becoming increasingly difficult for a single processor to keep up using current protocols and computer architectures.  Computer architects have compensated for the fact that processor speeds are no longer increasing by putting multiple processor cores on each die, and while these multicore systems have high aggregate processing capacities, attaining predictable performance for the commonly adopted communication protocols requires complex manual tuning.  In prior work, the concept of affinity (intelligently binding processes to processors) was leveraged to exploit the hardware parallelism of current and next generation computers.  This project will build upon this prior expertise and leverage statistical and control theoretic methods to manage end-to-end performance of high-speed flows. The process of careful characterization of current technology, followed by analysis, and finally middleware tool development will affords the maximum impact on shaping best practices while minimizing any impact on distributed application development processes.\r\n\r\nThis project will characterize the end-system bottlenecks that arise during data transfers required in different distributed scientific and business applications. What is learnt will drive the development of introspective end-system aware models, which will allow the auto-tuning of data transfers. This tuning will consider both latency and throughput requirements of the applications. Flow striping methods that exploit multicore end-systems and adapt to the end-system bottlenecks will be developed. This will require addressing many new issues, such as assigning flows to cores while taking into account various (application, cache, and interrupt) affinities. Additionally, the underlying topology of the cache (inclusive vs. exclusive), the memory organization, and the heterogeneity of the cores will be considered when controlling the end-to-end flows.  Memory-mapped network channels, such as Remote Direct Memory Access over Converged Ethernet will be investigated, for data transfers over wide-area networks. Towards this end, memory management, message synchronization and end-to-end flow control to enable remote messaging for different types of network flows will be designed, implemented and evaluated. From the end-system architectural perspective, cache architectures that can significantly improve the network I/O performance will be proposed and investigated.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: This project, which lies at the intersection of computer networks, computer systems, operating systems, and distributed applications, will provide a platform to train graduate students in both analytical and experimental methods. Senior Design projects for undergraduates will be defined that will be closely related to the project and involve profiling distributed applications in high-speed network testbeds.  Industry partnerships will be established to design new protocols and optimize the performance of distributed applications, as well as contribute to the design of next generation networked computer system.",
