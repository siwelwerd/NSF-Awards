 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is a systematic effort to identify and address mathematics-related learning issues in introductory physics courses. The courses include algebra- and calculus-based general physics. The model emphasizes small-group, active student problem-solving using research-based curricular materials, in which students express and reflect on their thinking verbally and in writing.  The project is to establish a basis for the design and development of new strategies for improving student engagement in introductory physics, which it is hoped will improve student retention in physics.  \r\n\r\nProject findings and products contribute substantially to the body of research and of evidence-based instructional materials available for undergraduate physics courses.  These will be a resource for other researchers and curriculum developers. The model incorporates identification and analysis of specific student mathematical difficulties. Use of the materials in targeted instruction will be followed by assessment of student learning. This analysis will be used to develop tightly focused instructional materials.",
