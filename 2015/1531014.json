 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities -Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provides support to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at the University of the District of Columbia seeks to establish the foundation for a \"STEM Center for Research and Development - Increasing Minority Students in STEM Disciplines\". The goals of the project are:  to provide STEM students with information and active support designed to retain them and prepare them for graduate school or the workforce; and to provide faculty with support that will expand their teaching and research skills so that they will be better prepared to impart knowledge and assist in the development of students' skills as they forge successful mentor/mentee relationships.   \r\n\r\nActivities that are part of this project are:  support for students in such areas as study skills, academic scoping skills, graduate school and fellowship application preparation, research opportunities during the academic year, as well as summer internships; one-year mini-grants to faculty members to give them the support needed to initiate and advance research and curricular reforms, train students, and promote professional development. The project will be guided by an on-going evaluation and by external and internal steering committees.",
