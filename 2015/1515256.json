 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobile phones have become an ever-present part of our society bringing to the forefront increasing concerns related to security. Mobile devices are being used to commit crimes and are becoming a target to gain user information for harmful intentions. Mobile security remains a top concern to businesses. The project advances both knowledge and education in the field of mobile cybersecurity and cyber forensics by creating an online Mobile Forensics and Security (MFS) certificate program and developing and implementing a train-the-trainer program for Computer Information Systems faculty. This will increase Robert Morris University's capacity to train MFS specialists and the capacity of other institutions to offer programs in this area once their faculty has been trained.  \r\n\r\nThe project will provide the MFS train-the-trainer program through onsite and online training programs using Blackboard and VMWare to 20 faculty members by the end of the grant period, and annually thereafter and offer an online certificate program in Mobile Forensics and Security by Fall 2016. The certificate program will be combined with hands on internships that will equip students with the skills needed to secure a mobile environment. Through partnerships with Middle Georgia State College and Southeastern Advanced Cybersecurity Education Consortium that serve a large number of African American students and rural students, the project will expand training and certificate course offerings for these underrepresented groups. As a result of the project, by 2018-2019, at least 20 additional faculty members will be trained and fully equipped to teach mobile forensics. They, in turn, will be able to train others on their campuses and potentially impact thousands of students trained in mobile security, thereby improving cybersecurity in a variety of U.S. industry sectors and government.",
