The conference will bring together theorists and experimentalists in an effort to advance the theoretical understanding of complex biological systems. The speaker list includes leaders in the field from the US and abroad. Junior scientist and students are encouraged to participate.\r\n\r\nTo gain a deeper understanding of biology and make use of biological functions for societal benefits, the biology research enterprise is encouraged to adopt a more integrated approach to understand the multi-dimensional complexity and dynamics of these systems. This conference exemplifies one of the ways this can be achieved, namely to bring together theorists with experimentalists to learn from each other and to forge meaningful future collaborations. The organizers have made a noteworthy effort to encourage the participation from underrepresented groups, including women and minorities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant helped support strong graduate student involvement in the Ninth q-bio Conference, which is a highly interdisciplinary research conference geared toward advancing our understanding of the central unifying concepts governing how biological systems function.  The grant specifically funded 58 partial waivers ($200 off registration per person) and 1 full waiver (fully waived registration) for select students attending the conference.  These students were a major fraction of the 170+ conference attendees, and each of these students presented their own research either as an oral or poster presentation.\n\n\nThe intellectual merit of this grant is tied to at least three major activities or products that depended on the participation of supported students.  (1) Researchers at many different stages of their careers discussed the central principles behind cellular function during oral and poster presentations.  These interactions allowed for the refinement and dissemination of new ideas among attendees.  (2) A publicly available program containing scientific abstracts now provides a detailed record of the topics discussed, such that those not attending the conference still have access to a summarized form of the scientific ideas shared at the conference.  (3) A special issue of Physical Biology, titled \"Special issue dedicated to the Ninth q-bio Conference,\"  featured 12 peer reviewed scientific articles based on the research discussed in the conference.  This special issue provides a longterm product of polished research.\n\n\nBroader impacts from this grant follow from four main contributions.  (1) The support of graduate students contributes to the training of the next generation of researchers in the field of cellular systems.  These students were from a variety of backgrounds, including physics, biology, and engineering fields.  Exposure to and participation in the q-bio conference provided these students with valuable interdisciplinary training that will keep them competitive in their future careers.  (2) This ninth q-bio conference was held at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in Virginia, and this conference was the first of the series to be held outside of its original home in Santa Fe, NM.  This q-bio conference provided an opportunity to offer support to regional students who might normally not be able to attend due to financial considerations.  Students from West Virginia, Virginia, Alabama, Tennessee, Georgia, North Carolina, Maryland, and Pennsylvania are included in the list of nearby states containing supported students.  It should be noted that students from a number of other states were also supported, including but not limited to students from Utah, California, Illinois, and Texas.  (3)  Generally, the advancement of our understanding of the design principles behind cellular systems will lead to direct impacts in human health and biotechnology.  This is due to both a refined ability to interface with existing biological systems but also to engineer new synthetic systems, such as might be used as sensors for environmental contaminants.  (4) Through tutorials held early in the meeting, and particularly in the two banquet presentations (one by John Tyson, one by Phil Nelson), the essential role of interdisciplinary education was repeatedly emphasized.
