 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will be to greatly enhance the capabilities of printed electronics via high performance conductive materials.  This will be accomplished by the development and commercialization of novel silver and copper ink chemistries that are used in a number of device applications ranging from display bezels and interconnects, to high performance OLED electrodes, to ink specifically developed for high speed printing and smart packaging applications.  The commercial impact of such developments will be the significant adoption and use of printed electronics material palettes across multiple consumer electronic device platforms.  This will ultimately lead to more efficient device manufacture with a simultaneous improvement in performance.  The printed electronics market is rapidly growing with progress hinging on fundamental material improvements.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this Phase II research project are to demonstrate scalability of reactive silver ink chemistries, formulations for productization standards, and development of reactive copper ink chemistries.  The reactive silver ink chemistry has begun to receive significant traction with customers.  This program plans to achieve scalability of this high performance ink by novel purification of silver salts to achieve a high conductivity at large scales with industrially relevant processes.  Next the inks will need to adhere to specific productization standards.  This includes modifications of the chemistry for various printing processes ranging from low viscosity (10 cPs) up to high viscosities for high-volume printing techniques (1000 cPs and higher).  Also, modifications to the chemistry for various testing criteria such as adhesion, abrasion, and environmental tests such as humidity and heat cycling will be made.  Finally, reactive copper chemistries will be further developed.  Copper inks that can be processed thermally in the ambient environment represent both a significant challenge as well as a vast opportunity in the printed electronics market.  We have developed novel chemistries based on various low molecular weight reducing agents and short-chain surfactants that both reduce the copper quickly under thermal cycling while protecting the surface from oxidation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF 1534755 Reactive Silver Inks for High Performance Printed Electronics\n\n \n\nProject Outcomes Report\n\n \n\nElectroninks Incorporated was awarded a Phase II award to achieve the following milestones for its conductive ink products: (1) Ink scaling and materials purification, (2) Formulation development to meet productization standards, and (3) Reactive copper ink formulation development.  Through this funding, we were able to demonstrate a scalable (10?s of kilograms per days) way to achieve 99.999% purity silver salt production in house using a relatively inexpensive method.  This is vital for us to achieve the extremely high conductivity and performance values promised by our technology.  This was independently verified using ICP-MS from an outside lab.  With this scalable purification technology, we were able to successfully address an extremely high standard of conductivity at a large scale for electromagnetic shielding (EMI).  This result is extremely relevant in the ever-tightening standards for EMI in the consumer mobile market as wireless charging achieves large-scale adoption.  Finally, we were able to perform initial development on a corollary copper-based ink product that can be annealed in normal, ambient environments.  This resulted in a patent being filed.  There is still development work required for optimization the film formation of this product in order for it to be \"off-the-shelf\" for printed electronics applications.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, Electroninks Incorporated was awarded a Phase IIB supplement specifically based around the traction our products have received in the wearable electronics market.  These milestones were: (1) Increasing the viscosity of our precursor product, (2) Increase stretchability, and (3) Integration into a wearables product.  Through jointly funded work from a customer in the consumer mobile space, we were able to take our precursor based inks with an intrinsic viscosity of 10-12 cPs all the way to 300,000 cPs without losing any conductivity or performance values.  Though another jointly funded development in the textile space, a large partner was also able to test our optimized formulations in garments at 40% strain over 60,000 cycles without any significant degradation in conductivity.  This is resulting in a joint product development in the textile space due to the high conductivity and ease of integration into the fibers of the garment itself instead of laying down silver ink on top of the fabric. \n\n \n\nAs a direct result of funding from the NSF, Electroninks Incorporated has been incorporated into EMI shielding for consumer mobile devices as well as professional garments and has attracted much more customer attention and traction from the supported work.\n\n \n\nFurthermore, an indirect result of the project is a much more mature and advanced conductive ink technology that can cost-effectively address many issues currently seen in the consumer mobile and larger electronics market as a whole.  This has the potential to significantly impact many applications where traditional methods may be too costly or difficult and typical printed electronics materials may not have the performance required.  Our material palette bridges both market segment by achieving traditional plated metal performance with a chemistry that can be printed.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/07/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven B Walker"
