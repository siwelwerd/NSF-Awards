 "awd_abstract_narration": "The researcher will address a major question in Astronomy, understanding the first formation of galaxies.    Our most distant vision of the universe comes from radio wavelength observations. Their plan is to implement critical components of the next generation  radio telescope.   This telescope will observe the heating of the gas between galaxies, which happened when the first stars in galaxies formed.    These first stars in the first galaxies are too distant to be seen in optical light, but can be detected in radio waves.  Because these first galaxies are seen from a great distance, the radio waves are found to be shifted to much lower frequencies, making these observations very difficult. \r\n\r\nThe researcher will contribute to the study in two key ways: 1) investigating the effects of polarization calibration and foreground sources on power spectrum estimation and 2) developing the observational and analysis techniques to cross-correlate Epoch of Re-ionization data with other data sets.  The critical goal is extracting cosmological information, and their approach is based on semi-analytic models of re-ionization galaxies.\r\n\r\nThe primary broader impact activity is a novel one that goes beyond traditional efforts in this regime and was particularly well integrated with the research. They will convert an unused 10-m satellite dish into a community-use radio telescope in a high-poverty neighborhood, which will be used for high-school science projects. This includes involving students in the reconstruction of the dish. The students will use technology being developed for the experiment to detect the formation of galaxies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe first billion years of the universe saw the transition from the hot, dense plasma following the Big Bang to the universe of stars assembled into galaxies we recognize today.  While the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the leftover glow formed about 400,000 years after the Big Bang, has been well studied, and galaxies have been observed a few hundred million years after the Bang, the period in between remains poorly understood. A promising probe is the radio emission from neutral hydrogen, present throughout the universe, which was heated and ionized during the early phases of galaxy formation, so that in the present-day universe nearly all hydrogen is ionized and in the space between galaxies.  This period is known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR).  The hydrogen emission, if it can be observed, is potentially a powerful probe of process of the formation of the first stars and their assembly into galaxies, as well as the formation of black holes, and even potentially of exotic physics. \n\nThis project's primary intellectual merit was to advance the data analysis tools necessary to detect radio emission from neutral hydrogen during the first billion years, with a focus on the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), an NSF-funded radio telescope dedicated to detecting and characterizing this emission, and now nearing completion in South Africa.  Over the lifetime of the grant, a wide variety of issues were addressed, including\n\nassisting in the commissioning and calibration of HERA,\ndeveloping imaging and calibration techniques, particularly in dealing correctly with the polarized response of the instrument,\ncharacterizing the polarized response of HERA,\ncreating new methods of simulating HERA data,\nconstructing end-to-end testing of the data reduction pipeline using simulated data,\nexploring novel ways of analyzing HERA data by using cross-correlations with other data sets, including the CMB,\nadvancing machine learning methods for obtaining &tau; (\"tau\"), the optical depth to reionization, from radio data.  Tau has turned out to be an increasingly important quantity to measure via a vareity of methods, as uncertainty in its value propagates to other cosmological parameters estimated from the CMB.\n\n\nAll these investigations supplemented the ongoing work of other grants to construct HERA and served to extend the scientific impact of its measurements.\n\nThe research supported by this grant was reported in conference proceedings and refereed journals, including work in support of larger collaboration efforts.  Key results included a study of the effect of the ionosphere on the measurement of the EoR radio emission, a characterization of the polarized response of HERA, a method for cross-correlating hydrogen emission with CMB emission through the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, a new analysis technique to derive tau directly from HERA data, and a thorough test of the HERA pipeline via simulated data. \n\nThis grant supported the efforts of five graduate students, four of whom have been awarded their PhDs, as well as a postdoc now in a faculty position.  It also directly or indirectly supported the work of twelve undergraduates in summer research projects, at least four of whom went on to graduate studies in STEM, as well as several high school students. \n\nAs part of the broader impact program, a partnership was developed with West Philadelphia high school students to learn about the science and technology of radio astronomy.  Led by undergraduate students, a Mini Radio Telescope (MRT) was developed and made public with open-source hardware and software.  The MRT has been used in astronomy courses at Penn, in public lectures and demonstrations - including star parties and the Philadelphia Science Festival - as well as summer high school programs.  Many undergraduate researchers were also directly involved in HERA data analysis and were co-authors on published papers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/07/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James E Aguirre"
