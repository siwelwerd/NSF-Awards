Broader impacts of the work include training of a graduate student, engaging in research projects that incorporate women in physics and summer students from high schools, and workshop talks for high school teachers and general public talks on cosmology.  \r\n\r\nThe work will addresses systematic errors that arise from a variety of intrinsic alignments in weak lensing studies.
