 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is historically recognized for its malodorous rotten-egg smell, but is now accepted to be involved in diverse and important biological signaling processes. The fundamental chemistry by which H2S exerts this biological action, however, remains unclear. This project focuses on using synthetic model complexes to study H2S reactivity, with the goal of providing a greater understanding of how H2S reacts with important biological targets. Specific goals include understanding how H2S reacts with metal-containing biomolecules and how sulfur-rich compounds react in relation to H2S release and storage. The educational component of this project focuses on providing hands-on laboratory-based experiments for local middle and high school students while also providing career-development mentoring opportunities for college and graduate students.\r\n\r\nWith this CAREER Award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Michael Pluth from the University of Oregon to investigate the mechanisms by which H2S interacts with bioinorganic and bioorganic targets. Synthetic small-molecule model complexes will be used to investigate the mechanisms by which H2S reacts with transition-metal containing biomolecules. Parallel investigations will focus on establishing new methods of preparing small-molecule persulfides and understanding how these compounds react with biologically-relevant small molecules. Both foci share the goal of providing greater insight into the fundamental chemistry associated with H2S-mediated biological signaling. This CAREER award also supports the expansion of an outreach program co-developed by Professor Pluth that addresses reduced lab-based science education for local students due to state budget cuts. This program brings local middle and high school students to the University of Oregon to participate in STEM-based outreach activities and provides leadership and mentoring opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students.",
