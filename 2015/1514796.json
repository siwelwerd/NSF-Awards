 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now well accepted that cognitive functions are supported by activity dispersed throughout the brain, and that signals are passed among participating regions of the brain.  Indeed, there is an active direction of study, known as  connectomics, that seeks to find such connections on multiple spatial scales. It is not sufficient, however, to find what regions are connected. Rather it is important to determine how and in what directions regions are connected. How are signals conveyed and acted upon as part of a neural computational process? To understand such neural computations, it is necessary to understand how input patterns of signals in space and time are processed at the target network.  This is a huge scientific program in which mathematics and modeling can play a central role in guiding experiments. The aim of this research is to produce a body of work that is representative of the general issues that are encountered in adding input that has timing structure to networks exhibiting rhythmic structure.  From such a body of examples, a goal of this project is to search for general principles about networks of neurons with external input. Such forced networks are far more complex than the well-studied phenomena of simple forced oscillators. This project will support two graduate students and will be carried out within the context of the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative, a NSF-supported group of more than two dozen labs (mostly) in the Boston area working on brain dynamics and cognition.  The CRC is designed to facilitate collaborations among its many groups, with special attention to the graduate students and postdocs of these groups.  \r\n\r\nThis project is concerned with the effects of input signals with multiple time scales on target networks of neurons that also have multiple time scales.  From the huge number of examples of these phenomena manifest in the nervous system, this research is focused on two of particular biological importance.  The first is the interaction of gamma and theta rhythms, mainly in hippocampal networks, with inputs from other parts of the hippocampus and neocortex also carrying such temporal patterns.  The second concerns a rhythm that has been experimentally and computationally investigated in a region of parietal cortex in vitro; parietal cortices are known to be hubs of connections, with inputs from many other areas.  The particular rhythm in question arises as an after-effect of stimulation, and has been shown computationally to change the network response to later tonic excitation.  This research will improve understanding of the effect on a network displaying this rhythm of input with more complex spectral properties, such as inputs from other brain regions. The networks involved have both excitatory and inhibitory cells, sometimes with more than one kind of inhibitory cell producing multiple time scales in the target network.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject outcome\nInteraction of Time Scales in Forced Rhythmic Networks of Neurons       \nFederal Award ID: 1514796\nIntellectual Merit:\nRhythmic dynamics in the brain are critical for all aspects of cognition, which involves coordination of large areas of brain in any given task.  The input from a given area to another general has some rhythmic components, and hence the target can be considered a forced rhythmic network of neurons.  However, the effects of inputs on a network of neurons can be far more complex than that of a periodic input to a single oscillator described by phase.  One aspect of the complexity is that both the input and the target network may have multiple times scales that affect one another.  The purpose of this grant was to study a range of examples involving interacting time scales to look for new phenomena and general principles.  \nThe first project concerned a target network with one cell and an inhibitory autapse having a time scale of a gamma oscillation (~ 40 Hz); this cell also had an intrinsic outward current (M-current) whose kinetics had a longer (theta: ~ 8 Hz) time scale.  The input currents had a mixture of gamma and theta time scales.  The question was how these external and internal time scales would interact.  This pair of time scales is particularly important since the gamma and theta rhythms often appear together with the gamma nested inside the theta; the combination has been shown to be important in the hippocampus for memory and learning.  The main result is as follows: when the input to the target contains a theta oscillation, it makes it difficult for the simultaneous gamma to entrain the target.  The M-current acts in a homeostatic way to remove some effects of the theta and allow precise entrainment to take place. This precision is important for the plasticity function of the gamma rhythm.  \nThe interaction of gamma and theta was also the subject of a project about basal ganglia, a set of brain structures important for motor control. It was shown that the fast spiking interneurons (FSI) of the striatum, an input structure of the basal ganglia can produce both rhythms in a nested way, when the dopamine level is high.  In the same circumstances, another set of inhibitory neurons, the striatal projection neurons, produce a beta rhythm (8-20 Hz), associated with the continuation of a particular motor program.  The central result of this computational project was that gamma frequency inhibition from the FSIs can suppress the beta in the SPNs in part of every theta cycle, allowing a new motor program to be initiated. \nA third computational project concerned a parietal cortex network with four different kinds of cells, which produces a 15 Hz beta rhythm that is a concatenation of a gamma rhythm (40 Hz) and a faster beta rhythm (25 hz). This was shown to be a substrate for a working memory buffer: Inputs into this network could create, hold and manipulate cell assemblies, and be easily erased when no longer needed. A final project, partially supported by this grant, concerned rhythms in the cortex mediated by ketamine, an anesthetic that produces gamma and a slow rhythm (&lt; 1 Hz) at an anesthetic dose.  Ketamine acts to disinhibit excitatory cells, making its function as an anesthetic anti-intuitive.  This project determined a possible source of the slow rhythm, and why the gamma is embedded in it.   The computational work was closely related to experimental work and data analysis in which the Kopell group was involved; these parts of the projects helped explain why ketamine acts as an anesthetic by preventing appropriate coordination of different parts of the brain via changes in brain rhythms needed for coordination.  \nBroader Impacts:\nThis project supported 5 graduate students for a total of 60 months.   In addition to the students directly supported, Kopell mentored multiple students and postdocs from Boston University and other institutions. She also headed the Cognitive Rhythms Collaborative, a group of more than two dozen labs in the Boston area and beyond who work together to advance our understanding of the brain dynamics underlying cognitive functions such as sensory processing, attention, learning, memory and motor planning. The CRC focuses on mentoring as well as research.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/05/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nancy J Kopell"
