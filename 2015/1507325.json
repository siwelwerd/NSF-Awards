In a crystalline material, the arrangement of atoms can be described in terms of a unit cell which periodically repeats in all directions to make up the bulk crystal.  In some crystals such as gold and silicon, the unit cell contains only a few atoms, while in others, the unit cell may contain upwards of hundreds of atoms.  Examples of large unit cell crystals include \"zeolites\", which have application in catalysis, molecular separation, and gas storage, and \"fullerenes\", which have applications in molecular electronics and solar energy conversion. Understanding thermal transport in these materials is critical for predicting how they will respond to temperature fluctuations in their surroundings and how they can dissipate excess heat generated during device operation. \r\n\r\nThe way that heat flows through a crystalline material depends on its unit cell. Conventional understanding of thermal transport is based on theory developed for small unit cell crystals. Experimental evidence, however, suggests that these theories are not suitable for modeling thermal transport in large unit cell crystals.  The objective of this project is to use atomic-level computational tools to develop a framework for predicting the thermal conductivity of large unit crystals and apply it to zeolites and fullerenes. The results will be of direct importance to scientists and engineers using these materials in everyday applications. The computational tools developed will be suitable for modeling other large unit cell crystals.\r\n\r\nThrough this project, the research team will integrate nanoscience into the undergraduate engineering curriculum at Carnegie Mellon University through a lecture series and distribute the materials through the National Science Foundation-supported nanoHUB. Outreach activities related to large unit cell crystals will be developed and presented to middle school and high school students in Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education aimed at achieving a fundamental understanding of how thermal energy is transported in crystals with large unit cells. Crystalline materials with large unit cells are relevant in a wide range of energy-related challenges and opportunities, such as in catalysis, molecular separation, gas storage, thermoelectric energy conversion, and solar energy conversion. In many of these areas, thermal transport plays a critical role, but has received minimal attention.  The central hypothesis of this project is that not all vibrational modes in a large unit cell crystal propagate and that energy transport mechanisms at length scales smaller than the lattice constant are important. The overarching objective is to uncover the underlying physical mechanisms and to suggest strategies for the design of materials with tailored thermal properties.\r\n\r\nTwo distinct materials systems will be considered using a suite of atomic-level computational tools including molecular dynamics simulations and lattice dynamics calculations. First, zeolites, where all atoms are strongly bonded due to covalent and electrostatic interactions will be investigated.  Anharmonic and harmonic effects on thermal transport will be rigorously modeled to quantify the contributions of different types of vibrational modes to thermal conductivity. The effects of framework aluminum, non-framework cations, and adsorbed species on thermal conductivity will be quantified. Second, fullerene-based molecular crystals, where the intramolecular interactions are strong but the intermolecular interactions are weak due to van der Waals forces, will be investigated.  At low temperatures, a reduced-order model will be developed, while at higher temperatures a network model based on the thermal conductance between molecules will be explored. The modeling predictions will be validated through collaboration with experimental research groups. The methods and tools developed will translate to studies of thermal transport in other large unit cell crystals, such as clathrates, skutterudites, Zintl compounds, gas hydrates, and metal-organic frameworks.\r\n\r\nThrough this project, the research team will integrate nanoscience into the undergraduate engineering curriculum at Carnegie Mellon University through a lecture series and distribute the materials through the National Science Foundation-supported nanoHUB. Outreach activities related to large unit cell crystals will be developed and presented to middle school and high school students in Pittsburgh.",

These materials have application in technologies ranging from solar energy conversion to carbon dioxide capture to thermal insulation.<br /><br />We studied fullerenes built from 60-atom carbon molecules (i.e., C<sub>60</sub> buckyballs). These materials are interesting because the C<sub>60</sub>s rotate freely at high temperatures. We discovered that these rotations do not carry heat themselves, but do scatter with other heat carriers, lowering thermal conductivity. We determined that a simple reduced-order model, where each C<sub>60</sub> is replaced by a point mass, is able to predict structural and mechanical properties, but cannot predict thermal properties due to the importance of the molecular rotations.<br /><br />Superatomic crystals are built from C60s and more complicated organic molecules. By applying the knowledge gained from the fullerene work, we collaborated with experimental research groups to discover the same rotation-based suppression of thermal conductivity. The design space of SACs is large (I.e., there are many possible molecules to choose from and they can be arranged in different ways). Our results suggest that it will be possible to control thermal transport in SACs using chemical composition, pressure, and electric fields, moving beyond the temperature control in simple fullerenes.<br /><br />Metal-organic frameworks are organic-inorganic hybrid materials that contain Angstrom-sized pores and channels. We determined how the shape and size of the pores and channels impacts thermal conductivity in empty and gas-filled MOFs. Studying gas-filled MOFs is important for understanding how they will behave in gas storage and separation applications. We also analyzed the dynamics of gas molecules as they enter a MOF. Probing this transient process is critical for predicting the temperature rise that will accompany tank filling and may be detrimental to filling speed and capacity. We determined that the thermal transport resistance at the interface is significant, but that the mass transport resistance is negligible.<br /><br />This project contributed to the training of four PhD students, two Masters students, and one undergraduate student.
