 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative project involving the University of California, Davis (Award DUE-1525862), Diablo Valley College (Award DUE-1525057), Howard University (Award DUE-1524638), the College of Saint Benedict (Award DUE-1525021), Hope College (Award DUE-1524990), and the University of Arkansas, Little Rock (Award DUE-1525037).\r\n\r\nThis project will expand the content and capabilities of the STEMWiki Hyperlibrary, which was launched to provide vetted Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) learning resources to the public in the form of easily accessible, online college textbooks that alleviate the rising costs of postsecondary education. The STEMWiki Hyperlibrary consists of a number of connected, discipline-focused hypertext applications (ChemWiki, BioWiki, MathWiki, StatWiki, GeoWiki, PhysWiki), which are freely accessible to students regardless of socioeconomic or educational backgrounds. The ChemWiki (http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu) is currently the most developed STEMWiki, with millions of visits each month. By making high-quality STEM learning resources readily available, the project will positively impact at least four main populations: (1) the non-science community; (2) socioeconomically disadvantaged students; (3) smaller or financially disadvantaged academic institutions, including high schools, that wish to adopt new learning technologies but cannot afford the initial steep costs of a new curriculum; and (4) discipline-based education researchers looking for a platform on which to evaluate new interdisciplinary approaches and curriculum modifications, which would otherwise absorb too large of a budget to develop from scratch. Once sufficiently developed, the Hyperlibary will be a power platform for the dissemination of new educational content and the evaluation of emerging educational technologies.\r\n\r\nThe STEMWiki Hyperlibrary is designed as a collaboratively constructed learning environment that enables the dissemination and evaluation of new educational resources and approaches as online course textbooks, with an emphasis on data-driven assessment of student learning and performance. The STEMWikis allow learners to cooperatively construct and organize knowledge, providing an important alternative to \"one size fits all\" instruction in which content is presented in a static, prepackaged manner. In this project, the investigators will augment the constituent STEMWikis of the Hyperlibrary with ancillary homework and simulation applications, as well as formative assessment modules. They will integrate the content of the STEMWikis both horizontally (across multiple STEM fields) and vertically (across multiple levels of complexity) within a network that will provide not just single textbooks but a rich \"hyperlibrary\" through which new, interconnected STEM textbooks can be constructed. The result will be an easy-to-use platform on which faculty members can collaborate to create and publish reusable, online pedagogical content. The project team will add ancillary online homework (the Student Ability Rating and Inquiry System [SARIS]) and simulations (via the ChemCollective, http://www.chemcollective.org). From these components, they will build an assessment infrastructure that tracks and correlates use of individual Wiki-based textbooks with simulations, homework activity, and exam performance, with the goal of identifying and tracking student performance across multiple STEM curricula.",

The supporting work of the DVC team produced a number of meaningful outcomes that provided intellectual opportunities for students, helped constructively disrupt the definition of what constitutes a college textbook and what should be fair costs to students, and served to assist in affecting the long-term sustainability of the LibreTexts Project.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The team produced significant, high-quality Open Educational Resources (OER). The process directly benefitted more than 70 DVC students either academically and/or financially, who worked on the project, and indirectly more than 200 students, who class-tested the OER produced and related methodologies used over the three year period.</p>\n<p>The co-PI and adjunct DVC faculty gained professional experience that improved their tenure-track hiring prospects. Outside-faculty, who added to their professional credentials, improved consideration for promotion.</p>\n<p>An important consequence of the DVC team's contributions being included in the published LibreTexts collection of more than 20,000 webpages that are disseminated through the chemistry library (https://chem.libretexts.org/), is the broad reach to a very large audience who use the library.

The award calls for the LibreTexts /UC Davis?s collaborative group to continue development and expansion of the Project with the objectives of minimizing textbook costs and maximizing the instructional value to all students. The DoEd grant incorporated DVC into a larger Contra Costa Community College District (4CD) team, adding two new members, DVC's sister colleges, Los Medanos College (LMC) and Contra Costa College (CCC), an NSF funded Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), for Phase III of LibreTexts continued development.</p>\n<p>NSF award, 1525057, provided resources and support that allowed the DVC team to substantively contribute to building a solid foundation for the LibreTexts Project, which offers it the flexibility needed to adapt to changes that emerge over the next decade in the nature of textbooks, new pedagogies and learning environments, and which result in LibreTexts being effectively positioned to evolve with whatever those changes may be, and strengthen the Project's long-term sustainability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/04/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ronald&nbsp;J&nbsp;Rusay</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
