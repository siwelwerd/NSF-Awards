 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is requesting travel funds and subsistence support for U.S. graduate students to attend one-week 2015 Magnetism Summer School being held at the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis/St Paul, Minnesota, from on June 14-19, 2015.  Funds are requested to support for an additional 12 U.S. graduate students to attend the Magnetism Summer School in addition to the 70 being supported by the IEEE Magnetics Society.  This outreach effort promotes education in the field of magnetism and attracts more young scientists to choose a research career in magnetism and related areas.  The broader impact of the Summer School lies in the education of young scientists and researchers in a fast-moving and economically important field of magnetism.  Participants will learn both fundamental as well as advanced topics through lectures delivered by internationally-renowned experts.  In addition, there is a degree of cultural education, teaching young scientists to interact with their colleagues from other countries.  The students will be co-housed with peers from different nationalities fostering interaction and cultural exchange.  The organizers of the Summer School particularly encourage women and underrepresented minorities to participate.  The program committee also strives for diversity in the lecturers selected for the summer school to provide role models for female and minority students.  There are 28% women attendees.\r\n\r\nThe Summer School provides a forum for exchange of information in the field of magnetics research.  The one-week Magnetism Summer School is designed for graduate students to both learn and interact with each other and world-renown experts in the field.  Lectures have been carefully chosen to begin with fundamentals of magnetism and proceed into more advanced topics throughout the week.   In addition, lecturers are chosen from around the world both from industry and academia.  Each participating student is required to present a poster about their current research.  The students will also have the opportunity to present their own work to each other and to experts via two evening poster sessions.  The students will spend significant time interacting with researchers.  A large team of poster judges have been assembled to evaluate the quality of student research efforts.  Finally, there will be special evening sessions on Entrepreneurship and a Career Panel by the speakers.",
