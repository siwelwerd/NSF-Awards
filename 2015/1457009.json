 "awd_abstract_narration": "During animal development, cells increase in number as the overall body and each part of the body grow in size and complexity. The processes that coordinate growth, shape generation, and final size are essential to ensure the correct body pattern is made and key features such as limbs are properly formed. In this project, the fruit fly wing will be used as a model to study limb growth. By studying the wing at the beginning of development, when the tissue is simpler, the direct effects of genes that regulate cell growth can be tested. The research will use important resources that have been developed in the nationally funded genome projects and will involve molecular biology, genetics and microscopy. It is expected that a comprehensive view of how a limb is established from the earliest stages will emerge. The genes used in limb development in fruit flies are conserved with other animals, including humans, so that general principals will be learned. To increase public understanding of science, an animated movie will be made in conjunction with the Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design. The movie will highlight the beginning of fruit fly genetics, which started a field of research that has fueled the fundamental understanding of animal biology for more than a century.   \r\n\r\nAs animal body parts and organs grow in size and complexity, cell proliferation must be linked to cell fates so that the final structure has the correct pattern and proportions. A major goal in developmental biology is to understand the link between patterning and growth (scaling) at a mechanistic level. In the proposed work, the small group of cells comprising the wing disc, which become the fly thorax and wing, will be studied as they increase in number from about 30 to 150 cells. In this short time window the major pattern is established. The mechanisms that operate here encapsulate those typical of all growing systems and involve conserved growth factors in the Dpp and Egfr pathways. By studying the regulation of cell-cell signaling and determining how cell fate is linked to domains of cell proliferation, the work is expected to both fill a gap in knowledge about early development of the Drosophila wing and provide insight into fundamental processes shared in all animals. In an effort to broaden public understanding of genetics, the story of the pioneer Drosophila geneticist, Morgan, will be documented in a biographical film. In partnership with ACCAD (Advanced Computing Center for the Arts and Design), a state-of-the-art graphic film will be made that describes the discovery of the first Drosophila mutant - the famous white-eyed fly. The film will be posted on YouTube for broad dissemination.",

The coordination process results in a predictable size and form for each species. When the process is altered, different body types result, which can impact function and disease susceptibility. We used the fruit fly, Drosophila, wing disc?a flagship model for understanding growth control to study how growth of the wing is initiated and controlled by a growth factor system, called the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) pathway. We also determined how growth induced by EGF signaling is coordinated with overall body growth. The EGF pathway is comprised of a receptor molecule that sits on the outside of cells, including wing cells, and molecules, called ligands that attach to the receptor and send a signal into the cell to cause a response, such as cell growth and division into two cells?so that an organ, tissue or limb can increase in size. In the early wing disc, which is only about 30 cells in size, a ligand called Vein (Vn) acts as the signal molecule to activate the EGF pathway and initiate cell divisions and growth of the wing.</p>\n<p>In normal wing development, the cells start to divide at about seven hours and all the cells are dividing by fifteen hours (Figure 1). In Vn mutant larvae, in which the EGF pathway is not functioning, the wing cells fail to divide (Figure 2). When these flies develop, they lack wings indicating that the fly has lost the coordination between growth of the whole body and a part of the body?wings. If larvae are starved the wing cells do not divide (Figure 3). This suggests that nutritional deprivation acts as a signal to stop the wing growing. In this way the fly is able to co-ordinate overall growth with the growth of a limb (the wing in this case). Interestingly, in starved larvae, the Vn gene is not expressed (Figure 4). Taken together these results suggest that the EGF pathway coordinates overall growth with growth of a body part (the wing) because the activating ligand is only expressed if the larvae are well fed. While there is extensive information about systemic growth of animals and the growth of individual organs, tissues, and limbs, little is known about how these two processes are coordinated. Our results suggest that the EGF ligand Vn is a mediator between systemic growth and tissue growth and a key molecule for coordinating the two. Future work will investigate the specific mechanisms that control expression of Vn in response to the nutritional level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/22/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mark&nbsp;A&nbsp;Seeger</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457009/1457009_10382483_1640197849101_Figures--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457009/1457009_10382483_1640197849101_Figures--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figures\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457009/1457009_10382483_1640197849101_Figures--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figures\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figures for outcomes text</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Amanda Simcox</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mark&nbsp;A&nbsp;Seeger</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figures</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
