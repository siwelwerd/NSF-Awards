 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs are organizing a summer school in the summer of 2015 on land-atmosphere interactions. The objective of the summer school is to cover a large range of topics pertinent to the study of land-atmosphere interactions from soil physics, plant ecophysiology, and boundary layer turbulence and convection. This objective is to train the next generation of scientists in this area and hope that such training will generate rapid research development in the field.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit \r\nAn NSF-sponsored workshop was held in September of 2014 to facilitate progress in hydrometeorological, hydroclimatic, and ecohydrological (HHE) research. The study and funding of land-atmosphere interaction research came up as the number one priority of the workshop. One of the main gaps towards research and operational advances in this area is the lack of core training in land-atmosphere interactions. This summer school is targeted at addressing this need.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts \r\nOne of the objectives is to reach out to a diverse pool of students and young scientists in the U.S. so that the scientists attending the summer school reflect the diversity of the population.  Historically Black Colleges and Universities will be specifically targeted.  Several lectures will be available online through the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Sciences, Inc. (CUAHSI).",
