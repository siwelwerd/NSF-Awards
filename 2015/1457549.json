 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rivers and streams are the major conduits for transporting of Earth's carbon from the land to the oceans.  Much of the carbon is in a dissolved organic form, and it serves as food for aquatic microorganisms.  The challenge is that the chemical diversity of dissolved organic carbon is very great, and the genetic diversity of aquatic microbes is also immense.  Accordingly, this project will use state-of-the art genomic methods to study the diversity and specific functions of these microorganisms.  The results will fill a critical gap in understanding the specific metabolic capabilities of these microbes and how they carry out the key ecosystem function of transforming and metabolizing highly complex, riverborne dissolved organic carbon.  The data that will be collected are important for predicting the impacts of land-use change, nutrient use, and shifting climate on freshwater quality across the USA.  The research involves a collaboration with the Yale Peabody Museum Evolution program for inner-city New Haven high-school students to train interns and develop an interactive museum exhibit on U.S. rivers. The project will also train a postdoctoral researcher, and undergraduate and graduate students, including members of underrepresented groups in science.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to describe interactions and feedbacks between watershed diversity, microbial functional diversity, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) chemistry in 36 large U.S. rivers, and to experimentally link gene expression with DOM degradation in five of them (the Altamaha, Columbia, Mississippi, St. Lawrence and Yukon). River sampling will be conducted in collaboration with a U.S. Geological Survey stream network. This research will address the concept that microbial genetic mechanisms in river ecosystems are closely linked to climate and landscape features that control river environmental conditions, particularly DOM quality. This concept implies that microbial function is shaped by DOM composition, climate, and river chemistry. These shaping forces alter the functional genetic capabilities required for competitive success within riverine microbial communities, and, thus, drive shifts in functional gene expression and phylogenetic composition, that, in turn, increase the efficiency of DOM metabolism and biogeochemical processes. Three hypotheses are to be tested: (1) the functional genetic composition and gene expression patterns of riverine microbial communities are correlated with the composition of riverine DOM; (2) community gene expression patterns vary predictably in response to shifts in the available forms of DOM; and, (3) the composition of riverine bacterial communities correlates with the composition of riverine DOM over space and time, and varies with watershed-specific climatic factors. The first hypothesis will be addressed with an empirical study of microbial community gene content (metagenomics), gene expression (metatranscriptomics), and DOM diversity (high-resolution analytical chemistry) during four seasons in five rivers that encompass a broad range of DOM composition. The second hypothesis will be addressed with an experimental study to identify active organisms and genes expressed by freshwater microbial metabolism. The third hypothesis will be addressed with an empirical study of microbes, DOM, and river chemistry in 36 major U.S. rivers. Statistical approaches being developed through a Microsoft-sponsored international working group (BioGeoChemistry Data System) will be applied to link microbial and DOM data.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project proposed to greatly expand our knowledge base on the intersection of microbial diversity and dissolved organic matter diversity in freshwater ecosystems.  One major outcome to date concerning microbial diversity is that microbial DNA can be used to understand hydrologic function in rivers.  The relationship between flow conditions and bacterial DNA was explored across a range of riverine environments and flow conditions.  It was found that because flow conditions determine environmental variables important to microbial habitat, their DNA can be used for hydrologic purposes, including prediction of river hydrographs.  This new approach, termed \"genohydrology\", offers new direction for aquatic sciences.\n\n               Multiple outcomes have been reported to date concerning dissolved organic matter diversity.  First, the diversity of DOM age was explored.  The radiocarbon age of DOM provides information on both the sources of riverine DOM and the timescale of connection between land and rivers.  Samples from this study were used to demonstrate that different photoreactive components of DOM have different ages.  The most photo-reactive portion of DOM is generally modern.  This contrasts with the more 14C depleted/older DOM, which is driven by large pools of slightly older compounds.  It was also found that the flow paths and therefore residence time of DOM in watersheds is an important determinant of its age.  Aged DOM was more prevalent in arid watersheds or during base flow, both of which are characteristics of longer flow paths and residence times.  Finally, the importance of residence time on DOM composition was further explored using optical characteristics of DOM across a range of watersheds that varied in size, climate, and land cover.  Results suggest that residence time, or the amount of time DOM spent traveling in streams, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, was a major predictor of compositional changes.  Collectively these studies are increasing the knowledge base on the controls of DOM composition.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/10/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter Raymond"
