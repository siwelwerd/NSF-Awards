 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Arizona State University Center for Games and Impact will collaborate with VME (Vme Media), E-Line Media, and HACU (Hispanic Association of Colleges & Universities) to develop a project designed to engage Hispanic middle-school students in learning about STEM careers. The project will initially stimulate career interest as youth reflect on game play using the Career Illumination Tool. They will then work through a number of targeted quests using a bilingual, game-infused platform, followed by submitting an application expressing interest in pursuing a STEM focused degree program, and culminating in a HACU tour at universities and community colleges in the Phoenix and San Antonio areas. Students and their parents will be recruited through: (1) nationally broadcast Vme television (Spanish-language public television) episodes and web-based shorts in Spanish and English introducing STEM careers and the college application process and (2) community-level outreach. The project will involve approximately 1300 middle-school students in the Phoenix, AZ and San Antonio, TX school districts, as well as participants from other regions reached by media outreach.\r\n\r\nAn online guidebook will facilitate the adoption of the program by other communities across the nation. The project will develop a web presence on the Vme Television website, and will use an original television series to promote the program among a Hispanic audience of more that 11 million viewers. The project and its resources will be further disseminated through presentations at conferences, journal article submissions, outreach to Hispanic-serving institutes of higher education, and the use of social media to target Latino students.  This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand how online resources, gaming and media increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM).\r\n\r\nThe project design is based on a growing body of research that documents the successful use of technology in developing student interest and engagement in STEM activities. A mixed methods approach will be used to examine research questions that will look at the communities formed by participants, reciprocal influences of the project on participants and their caregivers and teachers, and student uptake of concepts and resources along with the effects on their self-efficacy and interest in STEM career pathways. The project will access data analytics (user data) to determine how users are participating and use these interactions to understand what areas and resources are drawing students in. The project will further analyze STEM learning from games, self-efficacy, and attitudes towards STEM careers using validated instruments.",

This project designed, built, tested, and implemented multiple components, including (a) a Journey-based thrive-focused connected learning platform with multiple learning journeys focused on supporting Hispanic youth pursuing STEM careers, (b) 13 Vme television episodes in Spanish and web-based shorts in Spanish and English illuminating STEM careers and the college application process, (c) HACU supported campus tours focused on STEM degrees and targeted towards Spanish speaking families, and (d) STEM-focused games in both Spanish and English. The work was presented at academic conferences, is published in a book chapter, supported a student dissertation, and the STEM Mio platform experience, the game in both Spanish and English, and all videos illuminating Latino professions doing STEM career videos are publicly available. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>As further description, through this grant we developed the connected growth platform, ThriveCast, designed to support youth in creating STEM stories in the context of other youth with whom they relate. Within the infrastructure of the ThriveCast platform, we designed the STEM Mio Journey and its four &ldquo;Collections&rdquo; of growth activities. The first Collection called Identifying Passions, focused on exploring one&rsquo;s STEM-related interests and then trying out different activities, and building a support network. Collection Two, Exploring Professions, prompted the user to pick an interest area and learn more about relevant professions and then to begin envisioning a personal career possibility. The next Collection, Pursuing Pathways, focused on identifying a college or other possible pathway to work towards a desired future. The final Collection, Plan Futures, involves picking a direction and begin orchestrating ones remaining courses, identifying enrichment activities, and even submitting a college application (getting letters of recommendation, SATs, writing their best essay, finding a avenues for funding/scholarships/FAFSA, etc).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each of these four Collections includes five Growth Modules, with each module including an aspirational goal, peer success stories, growth activities, and an opportunity to create and submit one&rsquo;s own thrive story for review. As part of assembling transformative resources, we worked with VME television (discussed below) and created Latino STEM video segments that were integrated into the platform. Additionally, we developed other diverse growth experiences as part of the &ldquo;grow&rdquo; activities, including 50 different learning challenges leveraging key resources including over a dozen videos produced for the platform journey, which we created as part of our STEM Mio TV series. To date the platform and games have been used with over 400 youth, passing through multiple iterations informing research on how people learn published in a book chapter, and is now openly available to anyone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As a companion and providing resources to the STEM Mio game-based journey and learning activities, we co-created a television series called&nbsp;<strong><em>Generaci&oacute;n STEM</em></strong>, to engage entire families with STEM, college, and the benefits of preparing for these careers, while providing Latinx role models, sharing their stories of what they do and what they overcame to get there. These 13 episodes have been broadcast for the past two seasons on VME TV (Spanish Public television), and have 19 airings thus far on Primo TV (the first English-language Hispanic tween/teen TV channel). All episodes are also available in English within STEM Mio, and in English and Spanish for families to watch together anytime online.&nbsp;The combined broadcasts on VME and Primo channels have thus far reached over 25,000 viewers across multiple airings, continuing to be shown and with many available on YouTube.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, two games were developed, one remaining publicly available, providing an immersive world to support middle-school youth in learning about scientific inquiry and available in Spanish and English. These games were used with over 300 youth during the project and are both now publicly available on our website with a fully integrated teacher dashboard to support successful implementation in classrooms and after-school environments. While the focus of this grant was more on design, insights related to the development of the underlying ThriveCast platform used to host the STEM Mio online experiences were published in a book and presented at two conferences.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/10/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sasha&nbsp;Barab</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
