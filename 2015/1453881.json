 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program grant will create new, science-based, computer models to accurately predict the deterioration of reinforced concrete infrastructure.  Physical infrastructure forms a foundation for our quality of life and enables national development and progress.  However, the design of bridges, dams, and other structures that are safe, efficient, and long lasting, while also socially, environmentally, and economically sustainable, has not proven to be straightforward.  Our deteriorating infrastructure continues to require larger maintenance budgets, while consuming vast material resources and energy.  The new models created through this research will result in the design of infrastructure systems that reduce economic cost, environmental emissions, and negative societal impacts over their decades-long life cycles.  An important innovation of these models is their ability to consider uncertainty.  Uncertain future events may include evolving use patterns of infrastructure, a changing climate, or the introduction of new, more sustainable, construction technologies.  By rethinking the design and management of our national infrastructure, results from this research will benefit the United States economy, environment, and society.  The research involves a number of disciplines including civil engineering, material science, electrochemistry, and industrial ecology.  This multi-disciplinary approach will be leveraged to increase participation of underrepresented groups in research and education at the undergraduate, graduate, and practicing professional levels.\r\n\r\nFuture reinforced concrete design standards should couple physics-based models of materials and structures with probabilistic reliability-based methods in order to design safe and efficient structures.  To advance the field of sustainable infrastructure design, this research engages in development of (i) multi-physics, multi-scale numerical models for deterioration of reinforced concrete structures exposed to harsh environments, (ii) probabilistic life cycle assessment models that capture the full life cycle impacts of reinforced concrete materials, and (iii) reliability-based design approaches for infrastructure systems that meet economic, environmental, and social sustainability limit states.  Deterioration models will computationally link physiochemical processes of ion transport, reinforcement corrosion initiation, and corrosion propagation at smaller scales with finite element models of degraded reinforced concrete structures at larger scales.  When orthogonally integrated with probabilistic life cycle impact measures, the evolution of future economic, social, and environmental impacts of reinforced concrete infrastructure can be computed, along with its likelihood of meeting long-term, sustainability-focused, impact reduction targets.  Ultimately, this research provides a pathway for integrating sustainability-focused design goals into modern structural engineering design methods.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnsustainable energy and material consumption, waste production, and emissions are some of today?s most pressing global concerns.  To address these concerns, civil engineers are now designing facilities that, for example, passively generate power, reuse waste, and are carbon neutral.   These designs are based foremost on longstanding engineering theory.  Yet woven within this basic knowledge must be new science and new technologies, which advance the field of civil engineering to the forefront of sustainability-focused design.  \n\nThus, this research developed fundamental engineering design concepts, models, and tools that are tightly integrated with quantitative sustainability assessment and service life modeling across length scales, from material scales to system scales, and throughout the early design, project engineering, construction, and operation life cycle phases of constructed facilities. This research approach is embodied in the Sustainable Integrated Materials, Structures, Systems (SIMSS) framework. This framework allows researchers to design more sustainable built environments at all scales of the world around us; materials, structures, and systems, and includes multi-physics modeling informed by infrastructure sensing data and computational learning and feedback algorithms.  Overall this work applied SIMSS through two complementary research thrusts;  (1) developing high-fidelity quantitative sustainability assessment methods that enable civil engineers to quickly and probabilistically measure sustainability indicators (right side of the SIMMS framework), and (2) creating multi-scale, fundamental engineering tools that integrate with sustainability assessment and facilitate setting and meeting sustainability targets throughout the life cycle of facilities (left side of the SIMMS framework). \n\nThis award also served as the research foundation for the newly established Stanford Center at the Incheon Global Campus (SCIGC) in South Korea.  Officially founded on July 1, 2020, and physically opened on June 20, 2021, the Stanford Center at the Incheon Global Campus (SCIGC) is Stanford University?s flagship research center in Korea and a strong bridge between researchers in the United States and South Korea.  SCIGC is built to be an interdisciplinary research center initially engaging in smart and sustainable municipal finance and entrepreneurship, smart and sustainable urban mobility, circular urban economies and sustainable systems, and smart and healthy city innovation.  Recognizing that sustainability is a global challenge, the establishment of research centers like SCIGC is critical for supporting research collaboration, exchange of ideas, and sharing of solutions.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Lepech"
