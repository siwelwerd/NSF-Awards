 "awd_abstract_narration": "A non-technical description of the project, which explains the project's significance and importance\r\n\r\nCoastal erosion is a problem of national and global importance. As more people live along the shore, it is becoming increasingly vital to forecast how storms and other weather systems can alter the landscapes of coastlines. This RAPID project will collect intensive field data from the Oregon coastline during a period of elevated sea level and El Ni\u00f1o conditions that will make numerical models of beach movement and erosion more accurate.  Numerical models of coastal processes are widely used by federal/state government agencies, local planners, and consultancies for a range of engineering and planning applications; accordingly, enhancing the quantitative accuracy of morphological evolution in these models has the potential to improve the quality of many products and services. \r\n\r\nA technical description of the project\r\n\r\nThis RAPID project will implement a beach and dune topographic surveying campaign in the Netarts littoral cell, Oregon to quantify the impacts of extreme sea level anomalies on beach morphology. Hypotheses to be tested are whether 1) the majority of the dune-backed coastline within Oregon's headland-bound littoral cells will experience the \"collision regime\" of the Sallenger storm impact scale approximately 10-15% more during El Ni\u00f1o than during normal years. Dunes along the coast will also experience the \"overwash regime\" significantly more than during a typical year; 2) the southern extent of littoral cells will experience significant erosion and will be more impacted than the north. Gradients in longshore sediment transport will erode on the order of tens of thousands of cubic meters of sand from the southern ends of littoral cells with that sediment being transported both offshore and northward; and 3) Cross shore sediment supply to the beach following storms and at the end of the anomalous period, initiating the recovery phase for the dunes, will be highly spatially variable based on beach morphometrics, but will be strongly correlated to local gradients in longshore sediment transport.  Although there is a general sense of how sea level anomalies and El Ni\u00f1o events impact beaches and dunes along the U.S. West Coast, there are few data sets available and the rates and mechanisms of onshore feeding of sediment are poorly documented. This research will quantify the sediment volume lost from the beach during each storm event and subsequently track the spatial and temporal trends in beach recovery throughout the winter and spring.",
