 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop new methods of describing and managing neuroscience data in order to accelerate scientific progress in many fields of neuroscience and deepen understanding of the brain.  The project will produce software tools to enable annotation and integration of distributed data and help leverage the wealth of data emerging from current large-scale projects such as the Human Brain Project in Europe and the BRAIN Initiative in the US.  These results will impact medical application areas such as brain machine interfaces, devices for sensor prosthetics and also application areas such as computer vision.  Further, the methods developed might be generalizable to other domains of biology and medicine where traditional rigid approaches for organizing data are inapplicable. This could lead to the discovery of causes and treatments of diseases that would not have been made otherwise.\r\n\r\nNeurophysiology data, which contain recordings of brain activity, are becoming more commonly shared on the web but they are still very hard to use. To improve the usability of shared neurophysiology data sets, a standardized and expandable system will be developed for annotating the data with metadata required for their understanding. Furthermore, semantic web technology will be employed to represent, index, and integrate data and metadata, across distributed locations on the web. Improving the organization of metadata for shared neurophysiology data will be key for enabling studies that integrate across data sets, such as new types of meta-analyses or data mining methods.  This project builds on existing online resources for neurophysiology data created by the project partners, CRCNS.org and G-NODE.org, and on pervious work by the INCF neurophysiology data sharing task force. Training of international students and researchers in annual summer courses at UC Berkeley and LMU Munich will improve career opportunities that allow individuals across disciplines to make discoveries and advancements in neuroscience. \r\n\r\nA companion project is being funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, Germany (BMBF).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding the functions of the brain is one of humanity's grandest challenges.  Success in this endeavor will require harnessing the vast amount of experimental data being produced in neuroscience labs and making that data available for analysis to a multitude of experts.  This project resulted in the development of tools that can make it easier for researchers to search neuroscience data in order to find data useful for a particular analysis.   The tools focused on neurophysiology data (data describing how the responses of neurons change over time) and were designed to work with such data stored in different formats.   One set of tools was designed for data stored in a format called Neurodata Without Borders (NWB) and allowed searching for data in that format without requiring converting the data to another format.  Another set of tools was developed to convert data from a variety of representations to a common form called the Resource Description Framework (RDF) which is used in the \"Semantic Web.\"  The Semantic Web representation allows linking distributed data and searching for data based on the relationships between data.  The tools developed enable converting data from the NWB format, JSON, odML and DataCite metadata formats to RDF.  The odML format (stands for open metadata Markup Language) was developed by the German G-Node which is a project partner.  The DataCite format stores metadata that are used to create a DOI for shared datasets.  Once in the RDF format, the data from these different sources can be searched in a unified way using SPARQL, which is a query language used for the Semantic Web.\n\nAdditionally, this project enabled the continued support and expansion of the CRCNS.org repository, which is a repository of publicly available neuroscience data useful for computational neuroscience.   During the project, 63 new datasets were added to CRCNS.org, bringing the total to 140 datasets.  The datasets hosted at the repository have enabled the creation of at least 200 publications based on the data.\n\nThe project also supported training of 103 students and researchers in techniques for analyzing neuroscience data through a 2-week summer course in mining and modeling neuroscience data which was held three times, and had about 34 students each year.  Videos of the lectures of these courses has been made publicly available at archive.org.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/03/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Friedrich T Sommer"
