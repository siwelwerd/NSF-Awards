 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the NSF I-Corp for Learning Program, this project will develop ways to increase the scale and impact of an effort to help community college biology faculty to meet the challenges facing this segment of higher education. The  program, called the B2 Scholars program, is a model professional development program which is designed to provide a community of practice to increase the rate of adoption of pedagogical reforms, and encourage participants to remain active in disciplinary and education communities. The model combines education and social science research about adoption of instructional reform, effective pedagogical approaches, and additional skills needed by at risk students to succeed in academia. Community colleges serve an enormous number of undergraduates: estimated enrollment for Fall 2014 was 12.4 million students.  High percentages of these students come from low socioeconomic backgrounds, are groups underrepresented in STEM disciplines, are non-traditional students, and work  while pursuing degrees.  Working with these students requires a strong understanding of how students learn, how to help students overcome cognitive and content barriers, and how to develop the professional skills recent research has demonstrated are necessary for academic success.  Unfortunately, most community college faculty are provided few resources, both in terms of funding and time, for professional development that would help them keep abreast of current educational information.  The B2 Scholars program is designed to directly impact the success of community college students by providing bioscience community college faculty with the skills and resources to enhance student success.  The program's emphasis on bioscience faculty is a reflection of the popularity of bioscience majors; in 2007-08, health sciences was the most popular STEM Associate's degree at 21% of STEM degrees (1,627,000 students) and this area continues to show enormous growth.\r\n\r\nThe B2 Scholars program will help enhance community college faculty pedagogical skills within their discipline, promote broader participation in disciplinary and educational communities, and encourage these faculty to assume leadership roles in designing the future of postsecondary education. The model has been developed based on educational research and lessons learned over BioQUEST's past 29 years in biology education reform.  The program utilizes a combination of face-to-face and virtual communities to allow participants to develop meaningful relationships and support each other through the challenges of adopting and implementing educational reforms. This model has the potential to be a valuable template for additional BioQUEST professional development programs serving other faculty communities. By increasing the widespread implementation of these professional development practices, this project will help to improve the effectiveness community college educators.",

By participating in the iCorpsL program we were able to explore the viability of the B2 Scholars program with the target audience, partners, and funders.  Participation in iCorpsL gave us an opportunity to talk with a wide variety of people, refine our message, and determine what aspects of the program were of interest.  We interviewed biology faculty and administrators at two year institutions across the country.

These conversations helped us refine our message and identify the valuable components of the program. We were encouraged by the overwhelmingly positive response to the program from all parties.\n \nThrough the course of these conversations we have developed relationships with many leaders of community college education.  We have commitments from individuals to assist with the development of the B2 Scholars program including shaping the professional development curriculum, serving on an advisory board, and mentoring participants.  We have several societies, both educational and scientific, with whom we are exploring partnerships.

The participants in the pilot worked with mentors from the B2 development team to increase their understanding of education reform theory, practices and resources, and in at least one instance are presenting the outcomes of their research at the National Association of Biology Teachers. \n \nIntellectual Merit\nThe iCorpsL program provided the opportunity for the team to explore the viability of the B2 Program, to revise the program to better serve the target audience, to pilot the program with a select group of participants to learn how to improve the program, and to continue conversations with a wide array of interested parties.  The lessons from the iCorpsL course were valuable in thinking about a sustainability plan for the project and developing a business model.  The opportunity to broaden our contacts in the community increases our likelihood of success, and potential partners for the program.  iCorpsL gave us time to network and develop the program, and a language to present a business model to future investors.\n \nBroader Impacts\nThe goal of the B2 Program is to develop a community of practice that supports scholarship among faculty, increasing the rate of adoption of pedagogical reforms, and encouraging participants to actively engage with disciplinary and education communities to continue their professional development.  The ultimate outcome of the B2 Project is increasing the success of the diverse community college student body by enhancing retention and completion. Incorporation of effective student centered pedagogical approaches has been shown to improve student interest and attitudes about science, as well as impacting understanding.  The B2 Scholars Program approach has the potential to impact institutional practices, increase student success and contribute to a diversified workforce.  It also has the potential to impact general scientific literary and attitudes about science.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kristin P Jenkins"
