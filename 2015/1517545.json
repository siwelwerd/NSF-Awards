 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal aims to use observations of galaxy clusters to investigate models for dark-matter particles. Galaxy clusters can be thought of as enormous reservoirs of non-radiating, thus \"dark\", matter. Particles of dark matter respond to the force of gravity, but little else is known about them. Theories predict that dark-matter particles will annihilate or decay, yielding gamma-ray emission plus high-energy electrons and positrons that can radiate in other regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The team's models show that the products of dark-matter annihilation are best traced via their radio emission, and they will use galaxy clusters to investigate that radio linkage. The team's models also show that the products of dark-matter decay are best traced via their gamma-ray emission, and they will use galaxy clusters to investigate that gamma-ray linkage. Finally, the team will modify their models and apply them to unusual clusters that exhibit radio halos, to try to solve the long-standing problem of the halos' origin. The PI will continue her efforts at departmental, institutional, and national levels to promote the involvement of women in physics. She will expand these departmental and institutional efforts to include other underrepresented groups",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA confluence of evidence suggests that dark matter is some form of weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP), but the type of particle and its properties remain unknown. This project improved our understanding of the nature of the dark matter which makes up most of the mass in our universe.  For example, the project opened a new window for particle dark matter searches by showing the strength of radio observations with current and near term facilities.  These observations can exceed the sensitivity of all current astronomical dark matter searches and present one of the best opportunities to learn more about dark matter in the next few years.  In addition, we have developed a tool for modeling the multiwavelength signature of dark matter including relevent astrophysical proceses.  This tool has been made public so that members of the community can make maximum use of this novel probe.  Using this tool, we placed limits on dark matter particle properties using observations of galaxies and clusters of galaxies; we showed that the gamma-ray emission from the Andromeda galaxy is likely not of dark matter origin, and we investigated the same radio and gamma-ray data to better understand the populations and acceleration of cosmic rays in galaxies.  This project has shown the utility of radio observations for understanding dark matter and particle physics and provided a tool for utilizing them.  This is novel and previously under appreciated science in radio astronomy.  As such it can impact planning of radio surveys and future radio instrumentation.\n\nThis project has provided experience and training in research to two graduate students and one undergraduate student.  In addition, the PI is committed to increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in science, and she organizes and participates in numerous outreach activities.  During the grant period these include acting as the faculty mentor for the UCSC Women in Physics Club, talks at multiple local high schools, four public outreach talks, and meetings with student groups like SACNAS (Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science), IMAP (Improving My Academic Progress), and MINT (Matriculating, Influencing, Networking and Triumphing).  IMAP is a program which aids students on academic probation, while MINT is a mentoring program for women-identified undergraduate students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tesla E Jeltema"
