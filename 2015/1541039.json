 "awd_abstract_narration": "EarthCube is supporting the creation of interoperable tools and services for Earth science research, but no environment currently exists for integration and testing of these components.  The EarthCube Integration and Test Environment (ECITE), an outgrowth of activities of the EarthCube Testbed Working Group. The ECITE approach focuses on integrating existing effective technologies and resources as well as capabilities being built by the EarthCube community to provide a federated and interoperable test environment. ECITE?s nationwide cyberinfrastructure for the geosciences will also advance the understanding of regional cyberinfrastructure and collaborative geosciences across geographic locations and disciplines by contributing relevant scheduling tools and a working integration and testing environment. A hallmark of the ECITE effort will be engagement of scientists and technologists from multiple disciplines and geographic regions across the geosciences community to develop requirements, prototype, design, build, and test an integration test-bed that will support cross-disciplinary research.  The multi-disciplinary ECITE team is led by Sara Graves of the University of Huntsville in Alabama (UAH) and includes participants from all areas of the United States. ECITE activities will enable EarthCube to further support other members and contribute leadership to the broader scientific community. The ECITE federated Integration and Test (I&T) environment has the potential to scale and extend to an NSF wide integration and test capability that can serve as a model and example for other agencies. The proposed ECITE functionality is vital to ensure that the broader goals of the EarthCube are achieved.\r\n\r\nThe ECITE team will actively engage EarthCube and the wider geosciences community in definition of requirements, design, and testing of the system. ECITE will consist of a seamless federated system of scalable and location independent distributed computational resources (nodes) across the US.  The hybrid federated system will provide a robust set of distributed resources to include both public and private cloud capabilities.  The nodes will provide compute and storage resources requiring minimal system administration.ECITE is an important step in ensuring that EarthCube components will be able to work together to provide a successful framework that can continue to evolve to meet the needs of the geosciences community.  This research addresses timely issues of integration, test and evaluation methodologies and best practices with a strong interoperability theme to advance disciplinary research through the integration of diverse and heterogeneous data, algorithms, systems and sciences. The results and findings will provide guidance for EarthCube evolution and future integration efforts. The ECITE team aims to make the Integration and Test (I&T) environment easy to use and readily available to the EarthCube community. Access to the resulting platform will enable and encourage the EarthCube community to develop prototypes, try out new technologies, and to share ideas, concepts and experiments",

The ECITE project was the implementation of ideas and requirements initially developed by the EarthCube Technology and Architecture Committee (TAC) Test-bed Working Group (TWG). Specifically the ECITE prototype expanded the TAC technology testbed ideas by leveraging public and private computational resources, providing cloud hosting solutions for EarthCube Building Block and Integrative Activities projects, and demonstrated how an EarthCube testbed can be used for the integration, assessment and validation of EarthCube funded, and other existing, technologies, models, etc. Specific developments included the establishment of a hybrid cloud environment consisting of both public (e.g. Amazon Web Services and NSF Jetstream) and private (e.g. resources are George Mason University and CalTech) cloud resources that were accessible from a single sign-on administrative application, making it seamless for researchers to utilize the best available resources for their development and testing. Instructional videos (see Figure 1) were provided to assist users in setting up and utilizing the ECITE hybrid cloud resources. A number of current and previous EarthCube-funded technology projects (e.g. CINERGI, CHORDS, BCube, OntoSoft and others) utilized the free ECITE cloud capabilities during the course of the prototype activity. For technology assessment, the ECITE team designed and deployed an online system (based on the Open Science Foundation?s infrastructure, see Figure 2) that provide the ability to define, conduct and track technology testing and assessment activities. Example assessments were performed on example EarthCube technologies to demonstrate the possible utilization and benefit to EarthCube decision processes. The ECITE project team conducted outreach to the broader geoscience community by presenting information about technology integration and testing at annual American Geophysical Union (AGU), Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography (ASLO), AstroInformatics meetings, Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) meetings, EarthCube All Hands meetings, as well as other relevant workshops and conferences. The project team achieved a highly collaborative effort through continuous community engagement with EarthCube committees and related geoscience technology-oriented activities, allowing for the assimilation of assessment and testing ideas and concepts from the broader community. The culmination of the ECITE project was the development and promotion of ideas for comprehensive EarthCube science-driven workbench concepts that would further the ability of geoscience researchers to better utilize the technologies evolving from the EarthCube program. The workbench concepts and recommendations were reported to the EarthCube Leadership Committee for inclusion as part of a larger report and recommendations for future EarthCube directions to the NSF program office. Over 10 journal papers were published with international journals, such as the international journal of digital earth. Two Ph.D. worked and based their dissertation on the project. Both of them are continuing STEM research career with IBM research in silicon Valley and Ankura at Washington DC.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/24/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kenneth&nbsp;R&nbsp;Keiser</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541039/1541039_10397478_1540384069826_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541039/1541039_10397478_1540384069826_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1: Instructional videos provided for users of the ECITE hybrid cloud resources.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541039/1541039_10397478_1540384069826_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: Instructional videos provided for users of the ECITE hybrid cloud resources.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: Instructional videos provided for users of the ECITE hybrid cloud resources.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NSF EarthCube Integration and Test Environment</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kenneth&nbsp;R&nbsp;Keiser</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1: Instructional videos provided for users of the ECITE hybrid cloud resources.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541039/1541039_10397478_1540384163987_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541039/1541039_10397478_1540384163987_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2: Screenshot of the prototyped ECITE technology assessment system based on OSF infrastructure\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1541039/1541039_10397478_1540384163987_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2: Screenshot of the prototyped ECITE technology assessment system based on OSF infrastructure\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2: Screenshot of the prototyped ECITE technology assessment system based on OSF infrastructure</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NSF EarthCube Integration and Test Environment</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kenneth&nbsp;R&nbsp;Keiser</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2: Screenshot of the prototyped ECITE technology assessment system based on OSF infrastructure</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
