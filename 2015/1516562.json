 "awd_abstract_narration": "Libraries serve vital roles in communities not only for access to print media but also family programming and access to the internet. Because of their widespread local presence in communities and the diverse communities served, libraries are well-positioned to address inequalities in access to technology, family programming, and spaces for collaboration. Science centers, universities, and community centers represent resources that can partner with libraries to create science and technology-related content for delivery to diverse communities. Research has firmly established the link between parent engagement and a broad range of student academic outcomes, including higher student attendance, achievement and graduation rates.  A growing body of research in out-of-school science learning is focusing on the rich and varied ways in which families learn science outside of school, including habits of mind, motivation, and identities as scientists. Pilot work showed that backpacks have the potential for youth and parents to take on new roles relative to STEM work, with parents or older siblings taking on roles of lab partners, translators, and even teachers. The Robotics and E-Textiles project will support increased capacity within libraries and community centers to hold robotics workshops for families in their own communities.  Libraries and community centers will serve as vehicles through which families engage with robotics and e-textiles, resulting in wider access to Next Generation Science Standards' engineering practices to more people. This Innovations in Development project is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments.\r\n\r\nLibrarians and community engagement leaders will participate in professional experiences to develop science and technology content and facilitation skills. University researchers in collaboration with project partners will use a design-based research methodology to iteratively design the professional development and backpack programs and to investigate learning processes and outcomes. The Cultural Learning Pathways theoretical model will guide the study of how engagement with robotics/e-textiles experiences can lead to changes in practice, identity, and deeper participation in communities of practice on the part of librarians, youth, and families. \r\n\r\nAlthough collaborations between public libraries and informal science providers are becoming increasingly common, this project will document the process of developing such collaborations and draw insights that may be applied to other contexts. By bringing together traditional and non-traditional community organizations to develop and facilitate STEM learning experiences, this project has the potential for resulting in a new model for a decentralized system of informal STEM education and broadening participation in STEM. Over the life of the project, the number of partner libraries will expand from one to four, and it is anticipated to reach more than 550 families. It is being conducted through a partnership between the University of Washington, the Pacific Science Center, the Seattle Public Libraries, and Red Eagle Soaring, a Native American community youth program.",
