Unlike large rivers with extensive sediment routing systems or large estuaries at their mouths, these smaller rivers have a more direct sediment path to the ocean, thus maintaining a better signal of the flood event.  These episodic-event dominated rivers typically reflect climate variability rather than seasonal cycles.  This results in the record of past flood events preserved in the marine sedimentary deposit that can give insight into climatic variations over longer time scales.  Understanding these past climatic variations regionally will be critical for anticipating future variations due to climate change.  Unfortunately, developing strong proxies for river floods using the marine sedimentary record is not a straightforward application due to the complexities of sediment dispersal along continental margins.  This project aims to take advantage of recent, near historic floods on the Brazos River, a moderately sized, episodic river draining into the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), to investigate how a flood deposit is ultimately preserved in the continental shelf sediment record.  As large floods within this river typically result from El Ni\u00f1o conditions, flood deposits preserved in the sedimentary record will reflect past periods of intense flooding associated with El Ni\u00f1o events in the northwestern GOM.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this study is to develop a high-discharge/El Ni\u00f1o proxy for the northwestern GOM based on this most recent flood event that may be useful for future paleo-climate studies.  To accomplish this, PIs plan to collect sediment cores during two sampling cruises along the shelf between the river mouth and the distal depocenter, a feature known as the Texas Mud Blanket (TMB).  These cruises will take place at approximately 3 and 6 months following peak discharge to investigate: 1) how the flood deposit changes over this time period; 2) the fraction that may be transported to the TMB during a single event; and 3) the preservation potential of event layers in the TMB.  To answer these questions they will delineate the flood layer in the cores by analyzing a variety of sedimentological properties including: physical characteristics, short-lived radioisotopes (e.g. 7Be and 234Th), and elemental composition from XRF core logging.  Understanding these depositional characteristics will help to establish an appropriate environmental proxy for such events.   Some of the broader impacts from this study include funding an early career scientist, and engaging and training undergraduate and graduate students in geoscience research, many of which will be from traditionally under represented groups.",
