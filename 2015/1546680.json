 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implantable passive mechanisms have never been developed for orthopedic surgery.  This project seeks to create a paradigm shift in the domain of reconstructive orthopedic surgery through the exploration of the commercial market for a new class of implantable biomedical devices.  The implants are passive mechanisms that take the form of tendon networks, levers, pulleys, and linkages.  They will be surgically placed between muscles and tendons within the body with the goal of modifying the functional attachment of muscles to tendons and bone.  Specifically, the implants will provide the ability to scale and distribute forces better between muscles and tendons when compared with the current practice of using sutures to make attachments.  These implants will enable customizable and superior musculoskeletal function for the patient, thus improving quality of life in the long term.  Since such implants have never been developed before, this project promotes the progress of science.  If these implants make it to market, the work could lead to the creation of a new medical-device industry, thus advancing national health, prosperity and welfare.\r\n  \r\nThe work currently focuses on two classes of implantable passive mechanisms as exemplar implants. The first class consists of 'differential' mechanisms, such as moving pulleys and levers, which distribute forces and movements from one muscle across multiple tendons. The second class of implants consists of 'force-scaling' mechanisms that increase the force transferred from one muscle to a tendon. Preliminary studies show that these implants enable customizable and superior musculoskeletal function for the patient, thus improving quality of life in the long term. During the I-Corps program, each member of the team will pursue activities every week that explore the commercialization potential of the proposed technology.  Specifically, the team will bring together ideas regarding the need for such implant technology in the surgical domain by consulting with people from different backgrounds, such as companies that develop orthopedic implants, regulatory bodies, and medical care centers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nI-Corps: OrthoMechanica-Implantable Passive Mechanisms For Orthopedic Surgery\n\nAward ID: 1546680\n\nProject Outcomes\n\n \n\nThe I-Corps experience for Team OrthoMechanica was successful in multiple ways.  Most significantly, it brought together a team of researchers, students, entrepreneurs, surgeons, rehabilitation experts, and patients to explore the commercial potential for the novel orthopedic implants developed at Oregon State University (OSU).  One hundred 1:1 interviews were conducted over a span of ten weeks by attending conferences, making office visits, and conducting phone calls across Oregon, Washington, Illinois, Toronto, and Chennai and Bengaluru in India.  This intense experience provided the Principal Investigator (PI) and the Enterpreneurial Lead (EL) input from a variety of angles; particularly about how end users (orthopedic surgeons and patients) would value the technology developed and about how to navigate the challenging path of biomedical device development.  We now list the outcomes in terms of the broader impact and intellectual merit.\n\n \n\nThe intellectual merit of this work is three-fold.  First, the work identified the need for the technology.  It was noticed that there exists a need for the technology in two applications; namely, in the tendon-transfer surgery for high median-ulnar nerve palsy, where the implant would lead to improved hand manipulation function, and in the tendon-transfer surgery for restoring the foot arch in flatfeet, where the implant would lead to improved foot arch restoration.  Second, the work identified the network of partners that we would need to convince about the technology?s benefits in order to commercialize this technology.  Specifically, it was noticed that surgeons first had to be convinced that the technology provided superior surgical outcomes to the patient and insurance companies needed to be convinced of the financial viability of the technology.  Third, the work identified that the key technical barrier that needed to be overcome is to prove the technology in live animals.  This led the PI to identify the specific animal model (chicken foot) to evaluate the technology.\n\n \n\nBroader impacts\n\nThe PI, the EL, and the PI?s group learned much about how to explore the business side of research projects in universities.  They learned to be fearless in obtaining information from disparate sources to create a concise and rational evaluation of the feasibility of the technology.  This information gained through this project enabled the PI to secure two federal grants and one OSU internal grant.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/24/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ravi Balasubramanian"
