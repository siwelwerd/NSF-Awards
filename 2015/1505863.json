In addition to disseminating the latest results, CIPANP facilitates both formal and informal exchanges of information and the building of connections between physicists in these fields.  The 12th CIPANP will be held May 19 through 24 in Vail, Colorado and will bring together physicists from around the word.  This award supports the participation of young physicists and will be used to encourage a diverse group of participants.  \r\n\r\nCIPANP 2015 is organized with public lectures, plenary, parallel and poster sessions.  Topic areas include Physics at High Energies; High Intensity and Precision Physics; Cosmic Physics and Dark Energy/Inflation; Neutrino Masses and Neutrino Mixing; Electroweak Tests of the Standard Model; Dark Matter; Particle and Nuclear Astrophysics; Heavy Flavor and CKM Matrix; QCD, Hadron Spectroscopy and Exotics; Partonic Distributions in Nucleon and Nuclei; Hadronic Physics and Structure of Nucleus and Nuclei; and Quark Matter and High Energy Heavy Ion Collisions.  Proceedings will be published and presentations will be posted on the conference website.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n      The Conference on the Intersections of Particle and Nuclear Physics (CIPANP) is a triennial conference series that focuses on topics of interest to elementary particle physicists, nuclear physicists and physicists with interests in particle/nuclear astrophysics. As this conference series has developed since 1984, the overlap of these areas has markedly increased. For example, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is exploring both elementary physics and heavy ion physics, through ATLAS/CMS and ALICE respectively.   The LHCb experiment continues exploration of flavor physics.   Research in the neutrino sector has attracted both traditional nuclear, particle, and astro- physicists to measurements of extra-terrestrial neutrinos, reactor neutrinos, accelerator neutrinos and double beta decay.  Rare Isotope Facilities have opened up the possibility of innovative studies of very fundamental physics questions.  The connection to the cosmic frontier and particle astrophysics both through theoretical research and experimental methods is increasing.  In all of these fields, there is extensive overlap between particle, nuclear, and astro- physics in both theoretical ideas and experimental methods.   The Intellectual Merits of this award come through the uniqueness of this conference which has facilitated both formal and informal interchange of information among elementary particle physicists, nuclear physicists, and particle/nuclear astrophysics. \n\n      The 12th Conference on the Intersections of Particle and Nuclear Physics (CIPANP 2015) was held at the Vail Marriott in Vail, Colorado from May 19-24, 2015. The conference hosted over 300 scientists from nuclear, particle and astrophysics disciplines who presented thier work in plenary and parallel sessions and in a poster session.  The Broader Impacts of this award come both through the science presented and its impact on the community and specifically through enabling early career scientists to participate.  This  NSF award  enbaled young researchers to attend the conference through support of their local expenses and conference fees.  It is the young people who are critical to the success of the conference and the future of these fields and their intersections.  Enabling their participation both greatly enhanced the science of the conference and benefitted the careers of the scientists who had an opportunity to present their work and to interact with other scientists in their disciplines and related disciplines.  Overall, over 60 scientists received support to allow them to attend the conference. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bonnie Fleming"
