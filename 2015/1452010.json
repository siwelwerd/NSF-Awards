 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Oklahoma to support the Sam Noble Museum Recent Invertebrates Collection.  This scientific resource documents biodiversity in the state of Oklahoma and beyond, and is one of the largest collections of invertebrates from Oklahoma. This award will support the installation of a mobile storage (compactor) system and provide new entomology cabinets.  The project improves infrastructure to adequately and efficiently utilize existing space and increase the potential collection capacity.  Collection security and physical access to the specimens is enhanced for researchers and students.  The project will integrate with the existing ExplorOlogy Program at the Museum to engage K-12 students in research and encourage the participation of Native Americans, the largest underrepresented group in Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nThis project is the next phase in a long-term collection revitalization plan for rehousing and re-curating the ca. 400,000 pinned insect specimens at the Sam Noble Museum, the only active entomological collection in Oklahoma. The collection includes one of the largest and most comprehensive collections of Byrrhoidea, an aquatic beetle superfamily.  The collection also contains ca. 160,000 Diptera from early and recent surveys, inventories, epidemiology studies, and vector ecology. The collection contains 2,796 primary and secondary insect types that have been cataloged and digitized, as well as historically important collections of dragonflies, butterflies and other beetle groups. Along with the installation of a new compactor system and new cabinets, a reorganization of the collection will be completed, and will incorporate recent knowledge on phylogenetic relationships of insects. In a state where natural habitats have been and continue to be replaced by agriculture, deforestation, grazing, and other land use change, these specimens provide an invaluable record of entomological diversity in the decades before and after statehood (in 1907; Oklahoma was designated as Indian Territory until the major land runs began in 1889). Currently this is the only digitized and readily accessible entomology collection in Oklahoma. All data resulting from this project will be shared with iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/), ensuring accessibility to researchers and the public.",

The award was given to the Department of Recent Invertebrates, which houses one of the largest collections of invertebrates in the state of Oklahoma. The largest portion of the collection, the insects, was in desperate need of a safer and bigger storage solution to ensure its protection. Being the only insect collection in Oklahoma currently open to researchers and the public, the specimens also needed to be more accessible physically. This was accomplished between 2015-2017 by moving over 500,000 insect specimens from old, broken drawers and cabinets to a new compactor storage system with protective sealed cabinets and new drawers. Two undergraduate students, a graduate student, and a museum-studies intern were funded to help move and reorganize the collection so it is accessible and can expand to incorporate specimens from ongoing research. The inclusion of students allowed opportunities for them to be trained &nbsp;in both museum-based research, and logistical planning of large-scale projects. These opportunities resulted in two first-authored student posters presented at the Entomological Collections Network Meeting in 2016, and one ongoing research project with the museum studies intern on Emergency Planning in Collections.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The funding of this grant to the SNOMNH Recent Invertebrates Collection has resulted in a doubling of visitation to the collection by researchers and the public. Loans of the specimens to other researchers has also doubled during the duration of this grant, which is impressive considering the collection was completely shut down for six months during the physical construction of the compactor storage. The Department of Recent Invertebrates is also now able to expand its holding of specimens for new and ongoing research of insects in Oklahoma and abroad, including the Philippines, which it did not have room for before this grant. Therefore, the National Science Foundation was fundamental in allowing the museum to become a leader in Oklahoma, and the world, in specimen-based research. resreseresearch.for the next century.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/08/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Katrina&nbsp;Menard</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1452010/1452010_10384746_1502201787486_20170712_144400--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1452010/1452010_10384746_1502201787486_20170712_144400--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The Collection is now accessible\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1452010/1452010_10384746_1502201787486_20170712_144400--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The Collection is now accessible\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Thanks to the NSF CSBR grant to our collection, we are now able to utilize our collection better for visiting scientists and other Oklahoman researchers, including this group of ExplorOlogy students investigating Oklahoma's insect biodiversity.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carrie McKenzie</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Katrina&nbsp;Menard</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">The Collection is now accessible</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1452010/1452010_10384746_1502201416034_compactors2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1452010/1452010_10384746_1502201416034_compactors2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Collection Floor with rails being installed\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1452010/1452010_10384746_1502201416034_compactors2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Collection Floor with rails being installed\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">All of the old, rusty cabinets were removed so the rail system for our compactors could be installed.
