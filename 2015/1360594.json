 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will address fundamental science questions on how the midlatitude ionosphere behaves as a system. The midlatitude ionosphere is as prone to instability as the equatorial and auroral ionospheres despite the lack of obvious sources of free energy, and there is no comprehensive theory to explain this. There is a clear relationship between neutral winds, wind shear, and turbulence and Es layer formation and structuring, but the causal links have yet to be clearly articulated. Equally clear is that E region irregularities and F region medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances (MSTIDs) and irregularities are electrically coupled, but the roles of the regions (sources, loads, coupled resonators) remain unspecified. \r\n\tThis project will investigate midlatitude sporadic E layers, MSTIDs, the associated plasma density irregularities, their mutual coupling, their geomagnetic conjugacy, and coupling to the thermospheric neutral motion. The investigation will have experimental, theoretical, and modeling aspects. The experimental component of the research will be conducted in the Caribbean and will center on the Arecibo incoherent scatter radar. This radar will be supported by a coherent scatter radar imager fielded so as to have common E- and F-region scattering volumes with Arecibo. The project will also utilize the Arecibo lidars and all-sky imagers as well as sounders and GPS Total Electron Content (TEC) data. The theoretical investigation will focus on the turbulence properties of the neutral motions in the mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) region, which will be studied using a multi-scale analysis, and on the consequences for ionospheric structuring. Modeling work will incorporate a newly developed, fully three-dimensional plasma dynamics model. \r\n\tUndergraduate and graduate students will participate in this work, and public outreach activities will be carried out in the Caribbean.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe E and F layers in the Earth's ionosphere at mid latitudes frequently experience significant vertical displacements, and even overturning, in the layers that create major disruptions in the upper atmosphere.  In the E region near 100-km altitude these disturbances are manifested as Sporadic E layers, which also have important effects on radio communication.  At F-region heights near 250 km, mid-latitude Spread F occurs.  The project was designed to study these phenomena and the physical processes responsible for their occurrence using the large radar system at the Arecibo Observatory in coordination with observations from a smaller radar system located on St. Croix that was observing the same region as the Arecibo radar above Puerto Rico.  The research project led to the development of new techniques for obtaining the motion of the neutral, i.e., unionized, component of the atmospheric flow from the radar measurements of the motion of the charged particles.  The combination of the information obtained with the new technique and extended height and horizontal spatial coverage provided by the combination of the two radar systems led to the identification of two previously unknown instabilities, one operating in the E region and one operating in the F region, that are responsible for the accelerated upwelling and possible overturning in the medium.  Specifically, the observed neutral and ionized flow parameters were used as input to an advanced numerical model that simulates the physics of the region, as well as the vertical coupling between the E and F region.  The neutral flow was found to be a critical driver for the instabilities, and the electrical coupling between the E and F layers was found to be an important parameter in the development of the unstable flows.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Miguel F Larsen"
