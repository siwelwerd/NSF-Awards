 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this proposed scholarship program funded by the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, SUNY Cortland will create 38 scholarships for secondary school teacher candidates in mathematics, science and technology fields. These teachers will serve in central New York and the five major city areas of New York State. Partners in the project include departments of Biology, Chemistry, Geology and Physics, the School of Education, SUNY Cortland's Urban Recruitment of Educators (CURE), the SUNY Urban Teacher Education Center, and Central New York (CNY) public school districts including Cincinnatus, Cortland, Dryden, Homer, Marathon, and South Seneca. Having highly trained STEM teachers who truly understand both their content and pedagogy will engage students in such ways as to increase the numbers of both future STEM professionals and the next generation of STEM teachers.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work has three major foci: (1) to support 38 new Noyce Scholars with scholarships and value-added immersion experiences with project partners; (2) to develop a freshmen-learning community at SUNY Cortland named 'STEM2ED COR' that provides orientation sections for the recruitment of future STEM educators early on in their careers as freshmen and sophomores; and 3) to design a longitudinal study that aims to identify which aspects of the immersion model designed for the SUNY Cortland Noyce Scholarship Program have the most positive impact in attracting, preparing and supporting participants for work in high-need schools. This immersion model system of specialized classwork, field experience, student teaching in a high-need school district (HNSD), and integrated professional development will produce exceptionally-trained and qualified teachers ready to be successful in a HNSD. Additionally Noyce Scholarship recipients will attend on-campus workshops, seminars, and book chats with New York State Master Teachers with a focus on successful teaching in high-need schools and working with students who live in poverty. A longitudinal research study will examine scholar recruitment and certification, teaching efficacy and effectiveness, and retention among Cortland Noyce scholars.",

The funding supported new scholarships and related supporting activities for these students, the creation of a new class at the college that would encourage STEM students to consider becoming a teacher, and a longitudinal study that would help the authors better understand what it takes to prepare an effective teacher.  There were a total of 26 awards made to students.  The awards were either $11,500 for undergraduate study or $14,000 for graduate study. Approximately 53.8% of the awards went to students that identified in an underrepresented group in STEM disciplines.\n\n \n\nThe students that accepted these awards were expected to teach in a High Needs School District (HNSD) for two years for every year of support they received.  School districts qualified as a HNSD based on a number of factors that New York State maintains which includes percentage of students from families that are at or below the poverty level or the amount of turnover of staff at a school.  Examples of schools from Cortland County include Cortland Public Schools, Homer Public Schools, and McGraw Public schools.\n\n \n\nThe second main focus of this grant was to recruit more students into STEM and STEM Education fields.  Cortland offers a Freshmen Experience class call COR.  A new section of this class was created that focused on career choices in STEM and STEM Education.  Interested students were given the opportunity to learn more about different career pathways and were encouraged to apply to the scholarship program.\n\n \n\nThe final aspect of the program was the Longitudinal Study.  Initial data collected from this survey indicates that 76% of the students that were part of the Cortland Noyce program were still working as teachers, as compared to a national average closer to 50% of teachers leaving the field after 5 years and more than 90% of the alumni of the program remained on the staff at a High Needs School or School District.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory D Phelan"
