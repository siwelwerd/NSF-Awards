 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many social organisms live in groups of variable size.  Group size has many important consequences, such as affecting the spread and transmission of infectious diseases both within the group and to members of other groups.  This project seeks to understand why groups of variable size persist over long-term time scales.  As we better understand what promotes variability in group size, we can better predict the extent to which the costs or benefits of group living will change over time.  One popular but untested hypothesis is that climatic differences between years cause variation in food supply or in populations of parasites and pathogens, and this in turn causes the payoffs of different group sizes to vary annually. This project builds on a long-term study of a social bird, the cliff swallow, which lives in colonies of widely different sizes, and seeks to investigate whether changing selection on the animals' survival and reproductive success can explain annual variation in group size.  The research addresses one of the most fundamental questions in evolutionary ecology. \r\n \r\nThis project will test the prediction that success of individuals will increase with group size in some years, decrease with group size in others, and remain unchanged in yet other years.  It will be determined to what degree the birds' annual nesting success varies from year to year in colonies of different sizes.  This will be investigated by systematically collecting data at 20-25 colonies each year.  The work will determine the causes of variation in reproductive success by measuring the extent of parasite infestation, time of breeding, bird condition, and other factors. This study will promote better understanding of how group size affects individuals' lifetime reproductive success across long-term time scales, assist in interpreting the extensive variation in group size that is characteristic of many organisms, and reveal the potential influence of recent climatic changes on social behavior. The research will involve women, Native Americans, and students from the Great Plains, promoting STEM training of underrepresented groups with respect to gender, ethnicity, and geographic region.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany social animals live in groups of different sizes.  Individuals often seem to survive or reproduce better in groups of particular sizes in a given year, and ecologists have thus been puzzled as to why some individuals continue to occupy the least successful group sizes.  One possibility is that environmental changes in ecological conditions (such as food availability or the presence of parasites) and/or climatic conditions (e.g., wet years versus dry years) lead to certain group sizes being most successful in some years or in some areas, but at other times animals in different group sizes do best.  Whether the net advantages of different sized groups fluctuate in this way is unknown and can only be addressed with long-term research that measures the success of animals in different groups in different years and geographic regions.  This research measured the reproductive success of individuals of a social bird, the cliff swallow, which breeds in colonies ranging from 1 to 6000 nests.  Cliff swallows are distributed throughout much of western North America and are one of the most highly social land birds in the world.  The work investigated whether the costs and benefits of particular colony sizes change regularly enough among years to explain the long-term persistence of variation in group size.  \n\nThe data gathered was used to study specifically annual reproductive success in colonies of different sizes from year to year.  We systematically collected data on fledging success at up to 55 cliff swallow colonies each year.  As predicted, we found that in some years birds in large colonies did best, in some years birds in small colonies did best, in some years there was no effect of colony size, and in one year birds at the two colony-size extremes did best.  These results are consistent with fluctuating selection generating and maintaining the variation in group size seen in this species.  The research involved undergraduate students and offered them intensive research experience and training in field ecology.  Public outreach was conducted by giving annual lectures at the Swallows Day festival at Mission San Juan Capistrano in California, appearance on national media associated with that event, and maintenance of a web site about the research and cliff swallows generally.  This study has yielded better understanding of how group size affects animal fitness over the long term, assists in interpreting the extensive variation in group size that is characteristic of most social animals, reveals the potential influence of climatic changes on animal social behavior, and provides a test of the importance of fluctuating selection in generating and maintaining behavioral variation.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles R Brown"
