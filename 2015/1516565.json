 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project is concerned with the mathematical modeling and analysis of certain types of behaviors in superconductivity and nonlinear optics.  Many problems arising in physics can be modeled by nonlinear partial differential equations, and some of these differential equations generate solutions with interesting structures, such as pulse-like solutions that model light traveling through fiber optics or vortex solutions that arise in fluids and condensed matter physics.  This research aims to understand some of these structures.  In the first case, the behavior of large numbers of vortices in superconducting materials (a typical feature of certain classes of superconductors) will be studied.  In the second case, how vortices are generated in superconductors will be examined.  The third project will consider numerical algorithms that are used to compute pulse-like solutions that arise in nonlinear optics.\r\n\r\nThis research will focus on three problems arising in applied mathematics.  The first project will study the mean-field behavior of asymptotically large numbers of vortices arising in superconductivity.  The analysis requires handling asymptotically large numbers of vortices, each of which has asymptotically large energy.  To do so, refined estimates will be developed for tracking concentrations of energy.  The project on the understanding of vortex nucleation in the time-dependent setting should help to understand the transition to the mixed-vortex state in Type-II superconductors.  Finally, the project on iterative methods for computing bound states will study why certain methods are unconditionally convergent, which should lead to better algorithm design.",

An important feature of many of these equations are solutions with interesting stable structures, such as pulse-like solutions that model light traveling through fiber optics or vortex solutions that arise in fluids and condensed matter physics. This grant supported several projects that examined these structures in many physically relevant situations.\nIntellectual Impact: \nVortices are localized eddies of supercurrent in a superconductor, and a clear understanding of the location of vortices provides a deep understanding of the superconductor itself.  In one line of research the PI worked on projects that aimed to better understand when and how vortices appear, and how superconductors behave when there are very large numbers of vortices.  The results provide intuition into the qualitative behavior of physical systems and methods for accurate numerical simulations these systems. \nIn a second direction the research, the PI studied thin elastic filaments in two and three dimensional viscous fluids.  These problems arise widely in models for microscopic swimmers and microfluidic devices.  The results from this grant help provide a rigorous framework for understanding widely used methods for simulating such filaments. \nBeyond these two primary directions, the PI worked on addition projects that developed techniques for computing optical pulses, schemes for generating specialized meshes for arbitrary shapes, and novel methods for detecting imperfections in linear accelerator cavities. \nBroader Impact:\nSuperconductors are used in a wide number of applications, including MRIs, particle accelerators and ultrasensitive detectors.

Part of the research funded by this grant helped develop rigorous understanding of superconductors.\nThin elastic filaments are ubiquitous in microscopic fluid scales, and accurate numerical simulations of these filaments are challenging.
