 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Audience Summary \r\n\r\nThe proposed dissertation research project will study water management issues in the metropolitan region of Sao Paulo, Brazil, which is currently facing a historical drought that has placed the public and industry under great risk of water shortages. The impending water crisis has brought into question the reliability of the water system, a problem that is not unique to Sao Paulo; it has raised the question on how to encourage adaptive capacity and robust institutions that can govern in the face of growing environmental challenges. The work will be conducted at the water basin level in partnership with local universities, water utilities, federal and state agencies, and water basin committees to engage stakeholders in a collaborative modeling process. At the core of the case study are questions of how models support decision-making, how scientific knowledge gets incorporated into policy, and how meaningful participation can strengthen the modeling, decision, and institutional building process. The results of this project will illuminate the water challenges of rapidly growing urban regions and ways to meet these challenges. They will be disseminated to multiple audiences through a university-hosted website where material is available in both Portuguese and English. They will also be presented at public workshops, academic conferences, publications in peer-reviewed journals, and training of water managers.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary \r\n\r\nThe proposed research is interdisciplinary. It draws on Science and Technology Studies to understand water governance, institutional arrangements, and the role of public participation in adaptive management. It has three objectives: It will examine the evolution of water resource management models, trace water governance and participation in the case of the Cantareira system joint water management, and develop a collaborative modeling framework for the region that incorporates the challenges and opportunities defined by stakeholders and create a set of rules of engagement. These objectives will be accomplished through a mixed-method approach including qualitative and quantitative methods. The methods employed to examine the evolution of water resource management models are document analysis and archival work. The other two objectives will be met by way of interviews, meeting attendance, content analysis of technical documents, collaborative model building and a series of workshops to engage the public. By using a participatory modeling process and stakeholder engagement, the project aims to improve the role of models as boundary objects that allow the public to use scientific knowledge for water allocation decision. This innovative collaborative approach has the potential to transform water resource planning by decreasing information asymmetries and improving transparency through didactic tools that are made accessible to the public.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAbstract:\n\nThe metropolitan region of S&atilde;o Paulo, Brazil experienced an unprecedented drought starting in 2013, putting millions of people at risk of water shortages.  The nature of global water crises are varied, however, three identified underlying drivers are: a demand and supply gap, technology and infrastructure availability, and lacking governance systems.  All three drivers were present in S&atilde;o Paulo?s water crisis.  In this context, the work explores how combining structured modeling methods and stakeholder engagement public participation may improve adaptive governance and institutional capacity in water policy. The study makes use of an interdisciplinary mixed-method approach that includes quantitative methods for collaborative model building during two public workshops, and qualitative methods for interviews, meeting attendance, and content analysis of technical documents.  The results are presented in three peer-reviewed papers that analyze ways to improve water management from different perspectives.  Paper 1 presents a structured method for evaluating Participatory Models in a two-stage framework:  1) characterize the five dimension of participation and, 2) identify the attributes that render models more timely, flexible, transparent, and relevant to stakeholder needs.  Paper 2 provides evidence that participatory modeling and planning could improve S&atilde;o Paulo?s policies and responses the during drought of 2013-2016, by using an interactive computer model of the that analyzes Cantareira supply system performance under different drought plans.  Paper 3 explores the institutional challenges that prevented more transparent and participatory water management in S&atilde;o Paulo.  The water crisis exposed these challenges and exacerbated the ability of existing institutions to act quickly and respond appropriately to the risks posed by the drought.  \n\n \n\nContribution:\n\nThe study findings contributes to several bodies of knowledge:\n\nParticipatory Models&mdash; The S&atilde;o Paulo case demonstrates the challenges and opportunities for the co-production of models and technological tools that can address both decision-maker and stakeholder needs.  The concept of boundary objects is used to evaluate computer models for stakeholder engagement based on mechanisms that improve the credibility, saliency, and legitimacy of technical information.  When viewed as boundary object, participatory models can enable greater inclusion of diverse participants and knowledge systems in critical water allocation decisions; thus, creating new policy solutions that did not appear viable before stakeholder interactions.  Participatory models can provide a platform for deliberations resulting in more open and transparent policy alternatives.\n\n \n\nDrought planning&mdash; Drought management has evolved to incorporate stakeholder engagement and computer models as part of adaptive plans that are \"working\" documents.  This study provides an assessment of the reliability and resilience of the Cantareira system under different policy options and a comparison of the trade-offs involved to minimize drought impacts to the system (reliability), users (water shortfalls), and the utility company (economic loss).  The three key findings based on the system performance analysis:  1) the drought event of 2013-2015 was unusual but not unexpected, 2) the Cantareira system is stressed at current demands and higher water allocation permits will result in water conflicts during future dry years, 3) the metrics currently used to define \"reliability\" are not robust and can lead to underestimating potential drought impacts, 4) no reliable metric exists to identify the onset of drought.\n\nThe analysis of the Cantareira system and drought actions exposes consistent misrepresentations by authorities of the risks and system vulnerabilities.  Moreover, the delayed response to the drought required authorities to take more restrictive actions to avoid system collapse as the drought persisted.  Drought planning requires defining open and transparent indicators that can identify the onset of drought and when actions will be triggered. This allows utilities and the public to act promptly towards mitigating risks.   In this case, plans were not public. As a result, S&atilde;o Paulo?s case study demonstrates the value of water management in a more open and collaborative manner. \n\n \n\nWater Governance&mdash; Governance questions associated with S&atilde;o Paulo?s drought response go beyond \"technical\" explanation.  S&atilde;o Paulo?s drought exposed the shortcoming of a water management paradigm that minimizes the political nature of water decisions.  Many of the delayed actions taken by water authorities excluded important stakeholders, were announced after the fact, and resulted in growing public skepticism.   Information asymmetries hindered public participation and adaptive management.  Adaptive capacity comes from institutions that have the autonomy and problem-solving capabilities associated with a level of authority and decision-making power that is earned through experience.   During the unprecedented drought, state government could have enlisted the existing institutions and basin committees to play an active role in solving the problem. It could have these institutions to act as the National and State water laws had intended them to.  By doing neither, it undermined the authority of already existing institutions and weakened water governance in the basin.\n\nImproving adaptive governance and building institutional capacity to deal with future water crises will demand a better understanding on the socio-technical challenges (and opportunities) water poses for society. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erica Schoenberger"
