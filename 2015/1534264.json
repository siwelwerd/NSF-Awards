 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL:\r\n\r\nUnprecedented advances in computational capabilities, advanced characterization techniques and the ability to generate and harness large-scale data enable new pathways for the design and synthesis of a broad array of advanced materials systems.  However, critical gaps exist in the infrastructure for multiphase, multicomponent metallic materials, where the design space is extraordinarily large and synthesis processes are complex and expensive. A multidisciplinary UCSB team will develop an integrated framework for design of multicomponent, multiphase single crystal alloys. Novel complementary computational and experimental tools developed will be integrated with existing tools to address fundamental barriers that challenge the design and synthesis of a new class of L12-strengthened cobalt-base alloys.  The emerging class of alloys promises to positively impact the temperature capability and efficiency of a broad array of high temperature propulsion and energy systems. The program will develop new capabilities that substantially enhance the iterative feedback process between design, characterization and synthesis, rapidly expanding the knowledge base for this new class of materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL:\r\n\r\nNew coordinated experimental and computational tools will be developed and deployed for discovery of new Co-base single crystal compositions.   The technical developments that will enable this approach include: 1) A self-consistent thermodynamic framework for alloy design that rigorously couples first principles calculations, multicomponent thermodynamics, internal stresses and diffusion in these solid systems. 2) New parallelized, sharp interface computational methods that can predict the behavior of multicomponent alloys in a single crystal growth environment. 3) New approaches for rapid 3D characterization of the material structure and parallel computational tools that predict structure evolution in 3D. 4) Tools for prediction of basic substrate mechanical properties and rapid characterization of mechanical properties. The experimental and computational tools developed in this program will be broadly applicable to the development of multicomponent metallic alloys in other domains.  Additionally, computational tools, thermodynamic, kinetic data and 3-D data will be transferred to industry and broadly shared through a variety of data and software hubs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nInvestigators: Tresa Pollock, Matthew Begley, Frederic Gibou, Carlos Levi and Anton Van der Ven, University of California Santa Barbara \n\nAdvanced materials that perform in extreme environments are key enabling elements of a broad spectrum of technologically relevant platforms that underpin national security and competitiveness, including advanced propulsion systems for aircraft, automotive and space applications as well as a broad spectrum of energy generation, storage and harvesting systems.  Metallic materials are highly desirable for such complex operating environments since they often possess unique combinations of mechanical strength, exceptional damage tolerance, high resistance to oxidation and corrosion and the opportunity to tune these properties with higher order alloying additions.   However, the discovery and widespread commercial implementation of metallic materials for extreme environments has long been challenged by two major factors: (1) the overwhelmingly large search space, wherein many billions of combinations of elements and phase transformation paths result in a plethora of material properties that are not just dependent on composition but also on structure and defects, and (2) the inability to design alloys containing 6 or more elements, needed for the balanced set of properties that enable reliable performance in these complex environments.  Given the extraordinarily large search space, this program has developed new computational and experimental tools that accelerate the materials discovery, design and development.  These tools have been applied to locate new alloys containing cobalt as their base element.  \n\nThe motivation for cobalt-based alloys is the recent discovery of a strengthening phase that remains stable at temperatures in excess of 1000&#730;C.  Previously cobalt alloys were thought to only be mildly strengthenable, so the new intermetallic strengthening phase opens a new design path.  The program developed new computational approaches for guiding the selection of alloying elements, high throughput experimental methods for assessing material structure and properties and design tools to guide selection and assess the adherence of protective coatings.  These computational and experimental tools were used in an iterative fashion to explore composition space, in a non-linear manner, unlike prior search methods.  We located a new compositional space with alloys likely possess a highly favorable combination of properties.   Large (150mm length) single crystals of these materials were grown and their properties were comparable or better than current alloys used in the hottest sections of aircraft engines.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/04/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tresa M Pollock"
