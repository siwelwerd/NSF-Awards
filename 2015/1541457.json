 "awd_abstract_narration": "The growing complexity of research requires increasingly sophisticated tools, technologies, data options and solutions. Moreover, scientific inquiry is increasingly reliant on the ability to access a diversity of resources, on and off campus, based on comprehensive technology and infrastructure solutions along with capable networks that facilitate the sharing, management and analysis of data. However, to fully support scientific research it is not enough to simply provide cyberinfrastructure (CI). Expertise in matching resources to research requirements is essential.\r\n\r\nThe two-year project sustains the activities of a Campus Cyberinfrastructure Engineer (CIE) dedicated to supporting research inquiry. The CIE leads the provisioning and integration of local and remote resources, including those that are sited around the world, that meet the research and training needs of faculty and students while actively advocating for domain scientists' differing CI needs. This project identifies and addresses gaps in CI services and infrastructure, and incorporates new technologies and practices into the existing service portfolio and team skill set, allowing the broader CI team to better support research and training.\r\n\r\nThis project provides enabling and integrative capabilities across multiple disciplines and bridges activities between internal and external communities of practice through: (1) researcher support in pursuit and execution of research activities; (2) design, development, and integration advancement of core cyberinfrastructure services; (3) engagement of local, regional, and national partners in the development of communities of practice; (4) growth and expanded usage of the University's Science DMZ network; and (5) core CI services training.",
