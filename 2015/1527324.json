 "awd_abstract_narration": "Long-term reliability has become a significant challenge for design of integrated circuit (IC) chips used in today's computers and smart phones. Among many effects, electromigration-induced reliability has become the dominant limiting factor due to aggressive transistor scaling and increasing power density. In this project, the PI proposes to address IC reliability problems by providing more accurate electromigration models and assessment techniques at both circuit level and system level so that electromigration induced reliability and aging effects can be fully accounted, leveraged and optimized at both the design stage and run time stage to improve chip reliability and their lifetime at minimum design costs. Furthermore, through the collaborations with the industry partners, the proposed techniques are expected to impact the design and tool development community, thus increasing design productivity. This project also enables the institution to hire students from underrepresented groups, thus enhancing the diversity of science and technology workforce.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to develop new physics-based electromigration models and full-chip assessment techniques, to perform model validation for accurate yet efficient electromigration verification at the design stage, and to enforce electromigration-aware reliability management at run time for nanometer IC chips. First, the research will develop new physics-accurate electromigration models to better predict mean time to failure for multi-branch interconnect  trees, which are commonly seen in IC chips, for both void nucleation and void growth phases. Second, the project will develop electromigration models that can accommodate time-varying temperature and current densities, which reflect  a more realistic chip working condition due to time-varying loads for  both single wire and multi-branch interconnect trees. On top of this, the project team will develop resource-based electromigration models, which are more amenable to the system-level run-time reliability optimization and management.",

Physics-based three-phase EM models for multi-segment interconnects</p>\n<p>In this work, we proposed a new physics-based three-phase&nbsp;&nbsp;EM modeling for general multi-segment interconnects as show in Fig. 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The model consists of three phases of EM failure process: the nucleation phase, void incubation and void growth phases. The new EM model is more closely characterizing the EM failure process and the resulting wire resistance change process and it can be used for single and multi-segment interconnects. The new EM models also consists of two new fast EM immortality checking methods, one for the nucleation phase and one for the incubation phases even the wire has nucleated. As a result, it can significantly reduce the conservations of the existing Blech?s product based EM immortality check method.&nbsp;&nbsp;[Tan et al, Book 2019]</p>\n<p>2. Accelerating EM aging for fast failure detection for nanometer&nbsp;&nbsp;ICs</p>\n<p>In this work, we developed an advanced aging acceleration technique based on electromigration (EM) reliability induced failure mechanisms. The new technique can allow accelerated EM-induced aging of interconnect wires in integrated circuits (ICs) at the normal working conditions for the first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the new technique can allow the in-situ EM aging acceleration when the IC is working normally, which is not possible with the existing method. By combining this with the temperature based acceleration technique, the proposed reservoir-based acceleration method can reduce the lifetime of the IC from 10 years to just a few hours as shown in Fig. 1, which makes the proposed technique very attractive to practical EM failure detection and evaluation.

EM-Lifetime Constrained Power Grid Optimization Considering Multi-Segment Interconnect Wires</p>\n<p>&nbsp;In this work, we propose a new P/G network sizing&nbsp;&nbsp;technique based on recently proposed fast EM immortality check&nbsp;method for general multi-segment interconnect wires based on&nbsp;&nbsp;an&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;physics-based EM assessment technique for fast time to failure&nbsp;&nbsp;analysis as shown in Fig. 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;We first show that the new P/G optimization problem&nbsp;&nbsp;subjected to voltage IR drop and new EM constraints can still be formulated as a sequence of linear programming (SLP) problem. The&nbsp;&nbsp;new optimization will ensure that all the wires will not fail if all&nbsp;&nbsp;the constraints are satisfied. To further consider EM-induced aging&nbsp;&nbsp;effects on power supply networks for the target lifetime and mitigate the over-conservation of the first optimization&nbsp;&nbsp;formulation, we further propose an aging-aware P/G optimization method, which allows some short-lived wires to fail or to age and optimizes the rest of the wires considering resistance increase of&nbsp;&nbsp;those failed wire segments. We also consider the new EM immortalities for both nucleation and incubation phases [Zhou, ASPDAC?18, Zhou, ASPDAC?20].</p>\n<p>The PI?s team has published 25 conference papers and 19 journal papers.
