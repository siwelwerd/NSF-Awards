 "awd_abstract_narration": "Software performance is critical for the success of a software\r\nproject.  Performance bugs are programming errors that slow down\r\nexecution.  Many recent techniques have been proposed to detect\r\nvarious performance bugs.  However, there are still many performance\r\nbugs that cannot be detected by existing techniques.  Furthermore, a\r\ncrucial and practical aspect of performance bugs has not received the\r\nattention it deserves: How likely are developers to fix a detected\r\nperformance bug?\r\n\r\nTo significantly improve software performance, this project will\r\ndevelop a set of novel techniques that focus on a class of performance\r\nbugs that are very likely to be fixed by developers, specifically on\r\nperformance bugs that have non-intrusive fixes.  Performance bugs that\r\nhave non-intrusive fixes are very likely to be fixed by developers\r\nbecause the benefits of the fix (i.e., code speedup) clearly outweigh\r\nthe drawbacks of the fix (e.g., introducing new correctness bugs,\r\nbreaking good software engineering practices, development time and\r\neffort, etc).  This project will address three fundamental challenges:\r\n(1) What performance bugs have non-intrusive fixes and what are their\r\ndefining characteristics?  (2) How to automatically detect performance\r\nbugs and how to establish that their fixes will be non-intrusive?  (3)\r\nHow to automatically fix some of the detected performance bugs?  This\r\nwork will broaden our understanding of an understudied yet important\r\naspect of software performance and will provide automated solutions to\r\nimprove software performance.",
