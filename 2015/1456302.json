 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hummingbirds, songbirds and parrots learn their vocalizations from adults, just like human infants learn to speak by imitating their parents' speech. This capacity provides the basis for how humans acquire speech and language, yet how the brain achieves this goal is unknown. Using an array of powerful techniques, this collaborative project will examine the anatomical, electrical, and molecular properties of brain circuits that control vocalizations in hummingbirds and songbirds, comparing them with each other and with prior human studies. Understanding how these different organisms evolved brain circuits to accomplish similar goals will reveal insights into fundamental properties of vocal learning systems.  Traditional lab animals cannot be used as they lack vocal learning; hence, the use of vocal learner birds is critical. The project will provide training in multiple research techniques to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, emphasizing underrepresented groups. It will also promote broad dissemination of findings and outreach activities, related to both scientific and conservation efforts. The project is also integrated with an International Consortium (funded by the Brazilian Government) for cataloguing and characterizing the diversity of tropical birds, including integration of Museum collections, generation of genome sequences, and examination of brain specimens relevant to the evolution of vocal learning. These activities will enable interactions between US and Brazilian faculty and students, while promoting training in molecular and histological methods through site visits, field trips, and workshops.\r\n\r\nThe vocal control system of songbirds is critical for song production and learning, and is well characterized anatomically, electrophysiologically, and molecularly. However, knowledge of the analogous areas in other avian vocal learners is limited. Recent phylogenomics efforts reveal that hummingbirds evolved vocal learning independently of songbirds; thus, comparing their vocal control systems will reveal convergently evolved features that may be fundamentally required for this trait. The investigators will use tract-tracing to determine how vocal control areas are connected in hummingbirds, in vitro electrophysiological recordings to determine intrinsic neuronal properties of vocal areas in hummingbirds and songbirds, and in situ hybridization to identify molecular markers of vocal nuclei. Evidence of shared anatomical, physiological and molecular specializations will point to convergent features representing possible universal properties of vocal learning systems that may also be shared with humans. Alternatively, differences would suggest that multiple circuit and cellular/molecular architectures can subserve vocal learning. Outcomes will provide novel clues as to evolutionary origins and constraints of vocal learning and associated pathways, leading to insights into fundamental requirements of vocal learning.",

Remarkably, all three bird vocal learning groups possess discrete brain nuclei in conserved anatomical locations that show activation during hearing or vocalizing. On the other hand this trait is relatively rare, and is not found in non-human primates or in rodents. We hypothesized that the brain nuclei required for vocal learning in songbirds and hummingbirds would display convergent connectivity, electrophysiological, and molecular profiles related to fundamental requirements for vocal learning. We further hypothesized that these features would be absent in non-vocal learning brain areas, and in non-vocal learners. Importantly, songbirds and hummingbirds are unrelated avian groups that evolved vocal learning and related brain circuits independently (i.e. no common ancestor is thought to have evolved this trait), thus similarities in molecular features of their vocal nuclei likely represent convergently evolved features of vocal learning systems. To test these hypotheses, a collaborative project instituted by the Mello laboratory at Oregon Health &amp; Science University and utilizing molecular approaches to study brain gene expression, and the Perkel lab at the University of Washington, which used and patch-clamp electrophysiology methods compared and contrasted the anatomical, electrophysiological, and molecular properties of vocal areas in zebra finches (songbirds) and the Anna?s hummingbird.

Comparisons with data from hummingbirds allowed us to identify the subset of these molecular pathways that are shared by hummingbirds and songbirds, and thus constitute convergently evolved universal features of avian vocal learning systems, of possible relevance to comparable systems in mammals. Features that are not shared hint at unique solutions for diverse vocal challenges faced by these two bird groups. (2) The identification of shared properties of vocal nuclei that determine the excitable properties of neurons and regulate spike time precision, key requirements for the production of complex songs.
