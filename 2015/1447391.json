 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase I project will design, build, and test a web-based, modular curriculum for providing rigorous, accessible, and engaging computer science (CS) education to grades 9 - 10 students. The U.S. is experiencing two human resources gaps in computing. First, by 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts there will be 1.2 million more CS related jobs than Americans trained to fill them. Second, female, African-American and Latino student participation remains stubbornly low. This results in a loss of talent and innovation for America, and lost career opportunities for U.S. students. Research suggests these gaps are the result of too few students being introduced early to rigorous and compelling CS education. Currently, 19% of U.S. high-school students take a CS class, a percentage that has fallen over the last two decades (NAEP High School Transcript Study, 2009). This issue is further exacerbated by a lack of qualified CS teachers. The Phase 1 project prototype will be an easy-to-implement, student-driven mechanism to provide standards-based CS instruction. Unlike current initiatives that narrowly focus on programming, this prototype will align with standards developed by the nation's leading organizations for computing professionals and will allow under-trained instructors to provide comprehensive CS courses to students. The proposed project will provide high school students with an engaging and rigorous introduction to CS, and a clear pathway to college-level study and careers in CS and computing-related fields.\r\n\r\n\t\r\nThe project will be designed according to Universal Design for learning principles (UDL, 2013) to be student-driven and inquiry-based, and to support multiple learning styles. Students will engage with complex computational concepts and algorithmic constructs via interactive, multimedia, and adaptive content. Research suggests that these approaches improve knowledge retention and engagement with the subject (Gordon & Brayshaw, 2008). Unlike existing computing education, this project will make explicit connections to real-world context and societal impact which research suggests improves the engagement of students who might otherwise not connect to computing (Owens et al., 2008; Barker et al, 2014). In Phase I, the essential project infrastructure and architecture, a prototype of the reporting module and 5 of the 10 planned content modules will be developed. System and compatibility testing along with iterative usability and feasibility testing will be conducted.  At the end of Phase 1, a pilot study will be conducted with high school students (n=50) and CS teachers (n=5) to assess the usability and the feasibility of the completed prototype and whether the contextualized content increases female and minority students? affiliation and interest in CS. Users will also evaluate the initial feasibility of a Phase 2 full product concept in a classroom setting based on their experience with the prototype.",

Further, many instructors lack professional development and certification to support teaching computer science. In addition, there are far too few women and underrepresented minorities (URMs) pursuing the field of computer science. Curriculum have not been specifically developed to engage these populations and increase their pursuit of further computer science education and careers.\nTo address these challenges, EduNova leveraged an NSF SBIR Phase I award to successfully develop a prototype of Compuverse, a a web-based interactive experience incorporating multimedia content, animations, and simulations to teach grade 7-10 students computer science concepts and capabilities in a classroom setting. \nThe Compuverse prototype successfully developed four key innovations as part of the experience:\n1. The Compuverse prototype combined the latest research based pedagogy with breakthrough technology. To foster a deeper understanding of CS concepts, Compuverse provides a means for delivering \"schema based\" learning, which has been found to increase engagement, improve retention, and reduce attrition rates. Further, to improve the students' retention and experience, the learning experience is student-driven and inquiry-based. The prototype was successfully built to deliver interactive, multimedia, and personalized content.\n2. The prototype delivers to students a comprehensive exposure to computer Science societal relevance and impact: This aspect of computer science was integrated into the prototype because research has demonstrated that students avoid pursuing CS education and career tracks because they do not understand its relevance and societal impact. Compuverse developed two groundbreaking modules to comprehensively and explicitly educate students on CS relevance, and its societal impact using leading edge animation technology, built on the Unity 3D framework. Understanding CS relevance and importance helps students see CS as an attractive, lucrative, and viable career option in the future. \n3. Compuverse delivers Content Contextualization for Female and URM Students: The prototype was designed to attract and retain female and URM students in CS by implementing contextualized course content. The contextualization was based on the latest Universal Design for Learning guidelines to engage female and URM students and to address their decreasing participation in CS. \n4. Compuverse was designed to be highly scalable and designed for rapid adoption: Compuverse\u00c6s student-driven design allows schools with untrained or under-trained instructors to provide CS courses to their students. \nDuring the execution of the NSF SBIR Phase I award, EduNova sucessfully developed the Compuverse prototype to deliver five primary content modules:\n I) \"CS Societal Impact\" &ndash; This module identifies the broad interdisciplinary utility of computers and algorithmic thinking in the modern world. It establishes CS Societal impact, importance, relevance, and computing big ideas in the modern world.\nII) \"CS Careers\" &ndash; This module is an interactive multimedia experience introducing various computing careers available in the job market. \nIII) \"Computer Organization Principles\" &ndash; This module defines, characterizes, compares, and arranges various types of hardware components, middleware components, and software programs. \nIV) \"Computational Thinking\" &ndash; This module defines and cha..."
