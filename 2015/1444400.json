 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crop yields depend on effective uptake of water and nutrients by the roots.  A current challenge is to understand how crop plants regulate the formation and function of their roots.  An understanding of the genes that control roots at this level would help plant breeders tailor root traits to match new agricultural practices, land use patterns, and suboptimal soils.  In this project, genome-wide gene expression will be defined from roots and root hairs from a wide range of crop plants and their relatives under various environmental conditions. These gene expression patterns will be analyzed to identify key genes that control the formation and function of roots. Further, these large gene expression datasets will provide a valuable tool for scientists studying many aspects of root biology. The knowledge obtained from this project is expected to provide new insight into the origin, diversification, and conservation of molecular mechanisms used to regulate the formation and function of roots and root hairs of plants. Further, given the important roles of roots/root hairs for plant growth and environmental response, these findings are expected to assist the rational design of strategies to manipulate root and root hair architecture in crop plants, a particularly important goal given concerns about nutrient-poor soils and the impact of environmental change.  This project will provide strong interdisciplinary training for the participating undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. A major outreach activity of this project is a collaborative research visitor exchange program with the College of Charleston (SC), a primarily undergraduate institution, to provide large-scale genomic and computational biology experiences to students who are unable to obtain this training at their home institution. The project will participate in the Michigan Biological Scholars Program, a bridging program assisting first-year undergraduates in the life sciences, especially underrepresented minorities. Finally, aspects of this research will be incorporated into a semester-long laboratory exercise as part of an advanced molecular development course at the University of Michigan. \r\n\r\nWith the rapidly expanding gene and genome sequences available in plants, it is now possible to consider the ultimate goal of defining the gene activities present in every organ and cell type in species throughout the plant kingdom.  This knowledge would dramatically improve the understanding of plant processes and their diversity, and will likely lead to new opportunities for manipulating crop plants. This project is designed as a first step toward this ultimate goal by defining gene expression in a simple plant organ (the root) and a simple plant cell type (the root hair) in diverse plant species. In a preliminary study, expression data has been generated from seven species (rice, maize, soybean, cucumber, tomato, Arabidopsis, and Selaginella), demonstrating the feasibility and potential impact of the proposed research.  This project has two major objectives. The first is to identify sets of regulatory genes associated with specific root structural and functional traits, by defining transcriptomes from the three major zones of activity for the primary roots and other root types from a diverse set of crop plants. In the second objective, cell-specific regulatory genes will be defined by linking gene expression and cell characteristics in the root hair cells from these same plant species grown under normal and nutrient stress conditions. The results of this project are expected to have a significant impact on the plant research community, through the generation of root-zone-specific and root-hair-specific expression data from many diverse species, which will assist efforts to assign function to unknown genes, predict functional homologs, and assess gene evolutionary history. The data and materials produced by this project will be available at the project website (http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/PGRP-roots), the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA, http://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/), and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was focused on understanding gene expression in roots and root hairs from many different crop species grown under a variety of environmental conditions.  Knowledge of the molecular basis of root growth is crucial for developing modern strategies to enhance plant growth and crop productivity.  \n\nThree major avenues of investigation were pursued in this project.  In one part, genome-wide gene expression was assessed from three developmental zones of root tips harvested from more than 20 different plant species using the technique of RNA sequencing.  This led to the identification of many new genes that exhibit conservation of expression programs across all species, as well as genes that are species- or clade-specific.  Thus, these results will enable future studies to manipulate specific root genes in distinct groups of plants.  In a second part of the project, gene expression was analyzed in a particular cell type in the roots ( the root hair cells) from more than 20 plant species.  These experiments defined sets of genes that are unique to the root hair cell and its formation, including genes that are likely to play a role in the absorption of water and nutrients for plant growth.  In a third part of this project, a new technique was developed and applied to plant roots to explore gene expression within individual cells.  This technique, known as single-cell RNA sequencing, was used to define conserved and divergent gene expression among the different cell types in the root.  Furthermore, variations of this technique, including the use of single nuclei and analysis of chromatin accessiblity, were also developed and applied to the study of root gene expression.\n\nWork conducted under this project included many broader impacts.  The multitude of gene expression datasets from this project have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and have been made available through the Single Cell Expression Atlas (EMBL-EBI) for public use.  Further, the scRNA-seq protocols developed through this project have been distributed widely to plant scientists.  Many individuals have received interdisciplinary training and mentorship in this project, including one postdoctoral scientist, five PhD students, five undergraduate students, and two high-school students.  These students had the opportunity to present their project results in scientific meetings at the local and national levels.
