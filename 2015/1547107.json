 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the eighth annual \"Graduate Student mini-Conference in Computational Mathematics\" which will be held at Clemson University on February 5 and 6, 2016. Topics covered in the conference consist of recent advances in the theory and implementation of numerical methods for partial differential equations, including multiphase flow, porous media, numerical methods for stochastic PDEs, turbulence, fluid dynamics, climate simulation and PDE constrained optimization. Aside from one plenary speaker, all talks will be given by graduate students. \r\n \r\nApproximately twenty graduate students from Clemson, Virginia Tech, the University of Pittsburgh, Auburn University, the University of South Carolina, Florida State University, the University of Tennessee, and Emory University will present scientific research talks involving mathematical modeling in science and engineering, and rigorous analysis and efficient implementation of numerical methods for the modeling equations. The conference organizers strongly encourage participation of under-represented groups, and it is expected that nearly half of the graduate student speakers will be from an under-represented group. The goals of the conference are to give graduate students an opportunity to give a professional scientific talk, to bring graduate students and researchers (their advisors) together to discuss collaborative research projects, and to exchange new ideas in many challenging research areas.",
