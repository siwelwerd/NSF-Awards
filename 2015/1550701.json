 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the transition of the World Wide Telescope (WWT) project from Microsoft Research to the American Astronomical Society (AAS).  Amateur astronomers support an industry of considerable value and are involved in research through citizen science efforts such as the Zooniverse.  The WWT software provides a uniquely capable platform for involvement of amateur and professional astronomers alike in research, education, publishing, outreach, and communication.  Keeping this package available is a valuable service for the country.  The investment to ensure a smooth transition from its current state of being proprietary, albeit free, to an open source project led by the AAS, is clearly very worthwhile and at the same time extremely cost-effective.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft supported the WWT software system up until the fall of 2014, when they decided to release WWT to the open source community.  The AAS is keen to assume a leadership role in a project of such evident value, but needs time to arrange for long-term support of WWT in aid of the US astronomical community.  Microsoft funding ended on June 30, 2015, so this project will bridge the gap, although supporting only maintenance activities.  This will ensure both that the WWT remains available to AAS and that the system remains available for existing users.\r\n\r\nAs noted, WWT is currently used widely by many constituencies.  This software has unique capabilities, including the creation of video abstracts for publications.  It is used in many schools, planetariums and museums across the country and the world.  Under a community-driven open source model, these activities will be supported by experts from the respective constituencies, and connections between the various activities can leverage the work in one community for the benefit of all.",
