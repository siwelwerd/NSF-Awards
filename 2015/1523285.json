 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of the CLfL 2015 workshop is to strengthen research in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) by bringing together researchers working on computational approaches to narrative. Narrative data differ from texts in more technical expository genres strongly enough that NLP methods might not be directly applicable. The analysis of narrative poses new, interesting problems. The readers treat texts as a form of creative expression, and they expect more than the typical information-seeking tools. For example, a person may be interested in reading recommendations, analyzing narrative of a certain period or sub-genre or finding examples of certain narrative devices. The workshop is held in conjunction with NAACL 2015 conference, in Denver, Colorado. This award subsidizes travel and accommodation expenses for students actively participating in the workshop. These travel grants support geographic and other minorities by giving them an opportunity to exchange ideas, get into contact with key persons in the field, and gain invaluable feedback from the senior participants.\r\n\r\nThis workshop contributes to the maintenance and development of a research community in computational linguistics for narrative, with a geographical focus on North America. The workshop strengthens research in individual, punctual efforts on different aspects of computational approaches to narrative by bringing together people from both computer science and humanities.  It also fosters collaboration between theoreticians and practitioners working in academic or industrial settings, across disciplines.",
