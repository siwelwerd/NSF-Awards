 "awd_abstract_narration": "Probabilistic graphical models are employed throughout science and engineering to solve difficult problems, including automated reasoning and decision making, computer vision, computational biology and genetics, and data mining.  However, exact inference is often computationally intractable, necessitating approximations or bounds.  While significant progress has been made, many real-world problems remain out of reach. Many techniques require a set of problem-specific customizations and choices that must be made in advance, with little guidance or automation.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to develop the next generation of approximate, anytime inference algorithms for graphical models. The PIs will empower search algorithms by strengthening their guiding heuristic functions using variational bounds that are both pre-compiled as well as re-computed dynamically during search. The new algorithms ensure compact search spaces by exploiting the problems' decomposition (using AND/OR search), equivalence (by caching) and pruning irrelevant subspaces using the power of their bounding heuristics. These frameworks will additionally provide automated guidance for selecting parameters to optimize the inherent trade-offs between complexity and accuracy to provide meaningful any-time bounds, while tuning those decisions to the respective benchmarks and instances.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project developed exact and approximation methods for reasoning about complex problems defined using graphical models.  Graphical models are a central paradigm for representing and solving complex and large-scale problems across a broad array of application domains in science and engineering, including physics, computational biology, computer vision, data mining, and social network analysis.  The graphical model framework allows users to capture how local interactions between parts of the model (in time or space for example) combine to give rise to complex interdependencies in the overall system.  However, the computational cost of exact reasoning about such models can grow exponentially with the model size in the worse case, making efficient approximations critical in practice.  Particularly useful are so-called \"anytime\" methods, which give the best answer they can within any given timeframe.\n\nThis project focused on solving a spectrum of important queries over graphical models, including combinatorial optimization problems (which find the best or most likely configuration of a system) and summation problems (corresponding to computing probabilities or evaluating uncertainty about a prediction, also known as weighted counting tasks).  For optimization problems, the project developed techniques within the powerful AND/OR search framework that provide or improve its anytime behavior, including developing new weighted heuristic and limited discrepancy search algorithms, and improving the value and ordering heuristics that guide the search process.  For summation problems, we developed a new framework based on AND/OR search for anytime bounds, as well as a framework called dynamic importance sampling that combines search with a randomized sampling estimator to give vastly improved anytime confidence intervals.  Finally, we investigated problems that combine these query types (for example, finding the best estimate under uncertainty about a portion of the model, called marginal MAP).  We extended our algorithms to work in this setting, showing that it is possible to solve these problems in an anytime manner using the techniques developed during the project.\n\nWe tested and applied our methods to a variety of domains, including genetic analysis, computer vision, and conformant planning problems in artificial intelligence.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/28/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexander Ihler"
