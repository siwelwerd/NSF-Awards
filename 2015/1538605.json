 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nash Equilibrium (NE) models provide the mathematical basis to study the interdependence between decision-makers in a competitive environment. These models provide insights into the operations of many multi-agent socio-technical systems, which include communications, electric power, and transportation networks. These socio-technical systems must not only accommodate technical constraints (e.g., physical laws of electrical power flow), but must also acknowledge the goals of several decision-makers, all of whom make choices under uncertainty and compete with their rivals. As a concrete example, consider the modern electricity network: some generation is carried out by large units, whereas distributed generation and storage may be operated by individuals, and transmission and distribution assets are operated by system operators and utilities. In addition, the growing penetration of renewable energy (highly volatile), the uncertainty about fuel prices, new technology, and energy policy, create a challenging setting in which the firms and/or individuals operate. This project, which combines the need to incorporate system constraints, as well as the effects of risk and uncertainty in the absence of cooperation across decision-makers, will address some of the most challenging questions regarding the structure, algorithms, scalability, and interpretations for NE models under uncertainty. The broader impact of the project includes the study of markets in power and communication networks, and the training and education of graduate students.\r\n\r\nCurrent theories and algorithmic schemes are relatively restrictive in their ability to accommodate risk measures, hierarchical and recourse-based decision-making, and coupled strategy sets. Motivated by these lacunae, this research will utilize a broad framework that can accommodate both private and coupled constraints, allows for linear, quadratic and convex models for taking recourse, and captures risk-aversion through the incorporation of composite and deviation-based risk measures. The goals of this research include the following: (i) Analysis: Verifiable statements for the existence and uniqueness of the resulting equilibria through the analysis of the resulting risk-based variational and quasi-variational inequality problems; (ii) Algorithms: Design, analysis (convergence, complexity) and statistical properties of estimators derived on algorithms reliant on joint sampling and approximation schemes; and (iii) Applications: Problems in electricity markets and other areas of planning under competition and uncertainty will be considered in two-stage and hierarchical settings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of the project was to create a new science and engineering subject of non-cooperative game theory under uncertainty, by merging two of its principal components---stochastic programming and deterministic Nash equilibrium.  Separately, stochastic programs cannot handle multi-agent competition, and Nash equilibrium has so far been studied mainly in a deterministic setting.  By bringing these two topics together, we aimed to\nenrich the modeling and solution of a host of applied problems such as competitive resource allocation, pricing and mechanism design in economic systems, and establish the foundation of this novel class of game problems under uncertainty.   Our research program covered the analysis, algorithms, and applications.\n\nBroader impacts:\n\nUncertainty and competition are two practical facets that are pervasive in many decision making problems among multiple selfish economic agents who are undertaking activities of various kinds to optimize their objectives in uncertain enviroments and whose decisions have a direct affect on the rival competitors' behavior.   For instance, in electricity power markets, utility generators must make the plan of power generation before the demand of electricity is realized.  Following that generation plan, some fast-ramping gas generators are deployed to accommodate the demand variability.  The generators' operations are affected by the capacities of transmission lines that are under the management of an independent system operator.   Our research provides a rigorous mathematical treatment to such non-cooperative multi-agent decision making problems and offers computational approaches for their practical resolution.\n\nIntellectual merits:\n\nWe have made significant advances in the study of non-cooperative game theory under uncertainty.  IAs a first step in the study, we have formalized a mathematical framework within with fundamental theory can be established and compuational methods can be designed. We have researched several topics and made important strides in developing approximation methods for solving this class of stochastic game problems. In the process, we have obtained new solution properties of parameterized optimization problems. The topics studied include the introduction of a unified framework for two-stage stochastic multiagent non-cooperative games with convex quadratic recourse functions and a variety of risk measures, the convergence analysis of exact and inexact versions of combined sample average approximations and best-response schemes for solving such games, the development of iterative schemes for solving games with expected-value constraints, an extensive analysis of games involving value functions with application to network interaction and activity enhancements, and most recently, nonconvex\ntwo-stage stochastic programs with bi-parameterized quadratic recourse\nfunctions. In particular, the latter study is the pre-requsite to investigate multi-agent extensions wherein the agents' optiminization problems are non-convex stochastic programs.  The intellectual merits of our research lie in the use of advanced matheatical analysis that includes deterministical optimization theory and methods and asymtoptic convergence results in statistical sampling theory.  These toolsets are needed to understand, model, and treat the uncertainty and individual selfish behavior of the players in the game and provide computationally promising venues for practical applications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jong-Shi Pang"
