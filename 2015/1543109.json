 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating multi-scale injection molding technology to applications in biological research, specifically for in vitro cell growth. Cells grown in vitro are critically useful tools in biomedical research and development. Recent research in the area of in vitro cell growth has led to a number of important discoveries with regards to how cells behave and respond to their environment. These discoveries have significantly altered the way that researchers think about how cells grow; however, few commercial products reflecting this knowledge exist, possibly causing bottlenecks in applications ranging from in vitro fertilization (IVF) to disease model development for pharmaceutical testing. The project will result in a family of cell culture substrate prototypes designed to improve cell growth and development over the traditional flat polystyrene surfaces currently used in the industry today.  The prototypes will be designed for high-volume manufacturing to ensure commercial usefulness and cost-effectiveness in the biomedical sector. \r\n\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  First, traditional silicon tooling for multi-scale molding at the micro/nanoscale is cost-prohibitive.  Second, the high-volume manufacturing of injection-molded polymeric devices that possess features at the low micro to nanoscale is currently limited by factors such as tooling life and manufacturing robustness.  Third, a robust in vitro cell response to such products is required for future commercialization.  To address these technology gaps, the team will employ designs inspired by native cell environments, using a well-established in vitro cell growth assay for mouse embryos. Molds for high volume manufacturing will be produced using bulk metallic glass tooling, on which mold robustness will be analyzed.  Polymer rheology will be controlled in a variety of ways to ensure feature consistency and reproducibility.  Costs associated with mold production and other tooling will be built into the current working financial model to determine the next phase of the commercialization effort.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, including a graduate student and a team of undergraduate/high school students will receive innovation and entrepreneurship experience by developing the designs, talking to potential customers, and aiding with the development of a commercialization plan for the technology.",
