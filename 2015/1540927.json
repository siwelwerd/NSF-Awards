 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program is funding the research of Katherine Willets at the University of Texas to develop new techniques to study the detailed structure of surfaces. These techniques will improve the functioning of a variety of chemical sensors, in particular a type based on a phenomenon known as surface-enhanced Raman scattering, or SERS. While SERS is an intensely promising sensing technology, its commercial utilization has been limited by problems that appear to be due to non-uniform surfaces that are not well-characterized or controlled. The current research seeks to improve the functioning of devices based on SERS technology by studying the signals that come from the surface when small particles of gold and silver are added. When molecules come into contact with surfaces treated with these small bits of gold and silver, the resulting SERS signal is enhanced, sometimes by more than a million-fold. The investigators are bringing a variety of analysis techniques to bear on this system in order to understand how this enhancement occurs and, more importantly, how it can be controlled. The work is having a broad impact on the development of new chemical sensing technologies. The long-term goal of the work is to develop new SERS probes that will have greater commercialization opportunities, thus exploiting the ease, portability and relative cheapness of this type of sensor. It is having a further broad impact on the training of the next generation of scientists through the involvement of students at all levels, including high school, in the research investigations.\r\n\r\nThis project is focused on understanding how molecules interact with gold and silver nanoparticles that support localized surface plasmons in SERS. Excitation of plasmons leads to strongly enhanced electromagnetic fields at the surface of the nanoparticles, and by placing molecules into these enhanced fields at the surface, optical signals from the molecules can be increased. In particular, Raman scattering, which provides a molecular 'fingerprint' and is useful for a variety of chemical sensing applications, is strongly enhanced by these nanoparticles. Most work on understanding plasmons and SERS has focused on how excitation fields are enhanced by the nanoparticles, but has neglected the role of emission by the molecule, despite its importance in generating the measured signals. This project probes the role of the molecule interacting with plasmonic nanoparticles, in order to better understand the factors that lead to the strongest possible signals from molecular targets of interest. To more precisely understand how molecules couple to plasmonic nanoparticles, both spectral and spatial overlap between the molecules and the nanoparticles are being investigated. Electrogenerated chemiluminescence is used to probe plasmon-coupled emission in the absence of plasmon-enhanced optical excitation. Super-resolution optical imaging is also being used to probe how the location of molecules on the surface of plasmonic nanoparticles influences how and where the emission is coupled into the far-field with sub-10 nm resolution. A wavelength-resolved version of super-resolution imaging is used to achieve simultaneous spectral and spatial resolution in order to show how different Raman modes are coupled into the far-field via wavelength-dependent plasmon coupling.  These studies will provide an improved understanding of how accounting for the molecule can potentially redefine the conventional picture of a 'hot spot' region of strongly enhanced local electromagnetic fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project used super-resolution imaging to study how molecular emission interacts with noble metal nanoparticles.  Noble metal nanoparticles are able to enhance signals from nearby molecules by a thousand- to a million-fold, making these systems important for a variety of sensing applications where high sensitivity is key.  This enhancement is due to the excitement of localized surface plasmons, which generate strong electromagnetic field enhancements on the nanoparticle surface.  However, the presence of a molecule on the nanoparticle surface will influence how it is able to enhance these signals, creating a complex hybrid metal-organic system, where the properties of one change the behavior of the other.  This research studied the complex relationship between molecules and nanoparticles, by working to design a new microscope to study these interactions with unprecedented spatial and spectral resolution.  Challenges with robust calibration standards to check the accuracy of the microscope design hindered progress on this goal.  However, in addition to designing a new microscope, we also used different emission strategies to study surface-enhanced spectroscopies, including electrogenerated chemiluminescence and surface-enhanced Raman scattering.  While the former did not show any signatures of plasmonic enhancement, the latter showed the expected enhancement behavior, allowing molecule-metal interactions to be studied.  By fitting the SERS emission to novel 3-dimensional dipole emission models, we were able to probe how both the position of a molecule as well as 1-3 nm features in a SERS substrate can perturb SERS emission, influencing the ability to efficiently capture SERS signals for optimized sensing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katherine Willets"
