 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI proposes to convene a workshop of the Midwest Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics (MTSM). This Conference series will bring together researchers in the areas of experimental, theoretical and computational thermodynamics and statistical mechanics for the exchange of ideas and most recent research results. The conference is particularly designed as a platform for young researchers (graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty members) to present and discuss their ideas and research accomplishments, and to identify potential future collaborative opportunities.  The conference will provide students with an opportunity to present research, network with professionals in their discipline, and discuss current and upcoming scientific progress in the field. The development and application of molecular theory and simulation methods for predicting microscopic structure and thermodynamic properties of nanomaterials, soft matter and biological systems is fundamental to and useful for a variety of engineering applications such as energy conversion and storage, environmental protection, materials design and synthesis of polymers and nanostructures, investigation of biomolecules for drug delivery and other important areas. This conference support will be used to especially support student participation at this event.\r\n\r\nThe MTSM Conference has a longstanding tradition of promoting research and collaboration in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics. Since 1988, MTSM has been organized every year with only two exceptions. With MTSM 2015, the conference will continue to be a venue where the latest research in computational, theoretical and experimental thermodynamics and statistical mechanics is presented, discussed and debated. Thermodynamics is a major pillar of scientific and engineering disciplines. Statistical mechanics provides an additional, necessary molecular understanding of thermodynamic properties. Opportunities to discuss and learn thermodynamics in the context of statistical mechanics are scarce and MTSM provides a platform for high-level learning in a small setting. TSM is organized in the Midwest, yet attendees have been drawn from all over the United States. MTSM conference offers opportunities for strong inter-institutional community building as well as team building within research groups participating together. The meetings draw a spectrum of participants from established senior faculty members, junior faculty, and postdocs, graduate students to undergraduates. The technical program is deliberately slanted toward presentations by young scientists and engineers.  The 2015 MTSM meeting is tailored to facilitate personal and mentoring interactions. It is expected that approximately 90 people will attend: 4 young faculty members will give invited talks to their peers, 55 graduate students and postocs will participate, and about 10 undergraduate researchers will present in a poster session. Finally, up to 25 additional faculty members will attend, most serving as audience participants and mentors for the students in their group and others. These faculty members will represent a diverse set of colleges and universities, including some primarily undergraduate institutions, and a range of experience levels. Including researchers at various career stages. This will provide an important forum to expand the research conversation in thermodynamics and statistical mechanic.\r\n",
