 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor Jeffrey Harvey at the University of Chicago.\r\n\r\nWith the recent discovery of the long-sought Higgs boson, the theoretical framework underlying particle physics (the so-called \"Standard Model\" of particle physics) is now complete.    However, there are still many important outstanding questions involving the fundamental structure of matter and energy and their interactions. These include what sorts of mathematical structures are needed to combine gravity and quantum mechanics, as well as the origin of dark matter and dark energy. String theory provides one possible framework to address these questions.  Professor Harvey will pursue two independent lines of research aimed at addressing these questions.  The first part of this project involves the study of \"Little String Theory\" - a theory that has some of the same good features of string theory but is easier to analyze.  The second part of this project involves research in an area of pure mathematics that has close ties to techniques that grew out of string theory.  This project thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.   This project will also have significant broader impacts. The research will involve postdocs, graduate students and even at times undergraduate students, thus providing critical training for the next generation of physicists as they start research. The PI will also lecture at international schools and workshops and also participate in public outreach events in the Chicago area.\r\n\r\nMore technically, the PI will extend recent work on counting BPS states in Little String Theory to the study of more general backgrounds with N=2 supersymmetry. He will also continue his study of non-compact Conformal Field Theories and their connection to mock modular forms. This work has implications for the study of BPS states in supersymmetric field theories and to the study of string theory in a variety of physically interesting settings. A third component of this project involves the mathematics of some still-mysterious connections between sporadic groups and various types of modular and mock modular forms. In particular he will extend work currently in progress by extending techniques of Vertex Operator Algebras.",
