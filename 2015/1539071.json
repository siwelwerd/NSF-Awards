 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical description\r\nThis Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR* Collaboration (RII Track-2 FEC) involves researchers from three New England states: New Hampshire (NH), Maine (ME) and Rhode Island (RI). The research team will develop and test a framework for engaging stakeholders in understanding how the multiple functions of dams are impacted by the outcomes of management decisions. The project is led by the University of New Hampshire (UNH) in partnership with Keene State College (KSC), the University of Rhode Island (URI), Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), and the University of Maine (UM). The research team will develop role-play simulations and design charrettes to foster dialog among stakeholders with diverse perspectives. The interdisciplinary Science, Technology, Art, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEAM) research activities will be integrated with training and leadership development of 12 early-career faculty, two post-docs, two research staff, and 13 graduate students. \r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nThe RII Track-2 FEC project will address two overarching and interrelated questions: 1) What are the major trade-offs, thresholds, and feedbacks among ecosystem services for different dam management options? and 2) How does collaborative knowledge production influence scientific understanding about dam SES, and the use of science in dam decision making? Research topics include fish migration, nitrogen flux, energy economics, media discourse analysis, choice experiment surveys, and multi-criteria decision models.  This project will contribute to sustainability science through coupling biophysical and socioeconomic research with mixed-methods social science research to understand the roles of knowledge systems in decision processes. The team will investigate the dynamic behavior of dams in the context of coupled social ecological systems (SES) and the multiple functions of dams (e.g. ecosystem services, water storage, flood control, hydroelectric power generation, and recreation). The number of high-hazard dams in New England coupled with their significant clean energy role will provide a basis for hypothesis testing and delineating the consequences and trade-offs of rehabilitating, restoring, rebuilding, removal, decommissioning, or other alternative dam futures. \r\n\r\n*Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research",

Concerns about fish passage, safety issues, water quality, and other issues place constraints on decisions to remove, relicense, or retrofit dams.

Using a vast dataset including metrics on dam utilities, freshwater flow, and fish migration, we created a series of specific, realistic future scenarios that align with a broad diversity of stakeholder preferences, from ecological restoration by dam removal to mixed approaches that emphasize a balance between restoration, renewable energy production, water storage, property values, and river recreation. Our integrated modeling framework is a powerful method to help stakeholders understand water-energy-fish interactions and related economic and social impacts under alternative dam decision scenarios.
