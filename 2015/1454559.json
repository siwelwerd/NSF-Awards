 "awd_abstract_narration": "1454559 (Zhang). Increasing water demand, accompanied by water scarcity and the likely impact of climate change on water supplies, has created complex challenges for sustainable water management, demonstrating the need for integrated wastewater management that promotes and facilitates resource recovery. This research aims to determine the optimal sustainable configurations for integrated wastewater management under a given context through an innovative decision framework that integrates multi-discipline methods and tools and context-based learning. The objectives of this research are to (1) innovate a decision framework, WasteWATER, that integrates methods and tools from multiple disciplines including reverse logistics, life cycle analysis, and economic valuation; (2) examine the impact of demographics, geography, climate, and urban form on the optimal degree of decentralization; and (3) create context-based learning to train future practitioners.\r\n\r\nThe WasteWATER framework considers wastewater systems as a reverse supply network in which nodes are treatment facilities, pumping stations, and pipe junctions and links are pipelines. The framework uses compact model formulation through unique process and distribution pipeline mode representation. Triple bottom line sustainability indicators (specific net present value, carbon footprint, eutrophication, and social value of recovered resources) are formulated in the objective function to optimize the trade-off and identify the most sustainable configuration of integrated wastewater systems. Placement-based and hypothetical scenarios will be generated and simulated to identify the factors impacting the optimal degree of decentralization. The Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate (CDIO) approach will be used to develop a web application of the WasteWATER framework and redesign two existing engineering courses using microblogging and utility partnerships as a stakeholder communication platform. The CDIO learning outcomes will be evaluated using several assessment methods. \r\n\r\nPast research has identified that a primary challenge for integrated wastewater management is the lack of a planning and design methodology to evaluate and identify the most sustainable solution under a given context. This project addresses this critical challenge and will advance knowledge in (1) quantifying the sustainability of integrated wastewater systems driven by resource recovery; (2) understanding factors that impact the degree of decentralization; and (3) effectiveness of context-based learning environment for students' proficiency in disciplinary knowledge, interpersonal skills, and product, process, and system building skills. The project also will develop a new framework through the perspective of reverse logistics, a web tool, and a microblogging communication platform for stakeholder participation. Realization of integrated wastewater management will provide societal benefits that enhance community well-being in terms of reliable water supply, resource conservation, environmental restoration, and regional and local economic development. The project will leverage support from the Alfred P. Sloan Minority Ph.D. program to recruit and support under-represented minority graduate students. The research and education activities will be woven together to provide a context-based learning environment to train postdoc, graduate and undergraduate students. Stakeholder participation and wide dissemination of research and education findings and products will be achieved through microblogging, a web tool, and utility partnerships.",

Increasing water demand due to population growth, industrialization, urbanization, water pollution, and the likely impacts of climate change are putting extra pressure on natural water resources, threatening the future generations having access to sustainable and reliable water resources. These emerging challenges necessitate adopting a reverse logistics approach, which is the process of moving wastewater from its typical destination back to the water supply chain for reuse purposes. This practice not only reduces the negative impacts of wastewater on the environment, but also provides an alternative to withdrawal from natural water resources, forming a closed-loop water supply chain. However, the design of an integrated wastewater system that facilitates resource recovery over treatment, requires appropriate sustainability assessment and multi-criteria decision support tool. This research aimed at developing systematic approaches, innovative tools, and effective decision frameworks that help officials, service providers, utilities, and researchers find the most sustainable solutions for the design and management of water reclamation and reuse systems. The project also investigated the impacts of demographics, geography, climate, and urban form on the design of such complex systems using the developed tools, to find sustainable solutions that fit different local and operational conditions. The research team created context-based learning through microblogging, utility partnership, and redesigning courses in the context of CDIO (Conceive-Design-Implement-Operate), which enhances the competitiveness of college students in practice. To achieve the project goals, we adopted Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) approaches to evaluate the wastewater treatment technologies that can be implemented across systems scale (i.e., small, medium, and large scale) in terms of their costs, energy requirements, environmental footprints, removal and recovery efficiencies, and social impacts. We also collaborated with the Polk County officials in the State of Florida to design different water reuse scenarios based on the US-EPA 2012 Water Reuse Guidelines, with the purpose of assessing their economic, environmental, and social impacts, and to find opportunities to enhance the sustainability of such reuse systems. The effects of decentralization of treatment facilities on the outcomes were studied, and a multi-criteria framework was developed to help decision-makers find solutions for implementation of reuse scenarios in their water service area. The research team also collaborated with the Industrial and Management Systems Engineering (IMSE) department at the University of South Florida (USF) to develop a multi-objective optimization model that incorporates the three dimensions of sustainability (i.e., costs, environmental, and social) in finding solutions for water reclamation design and planning (e.g., implementation locations, selection of treatment technologies, degree of decentralization, and customers allocation). The optimizer CPLEX 12.7 was applied, and the Triangle Splitting Method was used for the optimization algorithm. The model was implemented through partnership with Hillsborough County officials to design for expansion of their southcentral water reclamation system. Considering the successful results from the Hillsborough County study and the positive feedback from the county officials, the research team collaborated with the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) department at USF, and launched the model as an open-source web-based tool (<a href=\"https://wastewater.csee.usf.edu/tos\">WasteWATER</a>), licensed and based at the University of South Florida. We also worked with several utilities and service providers across the United States for usability testing of the developed web-based tool, and to receive feedbacks for the tool&rsquo;s improvement purposes. Through collaboration with Orange County in the State of California, several hypothetical scenarios were generated to evaluate the impacts of population density and topography of the service area on the design of sustainable water reclamation systems. We found out that decision on decentralization of treatment facilities highly rely on the population density and the requirements for water transfer (i.e., wastewater collection and reclaimed water distribution). We also found out that there are tradeoffs between the sustainability indicators (e.g., between costs and environmental footprints), and the tradeoffs and the corresponding design thresholds are highly dependent on the case-specific parameters, local conditions, and the limitations associated with the water service area. Additionally, two (2) courses were improved using the CDIO approach at USF. The project supported three (3) postdocs, three (3) doctoral students, one (1) master&rsquo;s student, and two (2) undergraduate students. The research team published one (1) doctoral dissertation, one (1) MS theses, six (6) peer reviewed journal articles, and one (1) book chapter.
