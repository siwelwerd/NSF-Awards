 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamically dispatched power plants are required for the increasingly distributed nature of power generation. This ability to meet demand transients is key to developing safe, resilient and independent power networks, in response to natural or man-made disruptions. Furthermore, it is desirable for systems to be able to run at partial load without large losses in efficiency or performance. Partial load operation may occur, for example, to provide power to a small group of geographically remote users, or to make up for the variable power output from other forms of generation. Solid oxide fuel cells offer high efficiency, ultra-low pollutant emissions, and scalability and flexibility for distributed generation. However, while fuel cells are capable of tracking fast power variations, they are not used in this fashion due to important technical challenges, including dynamic preheating and processing of the fuel and oxidant, and the inability to control the fuel cell temperature profile dynamics. The current project seeks to overcome these limitations with innovations in fuel cell system design and control for dynamic operation, toward enhanced levels of reliability as well as reduced costs. This project includes fuel cell system designs, system level dynamic simulations, and new control techniques to enable fuel cell systems to become a key, if not the preferred, dynamically dispatched technology.  \r\n\r\nThis project aims at developing a better understanding of the issues faced in, and developing solutions for, fast dynamic operation of high temperature fuel cell systems.  Using advanced control techniques, and exploiting under-used flexibilities in the overall system design, could produce significant improvements in dynamic operation and thermal management.  Different fuel cell configurations (co-flow, counter flow and cross flow) will be studied and evaluated.  Three major tasks will be accomplished: (i) development of high fidelity models with significant spatial resolution for dynamic controller design computations, (ii) evaluation of system designs for separating decoupled control loops, identifying new mechanisms for actuation and sensing, and developing a variety of control strategies, and (iii) application of performance oriented anti-windup techniques to enable controllers designed for key subsystems to withstand occasional saturation without much performance compromise.  Degradation and life-cycle analysis will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the approaches.  Project will produce reliable dynamic models and a systematic approach to design and control fuel cell systems to enable higher, and reliable, renewable power use.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSolid oxide fuel cells and reversible solid oxide fuel cell electrolyzer systems are more efficient than other more traditional fuel cells and electrolyzers.  However, their relatively high temperature of operation (500 &ndash; 900 degrees Celsius) leads to challenges in thermal management during dynamic operation to meet power demands and to complement uncontrollable and intermittent renewable power.  Spatially resolved dynamic models for counter-flow, co-flow, and cross-flow fuel cells were developed and used to predict and compare the thermal profiles of the three main configurations for similar dynamic operating conditions (e.g., same net power and air flow rates, etc.).   The cross-flow configuration is known to have a substantial manufacturing (and thus cost) advantage, but suffers from significant disadvantages in thermal properties (e.g., hot and cold regions, leading to thermal fatigue and possible degradation).  To improve the thermal profiles, relatively simple design changes were made (e.g., change in the flow direction of a subset of the fuel and air flow channels) resulting in improved steady state and transient thermal profiles. \n\nNovel system configurations comprised of separate fuel cell (FC) and electrolysis cell (EC) stacks with integrated heat exchangers and flow control valves were developed.  These system configurations were simulated to develop and apply novel control strategies for the improvement of dynamic operation while maintaining good thermal management.  Results include complete spatially resolved models for EC and reversible FC systems, evaluation of the design considerations for operation within a micro-grid with significant intermittent renewable sources, and developing controllers that would allow smoother (thermal) transition between the FC and EC modes.\n\nFinally, the challenges posed by actuator limitations were explored by completion of rate-plus-magnitude saturation anti-windup design techniques, including a multi-staged version for improved performance.  It was shown that anti-windup techniques can mitigate performance degradations that result from episodes of actuator saturation.  Additionally,  it is shown that artificial saturation levels, which do not necessarily reflect physical limitations of the system, can be relied upon to ensure a smoother thermal response in power tracking operations.   While the investigation into anti-windup techniques was motivated by applications to fuel-cell systems, the results can be of general interest in control design, as actuator limitations are common in most high performance applications.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/07/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Faryar Jabbari"
