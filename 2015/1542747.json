The goals of this project are to synthesize high-quality, atomically thin material layers using several techniques, measure the properties of the layers using several spectroscopic methods, and assemble the layers to form a variety of prototype optoelectronic devices.  The project will explore how two-dimensional layered materials can be integrated into current silicon-based technology, which could result in innovative devices and improvements in existing devices.  Calculations will be carried out to predict material properties and guide device development.  The project will generate a database of material properties for atomic layer materials that will be made available to other researchers and practitioners in the field.  The investigators will use the project as a platform to provide new research opportunities at their institutions and at surrounding institutions, including community colleges.  In addition, they will develop a new course for graduate students titled \"Frontier in Optoelectronics based on Atomically Thin Materials: Device and Material Science.\" \r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to demonstrate a few novel optoelectronic devices made possible by two-dimensional materials and to systematically improve their performance through a synergistic effort on device fabrication and testing, calculations, material synthesis, and characterization.  The project includes the following coordinated activities: (i) design, fabricate, and test prototypical devices that include injection lasers, photodetectors, and single photon sources; (ii) synthesize high quality atomically thin materials and heterojunctions using molecular beam epitaxy, chemical vapor deposition, and layer transfer techniques; (iii) guide device development and predict material properties using first-principles calculations; and (iv) characterize materials properties using a wide range of imaging and spectroscopy tools with atomic to mesoscopic spatial resolution and ultrafast temporal resolution using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, microwave impedance microscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy.  The project aims to address important challenges in device fabrication, including overcoming the thin interaction region in optoelectronic devices, limiting defect density during growth, and understanding how defects, doping, stacking and photonic cavities change band structure, transport and optical properties of two-dimensional materials.",

All computers and smart phones are built with semiconductor components. As the demand for greater computation power and more compact electronics grows, one needs to explore new types of semiconductors to continue innovations in these technology. Van der Waals semiconductors make it possible to create layers that are only one-unit cell thick and they represent the thinnest materials possible. &nbsp;Because of the van der Waals force is so weak, one can also stack these materials to create heterostructures. The properties of these new materials need to be measured and calculated using the most advance tools so that researchers can design electronic and photonic devices rationally. During the course of this product, this team has unraveled many new properties one can create using these new materials using a combination of advanced measurements and fabrication tools. The team found how the electronic bands are aligned in energy when two materials are stacked together. The optimal materials for high photoconductivity are identified and the findings are quite surprising. Such finding was made possible using a new measurement technique that the team developed. Energy transport in these atomically thin materials is found to depend on how exactly the layers are stacked. The twist angle between the two layers has a significant impact on how photo-excited electron-hole pairs move in the materials. Sophisticated calculations carried out on super-computers to predict properties or find plausible explanations for surprising experimental finding. Finally, these fundamental understanding of materials properties guided the development of electronic devices. This team of scientists and engineers effectively collaborated to make these discoveries and technological development.
