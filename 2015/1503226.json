 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations to successfully complete high quality degree programs in STEM.\r\n\r\nSouthern University and A&M College, lead institution for the Louis Stokes-Louisiana Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-LAMP), consists of a consortium of twelve two-and four-year institutions and one research organization in the state. The alliance, located in a NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) jurisdiction, will expand its research capability through this project by producing up to 900 new STEM baccalaureate degrees annually and retaining 25% of these students for STEM graduate studies by 2020.   These goals will be accomplished by expanding partnerships with the pre-college community, community colleges, 4-year institutions, and other institutional, state, and national programs, public and private research organizations, and funding sources to expand student and faculty opportunities and to address continuing sustainability and institutionalization of successful practices in engagement and retention of STEM students.   The continued implementation of the Ten Strand Systemic Mentoring Model and best practices in teaching and learning for STEM minority undergraduate students (including financial support and research participation locally, nationally, and internationally) will be employed over the next five years in addition to enhancing the instructional and research infrastructures of partner institutions to achieve project success.\r\n\r\nEvaluation will be conducted by an external evaluation review board.  Project results will be disseminated via the alliance and partner institution websites and the LS-LAMP \"Best Practices Manual\" and Journal.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLouisiana Stokes Louisiana Alliance for Minority participation (LS-LAMP)\n\nFinal Outcomes (2015-2021)\n\nHRD #1503226\n\nOverview:\n\nThe Louis Stokes Louisiana Alliance for Minority Participation (LS-LAMP) is a comprehensive, statewide, coordinated program aimed at substantially increasing the number and quality of minority students enrolling in and completing baccalaureate degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and subsequently going on to pursue graduate studies in STEM disciplines. The overall project reference at LS-LAMP and related activities\u2019 strategies are centered on enhancing and coordinating existing STEM workforce development activities at the partner institutions, supporting undergraduate research activities and introducing strategic state-wide and regional academic and research activities to promote networking and technology exchanges.  LS-LAMP continues to be a major player within Louisiana for developing intellectual leadership critical to the needs of a 21st century scientific and technological workforce.  The expansion of Louisiana\u2019s STEM infrastructure has cooperated with several systemic initiatives (including the EPSCoR programs and others) coordinated through the Louisiana Board of Regents.\n\nThis Alliance is composed of twelve (12) institutions of higher education and the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium (LUMCON), a research facility, with Southern University and A&amp;M College as the lead institution.  The original alliance was joined by Xavier University in 2010.\n\nLS-LAMP utilizes the Ten-Strand Systemic Mentoring Model for achieving its goals. This model has been adopted by all partner campuses. It forms the foundation of the Strategic Implementation Plan that is utilized by all partner campuses of the alliance.  LS-LAMP Campus Coordinators have diligently worked to exchange best practices on incorporating externally-based stakeholders.  Thus, we are delighted to report that the LS-LAMP Senior Alliance Best Practices in Systemic Mentoring (1st Edition- ISBN:  0970460961) is available on Amazon in e-print and hardcopy.\n\nSummary of Impacts:\n\nLS-LAMP\u2019s strategy centers on expanding partnerships with the pre-college community, community colleges, 4 -year institutions, other institutional programs (state and national), public and private research organizations, and funding sources to expand opportunities, sustainability, and institutionalization. The undergraduate enhancement activities, including financial support, rigorous mentoring, research participation, and guidance to graduate school are a part of the LS -LAMP systemic mentoring activities that are carried out at the twelve (12) participating institutions. The LS- LAMP implementation continues expanding the State's STEM infrastructure and joining together several systemic initiatives and EPSCoR programs coordinated through the Louisiana Board of Regents.\n\nAll of the LS-LAMP campuses are continuing to expand and strengthen their partnerships for sustainability and institutionalization. More institutions have been tracking their students after graduation as a result of the persistence of the LS-LAMP Office.  Alliance-wide, data show that there has been an increase in the number of students attending graduate school since the implementation of LS-LAMP. Research opportunities afforded to LS-LAMP scholars have resulted in an increase in the number of students in Louisiana who continue on to graduate school.  All LS-LAMP scholars are encouraged to participate in a summer research program.  The LS-LAMP Office provided support to the campuses by supplying detailed information and application packages for research opportunities available nationwide. Increased awareness, via the World Wide Web, and other sources have facilitated student enrollment in research internships and have helped to promote graduate school attendance among students.\n\nProgrammatic Components:\n\nSystemic Student Mentoring is the formula for retention, on-time graduation, quality enhancement, the development of professionalism, competitiveness, and research-based careers. The LS-LAMP Systemic Mentoring Model has been adopted and adapted by all the partner institutions. These systemic mentoring activities are coordinated by the LSLAMP campus coordinators and carried out with the assistance and support of the STEM faculty and some academic and administrative units.

The approach relies on the synergy and leveraging between LS-LAMP and existing and future international research opportunity programs and entities, including laboratories overseas.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/02/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick F Mensah"
