No one country is able to support the level of research necessary to keep pace with the changing arctic environment, and therefore organizations like the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) represent important platforms for discussing scientific issues and promoting international, interdisciplinary, and in some cases, large-scale projects in the region. This grant is to support the United States' participation in the International Arctic Science Committee, a nongovernmental international organization that encourages and facilitates cooperation in all aspects of arctic research, in all countries engaged in arctic research, and in all areas of the Arctic region.\r\n\r\nThis grant will support the US delegate to the International Arctic Science Committee (IASC) to participate on behalf of the US Arctic science community on the IASC Council, its Executive Committee, and at national arctic planning meetings; to improve communication of IASC activities to US arctic stakeholders and the research community; and to coordinate US working group membership. It will also support some travel for US representatives to working groups appointed through the US National Academies process, and assistance for US IASC working group activities. IASC is not a funding agency, but facilitates international science development through workshops, networks, planning meetings, and early-career science support. It promotes and facilitates international research activities with an emphasis on issues that cross national boundaries, disciplines and timescales. National support for US participation is essential to ensure the US maintains a role in planning and coordinating these research efforts in the international arena.\r\n\r\nAs one of four Vice Presidents on the Executive Committee of IASC, the PI has direct involvement in IASC decision-making related to IASC programmatic direction and programmatic funding recommendations for international planning, as well as influence on decision-making to the benefit of US scientific interests in the Arctic. The US delegate's role is to convey the objectives and goals of the US scientific community within international planning efforts.",

The US delegates to IASC maintain US leadership and partnerships in the international community, as well as planning and coordinating roles for research collaborations in the international arena.\n\n \n\nThe US delegates to IASC maintain the strength and leadership the US has built over recent decades in international Arctic science.  The US has taken a strong advocacy position in promoting international collaboration and cooperation in matters of Arctic observations, analyses, and synthesis.  The US is clearly a leader in initiating and executing scientific expeditions, conducting large-scale programs and developing new methods of measurements and analyses, but the problem of understanding the Arctic system is of far too great a magnitude for the US to attack without international partners.  The Arctic is an extremely difficult and dangerous place to work, so it is critically important to share and utilize the results of efforts from all nations.  IASC offers a respected mechanism to formulate international collaborative programs and to develop protocols on sharing data and understanding.  IASC presents the formal structure to create new opportunities for international cooperation, support early career scientists and Indigenous scholars.  IASC and the participating partners enable us to extract more value from the research conducted by our scientists, while allowing all scientists and nations to benefit from the work of others.\n\nThe collaborative research programs envisioned, created and promoted under the auspices of the IASC banner have enabled projects of great magnitude and implications due to the collective engagement of many nations.  MOSAiC is a terrific recent example (among dozens) of a collaborative program created within IASC, but now with international sponsorship that will contribute substantially to our understanding of ice-ocean-atmosphere interactions.  IASC strives and succeeds in creating collaborative Arctic research endeavors for the benefit of the US and all nations.\n\nIASC initiates, promotes and supports dozens of coordinating workshops each year.  Our culminating event is the annual Arctic Science Summit Week (ASSW) that attracts hundreds of participants and dozens of organizations to meet in one place at one time to foster partnerships and enhance sharing of Arctic data, understanding, resources and facilities.  A more complete description of the dozens of events and outcomes is provided in our annual bulletin: https://iasc.info/communications/bulletin\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/08/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Larry D Hinzman"
