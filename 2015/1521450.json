 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I is the development of a disruptive manufacturing technology that will enable a new class of nanomembrane-based electronic devices to be assembled and integrated on flexible substrates. This innovative technology promises to provide flexible electronics developers and manufacturers a new option for fabricating a wide range of flexible devices that require the integration of high-performance semiconductors. It is anticipated that printing tools and processes based on this core technology will significantly lower the technological barriers that are hindering the widespread manufacture of next-generation flexible devices.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to develop a  direct printing tool that surpasses the available technologies in terms of both precision and scalability. Current flexible device manufacturing processes do not have the capabilities needed to realize high-performance flexible devices through the integration of high-quality semiconductor materials. Therefore, new strategies are required for fabricating and printing the thin device layers that are essential in emerging high-performance flexible electronics. This project will involve mechanics simulations,tool design and fabrication, process experiments to meet resolution and yield metrics, and establishment of design constraints and operating conditions for a manufacturing process.",
