 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project's significance and importance lie in its focus on addressing both the motivational aspects and conceptual learning barriers for students in early computer programming courses. In these courses the concepts become difficult with many computer science oriented students stalling in their college career. The project will apply modern ideas of group exercises in a highly interactive chat-room environment, where students will be accountable for helping each other and individually accountable for learning. The project's system will record and will then apply text analytics to student group interactions, summarizing for the instructor how well the student groups are functioning both socially and in problem solving.\r\n \r\nThe goals and scope of the project are to develop new collaboration assignments that exercise Java programming language analytic and conceptual skills. At the same time the project will study how students engage with the exercises and how student enthusiasm can be increased. These studies underlie further development of the text classifier technology to monitor for cognitive, affective, and linguistic phenomena that are indicative of enthusiastic students actively discussing and learning. Some measurements, for example, whether the students evince enthusiasm, should be usable in a wide variety of other pedagogical domains. The project will assess how well this intervention succeeds in keeping students motivated, both within individual exercises and in their student careers.",

This IUSE-funded project focused on students in a college 2nd semester Java computer programming class. A primary outcome is a set of exercises that have been tested and refined and shown to produce learning gains. Other outcomes have been in technology to facilitate group chat and in research.</span></p>\n<p class=\"PreformattedText\"><span>&nbsp;</span>Six COMPS Java exercises are now available, covering: objects and references, GUI programming with FX and with SWING, inheritance, exceptions, and Java arrays. The web-delivered group-work chat environment for COMPS can be used for these exercises, or instructors can administer them however they wish.</p>\n<p class=\"PreformattedText\"><span>&nbsp;</span>COMPS chat technology has been customized to facilitate student cooperation and participation. The students maintain an answer window, outside of the scrolling chat, where they develop their consensus answers. The participants all indicate their agreement via a button before the answer is shown to a teaching assistant, who gives feedback and possibly asks more questions. In this way the computer chat interface encourages all students to engage with the problem, engage with each other, and understand the answer.</p>\n<p class=\"PreformattedText\"><span>&nbsp;</span>Another advance is computer monitoring of the student conversation groups. Real time text analytics feed a dashboard with status indications for each conversation. The main indicator estimates how often a student conversation shows signs of addressing matters of substance. Another statistic is whether there are instances of students agreeing and disagreeing with each other. These behaviors would be expected from productive conversations with everybody participating. The dashboard thus provides the instructors an estimation of when a conversation group might benefit from some attention. The text analytics use a vocabulary of about 10,000 common English words, as opposed to looking for words specific to the problems being discussed, so the technology should be generally applicable to student discussions of a wide range of topics. The dashboard feature is still experimental.</p>\n<p class=\"PreformattedText\"><span>&nbsp;</span>An unusual feature of COMPS chats that encourages interactive engagement is participants can chat simultaneously without interrupting each other. Students all type at once and see each other's typing in real time. COMPS thus enables non-standard threading of conversation, e.g. Student B starts responding to student A without waiting for A to finish, or two students B and C both simultaneously respond to student A. Our analyses of this seeming anarchy show that within the simultaneous chatter students still engage in normal conversational exchanges. However, they edit their typing more frequently if there are other students typing at the same time. Also, if a student pauses for approximately two seconds (instead of pressing enter), the other students treat the pause as an opportunity for conversational turn-taking.</p>\n<p class=\"PreformattedText\"><span>&nbsp;</span>Assessments of participating students show that on average the best-prepared student within a conversation group shows very little learning gains. The other (usually two) students show gains. However on average the best-prepared student still reports that the conversation was worthwhile. The interest of a student toward the class topic, measured during the conversation exercises, correlates with learning gains. The same interest surveys administered at the beginning of the semester show no correlation with final class outcomes.</p>\n<p class=\"PreformattedText\"><span>&nbsp;</span>Under development during this project is a web site for administering exercises, where an instructor can upload class rosters, assign students to groups, have the students log in and chat, and administer pre- or post-tests and surveys. Plans are to enable instructors to share or modify their exercises and to export the data for their class records.</p>\n<p class=\"PreformattedText\"><span>&nbsp;</span>The COMPS IUSE project produced log files from&nbsp; a hundred student chat sessions, data that is being used for related research. Collaborative problem solving is among the 21st Century Skills that education systems are addressing. Collaboration is being assessed in the PISA international comparisons of educational achievement. COMPS project dialogue data is being used for identifying student problem-solving collaboration behaviors. The aim is to write software that estimates student collaborative activity from text analytics on their dialogue. COMPS data will also be used to measure the moderating effects of student interest and enthusiasm: to what extent do the enthusiasm levels of your fellow students affect your own learning, and how can this be used to better formulate discussion groups.</p>\n<p class=\"PreformattedText\"><span>&nbsp;</span>COMPS exercises were administered for six semesters in Java 2 classes at NC A&amp;T, an HBCU, engaging about 350 students in discussions of Java concepts in a new way.
