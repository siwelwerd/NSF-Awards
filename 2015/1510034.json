Leininger \r\n\r\nTo study the long-term behavior of an evolving physical or geometric system one can look at its \"cross sections.\"  For example, to analyze a fluid flowing throughout a closed system, we might deposit tracers into the fluid at a particular location then examine how it has been mixed, distorted, or changed when (and if) it returns.  We can also try to predict how the behavior of the \"first-return\" to the starting location-called a cross section-might influence or predict the behavior at some other cross section.  One goal of this project is to study the evolution of certain classes of abstract mathematical systems, similar in many ways to the fluid flow just described, which arise from geometric and algebraic considerations.  Previous work of the PI with S. Dowdall and I. Kapovich provides structural results which relate the cross sections and their first-returns to one another and to the original system.  The PI will continue this analysis with Dowdall and Kapovich and pursue deeper connections between different cross sections and with the ambient system. The PI's work with Dowdall and Kapovich, past and future, is motivated by the foundational work of W. Thurston, D. Fried, and C. McMullen in a more classical setting, but diverges in fundamental and striking ways.  The PI will also continue his analysis of the classical setting with Agol and Margalit investigating further connections and generalizations that might provide a unified theory.\r\n\r\nThis project involves aspects of geometry, topology, group theory, and dynamics.  The central objects are surface homeomorphisms and train track maps for free groups automorphisms.  The PI will continue his work with Dowdall and Kapovich, analyzing free-by-cyclic groups via special semi-flows on 2-complexes.  In addition to strengthening the connection between different cross sections, for example proving that full-irreducibility for monodromies is a property shared by all or none of the sections, he will also tie together all the monodromies with an action of the entire group on a tree and connect the Cannon-Thurston maps to each other.  With Margalit and Agol-Margalit, the PI will continue to analyze the classical setting of suspension flows of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms in an attempt to understand all systoles of moduli spaces.  In his work with Kent, Bestvina-Bromberg-Kent, and others, the PI will continue his geometric analysis of subgroups of the mapping class group and convex cocompactness.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch:  This award funded the PI's research on a variety of geometric objects, their symmetries, and their evolution under extraneous influence.  The research focused primarily on geometric surfaces, mathematical objects such as the surface of the Earth, or more generally, the surface of any solid object.  The idea of symmetry involves features that are indistinguishable by a ``change of perspective''.  To make this notion and study of symmetry mathematically precise, one must consider what features are to be considered and what it means to change perspective, and the PI studied symmetries in a variety of settings.  Finally, in studying evolution of geometric surfaces, the PI's research involved predicting unstable long term behavior of geometric properties of a surface from some initial data; this is something like considering the development of the \"arches\", \"bridges\", and \"hoodoos\" as found in Bryce Canyon, on the surface of the Earth formed by the influence of nature's elements.\n\nOne notion of symmetry studied by the PI is a surface homeomorphism.  This a change of perspective in which only the fundamental \"fabric\" of the surface is preserved: think of disassembling a surface into pieces and reassembling so that neighboring pieces remain neighbors.  The figure shows an instance of a pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism of the torus (the surface of a doughnut), which has been disassembled into rectangular pieces and reassembled without changing neighbors.  The figure also shows a second iteration of this homeomorphism.\n\nThe PI's research with A. Reid studied certain numerical invariants of pseudo-Anosov homeomorphisms and discovered unexpected new behavior beyond the simple case of the torus, answering a question of B. Farb.  In work with I. Agol and D. Margalit, the PI discovered new relationships between \"algebraic\" properties of pseudo-Anosov homoemorphisms, and geometric properties of 3-dimensional objects \"built\" from the pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism.

This research allows one to completely determine the shape of a polygonal region by knowing only the sequences of sides struck by particles bouncing inside the region.\n\nBroader Impact: While supported by this grant, the PI supervised four mathematics PhD theses to completion, and began supervising four more.  Furthermore, these students wrote numerous papers on their research during this period.  This training is an important component of the PI's research program.  Equally important is the PI's emphasis on promoting diversity: Of the four mathematicians who completed their PhD in this period, two are women, and of the four new students, three are women.  In addition, several of the PI's collaborators are women.  The PI also continued organizing a local seminar, and organized several international conferences to attract young mathematicians to the PI's field.  In addition, the PI gave many lectures on his research as well as mini-courses on his field at conferences and seminars in the US and internationally.  These lectures disseminated his funded results and provided further opportunity to attract young researchers to the field.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/22/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher J Leininger"
