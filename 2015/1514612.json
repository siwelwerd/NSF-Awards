 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Seeing Scientifically project will research a new way of supporting museum visitor experiences so they can have authentic scientific observation of live microscopic specimens. By adapting existing computational imaging techniques from current biological research, the project aims to encourage and support visitors in observing scientifically, that is, in asking productive questions, interpreting image-rich information, and making inferences from visual evidence that increasingly characterizes current biological research.  The scaffolding (e.g., visual cues or information supporting learning) will consist of a system of virtual guides and prompts that are responsive to what visitors see.  The scaffolding prompts will be overlaid on a real time, high-density image of a live sample that the visitor is investigating with a research grade microscope.  Project research will contribute early knowledge on ways to scaffold informal learners in the practice of authentic scientific observation with the complex, dynamic visual evidence that scientists themselves see using the equipment and techniques they use.  Project research and resources will be widely disseminated to learning science researchers, informal science practitioners, and other interested audiences through publications, conference presentations and sharing of resources via the NSF-supported informalscience.org website and other relevant websites.\r\n\r\nAs part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program funds innovative resources for use in a variety of settings. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. The project will prototype an innovative microscope exhibit that scaffolds visitors in scientific observation of live specimens and their biological processes. The overarching hypothesis is that scientific observation of real-time visual phenomena can deeply engage learners with the content, tools and practices of modern science, which increasingly rely on image-based data.  Through three rounds of iterative prototype development and evaluation, the project will generate early findings for the following related questions: (1) what are promising ways of scaffolding observation of live specimens at an unmediated exhibit; (2) How can computational imaging techniques be integrated into a microscope exhibit to engage and scaffold learners to ask productive questions, interpret what they see, and make evidence-based inferences from complex, dynamic images. Data will be collected and analyzed by coding think-aloud interviews with visitors concerning their interest in and description of the biological phenomenon observed; coding of think aloud transcripts of visitor questions types and answers, relevant features noted, inferences and scaffold use; and statistical comparison of holding time, questions asked, answers, inferences, and scaffold use. Project findings will seed more rigorous research on the combination of scaffolding and computational imaging techniques effective for supporting scientific observation in image-rich areas of science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Seeing Scientifically: Scaffolding Observation of Complex Visual Phenomenon        \n Since Robert Hooke first peered through his microscope in 1665 and discovered cells, the microscope has revolutionized our understanding of life. It has allowed for the discovery of bacteria, chromosomes, and how life itself begins. Microscopy is an essential tool in every aspect of biological research, from genetics to microbiology to ecology, and gives us insight into a world that would otherwise remain hidden.  When a scientist looks through a microscope, they call on deep background knowledge, observe relevant features in a systematic way, frame what they see in terms of a larger research question, and know how to manipulate their instruments to look for important features. \n\n \nSeeing Scientifically was an NSF-funded Pathways (or pilot) project that set out to prototype an interactive microscope exhibit at the Exploratorium science museum.  Inspired by and built around a pre-existing microscope facility at the museum, the project sought to find ways to support and encourage museum visitors in scientific observation at a microscope exhibit featuring live samples by using emerging techniques in automated microscopy, image processing and image recognition.  \n\n \nThe microscope exhibit consisted of a kiosk with a joystick and knob, which visitors used to move the microscope stage and to focus, and a touchscreen showing real time video of the live specimen directly from the microscope.  The touchscreen and video let the project incorporate questions, prompts, and directions in text on top of the live image of a living, moving sample (in this case, young fish embryos) to support and prompt visitors in their explorations.   \n\n \nSupporting Observation\nThe project team developed several versions of the exhibit to test with museum visitors, each building on findings from the previous version.  The team found that when the exhibit included carefully designed and sequentially placed supports for observation - such as questions for visitors to consider about the sample, suggestions for what microscope functions to use, and hints at what could be seen in the live sample - visitors were more engaged in observing the sample and stayed at the exhibit longer.   The addition of ?observation tools? -  image recognition functions that visitors could turn on and off to help identify important parts of the live sample - helped further sustain visitors? interest.\n\n \nWe hope these findings will seed more rigorous research on the combination of supports and computational imaging techniques (such as image recognition) effective for supporting scientific observation in image-rich areas of science. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kristina Yu"
