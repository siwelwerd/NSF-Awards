 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the relationship between how communities with limited technical infrastructures interact with computing and the discovery of technological solutions to globally connected problems in human-computer interaction (HCI).  Technological advances in computing are traditionally understood as coming from industrialized nations, or those that invest heavily in technology research and development.  For the U.S. to remain a global innovation leader, it must significantly enhance the capacity and ability of individuals and organizations to innovate. Based on an integration of human-centered design and postcolonial theory, this research will lead to improved models of innovation and advance our understanding of where and how transformative ideas emerge. Through ethnographic investigation this work will also fill a gap in knowledge regarding how constraints that exist in the U.S., but are more visible in sub-Saharan Africa, can motivate innovations in computing. Centers of information and communication technology (ICT) innovation are shifting in the world.  Emerging economies, such as Kenya, are no longer simply the recipients of innovative design from industrialized nations, but may develop ingenious strategies to navigate economic and technical constraints when using ICT. These workarounds are less obvious to those living in technology-rich environments, but they have motivated innovative computing applications used worldwide, such as mobile banking.  Recognizing Kenya's rural residents and slum dwellers as ICT innovators rather than passive adopters of Western technologies has broader theoretical implications, including completely reimagining approaches to design in HCI. \r\n \r\nThe research plan includes a series of theory-driven, ethnographic, and design-based studies that will result in three outcomes: (1) Discovery of empirical evidence that provides a fundamental understanding of how economic and infrastructural constraints visible among sub-Saharan Africa's rural residents and urban slum dwellers affect computing use and can influence innovative design for the rest of the world. (2) Improving upon two models of innovation using the empirical evidence as an intervention in a series of design-based studies to assess and compare the effectiveness of these models to yield design recommendations in these areas: sustainable HCI, collapse informatics in situations such as power outages, Internet data management, and crowd work and entrepreneurship. (3) Advancing the design workbook method by developing and evaluating a portfolio of conceptual designs that explore new practical possibilities raised by results from the ethnographic and design-based studies. Researchers based in the U.S. and Kenya will assess the potential to translate these ideas into marketable realities.  An integrated education plan will provide students with international research experience and opportunities to develop new technologies that target global problems.",

This project investigated how technological innovation emerge from &ldquo;resource constrained context&rdquo; in Kenya. We specifically studied how economic and infrastructural constraints visible among Kenya&rsquo;s rural residents affect computing use and can influence innovative design for the rest of the world. We used our findings to inform the discussion about designing ICTs to address societal challenges (e.g., climate change and youth unemployment). &ldquo;M-Kopa Solar&rdquo; was one of the innovations studied during this project. M-Kopa is a commercially available solar-powered lighting system, that is providing affordable and clean lighting to 450,000 rural households in East Africa. Findings from our qualitative study of how rural Kenyan householders use the system draw attention to their everyday sustainable practices and suggest that M-Kopa is a successful example of a sustainable system. However, our findings also raise questions about the long-term implications of such systems; especially how they introduce people to consumption practices, that have been regarded as counter to sustainable design.</p>\n<p>This research also advanced the HCI communities&rsquo; knowledge of how to use popular design methods (i.e., cultural probes and design workbooks) in a developing country. Findings from these studies suggest that these methods can benefit Information Communication Technology and Development (ICTD) research by raising questions about generalizability, objectivity, and the pursuit of a single solution in design.</p>\n<p>Other key outcomes of this project include a collection of 21 speculative design proposals; findings from my fieldwork in Kenya informed and inspired these concepts.

We have deployed these systems in 50+ households in Kenya and Malawi, to explore how sensors can support domestic activities. Findings from these studies include practical implications about how technology can be designed for rural African households&mdash;a topic which has been overlooked in HCI&mdash;despite the field's long-term interest in the design of domestic technologies.</p>\n<p>This project also provided five students (3 PhD-level and 2 undergraduate-level) with an international research experience (i.e., conducting fieldwork in Kenya).
