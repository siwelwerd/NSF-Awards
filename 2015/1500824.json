In addition to social scientists and humanities experts, the conference will include equal participation and presentations from Tlingit speakers and other tradition bearers who hold keys to contextualize linguistic and cultural findings.  Under the direction of Alice Taff of Tlingit Readers, Incorporated, this Clan conference will generate knowledge on place names from coastal Southeastern Alaska from Yakutat south to Ketchikan.  \r\n\r\nConference proceedings and presentations will be archived at the SeaAlaska Heritage Institute, Alaska State Library, and clanconference.org websites.
