 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, the University of Puget Sound will acquire a liquid chromatography mass spectrometer system (LC/MS).   The system will be used to analyze the composition of samples obtained from various sources including those obtained from environmental and biological origins.  Liquid chromatography (LC) separates a mixture into its individual components.  Mass spectrometry (MS) then ionizes the components and determines their mass by measuring the mass to charge ratio (m/z) of the ions.  This is a widely used analytical tool to identify what is the composition of a mixture or material.  The instrument will be used by students in their research, training them with sophisticated, modern instrumentation.  Students in laboratory courses will be trained in its use.  In addition to its impact on the scientific curriculum at Puget Sound, the instrument will play a central role in a planned collaboration between Puget Sound and the Tacoma Science and Math Institute (SAMI), a magnet STEM high school.\r\n\r\nThis award has a environmental and biochemical research focus.  The proposal is aimed at enhancing research especially in areas such as (a) probing changes in lipid expression in biofilms exposed to antimicrobial peptides; (b) quantifying illicit drugs and pharmaceutical metabolites in wastewater; (c) carrying out comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of phytochrome responses in plants; (d) examining the role of bisphenol A in the modulation of the reproductive neuroendocrine system; and (e) assessing the correlation between trophic level and bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants at abandoned sawmill sites in the Puget Sound.",
