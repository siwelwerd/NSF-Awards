 "awd_abstract_narration": "For a growing number of data-intensive research projects spanning a wide range of disciplines, high-speed network access to computation and storage -- located either locally in the campus or in the cloud (e.g., at national labs) -- has become critical to the research.  While old, slow, campus network infrastructure is a key contributor to poor performance, an equally important contributor is the problem of bottlenecks that arise at security and network management policy enforcement points in the network.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to dramatically improve network performance for a wide range of researchers across the campus by removing many of the bottlenecks inherent in the traditional network infrastructure.  By replacing the existing network with modern software defined network (SDN) infrastructure, researchers will benefit from both the increased speed of the underlying network hardware and also from the ability to utilize SDN paths that avoid traditional policy enforcement bottlenecks.  As a result, researchers across the campus will see significantly faster data transfers, enabling them to more effectively carry out their research.\r\n\r\nThis project builds on and extends a successful initial SDN deployment at the University of Kentucky, adding SDN switches to ten research buildings and connecting each of them to the existing SDN research network core with 40G uplinks. To ensure high-speed access to the Internet/Cloud, the research core network is being linked through a new 100 Gbps link to Internet2.  Research traffic in the enabled buildings is automatically routed onto the SDN research network where SDN flow rules allow research traffic to bypass legacy network infrastructure designed to police normal traffic.  By extending the SDN network capabilities to several new buildings on campus, a wide range of researchers are able to archive significantly higher network throughput for their research data.",

To improve a researcher's workflow, one can certainly upgrade the campus network to a higher speed, thereby reducing the time needed to transfer the researcher's science data.  However, even with a higher speed campus network research traffic must still compete with general campus traffic for limited bandwidth.  Moreover, conventional campus networks apply the same policies to all forms of network traffic, forcing research traffic to pay the same overheads and pass through the same choke points (e.g., middlebox firewalls, traffic shapers, rate limiters, deep packet inspection boxes, etc.) as non-research traffic.

In contrast to the Science DMZ approach, the goal of this project was to transform the University's production network (campus network) into a Software Defined Network (SDN) that could be programmed to carry research traffic at high speed.  In particular, we wanted to use new and emerging SDN capabilities to route research traffic around firewalls and other performance-limiting middleboxes.  Because we are transforming the production network, the new SDN network can provide high-speed not only to the University's HPC systems, but it can also deliver data to/from researchers' desktops and server machines (e.g., file servers and compute servers) all across the campus network at high speed.\n\nConsequently, this project deployed SDN-enabled network equipment across a significant portion of the University of Kentucky campus with the goal of bringing high-speed data transfer capabilities to a wide range of researchers.

In addition, researchers' machines remain behind, and protected by, the campus security mechanisms by default.  Also, like other software defined networks, network updates and new types of service can be deployed on much shorter timescales.\n\nOur SDN-enabled campus network infrastructure now covers more than a dozen key research buildings on campus, and supports researchers from a wide range of areas including Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Plant and Soil Sciences, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, Mining, Statistics, Bio(medical) Informatics, Business and Economics, Communications, and Special Collections researchers.

In other words, we were able to improve researcher file transfer speeds by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude in most cases.  We also worked with researchers to find the best software tools to quickly move data between their desktop/file server and the cloud, and showed that parallel transfer tools could typically be optimized to offer the best performance.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian Nichols"
