 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a critical need to develop and deliver research experiences to a greater number of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) interested undergraduates earlier in their collegiate careers.  At the same time, there is a need to identify pedagogical approaches that are most efficacious at fostering learning in STEM focused courses.  This project will focus on both of these entwined needs through the design, development, and implementation of an entry level research course, as well as the assessment of three different instructional approaches.  The University of Florida in partnership with Santa Fe College (both located in Gainesville, Florida) will develop a new research methodology course that will provide first- and second-year college students from both schools the opportunity to participate in authentic scientific investigations. While implementing this course, the project will do research to determine the optimal course delivery platform for stimulating student learning and satisfaction. The three pedagogical approaches to be examined are:  traditional lecture, online-only, and an emerging pedagogy known as the flipped classroom. Throughout the course, students will attend talks (through one of these three approaches) and then apply what they have learned by studying animal behavior of both domestic animals housed at the University of Florida, and exotic animals housed at the Santa Fe College Teaching Zoo. A web-based animal observation platform to facilitate the students' ability to record behavioral data will be launched. Significant effort will be made to recruit underrepresented (minorities, women, low-income and first-generation) students to partake in the course through existing institutional programs. Thus, the examination of three pedagogical approaches, the engagement of first and second year STEM undergraduates in scientific research, and the development of a research methodology course will contribute to the overarching goal of improving undergraduate teaching and learning as stated in the Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) program,\r\n\r\nThis project is founded in constructivist and experiential learning ideals centered on the creation and delivery of a one-semester research education course.  It will expose students to the basic tenants of research requiring them to develop, test, analyze and report on self-derived research hypotheses.  To facilitate students' ability to collect data, learners will be randomly assigned to observe and record animal behaviors in person, or over an interactive web site where students can remotely control cameras.  A comparison of the two data collection methods will occur in order to examine their facility to engage a large cohort of students in active research and for the students' ability to identify behaviors accurately.  Evaluation criteria will include student learning outcomes, ability to think critically, ability to comprehend and apply the basic tenants of research, and perceptions of science based on classroom and research experience platforms.  The educational research agenda will include the random assignment of students to the different instructional delivery approaches over the six semesters, use of mixed model ANOVA using SAS MIXED procedure with a post hoc Tukey's HSD, and other data analytics.  The project will conduct a rigorous formative and summative evaluation to assess the total impact these efforts have on gains in students that participate in the Wild Discoveries course, as either remaining in, or declaring a STEM major after participating in this experience, as well as its potential to support instructional change in many STEM-focused courses.  Ultimately, in addition to the local benefits in terms of recruitment and persistence in the sciences to the approximately 540 students who will be enrolled in the Wild Discoveries course during the initial launch, future students will benefit as well.  Moreover, the learning materials and web-based platform developed with this course will be transferable to other collegiate and K-12 programs throughout the nation.",
