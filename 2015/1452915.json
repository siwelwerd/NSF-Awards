 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to develop a rigorous theoretical understanding of complex and strategic network processes, network structure, and algorithms for network properties.\u00a0\u00a0 Social networks are an abstraction used to study social structure via pair-wise social interactions, and have proven useful in analyzing how local actions affect global trends.\u00a0 Better understanding of social networks promises a better understanding of and the ability to influence a wide range of phenomena, including:\u00a0 what technologies/practices people and firms adopt, how information is transmitted and aggregated, and how network structure relates to the agents' ability to search within the network.\u00a0 In all of these instances individuals' activities can have a global-scale impact, which is mediated by a network.\u00a0 The increasing presence of computer-accessible data (e.g., websites, user-generated content, usage data from telecommunications, apps, web-browsing, etc.)\u00a0 has rekindled an interest in this field because of the new ability to gather data to test theories on a large scale.\u00a0 This project seeks to develop new algorithms and theoretical frameworks to help fully make use of these data.\r\n\u00a0\r\nThis project will develop and apply traditional tools, insights, and approaches from theoretical computer science including functional analysis, graph theory, combinatorics, linear algebra, probabilistic analysis, linear and semidefinite program hierarchies, complexity theory, and game theory to the study of network processes and structure.\u00a0 This project will transform the way we use social network data by: 1) developing the technical tools required to achieve a better understanding of specific complex and strategic processes (including those mentioned above), 2)\u00a0 identifying network structures that are efficiently verifiable and are useful for understanding nuances in the network processes,\u00a0 and 3)\u00a0 improving our understanding of certain network processes by explicitly accounting for agents' strategic reasoning.\u00a0 The technical content of this project will have direct applications to related fields such as probability, economics, sociology, and statistical physics.\u00a0 Additionally,\u00a0 a key goal of this project is to move beyond worse-case analysis; if successful, this will pave the way to exporting theoretical computer ideas to many disciplines where their current application is limited due to its fixation on worst-case hardness---in particular fields that feature networks such as biology and epidemiology. The PI plans to develop curriculum to introduce computer science topics to high school students and involve undergraduates in his research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has made deep advances and lasting impact in our understanding of social networks and our ability to affect change through them.  This project will helps us better use the abundance of social network data by providing algorithms and frameworks to interpret it. \n\nThe project achieved its objectives by successfully: \n\n1) Modeling social networks as a distributed system where each node operates in a local, autonomous, and, possibly, self-interested way and analyzing these models;\n\n2) Developing and analyzing algorithms for interpreting network data; and\n\n3) Collecting and analyzing empirical social network data.\n\nAll three methods are important to tackle real problems.  To take a current example, we may want to promote the spread of healthy practices to limit the damage of a pandemic.  To do so we need models of how people adopt such measures, we must validate our models, and then we must understand how to effect change within these models. \n\nAdditionally, the technical content of this project has direct applications to related fields such as probability, economics, sociology, and machine learning.   \n\n \n\nNetwork Models\n\nThis project develops theoretical tools to provably quantify how network processes, for example: consensus, emergence of conventions and common belief, ideological sorting, and myopic routing, are affected by the underlying network structure, particularly community structure.  Understanding these relationships is essential to any effort to improve them (e.g. reduce sorting and promote diversity, limit the spread of unhealthy behaviors, etc)\n\nComplex cascades: Complex cascades model ``expensive\" changes that agents are unlikely to make after a single exposure (e.g., pricey technology innovations, the change of social behaviors, or the decision to participate in a migration).  Sociologists believe that many real-world cascades are complex.  Intuitively, in complex contagions additionally activated neighbors can have a synergistic effect, and thus means that their spread depends crucially on the underlying graph and community structure.  This project proved tight bounds on how complex cascades spread on a diverse range of networks.\n\nNovel techniques to analyze network dynamics:   This project has addressed the severe lack of techniques to analyze network dynamics, in particular, when previous techniques called mixing times do not apply.  This project developed new tools and illustrated their power by solving the time that large class of ``majority-like\" dynamics takes to reach consensus on two foundational network models.  This work showed a phase transition: if the communities are sufficiently well connected the dynamics converge quickly, but otherwise may take exponentially long to converge. \n\nThe novel techniques we developed include automatically generate appropriate potential functions (for any given updated function, a sort of automated proof) and proving that these processes quickly escape saddle point regions of their mean field approximations.  \n\n \n\nAlgorithms for Network Data\n\nBy developing cutting-edge algorithms, we have transformed the way influence maximization is approached. Our research specifically examined complex of cascades within social networks, investigating how ideas, behaviors, and innovations spread. These novel findings have opened up new avenues for maximizing the impact of initiatives and campaigns within various communities.\n\n \n\nInfluence Maximization asks how to seed nodes to maximize their influence and start a large cascade.  The majority of existing work considers the case where the model of contagion is simple (submodular).  This project studied influence maximization with complex (nonsubmodular) cascades as well.  For a particular setting of a hierarchical network structure, this project showed that if the cascade is complex, then it is optimal to allocate all the seeds among one community.  However, if the cascade is simple, then the opposite is true: it is optimal to spread out the seeds among many different communities.  This shows the danger of just focusing on simple contagions. This project also developed strong hardness of approximation results for influence maximization on complex networks that apply to many different settings of graphs and cascades and complement the above positive result.  Moreover, this project developed a heuristic that outperforms the state of the art for the nonsubmodular setting.\n\n \n\nThis project also studied the influence maximization problem for simple cascades in undirected networks: first showing the intractability of good approximation algorithms in very general settings, and then showing the effectiveness of certain heuristics.  We also studied a dynamic setting where seeds are chosen oven time after seeing the effect of the previous seeds.     \n\n \n\nEmpirical work \n\n This project helped to provide the first strong experimental evidence for the existence of complex cascades by running experiments on Mechanical Turk.  Identifying their existence is important to understand the most fundamental nature of how ideas and behaviors spread through social networks. \n\n \n\nEducation and Outreach\n\nThe educational component developed graduate curriculum, involved underrepresented undergraduates in research, as well as providing outreach to underserved high school students to expose a broad audience to the power and relevance of STEM research to their everyday lives via the interdisciplinary study of social networks. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Grant Schoenebeck"
