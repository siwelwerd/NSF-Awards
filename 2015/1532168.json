 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professors Brian Bennett and colleague Richard Holz from Marquette University will upgrade of an electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrometer. This upgrade will provide a high-quality cryogenic EPR system for research and education, without the expense of a new instrument. This equipment will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that provide insight on how biologically relevant species with unpaired electrons behave. In general, an EPR spectrometer yields detailed information on the geometric and electronic structure of molecular and solid state materials. It may also be used to obtain information about the lifetimes of free radicals, short-lived, highly reactive species involved in valuable chemical transformations as well as the initiation of pathological tumor growth. These studies will impact a number of areas, from the synthesis of inorganic and organic molecules to the development of new solid state materials to compounds of magnetic and biological interest. Employing examples inspired from ongoing research, this instrument will be an integral part of research and teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels at Marquette. Additionally, the investigators have identified a significant number of interested users from the area outside of this institution. Examples are major users from the Universities of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, Madison and Parkside as well as St Maurice College, Milwaukee School of Engineering and Concordia University.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) carrying out mechanistic studies on nitrile hydratase; (b) studying structural and functional models for metalloenzyme active centers; (c) studying inorganic supramolecular and materials chemistry; (d) studying nitrogen-cycle enzymes; (e) assembling and regulating of Cyt c oxidase by Hig1 and oxa1p; and (f) investigating carbenes, carbocations and non-covalent halogen interactions.",

Basically, microwaves of a fixed frequency are applied to a sample, maintained at very low temperatures in our case, and a magnetic field in which the sample sits is swept from low- to high-field. As the field is swept the separation between magnetic energy levels in the sample increases until, at characteristic field values for the sample, the energy of the microwave is exactly equal to the energy level separation. At that field, the microwaves are absorbed, and we see a signal. That is called the EPR signal.</p>\n<p>The samples that we investigate include materials (e.g. copper nanoparticles with bacericidal activity; nitric oxide binding cage-like molecules; and chemical catalysts that mimic natural enzymes); proteins with metal centers (iron, copper, manganese, cobalt)&nbsp;that are involved in bioenergetics or carry out biochemical catalytic reactions; and freshly-frozen tissue samples from both animal and human biopsies.</p>\n<p>Applications of EPR include mitochondrial disease diagnosis; disease progression and therapeutic evaluation in cancer; and understanding the mechanisms of how certain metalloproteins destroy cyanide compounds, confer antibiotic resistance, activate oxygen, trigger tumor metastasis, and regulate hormone responses.</p>\n<p>One of the limiting factors of using EPR is the cost of liquid helium to maintain the very low temperatures that are necessary for some studies, including those carried out at Marquette. As of 2018, it costs roughly $50 per hour just to keep the sample cold, or $2,000 for a typical work week. An investigation may take weeks or months to carry out and many researchers do not have the funds to complete such studies. In addition, some studies require extended scanning times that are not practical with liquid helium (it runs out!). Our system allows researchers to collect the data that will help them get funding for their research and better understand the systems they are working on.</p>\n<p>This award, then, allows the use of EPR for investigations that would otherwise be impractical, either for fundamental or financial reasons. In the two years since the equipment was installed, we have ran for over 2,500 hours and collected over 3,000 datasets. The savings in liquid helium costs have already recouped 80 % of the outlay for the cryogenic equipment.</p>\n<p>As an example of the new capabilities of the system, systematic studies on the role that free radicals play in tumor growth, and studies on the effects of chemoprotectants on tumor tissue and cultured cancer cells, have been enabled by the stability and long-term capability of both the cryogenic system and the newly upgraded spectrometer. The spectrometer is fully digitally controlled and has a very wide (24-bit) bandwidth and unlimited field resolution that allows us to collect from a single experiment information that would otherwise require multiple experiments to extract. This is mportant because of the large number of samples (hundreds) involved in these longitudinal studies. We can also combine more exotic experiments (so-called \"rapid passage\", and higher derivative displays) with the regular scan, which can provide additional information.</p>\n<p>Finally, as well as opening up low-temperature EPR to researchers across the Milwaukee and Southeast Wisconsin region, the instrumentation is used in laboratory classes in chemistry and in physics, for undergraduate research training at Marquette, and for training workshops for students, post-docs, and faculty across the region.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/11/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Brian&nbsp;Bennett</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1532168/1532168_10395326_1536675005034_IMG_0398_zoom--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1532168/1532168_10395326_1536675005034_IMG_0398_zoom--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MRI-funded EPR equipment.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1532168/1532168_10395326_1536675005034_IMG_0398_zoom--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MRI-funded EPR equipment.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The spectrometer itself is far right; the He compressors at the left rear; the cold head and vacuum/flow control panel is at front; and the magnet and microwave bridge at rear center.
