 "awd_abstract_narration": "To address regional and national STEM workforce demands, this NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas will provide access to quality science and math education for 16 students with demonstrated financial need.  Enrollment in the institution's computer science, math and physics majors will be bolstered through intensive recruitment efforts in area magnet and college-preparatory high schools.  The project will focus on making a variety of social supports available while at the same time providing students with a curriculum that integrate investigative learning strategies in introductory to upper-level courses.  This approach, which is grounded in the literature, has been shown to have positive impacts on learning in general and to be empowering for students from underrepresented groups and women. \r\n\r\nScholars will develop their scientific identities through project activities that focus specifically on inclusivity, inquiry, and community-building.  Students will participate in two Summer Science Overnights, regular meetings with dedicated S-STEM faculty mentors, a two-credit course on less well-known career tracks in the sciences, cohort-building experiences, and clustered enrollment.  The overnights are an innovative way to introduce students to the campus-wide STEM community and should help them create ties early on in their college experience.  Further, all of the project components are examples of sustainable, transferrable tools for engaging STEM majors.  The Evaluation Plan describes three key areas for assessment including, (a) project deadlines and benchmarks, (b)) formative assessment of individual S-STEM progress and likelihood of retention, and (c) overall project formative and summative assessment.  Formative assessment will rely on student perceptions of academic performance and engagement and of social and family support logged in journals.  The individual support structures will also be evaluated.  Summative assessments will be done in part through an annual questionnaire on scholars' perceptions of their SSTEM academic and mentoring.  The PI team will participate in the national conversation on STEM education by reporting its results through meetings of the Association of American Colleges and Universities and the Howard Hughes medical Institute.  A project website will also be designed.",

The project also aimed to build recruiting relationships with high schools in underserved areas of Texas while increasing the enrollment of Southwestern students in less-frequently chosen fields such as computer science, math, and physics. The multidisciplinary S-STEM project management team worked closely with Southwestern's Office of Admission to create a comprehensive Scholar selection and recruitment plan. Most S-STEM Scholars entered as two first-year student cohorts in academic years 2016 and 2017. These Scholars participated in a range of activities (see Figure 1) that promoted group cohesion, provided professional socialization, and supported their academic progress.</p>\n<p>A science and math curriculum grounded in evidence-based pedagogy and designed to promote Scholar creativity, persistence, and success provided the foundation for the S-STEM project. Southwestern previously engaged in a comprehensive curricular transformation that incorporated inquiry-based and active learning within STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses at all levels. Scholars were first introduced to active learning through EQUIP (Embracing Quantitative Understanding and the Inquiry Process), a pre-matriculation bridge program that was developed for Scholars and other incoming first-year Southwestern students interested in pursuing STEM degrees. The week-long intensive, residential program combined inquiry-based mathematics coursework with professional development and campus orientation activities, as well as cohort-building social events. EQUIP students were also cohort enrolled with their faculty mentors in key introductory courses during the fall semester of their first year.</p>\n<p>Scholars were assigned academic advisors within their disciplines from the S-STEM project management team to create a comprehensive structure to support their retention and success. Regular planned social gatherings between Scholars and faculty advisors throughout the academic year provided additional opportunities for informal mentoring. Immersing Scholars within undergraduate research early in their college careers was a program priority. With encouragement from their faculty mentors, every Scholar conducted undergraduate research, primarily through summer programs but also in course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). For example, 90% of Scholars participated in SCOPE (Southwestern's 8-week multidisciplinary faculty-student collaborative summer research program), mini-SCOPE (a 2-week introduction to research following the Scholar's first year), or a research program at another institution. Several Scholars participated in these opportunities over multiple years and as a result, Southwestern's S-STEM program had an impressive record of demonstrated Intellectual Merit through Scholar attendance at academic conferences and publishing co-authored research articles. Between 2016-2021, 16 Scholars participated in 24 conferences, made 14 research presentations at professional meetings, and published two peer-reviewed articles in academic journals (unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected these numbers due to meeting cancellations).</p>\n<p>Evaluation was a cornerstone of this project and allowed for programmatic changes to be made based on formative feedback. A comprehensive assessment plan based on a logic model and evaluation rubric was developed, and annual assessment helped to identify programming aspects that worked well and where opportunities for improvement existed. The summative value of the project to participants was also determined. For example, every graduating Scholar (100%) reported that the S-STEM Scholarship was the most important factor influencing their decision to attend Southwestern. Furthermore, most graduating Scholars (92%) noted the S-STEM award was \"extremely important\" in allowing them to graduate from Southwestern with less debt.
