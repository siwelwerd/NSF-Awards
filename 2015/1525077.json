 "awd_abstract_narration": "Education research continues to produce evidence that teaching methods that use active-learning strategies yield improved learning outcomes and student success across the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Yet, many college mathematics classes are not yet taught using such strategies. To address this problem, the project, \"PROfessional Development and Uptake through Collaborative Teams (PRODUCT): Supporting Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) in Undergraduate Mathematics through Workshops, Research and Capacity-Building\", is designed to increase institutional capacity to offer professional development for instructors. The active learning strategy of focus, known as \"inquiry-based learning\" (IBL), places emphasis on student creation, exploration, communication, collaboration, and experimentation with mathematical concepts, under the mentorship and guidance of an instructor. Building directly on previously funded work that produced and studied a successful professional development workshop model, this project will develop multiple new teams to conduct workshops and outreach activities on IBL teaching strategies (known as a \"train the trainers\" propagation model). Research conducted alongside the workshop activities will contribute to knowledge about effective strategies for encouraging use of active learning approaches such as IBL, and for supporting instructors as they learn to apply and adapt these approaches in their own classrooms.\r\n\r\nPRODUCT will conduct 12 four-day intensive IBL workshops, as well as 15 short workshops and five Professional Development (PD) Preparatory Meetings, and will host a Professional Development Summit for mathematics faculty developers. Through these activities, PRODUCT will directly provide professional development for 320 undergraduate mathematics faculty, adapt and improve IBL PD materials, develop multiple new teams of faculty developers who will be prepared to engage additional faculty in the future, and develop a framework for building professional development capacity. A research-with-evaluation study will provide formative feedback, study the process and outcomes for development of the professional development teams, gather data to benchmark workshops led by new teams against a model known to be effective, and investigate the classroom practices of workshop participants to understand how the professional development experience shapes their teaching. The project will produce new knowledge about scaling up professional development programs through a careful and collaborative process to prepare teams of faculty developers and provide them with well-supported leadership experiences.",

The workshops focused on inquiry-based learning (IBL), an approach to mathematics that engages students in thinking about rich, open-ended mathematical tasks, sharing ideas and solutions with peers, and refining their ideas through discussion. As a teaching approach, IBL offers instructors flexibility to adapt its core principles or \"four pillars\" to diverse student audiences, classroom settings, and personal teaching styles. The benefits of IBL for students have been demonstrated by prior research, and the professional development workshops were carefully designed in alignment with research on PD. In this way, good professional development that effectively prepares instructors to teach with these research-proven methods can have a powerful and positive effect on college students' success in mathematics courses and on their ability to achieve their goals, earn college degrees, and enter STEM and other professions.</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-945b6a44-7fff-df0a-69d8-f323ea2fc1fa\" style=\"caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal;\"> </strong></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 5pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><strong id=\"docs-internal-guid-945b6a44-7fff-df0a-69d8-f323ea2fc1fa\" style=\"caret-color: #000000; color: #000000; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; text-decoration: none; font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-position: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Our collaborators, a team based at the Academy of Inquiry Based Learning (AIBL), planned and provided the professional development.

Importantly, IBL implementation was strong across all demographic groups and across institutional types. The data also show that instructors' prior experience with IBL, and the class size and support available when they first implement IBL, enhance their ability to put what they learned at the workshop into practice in their own classroom. \n\n \nFor the traveling workshops, survey data show that the workshops raised awareness, fostered interest in IBL, and supported some instructors to implement IBL in their own classrooms. The traveling workshops expanded the project's reach and served instructors from groups often less well served by PD, such as non-tenure-track instructors and those at two-year institutions.\n\n \nPreparation of professional development leaders was an explicit goal of the project, with the intent to build PD capacity in mathematics higher education. Success in this goal is a second important outcome of this project. The workshop leaders were already skilled in IBL teaching, but not all had prior PD experience. They developed broader perspectives on IBL teaching and how it can be adapted to a variety of teaching circumstances; they built flexible toolkits of teaching approaches useful in workshops, and they expanded their own collaborative and professional networks. Many of them continue to offer PD about IBL and other topics related to teaching, learning, equity and justice in education.\n\n\nThe project has already generated many publications that variously target instructors, professional developers, and scholars; these products include posters, talks, articles, and handbooks. Our research team continues to identify new findings, analyze data, and share results. The project has also generated new insights about research methods that can be used to characterize teaching and thus to characterize changes in teaching that occur as a result of professional development. The research will help others adopt these professional development methods and strengthen college teaching in math and other STEM fields.\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sandra L Laursen"
