 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project by the Association of Women in Mathematics (AWM) focuses on fostering research collaborations and establishing research networks for women mathematicians in the early to mid-stages of their careers.  Research collaborations have become an increasingly essential part of a successful career in mathematics.  In theoretical sciences, unlike laboratory sciences, there is no structure in which collaborations and mentor relationships naturally arise.  It is thus critical that women, beginning early in their career, attend research conferences in their area of specialization, interact productively with other participants, and have access to research-based networks.  To facilitate such networks, AWM plans to organize a series of conferences and workshops aimed at fostering research collaborations and building sustainable networks.  These networks will be established at Research Collaboration Conferences for Women (RCCWs), which are week-long conferences, held at mathematics institutes, where junior and senior women come together to work on pre-defined research problems.  AWM will expand the number and scope of the RCCWs and organize a series of follow-up events to help sustain and grow the resulting networks.  Expected outcomes of this project include more invitations to speak at conferences, more collaborative research, a higher level of productivity for the women involved, and decreased attrition.  The networks created by this project will not be static and will welcome new researchers as they enter the field.  \r\n\r\nStudies conducted through this project will focus on understanding the effectiveness of research collaboration networks in helping to advance women's research careers to the highest levels of the profession.  By promoting research collaborations and forming networks of women with related research interests, the proposed workshops will help both senior and junior women increase their visibility in and contributions to the research community.  This project will also add to our understanding of the impact of networks and mentor relationships based on shared research interests in addition to shared demographic characteristics.  The research and interactive seminars designed for this project have the potential to become models for future events of this kind and for other theoretical sciences. \r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE Partnerships for Learning and Adaptation Networks (PLAN) program track supports projects that promote the adaptation and implementation of previously effective ADVANCE programs in new contexts and the testing of innovative strategies to promote the participation, success, and advancement of women in STEM academic careers.  PLAN projects also contribute to the knowledge base on gender equity in STEM academic careers.",

Funding from this NSF ADVANCE Award launched the AWM Research Communities for Women, enabling AWM to foster research collaborations and to establish research networks for women mathematicians in the early to mid-stages of their careers. These networks are spawned at Research Collaboration Conferences for Women (RCCWs), which are week-long conferences, held at mathematical sciences institutes, where junior and senior women come together to work on pre-defined research problems.  Through this grant,  AWM expanded the number and scope of such RCCWs and organized a series of follow-up events to sustain and grow the resulting networks.  AWM Workshops at the annual Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM) and Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Meetings bring together women from one of the Research Collaboration Networks, along with some recent PhDs in the field, to showcase their work and encourage continued collaboration and mentoring.  AWM also organizes a large biennial Research Symposium, with high-profile Plenary Speakers and Special Sessions in research areas linked to the Research Collaboration Networks.  A new AWM-Springer series was launched in which proceedings from the RCCWs are published. A formal assessment (both formative and summative) of project outcomes was conducted throughout the grants.  AWM supports the research networks further though two established committees:  The RCCW Committee helps research networks form in new areas by matching them with a math institute and working with them to submit a conference proposal;  The RN Committee helps strong research networks emerge after an initial RCCW. The Research Networks are encouraged to:\n\nform a Steering Committee; \nappoint a webmaster to create and maintain a webpage; \nuse a listserv to facilitate communication; \norganize follow-up events such as special sessions and AWM workshops; \npublish a proceedings volume in the AWM Springer series; and \npublish accounts of their networks in the AWM Newsletter. \n\nIntellectual Merit. This grant supported 1109 women mathematicians participating in Research Collaboration Conference, follow-up workshops at national meetings, and supporting activities of Research Networks. So far, 25 networks have been established for Women and more are being created. The AWM Springer Series has published 29 volumes of work produced by these activities [\"Association for Women in Mathematics Series.\" Springer, https://www.springer.com/series/13764? detailsPage=titles]. \nBroader Impact. More women are doing more and better mathematical sciences research and are more visible in the community. Analysis of survey and Google Scholar data reveal that rates of journal submission are up, as are rates of publication. Analysis of survey and CV data reveal that women are progressing through the ranks, getting promoted, securing more research grants and external grant dollars, and becoming more visible in their scholarly communities through deep engagement with (and leadership positions in) professional associations.\nParticipating in AWM networks bolstered respondents' professional relationships.
