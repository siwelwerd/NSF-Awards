 "awd_abstract_narration": "Additive manufacturing includes a variety of 3D fabrication technologies. Starting from early powder-based 3D printing, commercial machines are now capable of producing thermoplastics using fused deposition modeling, ultraviolet curable polymers using stereolithography, and metals using laser sintering techniques. However, additive manufacturing of composites or bi-materials remains challenging, particularly for two materials with significantly different properties that can be combined in various ratios to create different mechanical behaviors. This research aims to develop a manufacturing method, in which 3D printing is utilized to make specific scaffold structures, allowing polymer to infiltrate and reinforce the part. This new method will enable development of functionally gradient materials, light-weight design, and reinforced structures for applications of additive manufacturing in rapid prototyping, healthcare, automotive and aerospace. Outcomes of this research will stimulate the next-generation additive manufacturing technology and provide education and research opportunities for students of many different backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThis research focuses on understanding the infiltration mechanism of the polymer through certain parameters, such as viscosity and surface tension, and mechanical behaviors of the polymer infiltrated composite in order to customize material properties, including stiffness, hardness, strength, and isotropy or anisotropy. To this end, this research includes two tasks. First, the research team will study and simulate the infiltration phenomenon using computational fluid dynamics and validate with design of experiments. The results will define the structural limits to capsulate or drain liquid polymers prior to solidification. In the second task, they will investigate the rule of mixtures for composite mechanics under a variety of scaffold structures and the non-linear behavior of the composite under extreme loads. Results from this research can be used to establish a material decomposition algorithm. This algorithm can thus be used to define scaffold structure and polymer selection given a set of desired material properties.",

This composite is made of a 3D printed porous structure filled with another polymer to alter the mechanical behavior. Two types of composites were developed and studied, from manufacturing method, mechanical testing, to numerical analysis. TYPE I composite was a brittle 3D printed frame filled with an elastomer to increase the toughness. TYPE II was a brittle frame filled with a foam material to attenuate impact shock. These composites share a unique design that both constituents have distinct material properties in order to provide a wide range of resultant properties. The major findings to address the intellectual merit are as follows. For fabrication, the initially designed infiltration method was found limited by the pore size and polymer viscosity; thus, a large open cellular structure with a vacuum-assisted casting method was concluded to be more practical for producing these composites. In the experiments, TYPE I composite exhibited a frame-dominant linear-elastic behavior and an enhanced toughness as the deformation continues. TYPE II composite showed a noticeable energy absorption after the foam addition. Overall, the second phase was found useful to alter the structural behavior when its mechanical properties are compatible with those of the frame. To fundamentally understand the compatibility, further numerical analyses unveiled that delayed cracking and reduced stress concentration on brittle frames are the underlying factors. On the broader impacts, the results of this project enabled a new class of composite structure and associated manufacturing method, which can be applied to small and large scale applications, such as tunable bone simulants (as mentioned in the original proposal), athlete protection gears, and resilient construction components. Various ideas have been pitched to a number of agencies for continuous development, among which one successful implementation was the bone simulant being used and evaluated at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and University of Michigan Health System (via sub-award). On the education side, this project has primarily supported two Ph.D. students in turn (both have graduated) and funded three summer REU students with over 10 peer-reviewed publications. In addition, 3D printing and casting techniques were used in a number of outreach activities to middle school students and high-school teachers through the established programs here at Texas A&amp;M. These techniques have also been incorporated in the undergraduate materials and manufacturing courses taught by the PI.
