 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaborative effort by Desert Research Institute and Michigan Technological University to provide insight into the emissions of nitrogen-containing compounds from the combustion of peat soils.  Preliminary estimation suggests that nitrogen emissions from fires in peatlands can potentially rival that of fossil fuel combustion.  An accurate assessment of the global nitrogen cycling requires a detailed understanding of the various nitrogen-containing compounds emitted during peat fires and the factors affecting their partitioning into the gas and particle phases and the changes that they undergo in the atmosphere with age.\r\n\r\nThe main hypothesis of the proposed work is that an important fraction of peat fuel nitrogen (N) is contained in particulate organic nitrogen (PON), and that this fraction changes during photochemical processing in the atmosphere. The objectives of the research are: 1) to evaluate the partitioning of peat soil N into gas and particle-phase components as a function of peat fuel type and combustion efficiency, with a particular focus on quantifying the PON fraction; and 2) to assess how the oxidation (aging) of smoke by hydroxyl (OH) radicals alters the abundance and chemical properties of the PON.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work is expected to advance the understanding of the importance of peat fires for global N cycling and atmospheric chemistry. The research results will be distributed to US natural resource managers through a webinar, which may inform their decision-making on peatland restoration and preservation. A high school science teacher involved in this research will help develop material for engaging students in hands-on activities related to biomass burning, fire ecology, and atmospheric chemistry implications of these fires.",

The PAM-OFR was evaluated for its ability to quantify changes in source marker abundances. Laboratory tests were conducted to examine transmission efficiency/wall losses and residence time distributions and to determine hydroxyl radical (OH) exposure concentrations that represent different atmospheric aging durations.

Selecting appropriate aging time to evaluate maximum aerosol mass enhancement is also uncertain.</p>\n<p>Emission factors (EFs) varied by pollutant and by climate region. Averaged EFs for carbon dioxide (EF<sub>CO2</sub>) were highest (1400 &plusmn; 38 g/kg) and lowest (1073 &plusmn; 63 g/kg) for the Alaskan and Russian peats, respectively. EFs for carbon monoxide and methane (EF<sub>CO</sub> and EF<sub>CH4</sub>) were ~12&#8210;15 % and 0.3&#8210;0.9 % of EF<sub>CO2</sub>. Average EFs for nitrogen species such as ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), hydrogen cyanide (HCN), nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x</sub>), and reactive nitrogen (NO<sub>y</sub>) were of the same magnitude as EF<sub>CH4</sub>. EFs from this study can be used to refine global emission inventories.</p>\n<p>Average carbonaceous species abundances in total emitted carbon are shown in Figure 3. Most (&gt;95 %) of the total emitted carbon was in the gas-phase with 54&#8210;75 % as CO<sub>2</sub> and followed by 8&#8210;30 % as CO. Most (&gt;99 %) of the total emitted nitrogen (N) was in the gas phase, with an average of 16.7 % fuel N emitted as NH<sub>3</sub> and 9.5 % as HCN.&nbsp; Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) and NO<sub>y</sub> constituted 5.7 % and 2.9 % of consumed fuel N. Measured nitrogen compounds explained 24&#8210;52 % of the consumed nitrogen in the fuel, consistent with past studies. Most of the N in emissions derives from the N content of the fuels and is probably emitted as N<sub>2</sub>. Organic nitrogen formed from photochemical reactions of hydrocarbon with NO<sub>x</sub> plays an important role in the global nitrogen cycle.</p>\n<p>Species abundances in PM<sub>2.5</sub> between aged and fresh profiles varied by &gt;5 orders of magnitude with two distinguishable clusters: around 0.1 % for reactive and ionic species and &gt; 10 % for carbon. Organic carbon (OC) losses from 2- to 7-days aging were somewhat offset by the formation of oxygenated organic compounds, as evidenced by the 12&#8210;19 % increase in organic mass (OM) to OC ratios. The reduction of OM abundances in PM<sub>2.5</sub> by 3&#8210;18 % after 7 days, indicates volatilization of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) (Figure 4). Week-long aging resulted in an increase to ~7&#8210;8 % of ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>) and nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) abundances, but with decreasing of NH<sub>3</sub> for Siberia, Alaska, and Everglades (FL) peats (Figure 5). Elevated levoglucosan, a marker for biomass burning, was found for Russian peats, accounting for 35&#8210;39 % and 20&#8210;25 % for PM<sub>2.5</sub> mass for fresh and aged profiles, respectively.</p>\n<p>This study shows important differences between fresh and aged peat combustion profiles among the four biomes that can be used to establish speciated emission inventories for atmospheric modeling and receptor model source apportionment.
