One of the challenges in inhalation therapy is guaranteeing the precise dose is delivered uniformly throughout the lungs.  The drug particles may preferentially deposit in some locations in certain airways and not reach other locations or airways, especially in cases of obstructive disease.  This project will explore ways to promote dispersal of drug particles after they have been deposited onto the liquid lining of airway surfaces.  The strategy is to use surfactants, delivered as particles, with the drug particles to establish spatial variations of surface tension in the liquid along airway surfaces.  Variations in surface tension induce flows called Marangoni flows that can entrain the drug particles and move them along airway surfaces. The project comprises a series of experiments to understand the dynamics of particle motion along the liquid surface and to determine how material properties influence the final extent of drug dispersal.\r\n\r\nThe project will explore factors that determine the extent of dispersal of inhaled drug particles, including properties of the surfactant, such as surface tension reduction, solubility and kinetics of dissolution as well as wettability of the surfactant particles and size of the particles. Similar properties for the drug particles will affect the motion of the particles entrained in the Marangoni flow. Collective effects related to how the deposition pattern of large numbers of co-mingled surfactant and drug model particles controls large scale powder dispersal will be determined, and a multi-variate analysis will be performed to determine the primary factors that control the extent of post-deposition dispersal. As an alternative to co-administering two kinds of particles, a composite particle that contains both the drug and a surfactant to induce the Marangoni flow will be examined.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview: Motivated by a new approach to enhance pulmonary aerosol drug delivery, the work performed under his grant primarily focused on the fundamental mechanisms controlling surface tension gradient driven (Marangoni) flows to induce post-deposition transport of solid, dry aerosol particles across subphases that mimic the critical features of the lung airway surface liquid.  While inhaled aerosol drugs can deliver substantial doses of medication directly to the lungs, altered patterns of ventilation cause inhaled drugs to deposit non-uniformly in diseased lungs.  Some lung regions receive very high local doses while other regions go untreated.  This demands new methods to cause post-deposition dispersal of drugs in order to be effective.  The research carried out determined how Marangoni stresses drive post-deposition dispersal of dry powder aerosols across the liquid surface.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit:  Prior research from this group has produced a picture of how millimeter scale drops and micron scale aerosolized droplets of surfactant solutions spread across miscible, complex fluid subphases and what system properties control the final spread area.  These results present a set of material selection and dosing criteria for developing successful surfactant-enhanced drug delivery systems and set the stage for the work under this grant where the conditions for optimizing the final spread area of solid particles deposited from a dry powder aerosol were explored. \n\n            Major findings include that surfactant containing powders does induce Marangoni spreading with dispersal patterns similar to those produced by drops of surfactant solution.  At lower total surfactant deposited, the rates of the powders are faster than those of the drop; but at higher total mass of surfactant deposited, the powders and drops cause similar spreading rates.  For high powder mass deposited, repeated Marangoni waves occur. \n\n            Since surfactants already exist in the lung, we also examined how surfactant deposited from an aerosol produces spreading under such conditions.  We found that spreading does still occur but the fundamental fluid flows are significantly altered by the pre-existing surfactant.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:  The proposed research began to establish the fundamental mechanisms dictating the performance of surfactant-enabled, self-dispersing dry powder aerosol formulations for pulmonary drug delivery. As a result of such studies, material selection and powder design criteria will be established that will form the basis for designing an effective delivery system to uniformly deliver dry powder active agents in diseased lungs. This technology will benefit the treatment of any number of obstructive lung diseases, including cystic fibrosis, asthma, pneumonia and other acute or chronic pulmonary infections.
