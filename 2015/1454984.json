 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:\r\nThis research seeks to advance the understanding of defect-driven oxide materials for developing new battery technologies to meet global energy needs. People depend on energy to power buildings, cars, portable devices, manufacturing, and communication systems. Global energy demands are growing exponentially, making improved energy storage technologies increasingly urgent. This project explores a new electrochemical paradigm to create oxide materials with disorder for high energy, power, and stability battery systems. Recent studies have indicated that metal oxides with structural defects and local disorder may offer superior capacity and stability over the widely explored well-ordered oxides for advanced battery systems. Confirmation of the hypothesis of enhancing battery functionality in this project using defect-driven oxide materials could profoundly transform battery research, manufacturing, and applications, and also open pathways for defect-driven electrode materials research. This project stands to improve the U.S. innovation and economic competitiveness in the area of energy storage technologies. Finally, this project aims at educating and mentoring students from elementary through graduate school through an integrated research program that is focused on fundamental science of energy materials. Graduate students are offered opportunities for professional development through collaborative research with national laboratories. This project is also developing educational modules for Idaho youth in non-school settings through a new partnership with local Boys and Girls Clubs to boost students' interest in science and engineering. Research outcomes are demonstrated through hands-on education modules in the annual STEM Exploration Day and other on-campus outreach activities. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS:\r\nThis project tests the hypothesis that nanoscale disordered metal oxides can serve as a host with a fairly open framework that can be electrochemically altered to form optimal structures for enhanced electrochemical charge storage. Recent studies have indicated that cation-disordered ceramic materials may offer higher capacity and better stability as compared to well-ordered oxides; however the underlying electrochemical charge storage mechanism remains largely unknown. This study aims to advance knowledge of defect-driven oxide materials, thermodynamics, intercalation kinetics, and how to leverage them for energy storage. Evidence that tailoring the defect chemistry will result in spontaneous phase transformation during electrochemical cycling from nanoscale amorphous oxides to optimal structures is sought. Under study are simple model oxide systems (titania and niobium pentoxide) and Li(Na)-ion battery systems. The research could offer a universal method to create new high performance electrode materials. In addition, the team is adapting nanoscience, electrochemistry, and energy materials research concepts to curricula from K-12 to the graduate level. Graduate student researchers are collaborating with national laboratories to expand the capabilities in this project; through these collaborations, students are also gaining technical experience with cutting-edge research equipment and techniques.",

Despite the promise of cation-disordered metal oxides driven by defects for improving the performance of electrochemical energy storage systems, fundamental knowledge regarding thermodynamics, intercalation kinetics, size and shape effects of nanostructures, as well as surface chemistry for this class of electrode materials remains limited. The PI investigated the crystallinity effect of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles with identical size morphology on Li-ion storage. It was found that at low current rates (close to equilibrium conditions), Li storage increases with the increase of crystallinity. It is postulated that more available intercalation sites for TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles are present with higher crystallinity. <em>Ex situ</em> synchrotron pair distribution function analysis suggests that the 1D zigzag Li ion diffusion pathway becomes expanded with the increase of crystallinity. At high current rates (away from equilibrium states), however, the amorphous(A)-TiO<sub>2</sub> sample had slightly larger capacity than the fully-crystalline(FC)-TiO<sub>2</sub>, both of which showed larger capacities than that of the partially-crystalline(PC)-TiO<sub>2</sub> sample. Both A-TiO<sub>2</sub> and FC-TiO<sub>2</sub> sample exhibit higher capacitive contribution to the charge storage and larger Li<sup>+</sup> diffusivity than those of the PC-TiO<sub>2</sub> sample, which explains their better rate capability. Moreover, the larger lithium diffusivity of A-TiO<sub>2</sub> sample leads to the slightly larger specific capacity than FC-TiO<sub>2</sub> sample at the highest current rate. The PI has shown evidence that transition metal oxides which have structural defects (e.g., vacancies and interstitials) at cation sites with local disorder have the potential to offer higher capacity and better stability compared to ordered oxides. Most researchers in this arena prepare cation-disordered structures chemically before battery testing. In contrast, the PI have shown that through electrochemical cycling with Li<sup>+</sup>, metal oxide electrodes (e.g., TiO<sub>2</sub>, Nb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>) can undergo amorphous-to-crystalline (a-to-c) transformation to disorder rock salt (DRX) phases that exhibiting superior capacity, power, and long-term stability as compared to other metal oxide polymorphs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project led to new understanding of the driving forces for a-to-c transformation as well as crystallinity effect in nanostructured metal oxides for energy storage. The work suggests that inducing crystallization of amorphous nanomaterials through electrochemical cycling is a promising new avenue for creating unconventional high-performance metal oxide electrode materials. Outreach programs related to this project were conducted to K-12 students and the local community at STEM festival, local library, high schools, and Girl Scouts workshops and were well received. The PI developed a girl scout patch program on materials for energy sustainability based on the project and received the Outstanding Community Partner Award from the Girl Scouts of Silver Sage Council Research in 2020. Opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students and strengthened collaborations with national labs were achieved. This project has provided invaluable training and skill development opportunities for seven graduate students, 18 undergraduate students, two high school teachers and four high school students, including 9 females (2 PhD students, 6 undergrads, 2 RET, and one high school student) and three Hispanic students (LSAMP, CAMP.
