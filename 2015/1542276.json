Dec 4, 2015)\r\n\r\nThe proposal seeks funds to partially support the attendance (which includes the registration, travel and subsistence) of early career scientists (junior faculty, postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students) and partial registration support for the invited speakers to the symposium  \"Modeling and Theory Driven Design of Soft Materials,\" to be held at Boston, MA, between Nov. 29 and Dec. 4, 2015.  This symposium is motivated by the growing importance of soft materials ? these encompass a wide range of materials, such as polymers, colloids, foams, gels, composites, bioinspired materials, and functional organic-inorganic structures, whose predominant physical behavior occurs around room temperature.\r\n\r\nThe symposium will be attended by both prominent and young scientists. The aim of the symposium is to bring together researchers from academia, industry and federal laboratories who are exploring both simulation and theory to explore and validate the design of synthetic and organic soft materials to enable the dissemination of state-of-art developments in the field along with educating the next generation of young scientists. The organizers will encourage the participation by prioritizing the travel, subsistence and registration support for women and  underrepresented minority researchers.",
