 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project between the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) and the National Research Council (NRC) aims to study the future of NSF's center-based, multidisciplinary engineering research. NSF's multidisciplinary, center-based, engineering research programs address a variety of key research, education, and innovation needs of the United States. Given the changing global context for engineering research, education and innovation, it is important to consider new guiding principles for constructing a new vision of such centers for the benefit of the nation.  In addressing this goal, the proposed study will consider a variety of questions, including: 1) What models might most effectively enable breakthrough engineering research and discoveries that require center-scale investment considering the convergence of physical science, engineering and life science? 2) What educational models of center-based engineering research programs are best suited to creating a more diverse, internationally aware, and flexible engineering talent pool that is capable of addressing complex, real-world problems?;  3) What academic-industry partnership models might most effectively promote advances in use-inspired basic and translational research, accelerate technology commercialization, and strengthen the broader innovation ecosystem?;  and 4) What metrics can be used to define successes and risks of such center programs?\r\n\r\n This study will inform NSF and other stakeholders about future directions of multidisciplinary, center-based, engineering research. The results will potentially influence decision making by several federal agencies, state economic development offices, research universities, R&D intensive industry, and non-profit foundations interested in more effective and impactful investment in and management of large-scale, multidisciplinary engineering research.  The study will be managed by a committee of experts, appointed by the presidents of the NAE and the National Academy of Sciences.  The committee will conduct extensive data gathering and host a public symposium to help it articulate a new vision for NSF's multidisciplinary, center-based, engineering research over the next 10-20 years.  The study will identify needs and gaps of current approaches, and provide guiding principles and possible strategies for implementing the new vision.  The committee's conclusions will be published in a peer-reviewed report.",
