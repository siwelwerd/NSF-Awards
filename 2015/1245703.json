 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support two training courses that will introduce early-career scientists from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds to key issues in polar science, and especially to provide the opportunity to gain hands-on experience in Antarctic field activities. Antarctica is an ideal location to study a wide variety of questions in biology. However, few students and early-career scientists have the opportunity to work on-site in Antarctica unless they are directly associated with a senior scientist who has a funded Antarctic project. The project will further the NSF goal of training new generations of scientists by providing hands-on training in Antarctica during one course at Palmer Station in 2016 and another at McMurdo Station in 2018. This represents a continuation of nine previous courses at McMurdo Station which have a proven record of introducing participants to Antarctic science under realistic field conditions, providing opportunities to understand and appreciate the complexities and logistical challenges of undertaking science in Antarctica, enhancing the professional careers of the participants, and increasing international collaborations for early-career scientists.\r\n\r\nThe proposed training courses will be open to Ph.D. students and post-doctoral scientists who have interests in the study of Antarctic marine organisms to help prepare them for success in developing their own independent research programs in polar regions. Long-standing and recent questions in evolution and ecology of Antarctic organisms will be examined with 1) field collections, 2) physiological experiments on whole organisms, 3) studies of isolated cells and tissues, 4) experiments on macromolecular processes (e.g., enzymes), and 5) molecular biological analyses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nBiological Adaptations to Environmental Change in Antarctica - An Advanced Training Program for Early Career Scientists.\n\n\n  Working in polar environments is challenging, and particularly so for early-career scientists who have no prior experience of the complex logistical requirements required to undertake successful scientific research in these remote regions. This NSF training program was designed to introduce first-time, early-career scientists to working in Antarctica. Specifically, the program focused on training Ph.D.-level graduate students and recently graduated postdoctoral-level researchers who were interested in pursuing careers in Antarctic research, but had no prior field experience in this region. During this NSF award over a period of two field seasons, 15 participants were selected by the faculty-led instructional team to work at Palmer Station (Antarctic Peninsula area), with an additional group of 20 different participants who worked at McMurdo Station (Ross Sea area).\n\n\n  The major goals and accomplishments of this unique training program were: (1) to train all course participants in field and laboratory methods unique to working in Antarctica; (2) to introduce early-career researchers to fundamental biological processes in a wide range of Antarctic organisms; (3) to have participants understand Antarctic biology in the context of wider concerns about adaptation to environmental change in polar regions and the importance of Antarctic ecosystems on global processes; and (4) to assist in the training and preparation of early-career scientists to develop their own independent research programs in polar regions. In summary, participants in the course gained an in-depth understanding of biological adaptation and evolutionary biology of Antarctic organisms, spanning molecular biological, biochemical, physiological, to biophysical, ecological, and global perspectives.\n\n\n  Importantly, this program also provided the opportunity for scientists -- working for the first time in Antarctica -- to appreciate the complex logistical constraints and possibilities of conducting research in this extreme environment. Without such prior field experience, it is challenging for new early-career scientists to conduct successful research in Antarctica. Course participants were also introduced to international aspects of environmental management of Antarctic resources, to foster an international appreciation of these issues, and to encourage future collaborations among early-career researchers to address current and emerging complex scientific issues in polar regions.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: DennisHedgecock\n"
