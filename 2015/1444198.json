 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cells are a promising alternative energy technology that uses a fuel like hydrogen to produce electricity. The main byproduct of this electricity generation is water, which can 'flood' the fuel cell and severely limit its efficiency if not managed appropriately. Addressing these water management issues in PEM fuels cells will lead to better performance, longer lifetimes, and a higher likelihood of use as an economically viable source of electrical power.  Fuel cells are not transparent, so visual observation inside a fuel cell is not possible. As a result, it is difficult to manage the water produced since it is not clear where water droplets are or what is causing them to stay trapped. One way to 'see inside' the fuel cell is to use X-ray techniques.  This research will establish collaboration between Montana State University and the University of Saskatchewan, which is home to a sophisticated X-ray facility for scientific measurements. The experimental data will better inform computer models and ultimately lead to better fuel cells. Broader impacts include integrating research into the classroom, placing women and minority students in the lab, and scientific presentations for elementary through high school students. \r\n\r\nThe transport of water in a PEM fuel cell remains an unresolved issue because the system is reacting, multiphase, multi-scale, porous, and not amenable to direct visualization. Connecting transport phenomena with performance currently relies on indirect approaches or models with insufficient data for full validation. Collaboration with the University of Saskatchewan provides access to Synchrotron X-ray radiography, allowing this research to identify exactly where water accumulates in a fuel cell to understand how to manage it effectively. The research will study fundamental fluid transport in fuel cells from experimental and numerical perspectives. Knowledge generated on multiphase flow will advance fuel cells and provide additional insight into microfluidics, multiphase heat exchangers, and porous media flows.  The project will (1) allow travel to Saskatchewan to share expertise and schedule time with the Synchrotron facility; (2) collect and analyze initial X-ray radiography data; (3) establish an experimental and modeling approach; and (4) continue the collaboration by leveraging these results for continued research.",

The project focused on water&rsquo;s accumulation and movement within a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell, and how the water related to the overall performance of the cell. Proper water management is critical to the efficiency and longevity of fuel cells; however, these systems are not optically transparent meaning it is difficult to determine where the water is located, how it moves, and effective operational strategies. U of S is home to the Canadian Light Source (CLS), and unlike an optical microscope, the X-ray scans available at this facility allowed the team to visualize water inside the fuel cell. The collaborators at U of S assisted in both experimental and numerical work, and there was complementary expertise between the two teams including mathematical modeling, fluid flow, and fuel cells. The specific objectives were completed via: 1) MSU faculty and students traveled to the CLS to meet and share expertise, outline experimental goals, and design a system for use in the X-ray facility; 2) X-ray radiographs were collected and the group gained expertise in this method; 3) experimental and numerical data were generated and analyzed based on water in the fuel cell components; 4) additional proposals were submitted to continue the collaboration. In combining expertise and studying this important problem, further discoveries can be made related to the fundamentals of the system, which will inform better fuel cell designs and operating conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>PEM fuel cells generate electricity by reacting hydrogen and oxygen. There are no harmful emissions at the point of use, and the only byproducts are electricity, heat, and water. However, the water can accumulate in the fuel cell, resulting in severely limited power generation. Fuel cell materials are opaque, meaning one cannot simply look into the system to see where and how the water is accumulating and how best to manage the system. To overcome this limitation, an X-ray radiography technique was successfully used to look into the system, just as an X-ray may help to &lsquo;look inside&rsquo; a person for diagnosis. In this case, Synchrotron X-ray radiography at the CLS provided a facility capable of creating 3-D scans of the water within the fuel cell system. In establishing a collaboration with researchers at the University of Saskatchewan, the project generated image data about water&rsquo;s location in a thin porous electrode and in the flow channels, two key components of the fuel cell. The CLS facility allows for rapid imaging, meaning that not only can the water be detected, but the amount of water, the location of droplets, and how they move (or get stuck) can be investigated. Additionally, a computer model was used to connect the amount of water accumulating in the electrode to the overall power output of the cell. Experimental data from the X-ray images is critical to the computer model&rsquo;s accuracy. This new understanding is broadly applicable in systems like microfluidics, other porous media systems, and heat exchangers. In the fuel cell arena, being able to resolve the transport of water at the &lsquo;local&rsquo; scale is important to design better fuel cell materials and devise better operating conditions for the cell.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>1) PEM fuel cells are a clean energy technology that can add to the clean energy portfolio in both the United States and Canada. Improving their performance may lead to wider adoption, reducing carbon emissions and reliance on non-domestic sources of energy. 2) Collected data has already been shown in the classroom, exposing students to cutting edge research and providing a new jumping off point to discuss how engineers can solve complex problems. Further, this work provided experimental and modeling research opportunities and international collaboration for all levels of undergraduate and graduate students in the lab, with most this project&rsquo;s participants being women students. 3) The work related to fuel cells and fuel cell materials was incorporated in multiple outreach events in the Bozeman, MT community. The outreach events were done in conjunction with the local student chapter of the Electrochemical Society and included events that occurred on campus and at the Bozeman Public Library. Hundreds of K-12 students, teachers, and parents saw and interacted with components of this work.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/27/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ryan&nbsp;Anderson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1444198/1444198_10354364_1490646173549_CTScanImagesfromAcrylicSetup--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1444198/1444198_10354364_1490646173549_CTScanImagesfromAcrylicSetup--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Experimental CT Scans of Porous Media Used in PEM Fuel Cells\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1444198/1444198_10354364_1490646173549_CTScanImagesfromAcrylicSetup--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Experimental CT Scans of Porous Media Used in PEM Fuel Cells\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Top Left: A dry image shows the carbon fibers and open pores.
