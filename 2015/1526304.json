 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, BREEZEFS, aims to build a specific set of six file system transformations that expose new capabilities to ease the development of future cloud systems and the adoption of multistore devices.  Historically, the job of the OS is to provide common functionalities and thus speeding up innovations at the application layer.  For this project, the focus will be the cloud system.  By targeting the cloud and multistore era, the vision is to ease the development of future cloud systems and the adoption of multistore devices. This will be accomplished by developing new common functionalities into the in-kernel file system stack.\r\n\r\nThe developed software artifacts will be shared widely with the open source community and with various industry partners to help shape the next generation storage systems.  This is the era of Big-Data computing, and storage systems are one important core. Users from many areas (science, healthcare, business, education, military, and government) may benefit from this work.",
