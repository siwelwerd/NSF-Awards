 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the conduct of a workshop focused on identifying and evaluating the scientific basis for neuroscience-based learning interventions.  The workshop will bring together leading researchers who are working at the intersection of neuro-, cognitive, and educational sciences to address questions pertaining to the theoretical, empirical and methodological bases of interventions and technologies that purport to enhance learning and memory.  The workshop will take place in Washington, D.C., in January 2015.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the workshop are to (a) identify the current state of effective learning interventions and technologies; (b) discuss methodological and statistical challenges that have impeded scientific work in this area and propose solutions to these challenges; and (c) discuss ways of effectively and accurately communicating the scientific literature on neuroscience-based interventions to the broader public.  A summary report will be produced that details the products of the discussion and that highlights prospects identified for evidence-based learning techniques based on neuroscientific principles.",
