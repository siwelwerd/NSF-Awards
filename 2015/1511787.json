However, adding fibers to a material complicates processing, because the fibers cause changes in the physical properties of the material during flow.  This project will conduct experiments and computer simulations of the flow behavior of suspensions of rigid rods in a viscous liquid.  The project will examine concentrated suspensions where the rods interact with each other during flow.  Furthermore, the project will focus on the effects of nearby bounding walls on the structure and physical properties of the suspension.  Results of the project will provide information that engineers who process fibrous materials can use in process design to enhance material properties.  The project will provide research training for graduate students, research involvement for interested undergraduates, and opportunities to enhance international collaborations through established initiatives at the University of Florida.\r\n\r\nThe rheology of concentrated fiber suspensions will be studied experimentally in a series of devices.  To examine effects of confinement, the distance between bounding walls in the devices will be varied.  The effects of nearby walls on the microstructure of the suspension will be determined by imaging the rods.  Changes in the microstructure due to confinement will be correlated with changes in fluid rheology.  Experimental measurements will be compared to simulations with periodic boundary condition or with bounding walls to examine connections between microstructure, confinement, and rheology.  In addition to clarifying the influence of confinement, the project will identify the physical mechanisms that control structure and dynamics of concentrated suspensions of rods.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFibers are frequently added to fluids to alter the flow properties of the resulting suspension or as a means to make enhanced products.  Examples include composites formed by adding short fibers to polymeric fluids to make high performance materials, and fibers are often incorporated into concrete to reduce cracking and improve impact resistance.  Fluids filled with short fibers are used as viscosity modifiers in many industries.  In the case of the petroleum industry, the fibers also serve as proppants that stabilize fractures within oil-bearing rocks.  For some processes, the presence of fibers can be detrimental.  For example, fibrous minerals often prevent the effective separation of mining products using flotation methods.\n\nEfficient design and operation of processes that utilize fiber suspensions would benefit from improved abilities to accurately characterize, predict, and control their flow.  However, most investigations into suspensions have studied the case of spherical particles suspended in viscous fluids, whereas fluids containing highly elongated particles such as rigid rods and fibers exhibit very different flow properties than suspensions composed of spheres.\n\nOur project addressed the specific case of suspensions containing a large concentration of rigid fibers.  At large concentrations, the rotation of each fiber due to an imposed flow is strongly hindered by collisions with surrounding fibers.  This insight allowed us to generate a relatively simple model that balances hydrodynamic drag on the particles with collisional forces that accurately prevent fibers from overlapping.  The model was validated successfully by comparing its predictions against experimental measurements of orientation distribution in shearing flow.  The model was used in conjunction with experiments to advance our ability to accurately characterize, predict, and control this important class of suspension materials.\n\nAmong the findings, we identified variables that influence the measurement of the suspension rheology (e.g., viscosity and other related properties) in unexpected ways.  For one, experiments confirmed that the center of mass distribution of fibers can become inhomogeneous during flow, whereas most measurement techniques and designs assume uniform distributions.  Also, the size of the testing container must be significantly larger than previous guidelines have indicated in order to accurately gauge the flow properties of fiber suspensions at the highest concentrations.  Beyond identifying issues with standard measurement approaches, we used a custom-built device to measure the viscosity of suspensions near the jamming point and developed correlations for the viscosity which are applicable to a wide range of particle concentrations and aspect ratios (ratio of fiber length to diameter).  Our research has also identified an intriguing method for controlling the orientation distribution in fiber suspensions by using an oscillatory, instead of steady, shearing flow by altering the confinement of the fibers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason E Butler"
