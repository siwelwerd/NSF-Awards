 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/ commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is in revolutionizing the current mechanical system design practice across multiple industry sectors. Rather than using multiple rigid parts to create a mechanical system, our compliant design method, inspired by designs in nature, exploits material elasticity to create one-piece compliant systems or joint-less mechanisms. Our compliant design software will provide designers with a powerful tool to create products with dramatic reductions in part count, thereby reducing manufacturing cost ( at times eliminating assembly operations altogether), enhancing reliability and precision in ways that could not be achieved through conventional design methods. By replacing assembly-intensive products with compliant designs that have substantially lower assembly burden, manufacturing in the U.S. could be more competitive. For example, our compliant wiper has 75% fewer parts, weighs 50% less, and costs 60% less to manufacture in Detroit compared to conventional multi-piece wiper that is made in China. Thus, technically skilled machine operators producing one-piece designs would create value locally, without the burden of shipping costs and delays, to tip business equation away from offshoring. Thus, broad adoption of compliant design as enabled by our software will lead to more \"Made-in-USA\" products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to develop a framework for Integrated Computer Aided Engineering software for compliant designs. While commercially available design software can assist users in evaluating conventional mechanisms with rigid links and joints, there is no readily available software tool on the market to create (synthesize) and optimize the design of compliant mechanical solutions. Compliant design synthesis algorithms seen in existing research literature often require specialized knowledge that \"non-\u00adexpert\" users might not have, and the algorithms are often not robust enough to consistently create feasible designs. In Phase I, we laid the theoretical and the computational foundation needed to develop a unified compliant design framework. Starting with functional design specifications such as desired motion output(s), and input actuator(s), the algorithms will (a) determine an optimum topology (i.e., how material should be distributed within a prescribed 2D or 3D space), and (b) optimize the size, shape and geometry to meet performance requirements such as fatigue life (stress constraints), manufacturing constraints and dynamic response. In the proposed Phase II effort, we will refine the user-\u00adinterface and extend the functionalities to integrate all key elements into a field-\u00adready commercial package that enables both expert and non-\u00adexpert designers to create compliant design solutions.",
