 "awd_abstract_narration": "The air-sea interface in high-wind situations, like hurricanes, is an important topic that crosses boundaries between atmospheric sciences and oceanography.  Sea spray droplets are known to affect the temperature and moisture distribution in the surface layer above the ocean, which in turn can affect associated atmospheric processes.  This award will provide an opportunity for a researcher and his students to work on numerical modeling of these processes using direct numerical simulation, which allows researchers to follow individual droplets as they move along in the wind.  The potential impact of this project is on improved prediction of tropical cyclones, but the numerical techniques developed could potentially have an impact across a variety of scientific disciplines.  The work would also contribute to the future scientific workforce through the training of a graduate student and undergraduate student.\r\n\r\nThe researcher plans to address the role of sea spray on the exchanges of heat, moisture, and momentum at the air-sea interface through a suite of numerical experiments.  The role of sea spray on these exchanges at high winds is uncertain due to the difficulty in making measurements in these conditions.  The researcher has developed a numerical technique to track individual Lagrangian droplets through a shear-driven turbulent flow, and two-way momentum coupling was enforced for each particle allowing for a direct calculation of the bulk moment flux modifications.  This project would extend that work by implementing two-way thermodynamic coupling between the droplets and the surrounding flow, allowing for a direct evaluation of spray's influence on latent and sensible heat flux and the resulting profiles of temperature and moisture.  The specific research questions to be answered include:  1) Do the vertical fluxes of sensible and latent heat (and enthalpy) in an environment laden with thermodynamically-coupled droplet particles exceed those of an unladen case? 2) To what degree is the flux of salinity into the ocean enhanced by droplet evaporation, and can this lead to enhanced mixing in the ocean boundary layer? 3) Do the mean profiles of heat and humidity change immediately above the air-sea interface? 4) What concentrations of water droplets are necessary to see any effects on heat and moisture fluxes? 5) What size distribution of spray droplets can be expected when in thermodynamic equilibrium immediately above the air-sea interface?",

Warming and acidification of the oceans is driven by this exchange, as are hurricane intensification and atmospheric rivers. However while it?s easy to simply point to the importance of the broad idea of ?air-sea interaction?, the details of how things like water vapor, trace gases, and thermal energy actually cross the boundary between the water and air are extremely complicated and are often difficult to predict accurately. One such example of this difficulty occurs within strong storms, where winds can be so large as to rip water droplets off the top of waves, producing huge amounts of sea spray which gets injected into the air. One line of thought suggests that all of these little water droplets suspended in the air can greatly enhance the amount of heat that goes from the ocean to the air (thus helping power storms like hurricanes), and create a feedback cycle: spray leads to more heat transferring from the ocean to the atmosphere, which creates higher winds, which creates more spray, and so on. While this may seem like a reasonable idea, the difficulties of making direct observations, such as flying low-level aircraft in storms, unfortunately preclude our ability to confirm this and other similar hypotheses using only measurements.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Thus the overall scientific objective of the project is to use high-resolution numerical simulations to investigate the basic behavior of the spray-laden, air-sea interface. The goal is to take the full problem in all of its complexity (e.g., near-surface winds inside a hurricane) and simplify it down to uncover the basic role of sea spray, and the degree to which things like the self-reinforcing cycle described above occur. This in turn allows us to develop and refine existing models in air-sea transfer which are used for forecasting weather and climate systems. Our high-resolution simulations are meant to act as a ?numerical laboratory?, probing conditions which are impossible to measure safely and and accurately, thereby better specifying the basic mechanisms which we must understand for accurate prediction. This general goal includes several specific technical aspects: (1) modifying an existing Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) to incorporate individually-tracked Lagrangian droplets which can evaporate and exchange both heat and momentum with the surrounding turbulent flow; (2) performing a carefully constructed series of idealized test cases to develop a broad understanding of both the magnitude and direction of thermodynamic flux modification due to the presence of droplets; (3) analyzing the data in order to answer specific questions regarding equilibrium droplet size distributions, and modifications to near-surface temperature and moisture profiles; (4) using these simulations to quantitatively evaluate existing bulk and stochastic models for spray transport and feedback.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Through a series of simulations, we have found that the feedback cycle described above is in reality much more limited than it may seem.

Enhancements in one often result in reductions of the other, and only under certain conditions, and for droplets of certain size, do the large enhancements of total heat (latent plus sensible) exist. The implications of this have been demonstrated by evaluating two so-called ?bulk models? -- models which are used to represent these effects in weather and climate models. Our findings show that both models incorrectly neglect key thermodynamic interactions between the droplets and the winds, and that one in particular grossly overestimates the amount of heat that spray can help deliver to the atmosphere.
