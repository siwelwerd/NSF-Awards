 "awd_abstract_narration": "David Reichman is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry division to develop new theoretical tools for the study of structure and dynamics in complex systems that are expected to exhibit novel and useful properties. The rational design of new materials with novel functionality is the ultimate goal of theoretical and computational chemistry. Two such examples are the development of a new framework to understand the relaxation of electrons and holes in organic semiconductors that will lead to improved light-emitting and photovoltaic devices and a new theory for understanding ultra-stable glasses that have demonstrated promise for drug delivery and the development of materials with tunable mechanical properties.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on two main projects. The first focuses on a computational means of treating quantum charge and energy transfer and non-equilibrium quantum transport in strongly interacting condense phase systems. The second focuses on the dynamics and the structure-dynamics relationship of glass-forming liquids. All phases of the proposal make use of approaches recently developed in the Reichman group, including the recent development of the real-time stochastic bold expansion for the calculation of out-of-equilibrium transport properties in correlated condensed phase systems, as well as a novel microscopic approach for the description of dynamical correlation functions in supercooled liquids and glasses.",

The creation of these technologies requires the creation of theoretical techniques for their rational design.  In this award (Dynamics and Transport in Strongly Interacting Condensed Phase Systems, NSF-CHE 1464802; 2015-2020), novel theoretical techniques have been developed to understand strongly interacting quantum systems with potential for impact in the development of novel technologies.  In particular, the advancement of the accurate and scalable auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo electronic structure method enabled by this award has opened the door to the detailed and accurate mechanistic study of catalytic and photo-catalytic processes, and to the development of improved battery and energy storage technologies.  The techniques developed herein to understand layered semiconducting materials may enable the development of new solar cells and sensors.  Lastly, the creation of a novel entanglement-based wavefunction technique to exactly simulate how environmental degrees of freedom dephase and localize electrons and excitons may lead to the advancement of quantum computing-based technologies.
