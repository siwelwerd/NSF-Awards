 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow and a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Adrienne B. Mora is \"Effects of parasites on predator-prey interactions in estuarine ecosystems.\" The host institution for this fellowship is University of California, Davis, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Andrew Sih.\r\n \r\nImportant ecological principles have been elucidated by studying interactions between predators and prey. Increasingly it is necessary to study not only their presence or absence and interactions but also behavioral effects on them and their shared ecosystem.  By definition, parasites are detrimental to their host organisms but, viewed on a larger scale, for example, the whole ecosystem in which they reside, their effects may be more complex and varied than previously thought.  The California killifish is an abundant, ecologically important fish found in Southern California estuaries and is naturally infected by parasitic worms.  When so infected, the killifish exhibit more \"conspicuous\" behaviors including swimming higher in the water, which may draw the attention of predators.  These behavioral changes are thought to influence transmission of the parasites to birds who are the final hosts, where the worm life cycle is completed.  It has been determined that infected killifish are 10 to 30 times more likely than uninfected killifish to be eaten by birds. The fellowship research investigates the novel hypothesis that, in addition to behavioral changes, parasitized killifish have increased energy demands and these combined effects may result in higher food consumption, stronger competition with other fish for prey, and higher predation rates by other major predators in the communities and estuaries.  Accordingly parasites may significantly impact estuarine ecosystems by changing the relationships between killifish and their prey, competitors, and predators.\r\n \r\nTraining goals include acquiring quantitative skills in statistical and digital video analysis, expertise in ecological theory, and career advancement skills including teaching experience in the General Ecology course after attending workshops at the UC Davis Center for Excellence in Teaching and Learning.  The plan to broaden participation includes serving as a role model and mentoring undergraduates from diverse backgrounds to apply for funding through one of several science programs at UC Davis so they can successfully execute a research project and present project results at a symposium and, if possible, a national conference. Research results are being incorporated into curriculum materials for outreach events at schools in underserved areas in Yolo County and exhibits for the general public at a local museum that teach concepts of food web ecology, animal behavior, and host-parasite relationships.",
