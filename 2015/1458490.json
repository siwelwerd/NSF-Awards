 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mount St. Mary's University MOSS Project (Mount Opportunities for Success in Science) will provide 14 scholarships for high-achieving, financially-needy students as they pursue a B.S. degree in Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, or Environmental Science.  Beyond scholarships, the project will include resources, support, and development opportunities designed to promote future success in STEM careers and graduate-level education.  As the project builds a community of learners, cultivates academic achievement, and provides professional development opportunities, MOSS Scholars will be empowered to take ownership of their social, academic, and professional lives. In particular the scholarship recipients will participate in peer mentoring; take part in an expanded college-orientation program; receive intensive faculty advising and goal setting; obtain individualized career counseling and mentoring by external STEM professionals; and participate in a shared service learning experience that will promote access to STEM for the next generation of students. The MOSS Project will also broaden the participation and success of underrepresented minority students in science, thereby increasing the size and diversity of the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe measureable outcomes of the MOSS Project are to: 1) recruit and financially support two sequential cohorts of seven students; 2) retain Scholars to sophomore year at a rate of 85% or higher; 3) attain a 4-year Scholar graduation rate of 70% or higher; 4) to see 100% of the Scholars complete an undergraduate research experience and present at a scientific conference; and 5) to help 100% of graduated Scholars be employed in STEM jobs or enrolled in STEM graduate programs within 12 months of graduation.  To achieve these outcomes, the MOSS Project will enhance existing structures and programs to build a community of learners, cultivate academic achievement, and provide professional development opportunities. As aspects of the MOSS project are made available to all MSMU Science students, overall retention rates, graduation rates, and post-graduate achievement in STEM should improve.  The project will also examine the effect of service-learning on student persistence in STEM and enhance the understanding of the role of mentoring (by peers, faculty, and external STEM professionals) in supporting STEM students.  As outcomes are disseminated among STEM educators, the MOSS Project will serve as a model for other institutions.  Assessment of the efficacy of the comprehensive, integrated, and ownership-focused approach of the MOSS Project will advance our understanding of effective strategies and expand the knowledge base for supporting student success in STEM.",

Assessment of the program's comprehensive, integrated, and ownership-focused approach emphasized effective strategies for supporting underrepresented minority (URM) and non-URM student success in STEM. Program activities were designed to reduce financial barriers, promote academic achievement, form a community of learners, and provide professional development opportunities. Scholars reported that these activities moderately or highly impacted their academic achievement and post-graduate STEM outcomes. Scholars reported a sense of identity and belonging within the STEM community, which was facilitated by authentic mentored research experiences and activities designed to build community. Scholars benefited from shared service experiences; shared learning experiences, including common sections of gateway courses and field trips to STEM job sites and graduate programs; shared faculty advisors and peer mentors; and monthly Scholar meetings addressing STEM workplace skills, culture, and ethics. Our findings have been shared with the STEM and diversity, equity, and inclusion communities through scholarly poster presentations at national conferences in 2021 (ASMCUE and NCORE).</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts. </strong>MSMU is making components of the MOSS Program available to more science students. An Integrated Living and Learning Community (ILLC) has been formed for first-year women students majoring in STEM; it includes a one-credit course that addresses topics covered in monthly MOSS Scholar meetings that support STEM success. Another ILLC for Students of Color in STEM, paired with a peer mentoring program, is also developing. The Science Department seeks to incorporate MOSS monthly meeting topics into a 5<sup>th</sup>-credit option for introductory biology and chemistry courses and is exploring implementation of the cohort model by assigning incoming students into cohorts with a shared advisor and peer mentor and common sections of gateway courses. MSMU has received funding for a new NSF S-STEM program, C<sub>3</sub>STEM, which collaborates with two regional community colleges to recruit and support STEM transfer students at MSMU. Post-transfer support includes MOSS components such as peer mentoring, monthly meetings, a professional development fund, and an emphasis on research experience. MOSS findings highlighted the importance of early, authentic research experiences and motivated two science faculty members to implement a course-based research experience that will provide 60-100 first-year Science students with authentic research experiences. We predict that these efforts to sustain and expand MOSS elements at MSMU will lead to improvements in overall retention rates, graduation rates, and post-graduate achievement in STEM. We offer the MOSS Program as a model for other institutions seeking to enhance STEM educational experiences and to broaden participation and success of URM and non-URM students in STEM.</p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes. </strong></p>\n<p><em>Objective 1: 50% URM representation. </em>The program supported two sequential cohorts of 50% URM representation until third year, when a URM Cohort 2 Scholar was dismissed from the program for failure to meet the required GPA threshold, following 2 semesters of probation and intensified advising/support. A non-URM student applicant replaced the dismissed student. Therefore, MOSS served 43% URM students, falling just shy of achieving the goal through the duration of the program.</p>\n<p><em>Objective 2: 85% 1<sup>st</sup>-2<sup>nd</sup> year retention. </em>All Scholars (n=14) were successfully retained to their sophomore year in majors eligible for the scholarship (biology, biochemistry, chemistry, and environmental science), surpassing our goal and the rates for the MSMU C'20 (76%) and C'21 (74%) cohorts.</p>\n<p><em>Objective 3: 70% graduation rate. </em>All Cohort 1 Scholars (n = 7) and 6 of 7 Cohort 2 Scholars graduated in four years. The 4-year graduation rate (13 of 14 [93%]) exceeded our goal and is higher than the MSMU C'20 (56%) and C'21 (49%) rates.</p>\n<p><em>Objective 4: 100% participation in research and presentation at a conference. </em>All Scholars (n=14) participated in undergraduate research, attaining the first part of our goal. Two of seven Cohort 1 students presented award-winning posters at a regional undergraduate research symposium in Fall 2019. Three other Cohort 1 students had planned presentations at conferences in Spring 2020 that were canceled due to COVID-19. All seven Cohort 2 Scholars presented research at a conference. In sum, 64% of the Scholars (9 of 14) presented at a conference, falling short of our goal. However, without COVID, 12 of 14 students (86%) would have met this goal. The two remaining students chose not to pursue careers in research.</p>\n<p><em>Objective 5. 100% of graduated Scholars placed in STEM within 12 months. </em>As of November 2021, 12 of the 13 graduated Scholars (92%) are placed in a STEM job or educational program. A Cohort 2 graduate, who graduated in May 2021, has yet to secure post-graduate placement in STEM. Final assessment of this goal will occur in May 2022.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kathryn&nbsp;Dye</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458490/1458490_10377016_1638224728383_MOSSGraphic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458490/1458490_10377016_1638224728383_MOSSGraphic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MOSS Program Summary Graphic\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458490/1458490_10377016_1638224728383_MOSSGraphic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MOSS Program Summary Graphic\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">MOSS Program Summary Graphic</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kathryn E Dye</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kathryn&nbsp;Dye</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">MOSS Program Summary Graphic</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458490/1458490_10377016_1638211128213_ProjectOutcomesPoster--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458490/1458490_10377016_1638211128213_ProjectOutcomesPoster--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Faculty Poster: Applying Lessons Learned from an S-STEM Scholar Program to Promote Successful Outcomes in a Diverse Population of Science Majors\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1458490/1458490_10377016_1638211128213_ProjectOutcomesPoster--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Faculty Poster: Applying Lessons Learned from an S-STEM Scholar Program to Promote Successful Outcomes in a Diverse Population of Science Majors\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Faculty Poster: Applying Lessons Learned from an S-STEM Scholar Program to Promote Successful Outcomes in a Diverse Population of Science Majors.
