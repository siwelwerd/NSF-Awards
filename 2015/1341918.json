 "awd_abstract_narration": "The coupling of the solar wind with Earth's magnetic field gives rise to a range of disturbance effects in Earth's near-space environment. Some of the most dramatic and technologically harmful aspects of this space weather occur in the ionosphere from mid-latitudes to the polar cap. The HF radar technique as implemented in the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) has demonstrated its value for making always-on, global-scale observations of ionospheric space weather and for advancing our understanding of the underlying geophysical processes. The participants in the international SuperDARN collaboration jointly operate networks in both the northern and southern hemispheres that now total 35 radars. Over the past five years the scope of SuperDARN has greatly increased with the NSF-sponsored construction of a mid-latitude chain of radars that spans the United States.  The collaboration on this award counts Virginia Tech as the lead-PI institution and Dartmouth College, University of Alaska Fairbanks, and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory as collaborating PI institutions. Significant benefits are expected from combining efforts and sharing expertise within this consortium that brings together, for the first time, all the NSF-funded SuperDARN groups within one organizational structure.  The award will ensure the continued operation of the 11 radars in North America that this group collectively is responsible for.  The US SuperDARN group also provides leadership of the international SuperDARN collaboration.  The radar measurements of the rapidly expanding SuperDARN network constitute a unique dataset that will support many important science investigations within a wide range of Geospace research areas.  In addition, the project will support the education and training of students and postdocs at all of the participating institutions as well as many others in a broad  variety of scientific, engineering, and team-building aspects of space science. \r\n\r\nSuperDARN utilizes coherent backscatter techniques to track the ExB drift of ionospheric plasma, and in its standard mode of operation, each radar measures the line-of-sight plasma velocity at 75 ranges along each of 16 beam directions covering an area of about 3500 km in range and about 56 degrees in azimuth. The radars operate continuously, 24 hours per day and 7 days per week and deliver images of the high-latitude convection pattern with a two-minute time resolution. The network of SuperDARN radars constitutes a unique global-scale instrument to observe and understand the system-level effects of solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and to study space weather in the ionosphere.  By providing direct measurements of convection velocities over large regions, SuperDARN provides the best means available to determine ionospheric convection patterns.  Through this award operations of the system will be secured for the next five years, including both routine maintenance as well as some necessary technical upgrades.  The measurements will be provided together with advanced and improved analysis tools to enable and facilitate research by the broader community to make major advances on a broad range of science questions at the forefront of ionospheric research.  Planned topics of investigations include: magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, improved models of storm-time ionospheric plasma convection, ionosphere-thermosphere interactions, magnetic conjugacy studies, and ionospheric plasma instabilities and irregularities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEarth's near-space environment is the seat of dynamic physical processes with harmful impacts on technology and humans in space that are collectively known as space weather.  In a manner analogous to the networks of radars that map aspects of terrestrial weather, a network of HF radars known as SuperDARN is applied to conduct research on space weather in the ionosphere and upper atmosphere.  A collaboration of four US universities, with Virginia Tech in the role of lead principal investigator (PI) institution, operates ten radars distributed over sites located in the US and Canada.  The data generated by these radars are pooled with contributions from partners in the international SuperDARN collaboration to provide comprehensive coverage at mid-to-high latitudes in both the northern and southern hemispheres.  A community of users in the US and abroad draw on the data and expertise of SuperDARN scientists.  This NSF award provided for the operation, maintenance, and utilization of five radars operated over four sites by the Virginia Tech SuperDARN group.  It also supported the processing of data for inclusion in the SuperDARN data stream and the generation of research products that were made available through a dedicated website.  Users were assisted by group members in accessing and utilizing the data, leading to many collaborations and coauthorships.  Group members also performed key roles in managing the US and international SuperDARN collaborations.  These included PI-ship of the U.S. SuperDARN collaboration, participation in the Executive Council of the international SuperDARN collaboration, and involvement with the Working Groups that coordinate critical functions such as common scheduling of the radars, development and distribution of key analysis and visualization software, and collaboration with satellite programs.  Both intellectual merit and broader impacts of this award are found in its support for maintaining and enhancing the Virginia Tech portion of the U.S. SuperDARN collaboration as critical research infrastructure for the study of space weather.\n\nAdditional intellectual merit is to be found in the original research that was enabled by this award.  Group members led on the development of important new research lines and experimental techniques, all of which have been reported in leading scientific journals (~40 publications by group members).  Here is a partial list of advances:\n\n-        The occurrence of Medium-Scale Travelling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs) was related to variations in the polar vortex, demonstrating that the lower atmosphere is a major driver of a phenomena that was previously attributed to space weather\n\n-        A highly functional statistical model of the high-speed ionospheric disturbance effect known as SAPS (Subauroral Polarization Stream) was derived from years of SuperDARN data and applied to show that SAPS occurs for non-storm as well as storm conditions\n\n-        A comprehensive study of ShortWave Fadeout (SWF) - the first space weather effect following a solar flare - was performed using radar and riometer data and applied to develop a first-principles model of ionospheric absorption that is superior to the model currently in use for space weather prediction\n\n-        Applying the radars of the mid-latitude chain located in the continental U.S., for the first time a detailed statistical model was derived of the pattern of plasma convection in the subauroral ionosphere. This showed strong seasonal factors and that the penetration of magnetospheric electric fields into the inner magnetosphere occurs even during quiet times\n\n-        A survey of high-frequency pulsations in the magnetosphere was performed with an archive of high resolution radar data that has established a basis for developing a deeper understanding of how these wave modes couple energy from the solar wind into Earth's space environment\n\n-        In collaboration with the SuperDARN group at Dartmouth College, the first bistatic radar observations were carried out between a SuperDARN radar in Kansas and one in Oregon, opening up the possibility of having many more paths available for remote sensing of the ionosphere\n\n-        In two research firsts, deep-learning models were developed, one to enable prediction of magnetic substorm onsets and the other to predict the occurrence and intensity of field-aligned currents in the high-latitude ionosphere\n\nThe Virginia Tech SuperDARN group is based in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering where it shares in the teaching and student training missions of the University.

This award has contributed directly to completion of 10 MSc degrees and 6 PhD degrees.  In addition, numerous undergraduate students have been given opportunities to participate in research and to learn about space weather.  All of the graduates supported by this award have progressed to higher-level teaching and research positions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/22/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J. Michael Ruohoniemi"
