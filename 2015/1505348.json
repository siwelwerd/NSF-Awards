 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support to STEM junior faculty at HBCUs who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who may have returned to the faculty ranks after holding an administrative post or who needs to redirect and rebuild a research program. Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Norfolk State University (NSU) will conduct research aimed at understanding how bacterial pathogens adapt to divergent hosts in a variety of environments. The project will help NSU build its research capacity and enhance the educational and research experiences of their undergraduate students. The project has the potential to be a model for increasing the number of minority students pursuing degree programs and careers in bioinformatics and computational biology. The research and educational efforts will contribute to the University's goal to establish itself as a regional and national leader in STEM research. \r\n\r\nThis study proposes to use S. parauberis as a model for studying \"environmental generalist\" bacteria, as it can survive in soil, water and in warm-blooded (homeothermic) and cold-blooded (poikilothermic) hosts. The goal of this project is to define how host environment impacts global gene expression in a model species of Streptococcus: S. parauberis. This will be accomplished by: 1) establishing the set of genes that are differentially expressed during growth of S. parauberis at temperatures mimicking a mammalian (bovine) host and in a fish host; and 2) establishing the set of genes that are differentially expressed during growth of S. parauberis in serum from a mammalian (bovine) host and from a fish host. This project could help determine the mechanisms by which Streptococcal bacteria adapt to their host environment and will contribute to our knowledge base regarding the basic cellular processes that support microbial survival. This work will be applicable in controlling microbial growth as well as understanding the emergence of Streptococcal pathogens in new hosts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBacteria are amongst the most capable organisms at adapting to their environment. From niches in or on the human or animal host, to the depths of the oceans, in deserts or alkaline pools, bacteria have adapted to them all. They do this in part by mutating or acquiring new genes. Next-generation sequencing has provided a wealth of data on the genomic resources available to bacteria to enable adaptation. Despite all this data, for many species it remains unclear how and when these genomic resources are used.  What specific changes in gene expression influence the ability of bacteria to survive in different environments?\n\nStreptococcus parauberis is an \"environmental generalist\" that can live in soil and water but that is of most concern when it infects fish and cattle.  Survival in such a wide range of environments requires it to respond to variations in temperature, pH, salinity, nutrient availability, immune factors, etc. Of these, temperature is particularly relevant since S. parauberis infects both homoeothermic (warm-blooded) and poikilothermic (cold-blooded) hosts. Also of interest when studying pathogens infecting such divergent hosts is their response to the host immune system. Although cattle and fish immune responses have significant differences, S. parauberis has demonstrated the ability to overcome both. Understanding how this bacterium adapts to these very different hosts can help us to understand how they emerge in new hosts, as well as provide clues for controlling their growth in a variety of environments.\n\nThe current project used RNA-Seq, differential gene expression analysis and gene orthology and functional analysis to investigate genes that are differentially expressed at different temperatures and in different host serum conditions (fish serum vs. fetal bovine serum).  The result is the production of four RNA-Seq datasets and seven publicly deposited genome sequences for an important aquaculture and dairy pathogen. Importantly, recent case studies have described infections in humans as well. \n\nFrom the list of hundreds of differentially expressed genes, the data highlight the fact that temperature has a significant impact on the expression of genes involved in metabolism, with an average of 24% of the differentially expressed genes assigned to this functional category.  In particular, the data indicate that the bacterium adapts by using different carbon sources when their growth conditions change.  This illustrates well their role as environmental generalists.  In response to temperature changes, S. parauberis expresses both heat shock and cold shock proteins, as hypothesized, although sometimes in unexpected ways.  There is also evidence of utilization of acid stress response genes. \n\nAn interesting cadre of genes is upregulated when S. parauberis is grown in the presence of fish serum.  These include cell wall synthesis and capsule genes, an M-like protein, heavy metal (copper and cadmium) efflux pump genes, complement C3b evasion gene, antibiotic resistance genes associated with beta lactam resistance and macrolide resistance and finally stress-induced fratricide genes.  All of these are identified as virulence genes in other bacterial species. \n\nWhen grown in the presence of fetal bovine serum, a condition mimicking infection in a bovine host, a different set of genes are upregulated.  These include genes for mercury and antibiotic resistance, at least two genes involved in cell wall synthesis, and several genes involved in competence.  Several ATP-binding cassette transporters that are involved in colonization by other Streptococcal pathogens and at least one biofilm formation stimulator gene also were upregulated in the presence of FBS.  Several genes related to host immunity evasion were upregulated including TatD involved in evasion of neutrophils and glpF1 involved in H2O2 efflux.  All if these are worthy of study for development of future vaccine strains of S. parauberis for use in the dairy industry.\n\nThe work by the PI and her students was communicated to the scientific community through 14 presentations at a variety of national and regional conferences.  Two peer-reviewed publications tangential to the funded project were published, with undergraduate first authors and co-authors.  Two collaborations were established between the PI\u2019s lab and researchers at Old Dominion University and Virginia Commonwealth University. \n\nIn addition to contributing to advancement of scientific knowledge, the broader impacts of this project included the professional development of an early career investigator (the PI) and the support of minority students in microbiology and bioinformatics.  Ten minority students were supported either financially or through mentored research opportunities.  Of these, one student began a career in commercial bioinformatics, one high school student was accepted on a full scholarship to William and Mary, and five students were accepted to either Master\u2019s or PhD programs in biomedical sciences. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/25/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ashley N Haines"
