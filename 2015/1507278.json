 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polarized light (light with directional vibrations whose effects can sometimes be seen in changes in attenuation while rotating polarizing sunglasses) is everywhere--it is in the blue sky, the reflection from a pond, in light scattering from natural and manmade airborne particles, and in the display screens on our smartphones. The understanding and use of polarized light is central to both the science of light and to applications ranging from medicine to consumer electronics. For example, some of the triumphs of the computer information revolution have been built around manufacturing technologies that require almost unimaginable precision in measurements--many of which are light-based and use the polarization of light in ways that can be precisely controlled and measured. The proposed research uses the concept of an \"unconventional polarization state\" - a special form of light in which the polarization varies across the width of a laser beam - to explore fundamentally new ways of carrying out light-based measurements.  In conjunction with some special optical devices, it is possible to use an ordinary camera to create a visual map of the polarization in a single image, something that ordinarily requires a sequence of four or more images and accompanying algorithms. These measurement methods will also spur new ways of thinking about how to execute the simultaneous measurement of sub-nanometer process errors in microelectronics manufacturing.\r\n\r\nThe multiple measurements required to characterize the polarization of an ultrafast laser pulse or individual photon require either a time-sequential operation or explicit division of the amplitude into different detector ports. While each of these has been used to good success, there is a need to truly extend polarization measurements in a way that the maximum amount of polarization information is extracted from each measured photon (in the case of low light levels) or each pulse (in the case of ultrafast pulse characterization).  Because the method is extendable to the mapping of polarization over a sampled image field, it is possible to extend the concept to capture either angle- or frequency-resolved polarization information in a single image. The investigation also applies the new physics of unconventional polarization states to the now-famous physics of weak measurements by using unconventionally polarized light to measure two or more physical quantities in a single measurement. This concept will be tested by measuring nanoscale features in a microscope equipped with a liquid crystal controller that defines a field with arbitrary polarization, amplitude, and phase for focused beam scatterometry. The work is expected to impact allied areas of physics (through the introduction of new measurement methods), optical engineering (specifically, polarization engineering and image formation), biomedical optics (in medical imaging and spectroscopy), environmental science (through the use of polarimetric light scattering for aerosol characterization), and semiconductor inspection.",
