 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Montgomery College in Rockville, Maryland will provide scholarships and support services to academically-talented students majoring in engineering and computer science who demonstrate financial need. The project will address the need for larger numbers of engineering and computer science professionals, as well as the need to increase the proportion of these professionals who are from groups underrepresented in these fields.\r\n\r\nMain goals of the Achieving Community College Excellence, Success and Scholarship (ACCESS) in Engineering and Computer Science S-STEM program at Montgomery College will include increasing the number of community college students who earn bachelor's degrees in engineering and computer science, and contributing to the development of a scalable engineering education model for students transitioning from community colleges to four-year institutions. Students will be recruited from high schools and college-level math and science courses, and selected based on academic potential demonstrated via cognitive and non-cognitive correlates of academic success. The five-year ACCESS project will provide 136 scholarships and support five cohorts of students by expanding on best practices and building on current practices involving high school outreach, intensive faculty and peer support, undergraduate research opportunities, transfer support, and strong articulation agreements and programmatic enhancements with select four-year engineering colleges. Throughout the project, its success will be evaluated via analyses of multiple data sources, including assessments of student support services, student skills development, and student responses to interview and focus group questions. The project is expected to contribute to understanding attributes and practices of successful student scholarship and support programs, such as integrated, inquiry-based instructional methodologies; student support systems; structured two-year/four-year program articulations; and transfer and career advising.",

The program is entitled Achieving Community College Excellence, Success and Scholarship (ACCESS II) in Engineering and Computer Science that utilized scholarship funding to support the educational pursuits of academically talented and financially needy students in engineering and computer science disciplines specially in gender and ethnic minority students. The program also provided students mentoring, tutoring, career preparation and networking, supplemental seminars, and internship opportunity.</p>\n<p>During the grant period (2015-2021), our program enrolled 119 ACCESS Scholars (22% Asians, 46% African American, 19% Hispanic and 13% White, among these students 29% are female) with scholarships averaging $3600 per year. There was some additional support of around $500 per year during the COVID-19 pandemic to students who faced financial difficulty. At the end of the grant period, at least 85 students graduated/transferred to 4-year schools and continued their undergraduate studies, 3 students switched to other scholarship programs, 2 switched to non-STEM majors, 7 continued at Montgomery College, and 6 dropped from the program due to academic requirements. Majority of ACCESS scholars transferred to rigorous, competitive STEM programs at the University of Maryland at College Park, University of Maryland Global Campus, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, and Clarkson University to continue their studies in engineering/computer science and related degrees. The average GPA of ACCESS Scholars is between 3.37 to 3.72 from beginning to the end of program. In comparison, from 2016 to 2020, the number of engineering degrees awarded at Montgomery College increased 22% and computer science degrees increased an amazing 127%. There is a significant increase of the enrollments of students studying in computer science and related areas from 860 in 2016 to 1241 in 2020.</p>\n<p>When ACCESS scholars joined the program, besides scholarship, faculty mentors are assigned to them and provide advising and guidance throughout their time. In the meantime, new scholars are required to take a specially designed one credit course that introduces the profession of engineering/computer science, guidance in studying the field, ethical responsibilities and hand-on/community service activities. Scholars also participate in workshops on resume writing, technical writing in STEM areas, developing presentation skills and understand group dynamics and teamwork. The bi-weekly seminars provided supplemental instruction, technical seminars from outside speakers and an introduction from faculty of 4-year engineering/computer science undergraduate programs that most scholars transfer to. Peer tutoring support is also available upon request when scholars fall behind in fundamental math and science classes. Scholars are also encouraged to apply for internship with full support from ACCESS PIs/ and mentors. There were more than 15 students that received National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) or National Institute of Health (NIH) internships, and 2 at the University of Maryland REU summer programs.</p>\n<p>The program also offers annual Alumni Panel discussion and seminar in the spring semester. At the event, 10 successful Montgomery College graduates (some are previous ACCESS scholar graduates) who majored in engineering or computer science and currently either work in industry or are pursuing advance degrees at prestigious four- year institutions shared their experiences with scholars and other STEM students. They discussed studying, internship experiences, community service, and encouraged students to broaden their views and set ambitious goals. They also provided some four-year school transfer information. Following the panel discussion and seminar, alumni guests and scholars were invited to a dinner where scholars and alumni had the opportunity to interact, forging deeper connections between the groups and building professional network. In 2021, Alumni Panel discussion was held through Zoom video conference for the first time because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
