 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow and a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Christopher A. Emerling is \"The genetics of extreme adaptations in anteaters, armadillos, sloths and other mammals\". The host institution for this fellowship is University of California, Berkeley, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Michael W. Nachman. \r\n\r\nAnteaters, armadillos and sloths (xenarthrans) represent a group of mammals that evolved from a common ancestor 65 million years ago in South America. The group as a whole is characterized by a variety of extreme features, including a major reduction in dentition, an inability to discern colors and see in bright light, and an incredibly low metabolism. Individually the three subgroups have bizarre adaptations as well, such as strict ant- and termite-eating in anteaters and upside-down locomotion in tree sloths. While together these and other traits demonstrate the strangeness of xenarthrans, many of these features have independently evolved in various groups of mammals. The presence of such extreme traits in different mammals provides the opportunity to test for the genetic basis of the evolution of anatomical and physiological features. This research involves sequencing the genomes of eight xenarthrans and making comparisons with published genome sequences from mammals with similar adaptations. In addition to their value in studies of evolution, armadillos have been valuable in the study of leprosy and Chagas disease in humans.  The xenarthrans as a group may also serve as model organisms for other health conditions such as those that affect the teeth (e.g., amelogenesis imperfecta) and vision (e.g., congenital achromatopsia). This research promises to identify candidate mutations that illuminate the evolutionary history but may also be used for diagnosis and/or treatment of these conditions.\r\n \r\nTraining goals include how to sequence and assemble genomes with cutting edge technology and other career advancement activities.  To broaden participation of groups under-represented in biology, the Fellow is mentoring students in the UC Berkeley Biology Scholars Program, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds; providing science career outreach at K-12 schools and community colleges with high enrollment of underrepresented minorities and low income students; and providing evolution outreach to the public through blogging (https://evolutionforskeptics.wordpress.com) and oral presentations.",

Thanks to the increasing cost-efficiency of DNA sequencing, assembling the genomes of rare and unusual species has become easier than ever. For my NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship: Broadening Participation in Biology, I sought to sequence and assemble the genomes of a group of organisms with particularly unusual traits: xenarthrans. Xenarthrans include the armored armadillos, the long-snouted ant-and-termite-eating specialist anteaters, and the slow, tree-dwelling, leaf-eating sloths. Scientists believe that these unusual mammals are each other's closest living relatives, with other mammals having independently evolved very similar adaptations, such as the ant-and-termite-eating pangolins and aardvarks, and the leaf-eating colobus monkeys and flying lemurs.

Furthermore, we found evidence that the ancestors of most mammals had five chitinase genes, pointing to an insect-based diet while these animals lived alongside the dinosaurs. But when dinosaurs went extinct 66 million years ago, many herbivorous and carnivorous mammal groups began to lose the genes, suggesting that they stopped eating insects when the dinosaurs disappeared.
