 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Encouraging Interdisciplinary Learning in Science, Math, and Computing\" project at the College of Saint Scholastica will advance STEM knowledge and understanding by piloting strategies to engage and support students at a private liberal arts college, with an emphasis on recruiting female, first-generation, and other underrepresented groups. Scholarships and targeted activities will help a cohort of academically talented students with demonstrated financial need achieve aspirations for STEM careers or graduate school, while also boosting the STEM workforce. The project's interdisciplinary focus will familiarize students with the dynamic nature of research and employment in STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nProject objectives include: 1) Increasing the recruitment of talented, financially needy students in STEM majors, with special encouragement to groups underrepresented in STEM; 2) Encouraging S-STEM Scholars to pursue undergraduate research experiences or internships; 3) Achieve 90% degree attainment in STEM fields among participants, through forming a strong peer group engaged in STEM mentoring, career preparation, and academic support activities; 4) Achieve 80% placement in STEM graduate programs or careers, with a focus on meeting regional and national workforce needs. The project will employ a broad base of research-proven methods to engage female and other underrepresented students, including: intrusive advising, pedagogy to reduce stereotype threat, promoting a growth mindset and active learning, peer mentoring, workshops, field trips, internships, and research experiences. Lessons learned and effective practices that emerge from the program evaluation data will be disseminated to the education community and help enlarge the knowledge base regarding attributes and practices of successful scholarship programs of this type.",
