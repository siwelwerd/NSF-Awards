 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cells actively change their shape during essential life processes, from cell division to migration.  Their ability to do so depends upon their mechanical properties and their ability to generate mechanical forces, which are mediated by the internal scaffolding of the cell (cytoskeleton).  Far from a static structure, the cytoskeleton is highly dynamic, as it is constantly assembled and disassembled, yet maintains the shape of the cell continuously.  Without precedent in modern engineering, little is known regarding how the internal dynamics of assembly and disassembly within this material impacts the mechanical properties of the material itself.  Nor is it understood how cells use this relationship to generate forces and change its shape, as occurs throughout its lifetime.  To explore these relationships, the research team will engineer simplified, non-living versions of cells where the internal dynamics of the cytoskeleton can be controlled precisely and its impact on mechanics and \"cell\" shape can be measured quantitatively.  In parallel, they will use computational simulation to uncover how the modulation of internal dynamics manifests in mechanical changes of the cytoskeleton, providing insight into the development of new biologically-inspired materials.\r\n\r\nThe F-actin cytoskeleton provides the structural and mechanical support that maintains cell shape and mediates force production during essential life processes including cell division and migration.  The F-actin cytoskeleton is also highly dynamic, constantly assembling and disassembling, renewing itself in minutes.  However, how the renewal of the F-actin cytoskeleton (turnover) impacts the time-dependent mechanical properties of the cell, and its capacity to generate mechanical forces is uncertain.  Also uncertain, is how these mechanical changes in the F-actin cytoskeleton regulate the dynamics of cell shape change.   Connecting the dynamics of F-actin turnover to the mechanical behaviors of the cell has been difficult because the biochemical factors that control turnover are regulated internally through complex and overlapping pathways.  To reduce this complexity, the research team plans to reproduce shape changes within simplified, biomimetic cells in vitro, engineered from purified proteins and lipids, whose biochemical composition is controlled precisely.  With this \"bottom-up\" approach, the complicating influence of biochemical and genetic regulation by living cells is eliminated, facilitating the determination of a quantitative relationship between F-actin turnover, and the resultant mechanical and morphological changes in the \"cell\".  In parallel, they plan to conduct computational simulations to determine the molecular mechanisms by which the kinetics of F-actin turnover influence cytoskeletal mechanics, force production, and the experimentally observed changes in cell shape.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe cell cytoskeleton is the mechanical scaffold for the cell, which governs cell shape change, as occurs during essential cellular behaviors, including cell migration and cell division.  To faciliate these changes in shape, the cytoskeleton generates strong mechanical forces, through the coordinated activity of several proteins within the cytoskeleton.  The principal proteins associated with this shape change include filamentous actin (F-actin) and myosin.  Actin is protein which polymerizes to assemble into filaments to form a dense polymer network beneath the cell membrane.  Myosin is 'motor' protein which can convert chemical energy into mechanical force by embedding into the F-actin network, binding to filaments and pulling.  As a result of these pulling forces, the entire cytoskeletal network can rearrange and change its shape and thus facilitate the physical behaviors of the cell.  Recent work however, indicates that the interactions between these two proteins are far more complex.  In addition to the ability to pull on F-actin, myosin may play roles in determining the assembly state of F-actin itself.  Thus, its effects are not only mechanical (eg. pulling) but also chemical (eg. disassembling).  Our interest in understanding these roles is if this indeed is the case, perhaps other proteins may be able to fullfill these roles, and therefore the ability to induce such shape chage is not specific to myosin.  Thus, the most fundamental properties of cell shape change may be more general and redundant, providing additional avenues to pursue to influence shape change in living cells, or design artificial materials based on these principles.\n\nAmong the redudant roles that we explored are the ability of myosin to bind to multiple filaments (crosslinking) and to induce diassembly (depolymerization) of the F-actin network.  Theory suggests that in combination, these two functions may be able to generate a contractile force.  Thus, we ask, are contractile forces entirely due to motor activity, or the combination of these other properties?  Thus, we created a model of the cytoskeleton in vitro, outside of the cell.  In it, we combine purified F-actin and myosin in a way that mimics the cell cytoskeleton.  We can then inhibit myosin motor behavior using a drug which prevents its ability to convert chemical energy,  leaving behind its other putative roles.  By shining blue light selectively onto the experimental assay, the myosin can be reactivated, restoring its motor activity.  In our manuscript by Linsmeier et. al., Nature Communications (2016), we show how contractility varies when light is switched from off to on, thereby activating motors.  Among the more major conclusions, is that contractility is very cooperative, in that it is nonlinear, and that it is telescopic - that the more active motors are present, the faster the contraction.\n\nOne of the most important physical structures inside of the cell is the cytokinetic ring, the array of cytoskeletal proteins which coordinates the constriction of the cell to split the cell into two.  Recent work has shown that the 'pulling' force of the myosin motors may not be essential to the constriction of the ring.  Thus, another goal of this grant is to understand the driving forces for contraction and constriction in the cytokinetic ring.  Thus, using our experimental assay, where light can be applied in spatial patterns to activate myosin, we can generate a contractile ring.  Indeed, we were able to show the proof of principle that a contractile ring could be generated, which is distinguished by the nature of the flows of the actomyosin network.  When a circle is illuminated (and myosin is activated in a circle) the actomyosin network flows radially inwards.  However, when a ring is illuminated, there are also orthogonal flows, in addition to radial flows.  Thus, we were able to glean fundamental and basic physical properties of the assembly and dynamics of contractile ring formation and constriction.\n\nOverall, this grant allowed us to develop an experimental platform where we could (1) test the influences of myosin motors are decouple some of their mechanisms and (2) develop approaches to control motor activity using light to understand how cellular structures are assembled and controlled.  Overall, we expect these results to be impactful in understanding the biophysics of cell shape change, as well as illustrate new principles of materials design.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Murrell"
