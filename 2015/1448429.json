 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is the enablement of new and improved therapeutic drug development.  One hurdle in the development of new drugs, is their relatively low effectiveness due to poor water solubility limiting formulation choices and/or limiting cellular uptake.  Forming drug nano particles, by way of controlling the drug crystal formation process, is one tool to overcome this low solubility hurdle.   Acoustical energy has been shown to aid in the formation of drug crystallization however, current acoustical technologies are not able to reliably achieve the crystal size and distribution needed for many new drug candidates.  A reliable method for nanoparticle drug production will allow better and more effective drugs to make it to market. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will develop equipment and processes that enable the continuous manufacture of drug nanoparticles by controlling the crystallization using a novel focused acoustical field.  Focused acoustics has the advantage of delivering a highly efficient, controllable, scalable energy field to the crystallization zone.  The project will demonstrate a focused acoustics nanocrystallization process capable of being developed into commercial grade equipment suitable for use in a continuous flow production pharmaceutical manufacturing environment.",

A number of design iterations/modifications to the hardware were made to allow reliable operation, and to improve processing performance.  Model drug compounds were tested in batch sizes of 130&micro;L up through and including continuous flow processing as high as 30mL/min.  Continuous flow operation was tested with run durations up to 10 hours at concentrations as high as 500mM of API, resulting in a production rate as high as 292mg/min.

The ability of the system to run at a range of production rates and conditions with several different model drugs demonstrates the versatility of the system as a technique for tight control of nucleation and crystal growth.\n\nAFA Particle size control\n\nAFA was shown to be able to control crystal size by simply changing the computer-controlled parameters of the system.  The results in Figure 2 demonstrate the ability of AFA-mediated crystallization to vary particle sizes in a controlled manner, from the low micron range to sub-200nm.\n\nThe scalability of AFA allows for the production of nanocrystals in a continuous process, which is valuable to the pharmaceutical industry as it allows for large-scale production of the desired API.
