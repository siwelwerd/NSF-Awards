 "awd_abstract_narration": "A non-technical description of the project that shows the project's importance and significance\r\n\r\nThe environment of rivers and streams is important to wildlife that lives in and around these flowing waters. The sediment that accumulates on the riverbed, and how this material moves, is a critical component of the ability of different species to survive or flourish. However, first-hand knowledge of the processes of sediment movement is very limited and difficult to obtain. This project will collect data on the movement of particles in a gravel-bed mountain stream in western Oregon that is a fundamental habitat for Coho salmon. Knowing how and when these gravels move will help develop strategies for preserving proper areas of the stream to encourage the spawning and foraging of these fish. This project will also apply innovative instrumental solutions to actively monitor the movement of gravel through embedded transponders that will help model river transport in other important locations. The development of the small-scale hydropower system used in this research may provide a reliable means for delivering power to instruments in remote locations where solar power is not practical. The project will work with managers and scientists from the Siuslaw National Forest (Oregon), who are actively engaged in stream restoration. The study will provide research projects for a graduate student and research experience for undergraduate research assistants.\r\n\t\r\nA technical description of the project\r\n\r\nThis project will develop instrumentation to make continuous measurements of sediment transport and flow, as well as measurements of detailed flow hydraulics, channel geometry, and major roughness elements, in order to develop empirical relationships predicting sediment transport in debris-laden mountain streams. A fixed antenna array will monitor movement of gravel embedded with passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags, and logging pressure transducers will monitor flow stage between antennas and, thus, water surface gradient at the antennas. Detailed characterization of flow hydraulics, channel topography, bed texture, and in-stream debris will round out the data necessary to characterize total boundary shear stress, form drag, and skin friction with empirical relationships. A small-scale hydropower system will sustainably power the antenna array at a site where clouds and topography limit sunshine during the rainy season. The field effort will be accomplished in a steep stream where large wood is placed to create shelter and floodplain inundation for foraging by native Coho salmon. Sustainable habitat improvements may hinge on reliable prediction of how sediment moves in the vicinity of large wood structures.",
