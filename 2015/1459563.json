 "awd_abstract_narration": "The stable isotopes of carbon can provide clues about the processes by which carbon moves through the earth system. Researchers at Georgia Institute of Technology will use carbon isotope and nutrient reconstructions in the upper ocean, in combination with existing atmospheric carbon isotope reconstructions from ice cores, to better understand why and how atmospheric carbon dioxide rose at the end of the last ice age. This work will help further the understanding of the controls and feedbacks on atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.  The possibility of reconstructing past surface ocean temperatures from the air-sea carbon isotope difference will also be explored.  \r\n\r\nThe investigators will assess whether the upper ocean carbon isotope changes seen over the deglaciation in the North Atlantic primarily reflect biological cycling or air sea exchange processes.  A detailed record of seawater cadmium (Cd, related to the nutrient phosphate in today's ocean) from Cd/Ca measurements in benthic foraminifera will be constructed.  These measurements will help to pinpoint what mechanism was responsible for the transition to a less efficient biological carbon pump over the deglaciation.  The investigators will also reconstruct the carbon isotopic composition of well equilibrated, low nutrient surface waters in the North Atlantic using carbon isotopic measurements on large planktonic foraminifera.  The carbon isotope ratio in these waters will reflect the changes in the atmospheric ratio and the temperature of equilibration, potentially providing information on past surface ocean temperature changes.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to the societal relevance of better understanding the relationship between carbon dioxide and climate, this grant will support the training of several students from under-represented groups.  The data will be made available to the community and will be contributed to an international effort to synthesize and interpret carbon isotope records over the deglaciation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant funded a study of the stable isotopic composition of carbon dissolved in seawater in the North Atlantic over the last 24,000 years.  The stable isotopes of carbon can provide clues about the processes by which carbon moves through the earth system.  In particular, we investigated the roles that ocean biology and sea surface temperature play over this time period.  We have demonstrated that air-sea gas exchange, and the temperature of this exchange has a very large impact on the carbon isotopes in both the surface ocean and intermediate depth waters.  This discovery may pave the way for sea surface temperature reconstructions based on the different between surface water carbon isotopes (reconstructed from shells of planktonic organisms) and the isotopic composition of atmospheric carbon dioxide (reconstructed from polar ice cores).  A large role for temperature in setting the carbon isotopic composition of seawater in the intermediate depth North Atlantic is supported by a new reconstruction of temperature and nutrients in the Florida Straits from the Li/Mg and Cd/Ca in benthic foraminifera over this time period. \n\nIn addition to meeting the originally stated objectives, this work also led to a better understanding of the timing of changes the large-scale surface to deep circulation of the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the impacts of these changes on the delivery of nutrients into the North Atlantic. It also led to an exploration of past seawater oxygen concentration which, like the carbon isotopes, is impacted by both ocean biology and temperature dependent air-sea partitioning.  This work has resulted in a better understanding of changes in ocean nutrient cycling in the intermediate depth Atlantic Ocean, and lends support to the idea that a more efficient utilization of nutrients in the high latitude oceans caused the lower atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations of the last ice age.\n\nOur results will be of broad interest to those who seek to understand the ocean\u2019s role in controlling atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations as well as those who are interested in the mechanisms for, and impact of, changes in Atlantic Ocean circulation.  The project also benefited from the contributions of and provided training opportunities to four students from groups under-represented in science (two graduate students, one undergraduate, and one high school student).  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jean Lynch-Stieglitz"
