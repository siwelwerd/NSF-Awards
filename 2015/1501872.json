 "awd_abstract_narration": "Georgia's largest export in 2013, at $6.75 Billion, was aerospace products and parts. Exports from this sector grew by 19.8% in that year alone. Historically, machine tool technology has always been a foundational underpinning of manufacturing and this is especially true in the aerospace industry. While there is a national shortage of workers available with multi-axis CNC skills, and industry's demand for them is continuing to increase, the advanced training required to produce them remains unavailable. Professional development for machine tool instructors will directly address this problem by building the capacity for industry-recognized training at technical colleges and 4-year institutions involved in the Coalition of Machine Tool Technology Programs of Georgia (COMP-GA).\r\n\r\nAthens Technical College (ATC) in conjunction with COMP-GA and Southern Polytechnic State University (SPSU) are creating a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) Advanced Multi-axis Programming (CAMP) certificate program, to enhance the quality of Georgia's machine tool technology programs. Machine tool instructors from majorly rural areas in Georgia are receiving formal training from the renowned Vincennes University (VU) in Indiana to help sharpen their expertise in the field. Instructors are learning how to set-up, program, and use advanced multi-axis CNC machines, to incorporate the industry-recognized certification in to their classroom curriculums. COMP-GA and SPSU are partnering with the Regional Advanced Machining Partnership (RAMP) and Central Maine Community College (CMCC) who are also NSF/ATE recipients currently developing an advanced machining certificate. The CAMP project is responding to industry needs for trained workers, and meeting the specific demands of the aerospace industry in Georgia. The CAMP project is disseminating knowledge among Georgia machine tool programs while providing a model for working with four-year institutions to determine best practices for technical education. Machine Tool educators are learning to sustain technical instruction and maintain relevancy in the field. The professional development activities are influencing curriculums designs, and participants are creating strong foundations and practices that are benefiting the workforce in Georgia. The partnership between COMP-GA and SPSU is increasing the participation of underrepresented groups, including women and minorities, as all students matriculating are accessing greater job opportunities with higher rates of pay.",

Evaluated 10 different multi-axis machining and programming projects for suitability as potential projects in the proposed CAMP curriculum for TCSG institutions.\n\n5.)   Provided COMP-GA instructors with guidance and expertise on developing a CAMP certificate for Georgia by creating an effective training and networking partnership with the Regional Advanced Machining Partnership (RAMP), an existing NSF/ATE project, which developed the CAMP training certificate curriculum now being used at CMCC. \n\n6.)
