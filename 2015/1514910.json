 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water waves are a fundamental subject of study in atmosphere and ocean science.  They have been investigated for hundreds of years, yet many of their most basic features remain poorly understood mathematically.  For instance, only very recently has significant progress been achieved in developing a rigorous existence theory for steady rotational water waves, that is, waves with vorticity in the bulk of the fluid.  These types of waves are ubiquitous in nature:  vorticity is generated by incoming currents, the wind blowing over the ocean, or the density stratification due to salinity.  A deeper understanding of the mathematics underlying these phenomena would have many scientific and practical applications.  For example, traveling waves in density-stratified water (internal waves) are a generic feature of coastal flows in the ocean; they are known to play a major role in driving the circulation of ocean.  Vorticity in air is likewise strongly connected to the process of wind generation of water waves, a topic of great importance to ocean and climate modeling as well as ocean engineering.  The investigator studies traveling waves in density-stratified water, traveling waves with localized vorticity, and the stability of several important classes of steady waves.  He also studies the question of whether stratified waves depend continuously on their density distribution.  This question has serious practical implications for how well layered-fluid models can reliably represent flows in the ocean. \r\n\r\n     The specific goals of this project are to (i) expand the existence theory for steady stratified waves and rotational traveling waves; (ii) develop new tools for studying the qualitative properties of internal waves; and (iii) ascertain the stability/instability of several important classes of steady waves.  The investigators and colleagues improve on the current existence theory for large-amplitude internal waves by allowing for a general velocity profile in the far field.  Concurrently, they study the question of whether stratified waves depend continuously on their density distribution.  Confirmation or denial of this fact has serious practical implications:  if it is not true, then there is an unbridgeable gap between continuously stratified fluids and the layered-fluid systems that are commonly used to model them.  Conversely, if the dependence is smooth, then the modulus of continuity gives bounds on the error arising from the layered approximation.  The investigator studies traveling waves with localized vorticity.  In earlier work, he and collaborators proved the existence of classes of traveling wave with compactly supported vorticity (including point vortices and vortex patches), but completely unexplored is the intermediate regime where the vorticity is localized but not compact.  This important regime is attacked using techniques from bifurcation theory and semi-linear elliptic theory on unbounded domains.  Using newly developed tools for determining stability/instability of bound states for non-canonical Hamiltonian systems, they also study the orbital stability of traveling waves with point vortices.  Lastly, the problem of wind generation of water waves is considered.  This entails studying the stability of small-amplitude steady waves in a two-fluid Euler system, which sheds light on the role of the air-sea interface in the transfer of energy from wind to water.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe results of this award resolved a number of longstanding physically important problems arising in mathematical fluid mechanics.  The main products and broader impact of these activities is summarized below.  It is worth emphasizing that special effort was made to formulate general theories so that, in the near future, the techniques developed over the course of the project can be readily applied to a much broader class of problems.\n\n  \nSeveral projects concerned density stratified water waves.  In the ocean, the presence of salinity causes the density of the water to be non-constant or heterogeneous.  Internal waves are one striking consequences of this phenomenon: it is well known that one can find waves traveling through the bulk of the water without changing their shape.  These can be titanically large according to field observation and play a crucial role in driving ocean circulation.  One of the primary accomplishments of this award was a rigorous proof of the existence of large-amplitude solitary stratified water waves.  Here solitary refers to the fact that the waves are spatially localized perturbations of a background current.  Progress required novel mathematical ideas as the problem is posed on an unbounded domain, which severely frustrated prior methodology.  For that reason, the argument was abstracted to furnish a general global bifurcation theoretic machinery that will be of use to researchers working in many related areas.\n\n\nIndeed, as a second application of these ideas, an existence theory was given for large-amplitude solitary water waves with discontinuous vorticity.  Vorticity refers to the instantaneous rotation imparted by the fluid velocity; in actual ocean waves, it results from density stratification, wind forcing, temperature gradients, or boundary layer effects.  Discontinuity in the vorticity physically corresponds to the scenario where a wave is propagating over a strong counter current.  This result brings new insights to the question of how a wave and mean current interact (nonlinearly).\n\n\nAnother set of projects investigated the existence, qualitative properties, and stability of water waves with localized vorticity.  Note that each of the generators of vorticity mentioned above may be confined to a compact region of space.  This suggests it is physically important to understand the features of waves having vorticity that is concentrated in the near field.  Mathematically, studying these types of waves required  new approaches, as they are structurally quite distinct from other rotational waves in the literature.  It was shown that, in many deep water regimes, no nontrivial solitary waves with sufficiently localized vorticity can exist.  Conversely, solitary water waves in finite-depth water exhibiting an exponentially localized vorticity distribution were constructed.  The latter result was achieved in part by adopting ideas first introduced in mathematical biology.\n\n\nA point vortex corresponds to the singular limit where the vorticity in the wave is concentrated at a single point (or a finite collection of points) in the bulk.  These have served as toy models in fluid mechanics for centuries, especially as a way to conceptualize vortex shedding.  Relatively recently, it was shown rigorously that it is possible to have traveling water waves with a submerged point vortex.  As part of this project, further qualitative properties of these waves were discovered, as well as a much more refined asymptotic description of their far field structure.  Even more significantly, it was proved that water waves with a submerged point vortex are orbitally stable, meaning that the shape of the wave is robust under small perturbations.  On the other hand, wave borne dipoles (consisting of two counter rotating point vortices) were shown to be orbitally unstable.  These results were achieved using a new general machinery for treating traveling waves in Hamiltonian systems in the presence of symmetry.\n\n\nThe main broader impact of this award was in supporting the training of graduate students.  Over the course of the project, three PhD students and a Master's student played key roles in advancing the research agenda. The results were communicated to the mathematical and scientific community through lectures at conferences, workshops, and seminars.  Finally, the results led to publications in leading mathematics journals.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/08/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Samuel P Walsh"
