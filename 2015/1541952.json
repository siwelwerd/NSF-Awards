 "awd_abstract_narration": "The field of Adaptive Optics has made tremendous advances in the last decade. For many years it was exclusively used for real-time correction of the effects of atmospheric turbulence in images produced by telescopes. Over the past few years, however, the application of Adaptive Optics has broadened with the technology. Nowadays, Adaptive Optics is not only employed in astronomical and vision science applications; but it is also used in microscopy, X-ray beam control, and line-of-site communication. The future generation of giant telescopes will rely on advanced Adaptive Optics, making this technology even more essential to the scientific enterprise. It is therefore particularly important to support interdisciplinary research in this promising area.\r\n\r\nThis award provides partial support for the 2015 Adaptive Optics Topical Meeting, to be held in Arlington, VA, between 7-11 June, 2015. The meeting will bring together experts working in the many disciplines that develop adaptive optics, including both academia and industry. The workshop is designed to encourage interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration, and to serve as an effective platform to educate students, future scientists and engineers in multidisciplinary fields. The meeting will permit the dissemination of recent technological developments and novel applications in the field, exchange and stimulate ideas, advance innovation in adaptive optics, and provide a showcase on control algorithms.",

Rogan, CEO, The Optical Society, USA\n\nResearch Conference Lead: Julian Christou, Ph.D., Large Binocular Telescope Observatory, USA\n\nSubmitting Institute: The Optical Society, 2010 Massachusetts Ave NW, Washington, DC 20036\n\n \n\nThe Optical Society (OSA) is a scientific society of over 19,000 members with an executive office in Washington, D.C. OSA is dedicated to increasing and diffusing the knowledge of optics in all its branches, pure and applied. The Society sponsors topical meetings on subjects in which many rapid advances are taking place so that contributors to the field may interchange ideas to their mutual benefit.  The Adaptive Optics: Methods, Analysis and Applications (AO) topical meeting is one of seven co-located topical meetings of the OSA Imaging and Applied Optics congress.  \n\n \n\nThe field of Adaptive Optics has made tremendous advances in the last decade.  For many years it was exclusively used for real-time correction of turbulence degraded upward-looking atmospheric turbulence. Over the last decade, the field has matured for applications to ophthalmology and vision science thanks largely to the NSF\u00c6s former STC \"The Center for Adaptive Optics\" which brought together the astronomical and vision science communities for AO technological development.   Over the past few years, the application of Adaptive Optics has broadened with the technology being applied not only to astronomical and vision science applications, but also for microscopy, x-ray beam control, horizontal path imaging, and line-of-site communication and has developed into a broad international discipline.  The future generation of astronomical ELTs will rely on advanced adaptive optics technology. Most of the disciplines covered by the meeting continue to be relevant to the mission of quite a few programs at NSF.\n\n \n\nThe technologies behind these applications are very similar ranging from the MeMS devices which are commonly used as wavefront correctors to wavefront sensing technology and the control algorithms required to send the correction to the wavefront correctors from the wavefront sensors.\n\n \n\nAO, organized by OSA, is the premier meeting in the interdisplinary applications of area adaptive optics, making it unique by comparison with the single application meetings. The attendance of non-upward atmospheric correction attendees has grown significantly in the last eight years enabling the unique interaction of the technologists from the different disciplines.  In addition, its co-location with similar OSA Topical meetings have permitted interaction between AO researchers, signal &amp; image processing researchers, laser technology and computational optics communities over the years. \n\n \n\nThe meeting offered a unique opportunity for the adaptive optics community to share the exciting state-of-the-art technological developments, stimulate new ideas, learn new challenges and directions, and explore/promote new collaborations. The meeting also offered an effective platform to educate our students, future scientists and engineers in multidisciplinary fields and facilitate them to develop skills of collaborating with people from different backgrounds. This means bringing students from diverse backgrounds ranging from astronomy to ophthalmology and giving them opportunities to be informed about other disciplines, and finding ways to convince students to break out of the discipline-specific boundaries in which they often find themselves.  \n\n \n\nFor additional information, please visit www.osa.org. \n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth Rogan"
