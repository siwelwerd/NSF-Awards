 "awd_abstract_narration": "1505795(Koch)\r\n\r\nThe focus of the proposed research is to study particle transport phenomena that occur during cross-flow filtration of suspensions. In addition to development of fundamental understanding of these phenomena, the objective is to aid the development of a so-called sieve-free filtration system. While the proposed work is highly fundamental, engineering applications are its motivation.\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to conduct a combined theoretical/numerical/experimental study of particle separation in crossflow. The motivation for this study is to improve practices in cross-flow filtration - a high throughput method of separating particles (including cells or macromolecules) from a fluid and from smaller sized particles.  In conventional operation, the separation is accomplished by sieving through a membrane with a small pore size. The PI argues, and the panel agreed that this is worth exploring, that an operation in which the separation is accomplished using particulate hydrodynamic transport processes rather than membrane exclusion would have the advantages of decreasing membrane fouling and improving the selectivity of the separation. Because of the high shear rates accessible in cross-flow filtration, inertial lift can keep the particles away from the coarse non-sieving membrane. In addition, a new sieve-free separation mechanism based on the ratcheting of particle trajectories at the rough surface of the membrane due to excluded volume interactions of the particle with the membrane will be investigated. The goal is to develop a predictive model for lift-based cross-flow, allowing separation based on shape as well as size and identifying the maximum filtration flux and particle concentration at which particles can be retained. This mechanism can lead to sieve-free separations of nanoparticles or proteins which are too small to separate based on hydrodynamic lift. The models developed will be tested and the reliability of sieve-free filtration demonstrated by experimental measurements of separation of micro- and nano-particles of well controlled size and shape in a Couette cell filter. In addition to graduate education, plans to reach out to K-12 students and by an experimental  demonstration to  be used in activities at the local children's museum and the Ithaca Science Center are laid out.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n            Cross-flow filtration is a high throughput method of separating particles (including cells or macromolecules) from a fluid permeate and from smaller sized particles.  The solution containing the particles flows through a porous channel while a small flux of fluid filtrate is drawn across the porous channel wall.  In conventional operation, the separation is accomplished by sieving through a membrane with a small pore size.  In contrast, this project investigated sieve-free cross-flow filtration in which transport processes maintain the particles in the channel while the membrane pores are larger than particles.  This mode of operation has the potential advantages of decreasing membrane fouling and improving the selectivity of the separation.\n\n            Hydrodynamic lift, a motion of particles away from the channel wall caused by the inertia of the fluid and the fluid-mediated interaction of the particle with the wall can be exploited to separate large particles from smaller particles and the fluid in cross-flow filtration.  The high flow rates in cross-flow filtration, resulting in velocity gradients of 104 to 106 s-1, can make inertia significant even for micron-size particles.  Equations describing the transport of spherical particles within the channel were solved numerically to determine the particle concentration profile within the channel and the transmission ratio, defined as the ratio of the fraction of particles to the fraction of fluid transmitted through the membrane.  In a laminar flow at low particle concentration, the particles are focused at a single distance from the wall where the hydrodynamic lift velocity balances the permeate velocity.  In this case, the transmission ratio transitions abruptly from one to zero above a critical velocity gradient where the lift velocity at the wall balances the permeate velocity.  In most cases, the channel flow rates needed to yield high velocity gradients entail a turbulent flow in the channel.  Turbulent dispersion then results in a more diffuse particle concentration profile in the channel and a more gradual transition in the transmission ratio.  At higher particle concentrations, interactions between the particles also lead to a dispersive motion of the particles that is referred to as hydrodynamic diffusion.  Hydrodynamic diffusion retards the efficiency of the separation process as the particle concentration within the channel is increased.  These simulations provide guidance on the conditions that would lead to successful sieve-free cross-flow separations for an ideal system of spherical particles whose particle interactions are purely hydrodynamic.\n\n            An experimental demonstration of sieve-free cross flow filtration was achieved in a Couette cell, consisting of two concentric cylinders with a rotating cylindrical membrane serving as the inner cylinder.  Very dilute suspensions of spherical, polystyrene spheres were introduced slowly within the gap between the cylinders so that the velocity gradients could be controlled by adjusting the cylinder rotation rate.  In laminar flow operations, the transmission ratio of 5 micron radius spheres decreased abruptly to zero at a critical velocity gradient consistent with theoretical predictions for the hydrodynamic lift velocity.  At the higher velocity gradients required to generate sufficient lift to separate 0.5 micron radius spheres, the flow in the Couette gap was turbulent and the resulting dispersion led to a more gradual transition in the transmission ratio.\n\n            To facilitate lift-based separations of particles in cross-flow filtration or microfluidic channel flows, it is desirable to gain insight into the dependence of hydrodynamic lift on particle shape.  To this end, a calculation was performed to determine the lift of a slender fiber in a shearing flow near a wall.  The lift was found to have a strong dependence on the aspect (length-to-diameter) ratio of the particle.  This dependence arose because thin fibers remain aligned with the streamlines of the flow for a time that increases in proportion to the aspect ratio, while the motion away from the wall occurred primary when the fiber occasionally rotated away from this alignment.  Fibers close enough to make direct collisions with the wall move away from the wall more rapidly through a mechanism involving coupling of the solid-body fiber-wall collisions and the fluid inertia induced by the fiber?s rotation.  An understanding of the dependence of lift on particle shape facilitates separation of particles with equal values of the largest axis but different aspect ratios as higher aspect ratio particles experience less hydrodynamic lift and would be more readily transmitted with the fluid permeate.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/05/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donald L Koch"
