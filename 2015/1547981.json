The conference will focus on the special challenges scientists and engineers face in the design and analysis of multiphase chemical reactors, which are essential elements in many chemical processes.  The conference, which is part of a series that started in 1992, is an important platform for U.S. researchers to exchange results and findings with their U.S. and international colleagues. This particular event in the series will emphasize multiphase reaction engineering in water and sustainable energy technologies.\r\n\r\nThe Gas-Liquid-Solid Reactor Engineering conference series focuses on all aspects of fundamentals and engineering of multiphase reactors and processes.  Topics that will be covered in the 12th International Conference include multiphase fluid dynamics in chemical reactors, interfacial engineering, gas-liquid and gas-liquid-solid transport, measurement and flow visualization techniques, microreactor systems, and applications in biotechnology, energy, water and environmental systems. In addition to plenary lectures and topical sessions, the conference will organize site visits to nearby chemical plants and research facilities, which will provide graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with an opportunity to see multiphase systems in industrial research and practice.",
