 "awd_abstract_narration": "Evidence that a chemical reaction has taken place often includes observable phenomena such as changes in color or temperature, the appearance or disappearance of materials or the formation of bubbles in a liquid. Students of chemistry must explain these observations in terms of concepts that necessitate the use of invisible particles such as atoms, ions and molecules. When students encounter challenges to perceive or visualize in their minds the interactions that take place between these unseen particles, learning can be hindered, and students can become discouraged. This project will conduct research on effective strategies to develop and present visualizations that support student learning in General Chemistry. Students will view videos of chemical reactions that exhibit obvious signs of chemical change. This will immediately be followed by watching two animations that provide explanations at the particle level of the reaction in the video. One animation will present a correct description, while the other will contain intentional errors, and students will be asked to analyze and resolve the differences. Ultimately, they will be asked to reflect on the accuracy of each animation. This use of structured errors will facilitate the acquisition of knowledge with regard to student conceptual understanding and analytical reasoning of foundational chemical principles. The understanding and insights revealed through this endeavor, regarding how visualizations can enhance student success, will be of significant value to educators across a wide range of scientific disciplines, from biology, to earth sciences, to physics and more. \r\n\r\nThis visualization framework of videos with companion animations that employ structured errors will challenge students to reflect deeply on their understanding of three fundamental types of chemical reactions: oxidation-reduction, precipitation and acid-base neutralization reactions. Several studies will be undertaken to investigate how students respond to the video of experimental evidence and the animations in variance to each other. Novel eye-tracking studies will be done to examine how the viewing patterns of participants are affected by focusing exercises that students do in connection to their reflection on the visual components of the framework. The eye-tracking research will then be compared to studies that examine how the animations in variance affect the understanding the students demonstrate of the chemical reactions, and how students connect with the animation models in relation to the experimental evidence to revise and construct their understanding. Finally, naturalistic studies will also be conducted to examine how students respond to the tools in the authentic classroom learning environment. Assessment of project products and milestones will employ both a team of advisors with areas of expertise that span the range of research emphases in the project and an external evaluator proficient in the development of visualizations to provide independent perspective of the quality of the videos and animations and their impacts on student learning.",

Students of chemistry must explain these observations in terms of concepts that necessitate the use of invisible particles such as atoms, ions, and molecules. When students encounter challenges to perceive or visualize in their minds the interactions that take place between these unseen particles, learning can be hindered, and students can become discouraged. The intellectual merit of our study is that we conducted research on effective strategies to develop and present visualizations (videos and animations) that support student learning in General Chemistry. We constructed videos of three types of reactions (precipitation, reduction-oxidation, and acid-base neutralization) exhibiting obvious signs of chemical change. We also modeled the videos after social media cooking videos working to capture key features in the experiments with sped up footage of routine tasks such as stirring and dissolving. We also set the videos to music. Next, we constructed three animations per reaction event to provide explanations at the particle level of the central reactions in the videos. One animation was designed to present a correct description, while the other two animations contained intentional errors. We constructed these contrasting and conflicting animations to task students with analyzing the differences between the animations to select the animation that was most scientifically accurate. In total, we made nine atomic level animation and three videos that are available free of charge on YouTube.</span></p>\n<p><span>In order to study how students learned from the videos and animations, we controlled the conditions under which students viewed the videos. First, we asked students to describe how they thought about the atomic level of the reactions. We had them construct reaction models using magnetic pieces modeled after the atomic species in the animations or we asked students to compare picture cards of the reactants and products to select the cards that they felt best represented the atomic nature of the reactions. Upon completing the modeling exercise and card sort tasks, students were asked to compare the animations to the model they constructed and to each other. They were also asked to judge the accuracy of the animation components. Our findings from these studies revealed that students activated and coordinated knowledge resources from their past learning or experiences to think about the atomic level. Sometimes students shifted between their knowledge resources as they struggled to make sense of the conflicting animations, and sometimes they misapplied resources to make their selection. When students did not see an animation that fit with their model of the reaction it caused them to doubt their understanding.

Our visualizations serve as a valuable resource for chemistry instructors as they are very easy to embed in learning management systems and through zoom conferences. The videos and animations were created as separate entities that afford instructors flexibility in how they decide to use them. We believe that presenting students with contrasting animations to foster comparisons and make a selection is a worthwhile endeavor. It can be quite social in nature as students compare the animations and work together to make their selection. We caution that students, just like well-trained scientists, will make good and poor decisions as they apply and misapply knowledge resources to make their comparisons. However, many exciting possibilities can result from this social endeavor into model comparison, including teaching students the importance of developing ways, such as inquiry investigations and experiments, to explore lingering questions and doubts about the contrasting models. We hope through using our tools that you find ways to enhance your pedagogy and empower your students to try out their own ideas as they compare and select the animation that best explains a chemical reaction experiment.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/15/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Resa&nbsp;M&nbsp;Kelly</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
