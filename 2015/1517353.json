 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although scientists know a great deal about galaxies in the Universe, less is known about the gas that surrounds them all and especially about the interplay between this reservoir of material and the visually stunning regions so familiar from telescope images.  This truly unique study covers an enormous range in physical scale, from the smallest observable clouds to clusters of galaxies, to show the real dynamical interaction between the visible galaxies and their surroundings.  Junior researchers and students will learn how to run and to interpret state-of-the-art numerical simulations, and how to carry out data mining on existing observation archives.\r\n\r\nThe circum-galactic medium (CGM) is the diffuse gas surrounding galaxies that acts as a fuel tank, waste dump, and recycling center.  Recent discoveries show that the CGM is dynamic, rapidly evolving, has significant mass, and plays a key role in determining the mass, shape, and star-forming properties of galaxies.  This project applies a new combination of data with models to examine the role of the CGM in galaxy evolution over seven orders of magnitude in physical scale, which is required to truly understand its conditions and kinematics.  The data will be mined from existing archives, and the models will come from a suite of state-of-the-art numerical simulations.  The rigorous comparison will use a toolkit developed by this team to produce mock datasets from simulations, which can then be analyzed in concert with the real data.  This work should solve several puzzles: 1) although abundant in chemical elements, the dense CGM is not as well-mixed as predicted; 2) galaxies have massive reservoirs of metal-rich gas that should have an extremely short cooling time; 3) the cool CGM is too diffuse to be in pressure equilibrium with a hot galactic corona; and 4) there is just as much cool, neutral gas in the CGM of passive galaxies as in that of star-forming galaxies, so that this gas can be neither fuel for, nor a by-product of, star formation.  This understanding can only be gained by a breakthrough in understanding physics at the scales of the smallest individual clouds that observations can detect, which is not possible except by using multi-scale simulations rigorously coupled to data.  The study will reveal the physical state of CGM gas, constrain the timescales over which CGM clouds evolve, and determine the mass flow rates and total masses moving in and out of galaxies.\r\n\r\nThese results will be the focus of outreach talks by all team members to the diverse communities in the areas around the different institutions involved.  The project will involve junior scientists in front line research, especially targeting under-represented students, and contributing to mentoring skills amongst the intermediate-level researchers.  It will also support development of a new planetarium show that includes visualized hydro-dynamical simulations of the gas in galaxies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThis award created the Figuring Out Gas and Galaxies In Enzo (FOGGIE) collaboration.  The primary goal of the FOGGIE program is to link state of the art multi-scale simulations to observational data obtained from the ground and in space to explore the role that the circumgalactic medium (CGM) plays in the formation and evolution of galaxies.  As part of this work we produced multi-scale cosmological simulations, synthetic quasar absorption line spectra and synthetic nebular emission from those simulations, as well as data analysis tools to study them.  The observational component of this project built a large database of CGM spectra from the Keck Observatory Archives, made publicly available after uniform reduction. The two data releases of this KODIAQ survey provided data that have been used by researchers around the world.  The observational data were analyzed in concert with the synthetic observations from simulations to derive new insights into galaxy behavior.\n\n \nIntellectual merits:  The creation of synthetic observations of Milky Way-like galaxies has made significant contributions to our observations of both our own galaxy and others.  We learned that commonly used absorption lines in quasar spectra provide only weak constraints on the physical structure of the gas that creates them, but can be used to infer some quantities of absorption systems that are critical to probing galaxy evolution.  Emission from z ~ 3 galaxies by Integral Field Unit (IFU) spectrographs can be used to detect filaments and knots in these galaxies, and can inform our understanding of the bulk kinematics of the CGM gas.  We investigated observational biases in the use of quasar absorption line spectra in investigating the Milky Way\u2019s CGM, showing that the choice of reference frame is crucial and that not all of the commonly-used ions are sensitive observational probes, but that these challenges can be corrected using simulations.  Finally, we demonstrated that the complex structure of a galaxy\u2019s circumgalactic gas can substantially impact the evolution of its dwarf satellite galaxies as they orbit the more massive central galaxy, primarily through stochastic and impulsive events with high ram pressure that are not captured by typical analytic models that assume a smooth CGM. The KODIAQ data were used to demonstrate that gas with very low metal content is still present in large quantities over the most recent 8 billion years of the Universe, including in the halos of the most massive galaxies.  The KODIAQ data were also applied to map the build up of the metal and dust content of galaxies  over 10 billion years of  cosmic time.\n\n \nBroader impacts:  The scientific results obtained in this project were the focus of outreach talks by all team members to the diverse communities in the areas around the different institutions involved in Baltimore, East Lansing, and South Bend (and in the development of sill and video images of the cosmological simulations, which are also available on the project website - foggie.science).

In addition, this project included an emphasis on collaborative research between scientists at different career stages, contributing to the development of mentoring skills amongst the intermediate-level researchers. The database of fully-reduced spectra disseminated to the community has been used in more than 30 peer-reviewed publications to date.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jay C Howk"
