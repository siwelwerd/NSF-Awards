 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract\r\n\r\nSuperfluidity in liquid helium has fascinated condensed matter physicists for a century and remains a topic of great interest even today. This behavior is an example of a macroscopic quantum effect similar to the superconducting behavior that occurs in some materials.  In liquid helium this macroscopic quantum behavior manifests itself in many fascinating ways one of which is the disappearance of the viscosity exhibited by normal liquids.  This leads to many interesting phenomena such as the appearance of long lived quantum vortex lines.  This project will make use of the newly developed x-ray free electron laser at the Linac Coherent Light Source to explore the hydrodynamics of feely suspended helium droplets.  The new insights this research will produce will help in our understanding of the effects of vortices on systems ranging from superconductors to neutron stars.  In addition, the tools that will be developed during this project will be of great benefit to materials scientists developing new nanomaterials.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nThis project will explore quantum rotation in 4-He droplets to bring new physical insights into quantum hydrodynamics at the meso-scale. In particular, this study will: (i) contribute to the description of rotating quantum droplets across the available angular momentum - angular velocity phase space and determine if the rotating superfluid and classical droplets belong to the same families of shapes; (ii) provide stationary shapes and configurations of vortices (N = 1-200) in a droplet, which remain unstudied experimentally or theoretically; (iii) reveal the effect of vortex mass on their dynamics by studying vortices decorated with Xe clusters; and (iv) elucidate quantum rotation at extreme vorticity, up to a factor of about 100000 higher than attained in bulk experiments, providing access to unexplored regimes of rotational excitation in quantum liquids. Single-shot femtosecond X-ray coherent diffractive imaging at the Linac Coherent Light Source free electron laser coupled with new image reconstruction algorithms will be used to reconstruct real space images of the shape of the droplets and the location of vortices within the droplet.",
