 "awd_abstract_narration": "As passive tagging technologies like RFID become more economical and ubiquitous, it can be envisioned that in the future, millions of sensors integrated with these tags could become an integral part of the next generation of smart infrastructure and the overall concept of internet-of-things. As a result, securing these passive assets against data theft and counterfeiting would become a priority, reinforcing the importance of the proposed dynamic authentication techniques. This research project investigates dynamic hardware-software authentication techniques on passive RFID sensors and tags based on zero-power timing and synchronization circuits. \r\n\r\nThis project explores dynamic anti-counterfeiting and hardware assurance techniques based on zero-power timers. The operation of these timers are based on physics of quantum-mechanical tunneling of electron transport through the oxide layer and through synthetically introduced oxide-traps. The hardware-software authentication strategies being explored include: (1) Born-on-Date timing strategy where the response of the timers will be synchronized across different trusted RFID sensors/tags and any deviation from an expected response will be used to isolate counterfeits, (2) Tamper-sensitive timing strategy where the timer are used to detect any snooping or tampering of the trusted RFID sensors/tags, and (3) Dynamic authentication strategy where the timers are used to generate hashing functions that will be difficult to reverse engineer. The project develops a cross-disciplinary educational forum between the electrical engineers and computer scientists in the area of hardware-software trust verification.",

This is because these IoT platforms have: (a) limited computational bandwidth; (b) limited availability of energy; and (c) requirements on real-time authentication. Also, authentication on these IoT platforms involve the use of static identifiers, for example bar-codes, product IDs, embedded physical unclonable functions (PUFs) or stored private keys. The static nature of these tokens makes them vulnerable to theft, counterfeiting, replay attacks or tampering. In this projet we proposed and demonstrated a hardware-software approach that could be used to implement a SecureID type dynamic authentication protocol on passive, low-resource IoTs. The approach used the zero-power timer technology for time-keeping and for distributed synchronization without the need for any external powering (using batteries or energy-scavenging). Rapid trust verification and authentication is achieved by comparing the synchronized tokens (example random num-bers in the case of SecureID type approach), generated by the IoT and a remote server, as shown. The absence of any external powering for token generation on the IoTs en-sures that the dynamic tokens are secure against any power side-channel attacks.&nbsp;However, the success of this hardware-software authentication approach relies on three key attributes of the zero-power timer: (a) the ability of the timers to continuously operate over a long period of time (at least 2-3 years) without any external powering; (b) the ability of the timers to be accurately synchronized with respect to each other; and (c) an accurate be-havioral model that can be used for implementing the ?gold-standard? software timer on the authentication server, as illustrated in the Figure.&nbsp;In this project, we proposed and demonstrated a self-powered Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling-based time-keeping device whose response was demonstrated to be robust to fabrication mismatch and whose synchro-nization error was shown to be less than 0.5% over 100 hours.
