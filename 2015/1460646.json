 "awd_abstract_narration": "This travel grant supports the participation of U.S.-based students in the 2015 Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS) Summer School in Probability, to be held at McGill University in Montreal, June 15- July 11, 2015. The school is devoted to training of doctoral students in the area of probability. It anticipates some participation of advanced undergraduate students, recent Ph.D.s, and also some regular faculty. The PIMS Summer School 2015 is a fantastic opportunity for graduate students and junior researchers to learn about some of the most active research areas in modern probability theory from  top experts in the field. The junior participants are often current and future academic faculty, able to spread the knowledge of these fundamental techniques further in the research community. The PIMS probability summer schools, launched in 2004, play an outstanding role in the development of an exceptionally strong community of probabilists in North America and have a proven track record of fostering long term collaborations between the participants. \r\n\r\nThe participants will learn current techniques in some of the most active areas of probability theory, including random matrix theory and its connection to free probability and enumeration of maps, high dimensional percolation and scaling exponents near criticality, continuum scaling limits of critical random structures and their connection to probabilistic combinatorial optimization and dynamic models of diffusion on random networks as well as stabilization of partial differential equations via the addition of randomness. It is expected that the participants will engage in active research on some topics covered by the main courses and related areas.\r\n\r\nA complete description of the conference can be found at:\r\n\r\nhttp://problab.ca/ssprob2015/index.php",
