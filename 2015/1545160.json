 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genetic information inside the cell is managed by proteins known as transcription factors, which are essential to life. 'ETS' (short for E-26) is a family of related transcription factors found in all multi-celled animals and they participate in a wide range of biological functions in the cell. To perform their functions, ETS proteins must interact with DNA at specific sites identified by the sequence of four chemical constituents in DNA (A, C, G, and T). This research will investigate how ETS proteins recognize their target DNA sites, and in turn inform the broader process by which cells develop and adapt to their biological environment. Knowledge from this project will serve as the basis for training several graduate and undergraduate students, as well as for developing curricular material at Washington State University and Georgia State University. The particular demographics of these institutions stand to benefit significantly from NSF support in STEM disciplines in general and biophysical science in particular.\r\n\r\nThe ETS family of transcription factors is ubiquitous in animals (the Metazoa) and regulates the transcription of large networks of genes. Their biological functions depend on site-specific DNA recognition as determined by a structurally conserved DNA-binding domain (known as the ETS domain). Although ETS domains share strong structural conservation, their amino acid sequences are also highly divergent. Preliminary data on PU.1 and Ets-1, two ETS members that represent the extremes of primary sequence divergence, indicate that this diversity encodes distinctive differences in DNA recognition by ETS members. This project is aimed at delineating the mechanisms of sequence recognition utilized by ETS proteins through the kinetics and coupling of the thermodynamics of site recognition to the solution environment. A major focus of this proposal is to systematically define the diversity among ETS members, using PU.1 and Ets-1 as model systems, under solution conditions that mimic the cellular environment, in which binding sites are embedded within nonspecific DNA and the solution environment is semi-dilute.",

Detailed understanding of the molecular machinery that controls gene expression is therefore of key interest to many fields in biology and chemistry. A major component of the gene-regulatory machinery is the complement of proteins, known as transcription factors, that physically interact with the genetic substrate at defined DNA sequences to direct the expression of specific genes. This project was aimed at improving our understanding of, and experimental techniques for studying, DNA sequence recognition by transcription factors. Specifically, we were interested in the diverse molecular strategies by transcription factors to differentiate themselves within a remarkably tight repertoire of structures that are found in nature. We focused on the ETS family of transcription factors, which are excellent models for addressing this problem because of their long evolutionary ancestry, widespread occurrence in animals, and strong similarity in structure. The major scientific outcomes of this projects are as follows. 1) ETS proteins generate selectivity for their DNA target sequences through the differential incorporation of water molecules and reorganization of surface electric charges. We showed that the DNA selectivity arising from these molecular properties agree with the occupancy of ETS proteins in the native genome of living cells. An important paradigm emerging from our studies is the evolution of on-target specificity by suppression of affinity for off-target sequences. 2) Some ETS proteins, such as the transcription factor PU.1, self-associate in a manner that is conditioned on the target DNA sequence. This behavior is intrinsic to the conserved DNA-contacting portions that characterize ETS proteins, but is significantly reinforced by additional elements belonging to specific members of the ETS family. This novel layer of regulation was not previously appreciated from structural data on this family of transcription factors. 3) We established the operational conditions under which biosensor-surface plasmon resonance (SPR) could be used as an accurate experimental method for tracking the real-time behavior of DNA binding. In doing so, we overcame technical issues that previously limited the use of this technique in protein-DNA interactions. To demonstrate the potential of this refined biosensor-SPR technique, we used it to characterize the direct transition by ETS proteins to their DNA target while bound to another disconnected DNA segment. In terms of knowledge dissemination, this project resulted in 20 peer-reviewed journal articles in addition to over 50 oral and poster presentations in a wide range of domestic and international conferences.
