 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigations in this project are at the interface of geometry and physics.  In one direction, our knowledge of the geometric nature of the fundamental forces and particles of physics will be expanded, much as Einstein explained gravity as a manifestation of the curvature of space and time.  In another direction, physical ideas and insights will be applied to advance our knowledge about the geometry of certain curved spaces.  For the past thirty years, this general area of mathematical investigation has produced many important applications to other areas of mathematics, as well as sometimes surprising applications to physics, and to science and engineering more generally.  Doctoral students will be trained to assist in mathematical aspects of these investigations, adding highly skilled workers to the STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nSeveral problems in algebraic geometry inspired by string theory will be investigated, in addition to problems in string theory. One set of problems involves the study of three important algebro-geometric curve-counting invariants motivated by string theory: Gopakumar-Vafa (or BPS) invariants, Donaldson-Thomas invariants, and Pandharipande-Thomas invariants, as well as their motivic and refined extensions. Some of these theories are known to describe equivalent data, while others are only conjecturally equivalent.  New techniques and examples will be investigated to extend the reach of these theories.  Important goals are to establish some of the conjectures, at least in certain situations, and to put the definition of the refined BPS invariants of string theory on a more firm mathematical foundation by connecting the differing approaches. In another direction, the investigation of the small quantum product of a toric variety will be reopened with the goal of answering a question about its structure that was almost answered in the 1990s. Finally, the geometry-physics dictionary for F-theory and its dual descriptions in terms of M-theory and type II string theory will be investigated with the objectives of making the dictionary more precise and then deducing applications to both algebraic geometry and physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe field of algebraic geometry concerns itself with the investigation of collections of polynomial equations and the graphs of their solutions.  One fundamental problem of algebraic geometry involves describing the geometry of these graphs.  Another fundamental problem, the moduli problem, investigates the underlying structure of the set of all possible collections of equations of a similar type.  Each of these problems are of both theoretical and applied interest, with applications including biology, cryptography, computer aided geometric design, physics, optimal control, and many other areas of science and engineering.  This project was situated at the exciting interface of algebraic geometry and theoretical physics. \n\nThe mathematical content of the project focused on two subfields of algebraic geometry: enumerative algebraic geometry, and elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds.  The former is concerned with counting the number of shapes of various types.  This area goes back more than 2,000 years to Apollonius, who determined that given three circles in the plane, there are typically exactly 8 circles which are tangent to all three of them.  Enumerative geometry is undergoing a resurgence following unexpected insights from physics.  The geometries can be related to a quantum theory, and then the geometric counting problem translates to a count of quantum states called BPS states.  In a similar spirit, the moduli problem can be understood by an analysis of scalar fields in a related quantum theory. \n\nWithin algebraic geometry, elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds can be described by a single equation of a specific type.  Its enumerative geometry can be analyzed via BPS states in a theory of quantum gravity called type II string theory, while the moduli problem of elliptically fibered Calabi-Yau manifolds can be analyzed by a theory of quantum gravity called F-theory.\n\nNew fundamental results of current theoretical interest were obtained in these areas, including results of mathematics which inform physics, results of physics which inform mathematics, and truly interdisciplinary results which straddle both disciplines.  Some of these results have led to new areas of inquiry, which are currently being worked out by the Principal Investigator and other researchers, both independently and in collaboration.\n\nSix PhD students worked on aspects of the project, contributing to workforce development.  One student received her PhD during the award period, and another received her PhD shortly after the conclusion of the project.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/26/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sheldon Katz"
