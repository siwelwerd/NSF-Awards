 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Miami University, located in Oxford, Ohio, will support the training of 9 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015-2019.  Participants will conduct individual research projects that emphasize ecological questions presented by human activity and global climate change.  Research mentors will be from diverse disciplines including biology, geology, chemistry, microbiology, and geography. The program is collaborative and interdisciplinary, so that participants can come to recognize that understanding ecology necessarily incorporates diverse views and approaches.  Students participate in the workshop \"A People and Their Homeland: the Miami Tribe\" led by tribal educators, which provides a historical perspective on the relationship between humans and the regional landscape.  The program includes a second workshop focusing on the scientific profession, discussion sessions, field trips, and visits by world-renowned scientists from other institutions.  Selection of student participants is based on student qualities and the match between their interests and projects proposed by mentors.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 45 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences and in peer-reviewed journals.  In addition to expanding knowledge of climate change and environmental problems, students will come to appreciate traditional ecological knowledge and the history of human-landscape interactions.  In this way, the program will prepare participants to become ecoliterate citizens in an ever-changing global society.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) helps to determine the effectiveness of the training program.  In addition, participants will be asked to provide feedback throughout the summer and beyond.  Together this information will be used to improve the activities and experiences. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://www.miamioh.edu/ecoreu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. David J. Berg at BergDJ@miamioh.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Ann L. Rypstra at Rypstral@miamioh.edu).",

Participants conducted collaborative research related to human impacted environments including studies of invasive species, pollination ecology, plant genomics, chemical ecology, and land owner management, to name just a few.  The research was supported by a seminar course that guided them through the process of developing and executing a research project.  In addition, the student and mentor pairs were grouped into ?clusters? consisting of 3-4 teams whose research was connected by some broader theme.  This structure provided the students with a broader framework for their individual research projects and gave them more avenues for advice and feedback.  At the end of the summer, the participants presented their work in a symposium that was open to the entire university community.   The collaborations typically continue until the projects are completed.  Alumni of our program have given more than 90 presentations at professional meetings and more than 50 papers have been published by our REU participants and their mentors, including 14 since this renewal was funded in 2015. \n\nResearch alone does not provide the full solution to the environmental crisis, because developing effective policies also depends upon understanding and respecting the diverse history and culture of our populations.  During our program, the participants were able to learn from Myaamia peoples whose homelands include our region, they were able to experience current habitat restoration projects, and they explored alternative research and career pathways with leading researchers and practitioners in applied ecology. \n\nSince 2002, we have provided experiences for 189 undergraduates from 119 colleges and universities.  With each renewal we have been successful in increasing minority participation.  Less than 17% of the participants were minority in our first grant period, but that was up to 79% in this recent grant period (Fig. 1).  In addition, 67% of the participants between 2015-2019 were from institutions with limited research capacity and 38% of them were first in their families to attend college. \n\nParticipants in our program across the years have been very successful.  Sixty-one percent are currently in or have completed graduate programs in STEM disciplines.  Individuals have received NSF graduate research fellowships, Fulbright awards, AAAS Congressional Science Policy Fellowships, and Luce Environmental Fellowships.  At this writing 74% are currently working in a science field or pursuing a science degree (Fig. 2). \n\nEach year, the REU students evaluated the various aspects of our program through multiple avenues.   In the standardized evaluation tool that is used by all REU programs (SALG), we received an overall rating of 4.7?0.7 (on a 5-point scale).
