 "awd_abstract_narration": "Analysis of social networks at different spatial scales, both egalitarian and hierarchical in nature, is useful for understanding the organization of societies in the past as well as the present.  The discipline of archaeology is well suited to investigation of social change over millennia and to identifying significant variation in human lifeways.  Andrew Womack of Yale University and his colleagues in China will investigate different networks formed during the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age periods (c. 2600-1900 BC) in Gansu province of northwest China, an area with tremendous potential for revealing a different form of social organization in the past than those known for well-studied areas to the east in China and elsewhere.  The project will investigate whether people in early Gansu, thought to be a cross-roads for interaction with peoples to the west in Eurasia, developed a different kind of organizational system in which there was resistance to social hierarchies on the basis of wealth.  Several new methods of data collection and analysis will be employed, providing useful training for local archaeologists. \r\n \r\nWomack and Chinese colleagues will identify different kinds of social networks created through activities such as craft production and mortuary rites in the Tao River valley of southern Gansu Province. As other anthropological research has established, mortuary goods can be a key indicator of both status and the nature of social networks.  The team will identify patterns of interaction as identified from specific production methods of ceramics at different spatial scales and infer how social networks expanded over time through coalescence of populations at funerals for important individuals.  It also will investigate why, around 2000 BC, elaborate funerals were abandoned in the region.  The team also will use effective methods to identify specific signs of use on vessels, to identify raw materials used for production, and to infer degree of standardization across space and time.  These data will then be used to infer the character of social networks through the production, circulation, and consumption of pottery vessels and how they changed over time.",

Well before the first Chinese Han Dynasty officials ventured west, however, complex webs of interaction resulted in movement of new crops, animals, technologies, and ideas between Central and East Asia as early as the third millennium BC. Andrew Womack, of Yale University, along with colleagues in China, investigated two groups located in northwestern China&rsquo;s Gansu Province who were central to these interactions. Termed the Majiayao (3200-2000BC) and Qijia cultures (2300-1500BC), these groups are credited with the first bronze working, wheat and barley cultivation, and raising of domesticated sheep, goats, and possibly horses, all originally from Central and Western Asia, in what is today modern China. These technologies and means of subsistence would go on to have a significant impact on the development of Chinese civilization.</p>\n<p>Despite these contributions to what is seen as the development and spread of Chinese civilization, however, this region of northwest China is often pigeonholed into the trope of cultural devolution, with environmental shifts forcing a change from sophisticated Majiayao farmers to the small-scale, possibly pastoral societies of the Qijia. &nbsp;This conclusion is based almost entirely on shifts in pottery form and decoration, with the large, elaborately painted urns of the Majiayao period being replaced by the smaller, mostly undecorated pottery that defines the Qijia period. This research project challenged these conclusions by investigating the relationship between pottery production, consumer and producer identity, and social interaction in order to provide a more nuanced understanding of the continuities and changes occurring between the two periods. By focusing on change over time, this research also approached a critical question in anthropological archaeology, namely what is the relationship between material culture and the identities of the individuals and groups who created and used these goods?</p>\n<p>In order to address these questions, pottery from four Majiayao and Qijia period sites in the northern Tao River Valley of southern Gansu Province was sampled for petrographic analysis (Fig. 1; Fig. 2). This technique which involves slicing off a very thin portion of a ceramic sherd and then analyzing it under a microscope, allowing the researcher to examine what minerals and other inclusions are present (Fig. 3). Combined with geological sampling, these analyses can provide information on different communities of potters that were creating the vessels that were then deposited in various sites (Fig. 4). Use-wear and standardization analyses, which can provide information on vessel production and use, were also undertaken on whole vessels excavated from nearby cemeteries.</p>\n<p>The results of these analyses revealed, surprisingly, that exchange for daily-use vessels is persistent between the two periods, despite significant shifts in vessel form and decoration. Thus, this research clearly indicates that vessel form and decoration are not adequate reflectors of underlying social groups, while also demonstrating that exchange relationships between local sites were persistent over more than 600 years. Use of vessels in funerary contexts, on the other hand, changes markedly, with variation in vessel origins between cemetery and habitation locales during the Majiayao period, which likely reflects the importance of funerary rituals for local networking, disappearing during the Qijia period. This indicates that in most cases vessels were not brought from other sites during the Qijia period for use in mortuary rituals. Instead, the first clear artifacts that are related to very long-distance exchange, including a bronze mirror and knife, and a turquoise inlaid plaque, likely from southern Siberia and Central China, respectively, appear in a cemetery in the northern Tao River Valley. In all other aspects, the graves in which these goods were placed are completely ordinary, likely indicating that these items were not status markers, but instead are likely the result of long-distance network building.</p>\n<p>While the reason for these changes remains unclear, this research clearly indicates that early inhabitants of the Tao River Valley shifted their networking strategies to interact with more distant communities over time. However, despite these changes in networking, there was clear persistence in underlying communities of ceramic producers and bodies of production knowledge. In addition to improving of our understanding of the Majiayao and Qijia, the international collaborations at the heart of this research (Fig. 5) also strengthened ties between China and the United States through joint fieldwork and data collection, and the presentation of results in Chinese at local venues. Finally, positive interactions with local residents of the Tao River Valley helped to improve perceptions of the United States in a region of China that otherwise rarely sees foreign visitors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/29/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Andrew&nbsp;Womack</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1541275/1541275_10365540_1511983842191_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1541275/1541275_10365540_1511983842191_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Research Region\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1541275/1541275_10365540_1511983842191_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Research Region\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
