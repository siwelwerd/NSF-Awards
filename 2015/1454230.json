Through experimental assessment and advanced design and characterization methods, the proposed research will hopefully lead to the next generation of robust visible-light-responsive hetero-structures capable of utilizing solar light for efficient photocatalysis and energy generation. Highly desired is the development of photocatalyst materials that effectively utilize visible light to form resourceful photo-electro-systems. However, light-absorbance efficiency, high corrosion-resistance properties, as well as low energy levels that do not match material reduction/oxidation half-reactions in dry conditions remain contemporary challenges in designing and manufacturing the next generation of proficient photocatalysts. The goal of this project is to establish an integrated research platform for the design of robust three-dimensional arrays of visible-absorbing photocatalyst heterointerfaces that have optimum electrochemical capability, increased photosentivity, enhanced power conversion efficiency, selectivity, stability and prolonged shelf-life. The proposed education plan contributes to the research project, and aims to educate and inspire the participants to appreciate the power of catalysis and catalysis-based science and engineering. Through implementation of comprehensive instructional modules in \"Photo-Electro-chemical Catalysis Science and Applications\" and by using virtual laboratory demonstrations, the PI will reach the under-representative population in her community, expand its scientific literacy, and create opportunities for the next generation workforce to understand the challenges associated with energy-related technologies development and implementation.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives consist of: (1) using combinatorial approaches relying on tailoring material (metal-oxide/graphene hybrids) physicochemical properties and laser-based direct writing to design scalable hetero-interfaces, (2) elucidating the fundamental mechanisms that dictate the structure-photon absorption efficiency, photocatalytic activity and hetero-structure conversion efficiency, and (3) monitoring hetero-structure's resistance to corrosion, all in situ and in real-time. One of the fundamental technological barriers in photo-electro-chemical catalysis science is finding efficient light-absorbing catalysts that have controlled conductor bands and reduced recombination of photo-generated electron-hole pairs, to further allow for studying how their doping could lead to increased photon absorption efficiency, improved photocatalytic activity, and resistance to corrosion in liquid environments. The results generated from this research are expected to fill this critical knowledge gap. The research should unravel the crosstalk between material properties and hybrid interface reactions and help identify the key factors responsible for the enhanced conversion efficiency and selectivity in user-scalable three-dimensional photosystems. Lastly, by offering fundamental/mechanistic information on the response of the photocatalysts in relation to materials physical and chemical properties and by optimizing structure-function reactivity, the research is expected to improve the \"benefit-to-risk\" ratio and allow systematic design and integration of tailored hetero-interfaces for efficient energy generation.",
