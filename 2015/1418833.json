 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports increased participation of US researchers at the Conference on the Foundations of Computational Mathematics (FoCM), hosted by the Universidad de la Republica in Montevideo, between December 11 - 20, 2014. The conference, organized by the Society for the Foundations of Computational Mathematics, is eighth in a sequence that commenced with the Park City (1995), Rio de Janeiro (1997), Oxford (1999), Minneapolis (2002), Santander (2005), Hong Kong (2008), and Budapest (2011) FoCM meetings. The NSF funding predominantly supports participation of qualified US-based graduate students, postdocs, and recent Ph.D. recipients in the conference, either as workshop speakers or as poster presenters, promoting their integration into the research community. The conference's diverse activities -- distinguished plenary talks, specialized workshops, poster session, and informal interactions between participants -- all integrate front-line research with mentoring and training opportunities for young participants, helping them develop networks that include the world's leading researchers. Central to the overall conference organization is the organizer's continuing commitment to the tradition that FoCM conferences welcome and integrate newcomers into the research community. \r\n\r\nThe FoCM conference offers an effective forum for the dissemination of research results across diverse fields within computational mathematics, capitalizing on a rapid evolution in our understanding of the interplay between mathematics and computation. The organizers and committed participants of the conference have a history of intellectual and service contributions to the foundations of computational mathematics. The conference program includes 17 plenary speakers who are among the leading researchers in the field; the organizers of the 19 workshops are chosen to include both established senior and talented junior researchers, their potential, diversity and creativity promising a vibrant scientific program. Many of the confirmed plenary speakers and workshop organizers at FoCM are from the US, reflecting the vitality of US based research in a variety of disciplines within computational mathematics. The award will advance the international exposure of research conducted in the US, and will have long-term effects in catalyzing new collaborations between US and international participants of the conference.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  www.fing.edu.uy/eventos/focm2014/",
