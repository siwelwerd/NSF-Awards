 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this CAREER award, the Chemistry Synthesis program is supporting the research of Professor Joshua G. Pierce of North Carolina State University. Professor Pierce will develop new methodologies for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing heterocycles.  One aspect of the research allows efficient approaches to densely functionalized thiazolines providing unique nitrogen radical precursors for chemical synthesis.  A second research endeavor is asymmetric approaches for the construction of pyrrolidines, heterocycles commonly found in complex natural products.  \r\n\t\r\nProfessor Pierce is engaged in a collaboration with the Natural Sciences Museum in Raleigh, NC involving a series of Science Cafes for the general public. The partnership also involves an interactive \"synthesis lab\" to engage K-12 students in organic chemistry and chemical biology.  Professor Pierce is a mentor for Project SEED students and NSF REU students at North Carolina State University.",
