 "awd_abstract_narration": "The engineer of 2020 is not only expected to offer technical ingenuity but also to adapt to a continuously evolving environment while simultaneously being able to operate outside the narrow limits of one discipline and be ethically grounded in solving the complex problems of the future. To address the competencies of the future engineer, undergraduate education must train students not only to address engineering challenges that transcend disciplinary boundaries, but also to communicate, transfer knowledge, and collaborate across technical and non-technical boundaries. One approach to train engineers in these competencies is teaching biomimicry or bio-inspired design in an engineering curriculum, which offers relevance to professional practice as well as an affective hook to frame complex, cross-disciplinary problems. This research aims to address the need for undergraduate student training in multidisciplinary design innovation through the creation of instructional resources that provide exposure to the abundance of design examples that can be found in nature, and scaffolding the discovery and knowledge transfer processes such that those natural designs can be used to inspire engineering solutions. \r\n\r\nThe research is expected to produce knowledge that will improve student learning, STEM literacy, cross-disciplinary thinking, and capacity for innovation. As more engineering students are trained in multidisciplinary design innovation, they will create solutions that result in a sustainable future for society. Bio-inspired design supports diversity and inclusion of ideas, and will attract women and minority students with diverse backgrounds to pursue STEM fields.",

One approach to train engineers in these competencies is teaching biomimicry or bio-inspired design in an engineering curriculum.  \n\nThis research resulted in evidence-based instructional resources that help engineering students to perform bio-inspired design while addressing the competencies of the future engineer. The resources are based on Concept-Knowledge (C-K) theory, which is known for integrating multiple domains of information and facilitating innovation through connection building.  Thus, the instruction resources scaffold the discovery and knowledge transfer processes involved in using natural designs to inspire engineering solutions.  A significant result of this work is the C-K map, which is a visual guide of the structured thought processes and mindset behind bio-inspired design.  The mindset is one of iterative knowledge building, connection making and idea generation. \n\nTo assess the learning impact of the instructional resources, we conducted two comparative studies in a second-year engineering design course: 1) statistical comparison of student projects across approaches (C-K and Biomimicry Institute), and 2) statistical and deep learning methods comparison of student projects across institutions (University of Georgia and James Madison University).  The students using the C-K approach designed concepts that exhibited a better understanding of how to abstract and incorporate biological functions into concept generation. This means that they demonstrated learning from nature to innovate rather than copy, whereas the students using the other approach tended to fixate on observable features and produced concepts that look like the biological systems.  It was found that the C-K approach was not institutionally dependent, thus it is transferable between institutions without performance loss.  And it has significant capability to produce innovative design solutions. These findings provide conclusive evidence of learning impact and support design theory based bio-inspired design pedagogy.\n\nThe broader impacts of this work include educating students to be innovators in STEM and supporting faculty in teaching bio-inspired design.
