 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical:\r\nThis award to Vanderbilt and Tennessee State Universities will explore fundamental advances in the integration of proteins into devices to speed the development of biohybrid solar cells for the generation of affordable, renewable power.  A team of two chemists, and a chemical engineer will collaborate in this project to develop nature-inspired solar cells that use proteins from green plants as the photo-active elements.  The protein complexes Photosystem I (PSI) and Photosystem II (PSII) drive photosynthesis in plants and are highly efficient solar converters. Members of this team have experience in integrating PSI and PSII films with electrode surfaces to design and construct photoelectrochemical cells with photocurrents that have improved by a factor of nearly 106 over the past five years and are now within an order of magnitude of many mature technologies.  This research project will address key fundamental biomaterials issues to greatly enhance the performance of photosystem-based solar cells. The research team for this project will build on their strong track record of integrating research with education at Vanderbilt and Tennessee State University, an HBCU, by promoting the interdisciplinary education of graduate and undergraduate researchers in engineering and chemistry through research experiences and interdisciplinary coursework.  An established outreach program to include students from under-represented groups through Fisk and Tennessee State HBCUs is combined with K-12 classroom outreach in the Vanderbilt Summer Academy and Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science.\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\nIn this project, the team from Vanderbilt and Tennessee State will develop a biomimetic approach to orient PSI on electrode surfaces, explore new ways of interfacing these proteins with conductive materials to facilitate electron flow to/from the proteins, and promote band energy alignment with the goal to achieve another quantum leap in biohybrid solar energy conversion.  First, PSI orientation at electrode surfaces will be greatly enhanced by selectively modifying the exposed stromal face of PSI within the thylakoid membrane with surface-active ligands before releasing the modified protein for directed assembly onto surfaces.  Achieving uniform orientations of these biomolecular photodiodes without the reliance on expensive and slow alternative methods would greatly advance biohybrid performance.  Second, the conductivity within PSI films will be promoted by wiring reduced graphene oxide, redox polymers, and semiconductor nanoparticles to the active PSI sites.  These oriented and more conductive PSI films will be interfaced with two types of electrode systems in both wet and solid-state systems.  Building from the group's recent success, PSI films will be interfaced with semiconductors with appropriate energy levels to guide electron flow unidirectionally through the circuit.  In addition, an all-carbon-based solar cell in which PSI films are sandwiched between oppositely doped, atomically thin graphene sheets to yield \"stacked\" architectures with only slight impedance of incoming light will be designed, fabricated, and optimized.  These advances will also be applied to the interfacing and photoelectrochemistry of PSII onto substrate electrodes.  The PIs will create outreach components and kits for building and demonstrating these devices in the middle school and high school settings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: Our team was successful in developing new ways to integrate PSI proteins with conducting polymers.  Such integration enables more effective electron transfer to the P700 donor site or from the FB acceptor site.  In one approach, we electrochemically polymerized aniline in the presence of PSI to produce conducting PSI/polyaniline composite films on various electrodes.  These composite films were deposited onto TiO2 and a silver cathode was sputtered on top to produce only the second solid-state PSI cell ever reported in the literature.  At only 1.5% (volume) PSI, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the device (0.009%) was 4.5x higher than that of polyaniline without PSI and at least an order of magnitude higher than the first reported PSI solid-state device by another group in 2014.  In contrast to wet cells that exhibit decaying currents due to mediator diffusion, the conductivity of the polymer matrix yields stable photocurrents over 72 h of performance with half day cycles of light and dark.  Remarkably, the electron turnover frequency for this device (500 e-/s/PSI) is 10x higher than PSI in nature and exceeds any PSI-based system reported in the literature.    This striking turnover frequency correlates with effective wiring of individual proteins and is attributed to the wrapping of individual PSI proteins with polyaniline to achieve favorable contacts with the active donor and acceptor sites of PSI.\n\n            In a second approach for conducting polymer-PSI integration, we have introduced a gentle, vapor-phase process to grow conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) from PSI multilayer films.  By exposing a PSI film to a Friedel-Crafts catalyst and EDOT vapor, PEDOT can be grown from aromatic residues on PSI through an oxidative radical process.  EDX spectra obtained cross-sectionally through the depth of the film confirm that the PEDOT grows throughout the PSI film and also produces a dense, pure PEDOT film on top to provide conductive connections to other systems.  PSI maintains its structural and photoelectrochemical properties during this vapor-phase processing.  The conducting PEDOT functions to extend the electrode from the metal surface into the PSI-rich film.\n\n           Finally, motivated by the favorable energy levels of viologens relative to the FB site of PSI, we have polymerized p-xylyl viologen and deposited the resulting poly(p-xylylviologen) (PxV) with PSI films to prepare a new prototype solid-state biohybrid solar cell.  This combination of PSI with PxV improves photocurrent by an order of magnitude over p-doped Si alone or p-Si/PSI or p-Si/PxV, confirming the importance of all components.  The layered deposition also improves photocurrent over a completely mixed PSI/PxV film, indicating the importance of a pure PxV/ITO interface at the anode.  In this cell, energy levels dictate that p-Si injects electrons into PSI, and PxV functions to route those electrons from the PSI proteins to the ITO anode.\n\nBroader Impacts: The award funded, in part, 6 Vanderbilt graduate and 5 Vanderbilt undergraduate students, and 2 masters students (Bashiyar Almarwani, Chris Alexander) and 1 undergraduate student at Tennessee State University (TSU, a HBCU) working with Dr. Phambu.
