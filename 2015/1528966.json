 "awd_abstract_narration": "The concept of a \"smart city\" is ubiquitous with data; however, most urban data today lacks the spatial and temporal resolution to understand processes that unfold on timescales of seconds or minutes, such as the dispersion of pollutants.  A better understanding of these dynamics can provide information to residents, cyclists or pedestrians who may wish to use air quality data as they navigate urban spaces.  This project leverages existing street furniture, integrating air quality and environmental sensors into commercial solar powered, networked waste stations.  Sensors embedded in BigBelly waste stations in Chicago and other cities will collect data that will allow researchers to explore critical questions that must be understood in order to begin to develop and drive policies, measurement strategies, and predictive computational models related to the feedback loop between traffic flow and air quality. The partnership with BigBelly, with nearly 30,000 waste stations in place globally, provides a channel through which sensors can be deployed in many cities.\r\n\r\nThe project brings together computer science, cyber-physical systems, distributed systems, and sensor systems expertise to explore technical and societal challenges and opportunities of urban-scale embedded systems in the public sphere, initially related to understanding and ultimately managing urban air quality.  Sensors embedded in BigBelly waste stations in Chicago and other cities will explore (1) the spatial and temporal dynamics of air quality in urban canyons, informing the sensor network resolution needed to drive traffic change policies and to provide healthy air quality routing information to cyclists and pedestrians; and (2) how urban topology (natural and built) affects these dynamics and associated required measurement resolutions.  These are critical questions that must be understood in order to begin to develop and drive policies, measurement strategies, and predictive computational models related to the feedback loop between traffic flow and air quality.  Critical challenges include (1) power management with respect to sensor sampling, in-situ processing, and transmission; (2) ensuring data quality; and (3) providing data in forms that are actionable and understandable to policy makers and the general public.  All data will be published in near-real time with web-based analysis tools for use by scientists, educators, policy makers, and residents, and with application programming interfaces (API's) for application development.  By developing an open source, readily deployed urban embedded systems infrastructure leveraging a widely deployed commercial platform, the project can enable science, education, and outreach in many cities, national parks, and educational institutions worldwide.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntegrate environmental and prototype air quality sensors into a commercial platform with footprints in multiple cities, enabling such measurements to be readily incorporated into \"Smart City\" programs, and moreover to create a process and precedent by which commercially-hosted sensors can provide open and free data for urban operations, planning, and research.  We have observed in multiple cities (Portland, Seattle, Chicago, Chattanooga, New York City, etc.) that making such measurements available to the science community catalyzes academic collaboration with local government officials and with community groups, given the universal interest in the health effects of air pollutants and the historic paucity of data available to the general public.  While not yet validated at this early stage, we also hypothesize that such data will lead to improvements in air quality and emissions models by providing evaluation and calibration data, and further leading to more effective air quality improvement and emissions reduction policies and interventions.\n\nOur project aimed to (a) adapt environmental and air quality boards for use in street furniture, providing standard I2C interfaces, (b) evaluate the measurement performance and data quality within deployed products in urban deployments, and (c) ensure that data from installations can be aggregated irrespective of platform (BigBelly, Sidewalk Labs Link.nyc kiosks, Array of Things, etc.) in order to support scientific investigations involving urban air quality and related factors (and including comparative studies among cities).\n\nEnvironmental and air quality sensor boards were deployed in Sidewalk Labs? \"Link.NYC\" kiosks in New York City, which were modified to enable the boards to be mounted (as optional configurations) inside the air intake vents.  Deployments were in pairs, located in six different urban environments ranging from mid-town Manhattan to Chinatown shopping areas to riverfront parks, with each pair of kiosks within 1 block of one another to cross-check their measurements.  Hand-calibration measurements were made with reference-quality instruments. Calibrations showed the impact of the microclimate within the street furniture (in this case the kiosk), resulting for instance in a 5-6 degree C offset relative to ambient measurements.  \n\nThe project yielded valuable insight into the challenges of designing measurement systems within urban street furniture, which will be of critical value as \"smart city\" projects attempt to piggy-back sensors with new LED street lights and similar equipment. The mechanical and thermal design and calibration exercises will be essential in order for these sensor deployments to provide valuable data.  Moreover, the approach taken in our project &ndash; to format the data very simply so that it could be aggregated with other sensor network streams &ndash; will be important as a mechanism to engage the science community in making sense of these new measurement systems.\n\nThe project also had impact engaging Chicago Public high-school students as a case study within a curriculum funded by the Motorola Solutions Foundation.  Students learned about this project as well as the NSF MRI \"Array of Things\" project as part of an 8-week program taught in 2016, 2017, and 2018.  The program, \"Lane of Things,\" trained over 400 students to think about measurement questions, translate them into scientific measurement plans, design and build wireless sensor devices to implement the plans, deploy the sensors, and analyze the resulting data.  This program introduces computation and computational thinking at the middle and high-school levels, where hands-on sensor systems draw math and science students toward computing and draw computer science students toward other areas of science such as atmospheric or air quality or transportation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/02/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles E Catlett"
