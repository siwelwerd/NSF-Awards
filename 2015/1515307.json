The proposed solution is to approximate exchange-correlation density functionals dependent only on the electron number density and its spatial derivatives, and not explicitly on the Kohn-Sham orbitals. This unconventional, promising, but risky approach qualifies the project for EAGER. Context is the growing importance of ab initio molecular dynamics simulations for predictive simulation of novel material properties. This gives detailed insight into atomic-scale processes that affect bulk properties, even for experimentally inaccessible conditions.  The PI's constraint-based (not fitted to data bases) functionals  reduce molecular binding energy errors by a factor of two compared to the most popular methods with vibration frequencies, ionization potentials, etc. This \"rung reduction\" strategy will remove the orbitals from meta-generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA) functionals to get highly refined GGA functionals.
