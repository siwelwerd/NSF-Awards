 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a US-Ireland partnership program pursuing research in structural health monitoring of bridges. The goal of this collaborative research project is to use cameras and video-image processing to identify loss of load carrying capacity of bridge structures. The camera images can be captured continuously with minimum human intervention. The image processing algorithm can be automated to assess significant change in structural health and load carrying capacity of the bridge. Conversion of camera and computer images for assessment of traffic loads and evaluation of load carrying capacity of the bridge are major research contributions of this project. Early detection of change in load carrying capacity will allow timely repair and thus extend life of the bridge. Investigators from three institutions, one each from three countries of Ireland, Northern Ireland (United Kingdom) and United States will collaborate to develop recognition of traffic loads, changes in vibration characteristics of the bridge, computer vision output, and algorithms to predict load capacity and remaining life of the bridge. The developed algorithm will be validated by observations of a bridge in Northern Ireland in the field. The project is funded by two divisions in the National Science Foundation, the Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation and International Science and Engineering.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project will be the development of algorithms that transforms the recorded video images of a bridge into damage characteristics for the bridge structure. The structural health will be assessed within the context of structural identification with input and output characterization. This development will require new adaptations and transformations that can manage computer vision that are continuous in space for structural engineering applications. The novelties in this project are: vehicle load modeling using computer vision; bridge response using image processing; image- based structural identification using input-output signals; and framework for remaining bridge life evaluation. The development will be validated with laboratory and field experiments. The international activities among the three collaborating partners in the areas of research, education, and outreach will support the intellectual contributions and broader impact of this research.",

Transportation infrastructure in the USA encompasses more than 4 million miles of roadway, more than 600,000 bridges, and more than 350 tunnels. The safety, serviceability and resilience of bridges of the transportation infrastructure are therefore critical. The status of bridges in the USA requires immediate attention as presented in the most recent American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Report Card (2017). In fact, there is an overall need for improving infrastructure as discussed by the National Academy of Engineering as one of the Grand Challenges of Engineering in the 21st century. To address the fundamental aspects of this problem, the University of Central Florida (UCF) researchers at the Civil Infrastructure Technologies for Safety and Resilience (CITRS) Laboratory focus on exploring novel algorithms and methods for accurate, practical and low-cost bridge monitoring systems that can identify and quantify any reduction in bridge safety in an objective and timely manner.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A main research significance was the investigation of algorithms that transform the measured video images into a form that is highly damage-sensitive/change-sensitive for bridge monitoring and assessment within the context of Structural Identification with input (loading effects) and output (structure response) characterization.

The researchers also proposed a portable and cost-effective system for the evaluation of bridge load carrying capacity by using multiple cameras and computer vision methods.
