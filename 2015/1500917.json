The coexistence of similar species?ones that feed at the same level in a food chain, have similar life histories, and share predators?requires some form of tradeoff such that each is either limited by different resources or enemies, or each is a superior competitor to the other at some points in either space, time, or both. This project will elucidate the differences in life-history strategies of two grazing zooplankton, Moina macrocopa and Daphnia pulex/pulicaria, in a freshwater rock-pools on an island off the coast of Maine, USA. The dormancy and dispersal of each species will be examined to determine if these differences promote coexistence either alone or in combination with spatial and temporal variation. This study will experimentally test whether one species is superior at remaining dormant while one species is superior at dispersing, and will model whether or not this allows these two species to coexist. This project will train one Ph.D. student and multiple undergraduate students through field-assistantships and mentored independent projects. The research will be communicated to the public, K-12 students, and undergraduates from many institutions at a nearby biological field station. The research itself promotes the progress of science and has implications for national welfare through application to the management of biodiversity of fragmented habitats; the project also supports education and diversity.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding how and if species can coexist stably in a fragmented habitat is key to understanding the maintenance of biodiversity. The coexistence of similar species?ones that feed at the same trophic level, have similar life histories, and share predators?requires some form of tradeoff such that each is either limited by different resources or enemies, or each is a superior competitor to the other at some points in either space, time, or both. The differences in life-history strategies of two grazing zooplankton, Moina macrocopa and Daphnia pulex/pulicaria, will be elucidated for a freshwater rock-pool metacommunity on an island off the coast of Maine, USA. Life history strategies relating to dormancy and dispersal of each species will be examined and used to determine if these differences promote coexistence either alone or in combination with spatial and temporal variation. This study will experimentally test (1) whether one species is superior at remaining dormant while one species is superior at dispersing, and (2) whether or not this allows these two species to coexist in this metacommunity by measuring the necessary relationships to parameterize a mathematical dormancy-dispersal model to test the conditions for coexistence. The spatial and temporal dispersal rates of diapausing eggs and their establishment success will be measured by stocking focal pools surrounded by other pools in which the species are initially absent. These data will be combined with data on competition outcomes in both artificial mesocosms and manipulated rock pools. In addition to furthering our understanding of the maintenance of biodiversity, which can be applied to the management of naturally and anthropogenically fragmented habitats, this project will train one Ph.D. student and multiple undergraduate students through field-assistantships and mentored independent projects. Furthermore, the information about this project will be disseminated to visitors to Shoals Marine Laboratory, which includes the public, K-12 students, and undergraduates from many institutions.",
