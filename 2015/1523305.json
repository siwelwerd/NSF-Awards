 "awd_abstract_narration": "The process of electrification of convective clouds involves collisions of large ice precipitation particles that are growing by collecting supercooled cloud droplets (graupel) with ice crystals that grow by vapor deposition.  The negatively charged graupel fall and lower whereas the positively charged crystals ascend with the updraft, thus separating the charges and increasing the electric field until its breakdown in the form of lightning flashes.  The existence of supercooled cloud droplets and strong updrafts that are required for the process can be ascribed to both thermodynamic and aerosol properties of the air mass. Disentangling the dynamic and aerosol effects is a long-standing question, because the aerosol and thermodynamic properties are often not independent. This study addresses this challenge with a new combination of observational tools that are applied to this problem for the first time.  The cloud microstructure is retrieved by the new NPP/VIIRS satellite measurements that will provide retrieved cloud properties at a resolution of 375 m.  Ground-truth aerosol measurements will be continuously available. The Houston Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) and the central Oklahoma LMA will provide accurate 3-dimensional mapping of the lightning sources and their polarity. The new polarimetric radars will provide the evolution of the precipitation in the clouds. These measurements will be conducted over the Houston area, which has refineries and other sources of air pollution. Similar clouds in and outside of the Houston pollution plume will be examined for separating the aerosol from thermodynamic effects on cloud microstructure, precipitation forming processes and electrification, including charging polarity. Similar studies will be conducted in central Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nThis research will contribute to the education of several undergraduate and graduate students who will directly participate in the research, which will include their sharing in data acquisition and analysis. Included in this study is support for students who will write theses and dissertations and present their results at seminars and professional meetings.  Research results will be incorporated into courses on cloud physics and mesoscale phenomena.  The research team will continue to inform, engage, and disseminate information and data to the wider scientific community through the project website.  Access to the LMA real-time lightning display is provided at no cost to the Houston community and surrounding areas.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nAward Title:  Collaborative Research:  Lightning Studies in a Polluted Atmosphere\n\nThe Physical Basis of Clouds with Inverted Electrical Polarity\n\nThe electrical polarity of thunderclouds has been a subject of interest since the time of Benjamin Franklin?s prescient summary :  \" The clouds of a thunder-gust are commonly in a state of negative electricity, but sometimes in a positive state.\" (Franklin, 1752).  On the basis of a more quantitative assessment, C.T.R. Wilson?s (1916, 1920) thunderstorm measurements mostly agreed with Franklin?s summary.  Wilson assigned a positive dipole structure to thunderclouds, with positive over negative charge.  Simpson (1927) argued for a dipole of opposite polarity on the basis of his measured charge on rain in the lower part of the storm.  Ultimately, this long-standing between Wilson and Simpson (Williams, 2009) was resolved with a compromise: the tripole structure of thunderclouds (Simpson and Scrase, 1937; Simpson and Robinson, 1940; Williams, 1989).\n\nThunderclouds with inverted electrical polarity have been the main topic of the present NSF investigation for this contributing PI.   By \"inverted polarity\" we mean an electrical structure characterized (in the C.T.R. Wilson context) by a negative dipole.  This structure is not compatible with the general tripole structure unless the upper positive charge is completely removed.  Accordingly, inverted polarity storms require rather specialized conditions.\n\nIn keeping with the idea that the far more prevalent positive dipole thunderstorms make ground flashes with primarily negative polarity, the negative dipole storms are expected to make ground flashes with positive polarity.  This line of thinking formed the basis for Alexander Eddy?s Master?s thesis (Eddy, 2018) showing lightning maps for the CONUS where the ground flash polarity is exclusively positive.  These findings conform with earlier studies (Zajac and Rutledge, 2001; Rust and MacGorman, 2002; Rust et al., 2005; Fleenor et al., 2009; Fuchs et al., 2015; 2018) that the most +CG-prevalent regions, are found in eastern Colorado, Nebraska and the Dakotas in the lee of the Rocky Mountains, where both cloud base height and atmospheric instability (CAPE) are both abnormally large (Williams et al., 2005).  A sample map from Eddy (2018) from the year 2008 is shown in Figure 1.\n\nA cloud microphysical scenario is compatible with this thermodynamic evidence for inverted polarity storms from different geographical locations.  When the cloud base height is high, and characterized by low temperature, the thickness of the warm portion (T&gt;0 oC) of the cloud is small (Williams et al., 2005).  This condition will suppress the coalescence of cloud droplets to form ?warm? rain and also assure that the condensate is retained in the updraft in the form of cloud droplets.  Following the results of many laboratory studies (Takahashi, 1978; Saunders et al., 1991; Williams et al. 1991 and Takahashi et al., 2017), positive charging of graupel/hail is favored at large cloud water content.  This may be an essential aspect of the formation of the negative dipole with prevalence of positive ground flashes.\n\nA possible alternative explanation for the inverted polarity thundercloud is based on cloud droplet size.  In laboratory experiments simulating the mixed phase conditions in thunderclouds, Avila and Pereyra (2000) have found a tendency for positive charging of the rimer (the simulated graupel particle) with decreasing cloud droplet size.  This charging polarity is opposite the dominant negative charging (Takahashi, 1978) that is generally accepted as the primary mechanism for the prevalent storm polarity.  This droplet size effect was the explanation advanced by Lyons et al. (1998) for inverted polarity electrification in clouds ingesting smoke from fires.  In that case the cloud droplet size is reduced by virtue of the sharing of the adiabatic condensate amongst a larger number of cloud condensation nuclei.  Smaller droplet sizes in the mixed phase region may also arise from higher cloud base heights, simply because the ascent distance for moist parcels is reduced.  Rosenfeld et al. (2006) and Freud and Rosenfeld (2012) have shown systematic increases in mean cloud droplet size with increasing distance above cloud base height, in a wide variety of convective regimes in different geographical locations.  The smaller droplet sizes predicted in storms in eastern Colorado may also contribute to the exceptional radar first echo heights there (Martinez, 2001).\n\nFinally, given the recognition that the hypotheses discussed above are decidedly incomplete, included here is a brief discussion of an entirely different hypothesis for inverted polarity clouds&mdash;one based on atmospheric chemistry.  Chronis (2016) and Marchand (Newsletter on Atmospheric Electricity) have independently pointed out that certain regions of anomalously large positive ground flash incidence are also near ammonia plants.  There is some possibility that this is influencing the ion populations in the thin liquid layers on ice particles that are available for selective transfer when the ice particles collide (Jungworth et al., 2005).  More detailed checking is needed between the lightning maps produced by Eddy (2018) and the ammonia plants in the CONUS.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Earle R Williams"
