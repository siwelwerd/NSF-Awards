 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is facilitating the growing use of STEM Learning Assistants in STEM departments in institutions of higher education and improving implementations of this approach. Learning Assistants (LAs) are talented highly-trained STEM undergraduates who are hired by university and two-year college STEM instructors to help transform courses to evidence-based approaches and assist enrolled students to get the full impact of active learning methods. The Learning Assistant model has spread rapidly into practice in the last few years. In response to growing use and requests for assistance, the team that created the LA model has recently developed an international Learning Assistant Alliance - a collaborative network of 88 institutions that use Learning Assistants to catalyze education transformation in mathematics, science, and engineering courses. Members of the LA Alliance also engage in collaborative research with peer institutions interested in developing and using improved outcome measures. Project resources are supporting the development and implementation of a web-based process for disseminating research-based LA instructional practices, including a database to provide resources and information for new users that will contribute to the efficient implementation of the LA model. Project resources are also supporting a large-scale research study of the learning outcomes and retention of over 50,000 undergraduates who have enrolled in courses using the LA model. With the initial support provided in this award, the LA Alliance is developing a governing structure and a plan for sustainable funding in years beyond the grant.\r\n\r\nThe Learning Assistant model is a model for social and structural organization in undergraduate STEM education that is related to and builds on the work of Peter Senge on learning organizations and on the work of Jean Lave and Etienne Wenger on communities of practice. It is an approach to supporting the growing use of evidence-based instructional strategies. However, it is not a specific instructional strategy but rather a method of training and using advanced undergraduate students as course assistants and liaisons between instructors and students enrolled in a STEM course. Built into the model is the baseline expectation that participating institutions are working to bring about change in the way undergraduate courses are taught and to study the effectiveness of these changes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGeorge Mason University (Mason) Fairfax, Virginia was one of institutions included in the NSF IUSE grant, SUSTAINED.  The project had four main goals:\n\n  This NSF IUSE project was designed to build and test resources and prepare dissemination pathways for the Learning Assistant Alliance.  Resources for the Alliance have been reviewed, improved and increased over the life of this project.  In the past year for example, the Alliance has addressed the pressing needs of faculty who must convert their teaching to on-line learning and provided resources that will assist faculty in this change.  (See:  https://sites.google.com/view/laa-elearning/papers-and-publications)\nThe project proposed further investigation of student outcomes nation-wide by further disseminating the use of the LASSO platform by instructors and researchers, increasing the pathways for collecting data, collecting broader data by adding more instruments and integrating tools for data upload;  Mason faculty contributed a Calculus Concept inventory that was added to the instruments available.\nA major goal l was to test the \"LA Campus\" software (formerly known as LA Central) at collaborating institutions and work out a funding model and mechanism for receiving service fees;  Mason was the second test site for dissemination of LA Campus.  All Mason faculty and LAs are successfully using LA Campus, and Mason\u2019s LA program has been able to expand to additional College of Science departments as well as increasing the number of faculty and students involved in the program  In 2012 Mason had 2 learning assistants.  There are now over 110 LAs in the program every semester.   With the support of learning assistants, an ever-increasing number of faculty have adopted active learning practices.  The campus is about to open its newest building in which all classrooms are designed for active learning.\nThe project aimed to establish funding and leadership to sustain the LA Alliance.  A governing body has been created that involves both faculty and learning assistants.  They have created some funding methods and continue to expand them.  Currently, the Alliance receives much of its funding from the University of Colorado, Boulder.  The new funding measures will distribute the costs to all participating institutions to make the Alliance sustainable.\n\n\nThe intellectual merit of this project has involved a plethora of articles and presentations which have been written and published by members of the Alliance.  One of the most recent is Leveraging Undergraduate Learning Assistants to Engage Students during Remote Instruction: Strategies and Lessons Learned from Four Institutions.  The article was written by Mary E. Emenike*, Carolyn P. Schick, Andrea Gay Van Duzor, Mel S. Sabella, Susan M. Hendrickson, and Laurie S. Langdon, and was published in the Journal of Chemistry Education. (2020, 97, 9, 2502&ndash;2511, August 17th 2020).  The Alliance has been able to address the current on-line change in multiple ways, providing guidance on how learning assistants can be used to facilitate effective on-line learning.\n\nEach year of the project, Mason faculty have contributed to this dissemination process with articles and presentations.  In addition, the Mason PI has contributed every year to the Learning Assistance International Conference and to several regional conferences.  In addition, she made an eight-day trip to Turkey to assist the faculty there who were in the initial stages of building a learning assistant program.  All of these efforts are designed to disseminate information that will help institutions build and improve their LA programs.\n\nThe broader impacts of the project at Mason include an increase of participation in the program by departments, faculty and students in the College of Science.  Faculty interviews reveal comments like \"I would never have tried these new methods in my classroom were it not for the LAs. My classes have been greatly improved.\"  Most faculty asserted that they would not be able to use active learning without the assistance of learning assistants\n\nThere has been a greater awareness across the Mason campus of the program and its contributions to active learning.  Faculty using active learning in their classrooms has increased dramatically and continues to do so.  The administration has been supportive of increased faculty use of active learning, and efforts are underway to expand the program to other colleges and programs on the main campus in Fairfax. The campus is scheduled to open a new building in the spring with exclusively active learning classrooms.  Learning assistants will be crucial to effective use of these facilities.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n [MN1]\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mary Nelson"
