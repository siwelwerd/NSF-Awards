 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI: Pojman, John\r\nProposal #: 1510612\r\nCure-on-demand polymerization is \"getting what you want, when you want it.\" In other words, the polymerization only proceeds when you choose it to commence. Cyanoacrylates have a \"cure-on-demand\" property in that the polymerization occurs when exposed to moisture. This is also true for isocyanate adhesives such as Gorilla glue or silicone sealants. The problem with these systems is that the reaction is not completely under the control of the user. The ideal case is that the material does not react until an external stimulus is provided. Photopolymerizations exhibit this feature but they are limited to situations in which the light can penetrate the system. Therefore, photopolymerization is not useful for highly-filled systems or when a surface casts shadows that leave areas uncured. One possible was to accomplish cure-on-demand is by using frontal polymerization (FP), a polymerization process in which polymerization occurs directionally in a localized reaction zone. Thermal Frontal Polymerization results from the coupling of thermal transport and the dependence of the reaction rate of an exothermic polymerization. The essential criteria for FP is that the system must have an extremely low rate at the initial temperature but a high rate of reaction at the front temperature such that the rate of heat production exceeds the rate of heat loss. In other words, the system must react slowly or not at all at room temperature, have a large heat release and have a high energy of activation.\r\n\r\nMost adhesive and repair formulations require mixing two components, which then begin reacting, or require a lengthy time to complete the curing. The PI will study the urease-catalyzed hydrolysis of urea, which produces ammonia and carbon dioxide. If the initial pH is set to 4, the reaction proceeds autocatalytically because urease has optimal reactivity at pH 7. The reaction can be a clock reaction, with the pH abruptly rising after a programmable period of time or can support a propagating basic pH front. The PI plans to use this system to trigger the Michael addition of a thiol to an acrylate. He can create time-lapse polymerizations and isothermal frontal polymerization. With high concentration of urea, the high final pH results in a delayed hydrolysis that allows a programmable temporary adhesive or programmed degradation of a polymer particle. Using an organic system that autocatalytically produces piperidine, he plans to create nonaqueous time-lapse and frontal polymerization systems.\r\n \r\nThis research could lead to commercial adhesives for consumer use. The urea-urease-thiol-acrylate systems could be used to create a \"cure-on demand\" bone repair material or a programmed drug release system. The time-lapse character of the system could be used to create a programmable adhesive and the degradable feature to create a programmed adhesive that will stop adhering after a determined time. Using Guar gum and borate, one may be able to create an additive for fracking that will allow the viscosity to increase only after the fluid is pumped deep into the reservoir.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe studied the urea-urease enzyme system to create time-lapse polymerizations and study quorum sensing.\n\n \n\nUrea will convert to ammonia and carbon dioxide in water but slowly unless the enzyme urease is present to catalyze the reaction.  If a solution of urea and urease is created at low pH (&lt;4), the enzyme activity is low.  As ammonia is produced, the pH rises and so too the enzyme activity.  This pH dependence of the enzyme?s activity creates a feedback loop in which the change in pH slowly rises and then makes an abrupt increase.  The time to the jump in pH can be tuned using the initial concentrations of the components.\n\nWe found an inexpensive source of urease ? watermelon seeds!  By grinding them in a coffee grinder and adding the powder to acetone (nail polish remover), 10-micron particles containing urease are isolated.  The activity of the urease remains constant if the particles are kept dry.  This is very important because we created a simple procedure to generate stable urease that is inexpensive and will last for a long time without refrigeration.  This will benefit research in other areas that require urease.\n\n \n\nWe used the watermelon seed powder with urea to create a ?time-lapse polymerization? by adding compounds that would react when the pH was &gt; 7.  We found that thiols and acrylates and thiols and epoxies could be used to make a programmable adhesive that would not harden until the pH increased, and this time could be adjusted over a wide range (minutes to hours).  We are working to commercialize this approach for adhesives.\n\n \n\nA fascinating phenomenon occurs if we created small beads of agar (like Jello) that contain the watermelon seed powder.   For a single bead in a urea solution at pH 4, the pH never rapidly increases in the bead.  We say the bead never ?clocks?.  However, if several beads are placed in contact, the group of beads will ?clock? together.  The critical number of beads, or quorum, is dependent on the amount of watermelon seed powder.  This phenomenon is called ?quorum sensing?, and it is important for bacterial film formation.  We created an easy-to-use system.  More interesting is that we can create analogs of biofilms, layers of bacteria that protect themselves with a coating of a slimy material.  Using the same materials, we used for the time-lapse adhesives, we created groups of ?cells? that created a protective coating when they achieved a quorum.  Thus, we have developed a model system that can help researchers studying bacterial biofilms.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John A Pojman"
