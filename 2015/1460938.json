 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most digital products, such as cell phones, microprocessors and video game players, rely for their functioning on high charge-holding ores, which include columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite, gold, and wolframite. The production and sale of these \"digital minerals\" has produced important economic opportunities for people in the developing world, which is where most of the ore is found. But digital minierals are also called \"blood minerals\" because illegal profits from their sale and trade have fueled the rise and perpetuation of some of the world's most deadly militarized conflicts.  The international community has responded to this problem with new laws, such as Section 1502 of the United States' Dodd Frank Act, which require that corporations try to monitor mineral sourcing. The laws are supported by certification schemes that try to assure that the minerals purchased by international corporations are acquired through legal supply chains and are conflict free. However, little is known about the impact of these regulations on the actual workings of the mineral trade or how they connect with the complexities of the lives, politics, and economies of local people who, if negatively affected, may try to subvert and evade regulation. This project seeks to fill this gap with ethnographic field research in the most important center of digital mineral production, the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\n\r\nOver the course of a year, University of California at Davis anthropologist, Dr. James H. Smith, will conduct ethnographic research with artisanal miners, traders, state officials, and others in key Congo mining towns in order to understand the effectiveness and local impacts of these regulatory and certification processes. The researcher is in an excellent position to carry out this research. He is fluent in Swahili and has previously conducted significant research on the social formations that have developed around coltan and cassiterite mining in the towns where the certification system is now being implemented. The researcher will collect data with a mix of social science research methods including participant observation, focus groups, commodity chain analysis, and interviews. The research will contribute significantly to social science theories of how globalization processes simultaneously integrate and disconnect people and nations at multiple scales. Findings from this research also will be important for helping to improve the viability of mineral regulation programs.",

The main tracking scheme was implemented by a consortium of smelters called the International Tin Research Institute (ITRI), in conjunction with a US NGO and the Congolese government.  Beyond the social and economic impacts of these changes, this ethnographic research also sought to understand how those involved in the trade understood and interpreted these interventions, and built on the PI\u2019s earlier and on-going research on their understanding of the trade and their place in the global economy more broadly conceived.   Among other things, the research revealed the ways in which the discourse of \"conflict minerals\" and the ban on artisanal minerals stigmatized artisanal mining and benefitted foreign mining companies that were able to use this legislation to have artisanal miners removed from the sites they wanted to mine.  In some cases, these were sites that were first discovered and developed by artisanal miners, and to which mining companies were late arrivals.

Beyond these rather practical issues, the research built on my earlier research to elaborate a totally alternative and vernacular Congolese theory of progress and peace building, based on concepts that diggers refer to, broadly, as \"movement\" and \"many hands touching money\".  In general, these concepts hold that conflict comes from people being excluded from the sources and methods of acquiring value, and holds that total exclusion leads to violence and war.  Rather, selective and thoughtful inclusion of those who could bring problems to others, or impede their movement, , is necessary to ensure a kind of \"development\" and \"peace\".  This theory is directly in conflict with foreign conflict minerals interventions, which are about separating out \"bloody\" or \"unclean\" actors and spaces from \"blood free\" or \"clean\" ones.  Eastern Congolese interpret these foreign interventions in terms of their understanding of colonial history, which some refer to as an on-going process best captured by the phrase \"the eyes of the world\", which refers broadly to foreign actors trying to identify and control Congolese wealth for themselves, while simultaneously limiting the movement of Congolese.  The research was published in the form of a 360 page book, entitled The Eyes of the World: Mining the Digital Age in Eastern Congo (University of Chicago Press, 2021).  The book has so far won the Association for Political and Legal Anthropology\u2019s Best Book in Critical Anthropology Prize and been a finalist or runner up for the African Studies Association\u2019s Best Book Prize and the Amaury Talbot Prize of the Royal Anthropological Institute.  A review of the book was published in the June 2022 issue of Foreign Affairs Magazine, which is unusual for anthropology books/ethnographies. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/20/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James H Smith"
