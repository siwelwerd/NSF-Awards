Fundamentally, everything on earth is governed by quantum mechanics.  Yet, while quantum theory is essential to understanding the gross properties of materials, for example the existence of both metals and insulators, and the phenomena of magnetism, it rarely manifests itself directly in the more macroscopic world.  This project aims to bridge this gap by investigating materials in which quantum effects are unusually apparent in laboratory-scale observations.  These quantum materials offer new functionalities that could not be achieved in more classical substances.  \r\n\r\nThe research is broadly focused on two areas: quantum magnetism and conducting \"liquids\" of electrons.   In quantum magnets, the phenomena of quantum entanglement - the strange situation in which a system must be considered to be in multiple classical states simultaneously - can be designed theoretically and investigated experimentally.  This project will investigate and quantify entanglement in \"frustrated\" magnets, in which competing magnetic interactions between electrons induce exotic quantum mechanical effects.  The research in conducting materials focuses on novel systems where quantum effects can be controlled, and where these effects may directly be probed by electrical measurements.  Specifically this includes compounds made from transition metal elements that appear in the 5th row of the periodic table of the elements, and artificial quantum materials grown one layer of atoms at a time.  All the research involves a combination of development of theoretical techniques, numerical and analytical calculations, and close interplay with experimental studies.   Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in an essential way in the research, training them broadly in analytical reasoning, mathematical methods, computation, and scientific communication, which form the basis for many careers in STEM fields, both in and out of physics.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\n This award supports theoretical research and education aimed to address the problem of understanding and controlling quantum correlations in solids, by developing new materials and structures with useful functionality not currently available, and by extending the basic scientific framework to understand matter in new regimes and new phases. Specific projects focus on highly quantum magnetism and correlated itinerant materials.  The research will be carried out using a diverse set of theoretical techniques: phenomenological modeling, statistical mechanics, field theory, ab initio simulations, density matrix renormalization group, and symmetry analysis.\r\n\r\nIn the area of quantum magnetism, the goal is to bring cutting-edge concepts of exotic, non-locally entangled and quantum critical states into confrontation with experiment.   This research will address quantum spin liquids and frustrated ferromagnets and ferrimagnets, addressing major open questions and new paradigms for quantum ordering.   Study of itinerant correlated systems directly attacks the frontiers of modern materials - 5d transition metals and oxide heterostructures.   Specific projects identify several directions with a high likelihood for discovery: frameworks to test ideas of unconventional superconductivity and quantum critical transport in new venues, and clarifying the interplay of localized and itinerant electrons in oxide heterostructures.  All the research fully integrates graduate students and postdocs, who will be trained in forefront areas of physics and in the scientific process and communication.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project consisted of fundamental theoretical research into the\nquantum physics of electrons in materials.  Electrons pervade solids\nand determine most of their properties.  Though the macroscopic world\nusually appears classical and familiar, the electrons which comprise\nit are highly quantum objects, capable of bringing exotic behavior to\nlight under the right conditions.  The goals of the research were to\nunderstand and design materials and artificial structures where this\noccurs, and develop techniques to calculate the properties of systems\nof this type.  The two main thrusts of the research are described\nbelow.\n\nThe first main thrust of the project was to study new forms of\nmagnetism in solids.  Magnetism arises from an intrinsic properties of\nelectrons, known as \"spin\", which provides each electron with a tiny\nmagnetic moment, and in quantum mechanics is a fundamental quantum bit\nassociated with each electron.  These bits can align, resulting in an\nordered magnetic structure which may be useful to generate magnetic\nfields or to store information.  The quantum bits may instead \"entangle\",\nto generate strange quantum behaviors and often startling properties.\nIn this project, we found examples of both types of behavior, and\nexplained how to uncover the novel resulting states in the laboratory.\n\nThe second project thrust was into \"topological\" properties of quantum\nmatter.  Topology is a branch of mathematics, which here is used to\ndescribe \"twists\"of the electron wavefunction -- the object that\nencodes the quantum superposition state of electrons in a material.\nMaterials known as topological insulators (discovered simultaneously\nin 2007 by the PI and a few others) are now famous examples, and\nsubjects of intense physics and materials research.  Under this grant,\nthe research was directed at modeling the electrical and thermal\ntransport of toppological materials.  Most notably, the work\ndemonstrated how the anomalous Hall effect, a hallmark of\ntopological electrons, is controlled by manipulating domains in\nmagnetic materials.  The project also included some of the first\nstudies of topological phenomena and transport in twisted bilayer\ngraphene, an exciting and rapidly growing new area of research.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Leon M Balents"
