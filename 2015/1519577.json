 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the International Conference on Graph Theory and Applications, held at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro, Tennessee from August 15, 2015 to August 17, 2015. The aim of this conference is to bring experts and junior researchers together to discuss recent advances in graph theory and applications, and to exchange ideas for future research.  More information is available on the conference website http://mtsu.edu/GTA2015. \r\n\r\nThe focus of the conference is on topology and geometry properties of graphs, which have strong connections with other areas of mathematics, such as group theory, matrix theory, discrete geometry and optimization etc. The conference will feature six plenary speakers: Michel Deza, Fan Chung Graham, Douglas Klein, Bojan Mohar, Wendy Myrvod and Teresa M. Przytycka. While there are many conferences on graph theory each year, conferences focusing on geometric and topological aspects of graph theory are rare. This conference will provide an opportunity for researchers working on topological and geometric properties of graphs to present recent research results and to identify new directions for future research.",
