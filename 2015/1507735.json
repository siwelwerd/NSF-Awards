 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Division of Chemistry is supporting Professor Heather Maynard at UCLA to conduct research to create polymeric materials that protect proteins to heat, and break down into non-toxic components, to release fully active proteins. Proteins have important biological functions and are useful as tools in scientific research, as reagents in various industries including those that produce chemicals and home care products, as additives to enhance food production, and as therapeutics for a wide variety of diseases. However, for a significant fraction of proteins, instability to heat and other stressing conditions, limits their application. For example, isolated purified proteins often lose activity if stored at room temperature and may be unstable to shipping or storage without refrigeration, increasing costs. As a result, there is interest in polymeric materials that can stabilize proteins to conditions that normally inactivate them, such as changes in temperature. It is also critical for most applications that these materials are degradable, non-toxic, and can release active proteins when and where desired.  Through this research, undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral researchers will be trained in interdisciplinary research, with a particular effort increase the participation of female and under-represented minorities in chemistry research.  In addition, outreach activities are directed at K-12 students from underprivileged and diverse communities, to expose these students.\r\n\r\nIn this research, Maynard's research group will be preparing polymer conjugates and nanoparticles of trehalose glycopolymers that protect proteins, degrade into non-cytotoxic components and release proteins by relevant triggers. Specifically, her group synthesizes and studies end functionalized trehalose glycopolymers that conjugate to proteins, stabilize the biomolecules, and degrade into non-cytotoxic components. The research also aims to prepare degradable trehalose polymer nanoparticles that stabilize and release proteins. This project teaches students valuable synthesis, structure-property relationships with regard to protein stability, and is expected to yield information on cytotoxicity and release of proteins. Since proteins are used in a wide range of practical applications, from the use of antibodies as diagnostics and as therapeutics, to the use of enzymes in the food industry, to the use of proteins as pharmaceutical therapeutic agents, the fundamental discoveries relating to protein stability from this research are expected to impact many different fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProteins and enzymes are important in every day life.  For example, they are used in laundry detergents and other home care products and also as medicines for a variety of diseases.  They are also employed to make many different materials and chemicals, and as tools in scientific research.  Unfortunately, many proteins and enzymes are unstable to various conditions such as increases in temperature that are experienced on hot summer days. For this reason, the majority of proteins and enzymes have to be refrigerated or frozen, which increases the costs for shipping and storage.  With the funding from this grant, new polymers (plastics) were made that stabilize proteins to various conditions, including heat.  Importantly, the polymers that were made were also degradable. Materials that can break down easily into non-toxic components are critical for sustainability purposes to not have a build up of plastics in the environment.  \n\n \n\nDuring this project, various non-toxic polymers were made that stabilize a wide variety of proteins and enzymes.  Important parameters such as how the polymers are put together and prepared were surveyed in order to maximize the stabilizing effectiveness.  Not only were polymers made, but also nanomaterials that can stabilize proteins for long periods of time and also degrade. Furthermore, a new way to control how fast the plastics degrade was developed that involved the use of polymers that have the element fluorine in them.  Fluorine slowed the degradation down in a predictable fashion.  In addition, new ways to meld together proteins and enzymes with plastics was developed that was very precise. All together, seventeen peer-reviewed publications with an additional one submitted arose from this work. Furthermore, the students and professor collectively gave sixty-three talks on the work, helping other scientist learn and become familiar with it.   \n\n \n\nThere are many broader impacts of the work.  The research results are important for many applications.  Not only will chemists and engineers in both academia and industry be able to utilize the knowledge gained in this work, but also likely researchers in biotechnology and medicine.  In addition, the research made an important contribution to training of the next generation diverse work force:  eight students (six graduate students and two undergraduate students) including three female and one underrepresented minority worked on this grant.  They learned many valuable techniques and skills that prepared them for jobs in chemical industry.  This helps to increase the pipeline of trained individuals that are able to make new plastics.  In addition, the students and faculty together did many outreach activities, thirty-eight altogether, to reach students from diverse groups and help them become excited about research.  This will likely serve to increase the number of students interested in science and who pursue schooling in this area, which in turn will increase the workforce of the future.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Heather D Maynard"
