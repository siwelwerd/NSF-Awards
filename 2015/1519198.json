 "awd_abstract_narration": "According to the American Cancer Society, nearly half of all U.S. citizens will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetime. In 2012, approximately 40% of all new diagnoses for women were for breast or gynecological cancers, and 30% of all new diagnoses for men were for prostate or testicular cancer. Those diagnosed often need extensive treatment, which can result in the loss of function or removal entirely of gendered/sexed body parts (for example, impotency or infertility or the surgical removal of breasts or testicles). This disruption of the gendered body that cancer patients face provides a unique space to examine the salience of gender in everyday life. I argue that when people's bodies are altered, they must find new ways to experience and understand them. This dissertation examines how cancer and treatment of the disease can challenge or reinforce cultural scripts that define the gendered body. While cancer and its various forms of treatment can be understood as disruptive, their effects on the gendered body have been neglected in academic study. \r\n\r\nIn order to access medical discourse surrounding gender and the body, I interview male and female oncologists, knowing that their position gives them the distinctive authority to prescribe solutions to the gendered concerns of their patients. In addition, I interview men and women who have been diagnosed with prostate, testicular, breast and gynecological cancer to find out how they view the changes to their gendered body and subsequent changes to self and identity from undergoing treatment. Policy recommendations are generally made based on studies focused solely on the experiences of women with breast cancer.  Knowing this, it is essential to study the experience of male and female patients with various forms of cancer, in order to improve patient care overall. This dissertation also promises to make significant empirical insights to improve cancer care and will provide noteworthy contributions to the sociology of gender, gender studies, sociology of the body, and cultural and medical sociology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA common cultural belief is our body parts and sexual organs inevitably and invariably dictate our gender identities and manifestations of masculinity and femininity.  While sociologists have begun to understand different ways in which bodies are altered to match gender identities, previous literature focuses almost exclusively on transgender individuals.  However, little research has focused on the affects of involuntary changes to the body. I show that although women and men cancer survivors rely on limited cultural definitions of masculinity and femininity defined by body parts, the changes to their bodies provide them an opportunity to alter their definitions of what it is to be a man and a woman.  This dissertation highlights the embodied nature of culture by analyzing a large yet understudied population.\n\n90 interviews were conducted (27 with oncologists and 63 with cancer patients). In-depth semi-structured interviews were conducted with 27 doctors who work with breast, gynecological, and urological cancer patients and 63 cancer survivors: 17 breast cancer patients, 15 gynecological cancer patients, 14 testicular cancer patients, and 17 prostate cancer patients. These four cancers represent the most prevalent cancers that have large cultural significance in relationship to gendered bodies.\n\nStudying adults that have involuntarily undergone changes to their gendered body allows us to better understand the cultural definitions of masculinity and femininity and the subsequent consequence of these changes.  My results show how this process works.  First, as does the broader public, women and men in my sample generally define masculinity and femininity through cultural understandings of the body (i.e., femininity = breasts; masculinity = sexual function).  Second, undergoing treatment that threatens these cultural definitions allows them to change their understanding of their own masculinity and femininity more broadly.  Third, this process yields different outcome for women and for men.  Women feel empowered and redefine themselves as powerful and strong moving beyond cultural definitions of femininity defined exclusively by appearance, and more specifically the appearance of their breasts.  In contrast, men redefine masculinity outside of just their sexual function and are forced to confront their mortality and a loss of the control that they have taken for granted as men.\n\nTherefore, this dissertation contributes to a broader literature on gender, the body, and medical sociology. This dissertation also takes important strides in creating a theoretical framework that disentangles the relationship between gender identity and sexual organs.  Cancer patients provide a significant site of investigation and their power to redefine masculinity and femininity beyond limited cultural definitions provides the groundwork for changing societal expectations of men and women.\n\nIn addition to contributing to the scholarly literature, the results of this dissertation are likely to give medical experts and patients a greater understanding of the social experience for cancer patients.

Having a better understanding of the cancer experience for both women and men may help improve the types of support that cancer patients receive, as well as, help prepare individuals diagnosed with gender cancers.\n\nAs a result of the NSF dissertation improvement grant, the Co-PI has presented work at numerous conferences and 3 working papers have been written.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laura E Rogers"
