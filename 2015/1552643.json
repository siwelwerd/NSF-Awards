 "awd_abstract_narration": "Making has been described as the next generation of innovation and do-it-yourself. Makers are an emergent group of imaginative inventors who value tinkering, hacking, re-making, and creating of technical artifacts. Makerspaces are places where these Makers gather in communities to learn from each other and create. There are some who believe that the Maker Movement can potentially lead to a resurgence of manufacturing job skills development as well as reshape engineering education. The Making community is diverse, encompassing informal learning in museum/library settings; Making in community spaces; university Makerspaces; engineering and science researchers who engage in Making; and education researchers who engage in Making. In order to reap the benefits of Making for the US manufacturing industry, it is necessary to understand the benefits of Making and how to advance the Maker Movement. This project will provide the initial baseline data needed to identify future directions in Making.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop, launch, and analyze a survey on Making activities across the US. In an effort to leverage the knowledge acquired by those already active in the Maker Movement it is imperative that the various stakeholders learn from each other. The proposed survey will be used to gather information from the broad Maker Community to understand what Making means. Based on findings from the survey, a written report will be created and widely shared that highlights the state of the Maker Movement and how diverse Maker segments believe the Maker Movement can be best supported. This report will document how engineering schools and others are using Makerspaces and the perceived value of housing a Makerspace (e.g., pedagogical value, contribution to diversity, and contribution to retention. Findings from the Maker Survey report will serve as a potential baseline for new research inquiries into the Maker Movement and additional data collection and analysis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project surveyed engineering and engineering technology deans about how they think about Making, how Makerspaces are utilized on their campuses, how Making is used in their curriculum, and what positive student outcomes they attribute to Making.  A separate survey sent to the broader Maker community asked that population how it defines Making, how it finances and manages Makerspaces, and how it engages members of the community in Making.    \n\nTwo papers summarized the survey results.  A conference paper titled \"University Makerspaces: Characteristics and Impact on Student Success in Engineering and Engineering Technology Education\" was published in the peer-reviewed American Society for Engineering Education conference proceedings. This paper focused on engineering and engineering technology deans? views of how Making contributes to positive student outcomes.  The paper was presented at the 2017 ASEE Annual Conference in Columbus, OH in a session through the Cooperative &amp; Experimental Education Division.  \n\nA report that summarizes the results from both surveys was made available on the ASEE website as a downloadable PDF and was distributed to ASEE members via email.  The report is titled \"Advancing the Maker Movement: Making and Makerspaces at Engineering and Engineering Technology Schools and Departments and Outside the Engineering Academic Maker Community.\"\n\nSome of the main findings from the surveys include:\n\n&bull; Engineering deans, engineering technology deans, department chairs, and the non- Engineering academic Maker community all define Making as taking an idea or concept and creating it in material form.
