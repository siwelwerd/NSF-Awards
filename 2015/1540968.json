This conference brings together researchers in the interdisciplinary field of Requirements Engineering, which considers how people's goals for a system get implemented and evolved correctly over a system's lifetime. The supported students may be participating in the Doctoral Symposium and/or presenting papers. The proposal has a sound selection process and and a process for administering the funds. The funds will help the students advance their education and their research and to meet leaders in the field as well as the international community of researchers.",
