By bringing together scientists and students in an informal setting, the conference will enable students to explore and discuss career options available to young physicists. Through special topical and technical sessions, students will have the opportunity to gain a broader view of physics beyond their own classrooms and research laboratories. The meeting will generate scientific exchange among the student participants, promote international collaborations among young scientists within the North American continent, expose graduate students to sub-disciplines in physics beyond their individual research areas, and promote interdisciplinary research within the sub-disciplines. The meeting's organization is carried out by the students. Overall, it will provide excellent training for the next generation of researchers in the U.S.\r\n\r\nThe scientific program will include plenary talks by invited scientists in physics sub-disciplines such as Quantum Computing, Particle and Accelerator Physics, Theoretical Physics, Earth and Atmospheric Physics, Atomic/Molecular Physics and Material Physics. The plenary sessions will be followed by contributed talks from the students. A student poster session will round out the scientific program. All student participants will present their research in either a contributed talk or poster session.",
