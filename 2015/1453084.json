 "awd_abstract_narration": "Decisions define the course of a person's life, profoundly impacting health, safety and economic prosperity.  The process of decision making involves two key components: assessing the value of a sensory stimulus or anticipated outcome, and taking action based on that evaluation.  In humans and other mammals, neural networks involving the association cortex and reward centers have been implicated in stimulus evaluation, while other networks have been implicated in motor planning and initiation.  What remains unknown is the circuit through which evaluation directs selective motor activation.  Defining this link is essential to understand decision making, and this project will investigate natural social behaviors in a new animal model of decision making to reveal how the nervous system forges that link between perception and action.  An improved understanding of decision making and social behavior will advance many fields including neuroscience, psychology, and economics.  Furthermore, this research will also guide understanding of how decision making can go awry, yielding the promise of mechanistically-targeted treatments for behavioral pathologies such as compulsive behavior and addictive relapse.  Such advances will vastly improve not only quality of life but also national economic competitiveness. This broadly relevant and appealing research will be integrated with the educational goal of engaging high-school students and teachers in laboratory research, developing the next generation of professional scientists, and communicating these and other findings to the public through an educational series of relaxed and informal Science Cafes.\r\n \r\nIn female songbirds studied in this project, songs that they hear performed by males are the most important factor influencing the female's mate choice.  A female's preference for a specific song and the behavioral indicators of that preference are easily quantifiable and consistent over time, providing a context in which to investigate how the brain encodes preference and uses that information to direct selective expression of behavioral responses.  In these experiments, the researchers will (Aim 1) identify how subjective value of male song is encoded in specific populations of neurons in the female brain.  Additional experiments will (Aim 2) identify circuits through which sensory processing of subjective value directs motor behavior.  In those experiments, focally applied, low-intensity light will be used to activate or inactivate those circuits to discern the causal relation between activity in those pathways and performance of specific behavioral responses.  Together, these experiments will reveal the link between perception and action.",

Especially troubling are cases in which relapse is provoked by sensory experience, such as the smell of a specific kind of smoke or passing by a house in which the persob previously engaged in drug abuse. Presently, therapies are limited because of the relative lack of knowledge regarding the neural basis of how those sensory experiences are processed, how they are associated with feelings of desire or pleasure, and how that information affects downstream circuits to result in the initiation of specific actions. This project developed a new animal model of sensory evoked decision-making. The strengths of that model are that it is based on perception and evaluation of sensory stimuli, the results of the selective activation of one or a few behaviors from among many possible outcomes, and it permits high-resolution investigation of the cellular and circuit mechanisms through which those behaviors occur. Because of the close parallels between structures studied here and those present in the human brain, information from this and future studies using this animal model will provide a search image of how sensory evoked decision-making may also occur in the human brain.\n\n\nThe broader impacts of the study have also had a widely beneficial effect beyond the academic world. A primary focus of the Broader Impacts in this project is informal science education. We moved beyond the academic world to educate people in a relaxed setting where they were invited to enjoy learning apart from any formal academic structure. Such efforts resulted in a community of citizens that are more informed about the current state of scientific knowledge regarding issues that are important to them. Those people also interacted with researchers themselves, providing them first-person insight into the challenges and joys of scientific research and how science is essential for the continued improvement of our physical and social environment. The PI and his students also partnered with teachers at other institutions spanning the University level, multiple community colleges throughout our state, and high school life science classrooms. We developed active learning curriculum materials to help students grow in their ability to think critically and ask salient questions about issues that are important to them and their community. In that way, we also promoted student development in not just their knowledge of biology and neuroscience but also their ability to think and to use the tools of scientific inquiry to ask and answer questions that are relevant to them.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/07/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JonathanPrather\n"
