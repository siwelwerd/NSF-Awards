 "awd_abstract_narration": "The southern Great Basin is among the most arid regions in North America. It has almost no\r\nperennial streams, but does have >1,000 springs. These springs are islands of aquatic habitat\r\nin an ocean of desert. Remarkably, many of these isolated springs contain diverse aquatic\r\necosystems and even endemic species of fish, spring snails, and other aquatic organisms. The\r\npresence of many aquatic species that can only survive in water is evidence that the springs\r\nare remnants of a perennial drainage system, and the presence of endemic species requiring\r\nintervals in the million-year range for genetic divergence are evidence that at least some\r\nof these springs have never desiccated over the geological time scale. Aquatic biogeographical\r\npatterns thus inform the geological and hydrological history of the region.\r\n\r\nThis is a project to expand the already-large regional biogeographical database and to use the combined\r\nnew and preexisting data to test models of tectonic and paleohydrological evolution of the\r\nsouthern Great Basin. The PIs will focus on two timescales: that of the extensional breakup of\r\nthe region from the late Miocene to the present and that of glacial/interglacial climate cycles.\r\nExtensive work has been done to understand the extensional history of the region, which started\r\nin the eastern portion of the study area at ~14 Ma and migrated westward to the Sierra Nevada\r\nfront, driven by plate-boundary dynamics. They will simulate this evolution using a regional\r\nquasi-3D kinematic/tectonic-geomorphic-hydrologic coupled model that fully couples movement\r\nalong faults, mass distribution, magmatism, isostatic compensation and flexural deformation\r\nwith hydrology and surface geomorphic processes, including erosion and deposition. The extensional\r\nfragmentation of the hydrological system will be studied and groundwater flow, necessary to\r\nsimulate the resulting development of springs, will be an integral part of the regional tectonic-geomorphic-hydrologic model.\r\n.\r\nModeled paleohydrologic histories will be tested against biotic data (aquatic biota inventories,\r\nmicrobial and macrofaunal DNA, and genetic divergence times) with island biogeography theory.\r\nThe PIs will test for relations of hydrologic fragmentation chronology with endemic species and\r\nfor ecosystem diversity with spring resilience, as inferred from groundwater ages and climatically\r\ndriven modeling. They will use these results to assess and improve their tectonic/paleohydrologic models.",

Our work found springs discharging old groundwater are more buffered to the immediate effects of climate change than springs discharging modern water. Metrics across the study area that are correlated with increased groundwater age include temperature, electrical conductivity, spring landscape position, and spring emergence mechanism (i.e., what is causing the spring to emerge on the landscape). Interestingly, we did not find significant enough variability in the repeat spring data to correlate geochemical variability with groundwater age.</p>\n<p>Another major goal of the project was to establish connections between hydrology, geochemistry, aquatic ecology, and microbiology. We postulated some of these connections in the project proposal (Figure 3), however, our work over the last 6 years has lead to a reworking and expansion of these ideas into a new conceptual model (Figure 4). At local scales (i.e., a limited range in temperature and conductivity), we find that benthic macroinvertebrate and microbial community structures are controlled by spring permeance and spring geochemical composition (i.e., spring geochemical molar ratios). At the regional scale our data show systematic trends of increasing temperature, conductivity, and residence time moving from higher topographic positions to lower topographic positions. These patterns correspond to decreases in ecological richness and diversity from high topographic positions to lower topographic positions, while community tolerance increases. Springs emerging on the valley floor or basin playa are the exception to this conceptual framework and can have wide ranges in temperature, salinity and residence time based on the aquifer provenance and the flowpath distribution they source. These springs tend to host only very tolerant taxa (e.g., <em>Diptera</em>) due to the harsh environmental conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Broader impacts:</em></p>\n<p>This project resulted in numerous broader impacts for stakeholders, students, and the scientific community. During September 2018 we held a formal community outreach event in Tecopa, CA to interact with the public regarding the science of this project and to discuss the importance of desert springs as ?keystone? features in the environment. In July 2019, we held a weeklong immersive field workshop at Bernasconi Ranch in Big Pine, CA for teachers from the Clark County, NV school district. The goal of this workshop was to develop rich, interediscplinary curricular materials and samples that could be taken back to their districts, including virtual field trips, graphing and data analysis exercises, among others.

The four female undergraduate researchers from Pacific have all proceeded on to graduate school, with two having already received MS degrees. This smaller hydrogeology/geochemistry project team has also contributed a significant amount of scholarly research. Currently, there have been four manuscripts published in peer-reviewed scientific journals (with another in review and several more in preparation), and over 15 major conference papers and invited presentations (e.g., Geological Society of America &amp; the American Geophysical Union).</p>\n<p>Over the course of this project we had significant interactions with land management permitting agencies including Death Valley National Park, Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge, the Bureau of Land Management, Inyo National Forest, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, and the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area.
