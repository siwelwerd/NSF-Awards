 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award funds a REU site at Oakland University.   Each summer, undergraduate students from across the nation will work on challenging research problems related to cybersecurity, an area of national priority for our nation. Students will work with faculty mentors to use tools and techniques to solve problems that are timely and important.  This site should help develop computing professionals who can build future computing systems and applications that are secure and trustworthy and that we can all use with confidence. This REU experience provides students with the foundations and inspiration to pursue computing careers and research in areas that are rapidly evolving and impacting all of our citizens. \r\n\r\nThe site will focus on recruiting women and students from institutions where there are limited research opportunities.  The team will use successful strategies employed in past REU Sites to recruit undergraduate students from groups traditionally under-represented in computer science. The site includes a significant research component combined with professional development opportunities for the participating undergraduate students.  The students are immersed into a research environment with all of its facets: participating actively in shaping a research project and in defining the solution; communicating to peers and other audiences about the research and their findings; visiting research laboratories and attending scientific and technical presentations; and forming collegial relationships with research teams that include faculty, graduate students, and other scientific researchers.  The resulting research is often presented at professional conferences and included in technical publications thus contributing to the body of research related to sustaining secure and trustworthy cyberspace. The ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of a diverse scientific workforce with expertise in areas critical to national security in the evolving global society of the future.",

The <strong>major goal</strong>&nbsp;of this REU Site is to each year engage 10 undergraduate students, particularly <em>women and Under Represented Minorities (URMs)</em>, in 10-week summer research experiences that <em>excite and motivate them to embark upon graduate studies and pursue careers in science and engineering</em>.&nbsp;The <strong>intellectual focus</strong> for the REU Site is Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC).&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>1. Diversity: </strong>We have a diverse group of REU participants during 2015-2017. A total of <strong>32</strong> undergraduate students, <strong>9</strong> of them female, <strong>5</strong> Hispanic, <strong>5</strong> African Americans, from <strong>25</strong> different universities across the U.S., have successfully taken part in  the program. Although our NSF grant generally provided funding for 30  students, we sought and obtained additional funding from OU to support 2  additional students. The students came from a variety of institutions,  including 4-year colleges, colleges with limited graduate programs, and  institutions designated by the Carnegie Foundation as being research  intensive and extensive universities, as well as community colleges.  Most had no prior research or co-op/internship.<strong> <br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>2. Publications and Awards: </strong>The REU research projects carried out by the REU students during 2015-2017 have directly resulted in <strong>2 </strong>conference presentations, <strong>17</strong> poster presentations, <strong>3</strong> journal papers, and several awards, e.g.,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Seaver  Thorn and Harrison Mansour won the award for the Best Poster at the  2018 IEEE International Conference in Consumer Electronics (ICCE).</li>\n<li>Andrew  Davis and Matthew Wagner won the award for Best Full Paper at ACM  Proceedings of the 12th annual Cyber and Information Security Research  Conference (CISRC2017) held at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in  Tennessee.<strong> <br /></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. Scholarships: </strong>Many  of the UnCoRe participants received scholarships by the graduate  schools where they were admitted and by NSF. Below we only list a sample  of scholarships that resulted directly from the students? research at  UnCoRe during 2015-2017.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Harrison Mansour was awarded the Fulbright award to study in Finland for two years.</li>\n<li> Matthew Wagner won the student scholarships to pursue a Ph.D. degree in  Cyber Security at Missouri University of Science and Technology.</li>\n<li> Richard Yang won the student scholarship to pursue a Master degree in  Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence) at Stanford University.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>4. Students Perceptions, Preparation, and Attitude: </strong>Students  recruited to participate in UnCoRe come into the program with very  little or no research literacy as illustrated by the answers they  provide in the initial research quiz. As they leave the program, the  students not only acquire literacy in all aspects of research through  experience, but also gain a positive appreciation of computing,  familiarity with some of the computing research literature, form a  network of faculty and other researchers that they can use as mentors  and resource for advice, and gain an understanding of how the research  they conducted fits within the larger context. This statement is based  on the answers the students provide on the exit surveys and our analysis  of the data.</p>\n<p>On a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being poor and 5 being excellent,  students in all three cohorts have consistently reported satisfaction  with the program. For example, in 2017, students reported that they  became familiar with the relevant scientific literature for their  research projects (4.3 rating), developed a sense of how their research  contributes to scientific knowledge (4.5 rating), developed a mentor  relationship with faculty on whom they can call for guidance in the  future (4.2 rating), understood the practical applications of their  research (4.2 rating), understood the overall research project and how  their work will contribute to its success (4.5 rating), learned more  about the publishing process in engineering and science (4.3 rating),  got the opportunity to learn more about other faculty and student  projects in addition to their own (4.6 rating), developed skills on  making scientific presentations (4.5 rating), felt as though he/she is  part of the intellectual effort and not just a technical assistant (4.5  rating), and learned more about professional organizations and  networking in engineering, and/or the sciences (4.1 rating). All  students indicated that they would recommend the program to their  friends.</p>\n<p>Another measure of the UnCoRe impact on the REU student participants is the type of feedback we hear from the students <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">after they have left the program</span>.  For example, a female student sent us an email stating \"I'm delighted  to tell you that I was accepted to 3 wonderful programs: The Princeton  MS in CS (with thesis), the Duke Masters of Science in Economics and  Computation (MSEC), and University of Michigan MS in CSE. Even more, the  Princeton and Duke programs with a full tuition waiver!\" The students'  feedbacks like this received several years later are our ultimate reward  and indicator of the impact of the UnCoRe REU program.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/30/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Huirong&nbsp;Fu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
