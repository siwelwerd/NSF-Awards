 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award generally aims to use cave systems and speleothems as natural archives of environmental conditions related to tropical cyclones and variations in ocean and atmospheric conditions. This research is important because it will help expand the scientific understanding of the nature and timing of past tropical cyclone activity, especially during periods of varying regional (i.e., Indo-Pacific sea surface temperature and Pacific temperature gradients) and extra-tropical (i.e., Northern Hemisphere temperature) climatic conditions. Since tropical cyclones are responsible for the majority of extreme rainfall events in some regions, an improved assessment of their dynamics can aid in developing models of long-term water budgets and storm-related risks.   Investing in understanding tropical cyclones has significant economic and social returns in terms of saved lives and protected property.  Furthermore, this award will advance research and education at a primarily undergraduate institution thereby providing an early experience for students in the conduct of research. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the research project will involve the installation of instruments to monitor meteorological, chemical, and hydrologic conditions at three caves spanning a near-coastal transect across northwestern Australia. Environmental variables (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure) in each cave will be integrated with meteorological and rainwater data (including rainfall amounts and stable isotopic compositions) collected at each site, along with the oxygen isotopic ratios of plate-grown spelean carbonate.  These data will help develop a holistic understanding of cave responses, both hydrologic and isotopic, to extreme rainfall events such as those that characterize many tropical cyclones.",

The Australian tropics are a burgeoning agricultural and ranching region, and are particularly sensitive to variability in precipitation. Computer climate model simulations project how rainfall is likely to change here in coming decades, but they have their limitations and biases. It is thus useful to pair climate models with reconstructions of past environments extracted from proxy records (e.g., tree rings, glacial ice) to evaluate what caused rainfall patterns to change over periods well beyond observational records.</p>\n<p>Reconstructing past tropical rainfall is often accomplished using stalagmites, and caves are abundant across many parts of tropical Australia. Stalagmites are most commonly composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), and the oxygen in stalagmites is derived almost entirely from infiltrating rainwater. In the tropics, the oxygen in rainwater contains a climate signal, with the ratio of heavy to light isotopes of oxygen (<sup>18</sup>O/<sup>16</sup>O) decreasing as monsoon rainfall increases. Thus, oxygen isotopes in stalagmites record past changes in monsoon strength. However, this relationship between rainfall amount and rainwater oxygen isotopes varies with latitude and with distance from the coast. Further complicating the situation is that across northern Australia, tropical cyclones (aka hurricanes) make irregular but large contributions to annual moisture budgets and can alter the isotope-amount effect. Finally, the way stalagmites preserve oxygen isotope ratios is partly a function of air circulation in caves and how the caves respond to extreme rainfall events.</p>\n<p>The PI and his students have used oxygen isotopes of stalagmites from tropical Australian caves to develop reconstructions of monsoon rainfall variability from the last glacial period and recent millennia. These studies are limited by uncertainties in the issues discussed above. Thus, the goal of the current study was to closely evaluate environmental conditions at three cave sites along a northeast-southwest transect in tropical and subtropical Western Australia (Figure 1). The caves, which are located near the towns of Kununurra (cave KNI-51), Fitzroy Crossing (Ball Gown cave), and Exmouth (Wanderer?s Delight, Star Chamber, and Cyclone caves), were analyzed for a suite of variables including temperature, relative humidity, and barometric pressure. Measurements were made at 15-minute intervals above and within each cave using a variety of data loggers, and water level was also measured in one cave (KNI-51) that contained evidence of frequent flooding. Drip rates were also mounted from the ceiling beneath stalactites to assess how infiltration into the cave responds to rainfall events. Daily rainwater measurements were made and samples collected by volunteers in the towns close to each site. These were returned to the United States, where oxygen isotope ratios were measured in each rainwater sample and compared to the amount of rainfall associated with that event in order to calculate the amount-isotope relationship. The PI and a total of seven Cornell College undergraduates visited the cave sites each summer between 2015 and 2019 in order to download data and reset the loggers, change batteries, replace malfunctioning loggers, retrieve rainwater samples, and make observations.</p>\n<p>The work produced by this grant yielded several findings important to the interpretation of Australian stalagmites. First, a robust relationship between rainfall amount and rainwater oxygen isotopes was identified in the two more northerly sites (Figure 2). Second, the caves were shown to retain high humidity during the seven month-long dry season and to experience limited temperature or barometric pressure variations (Figure 3). Third, the triggers of cave flooding at cave KNI-51 were documented and shown to be closely tied both to the intensity and duration of extreme rainfall events and also antecedent moisture; no flooding events occurred during an extreme rainfall event when the monsoon was anomalously weak. In addition, cave flooding events were shown to last for less than 48 hours, and thus do not interrupt stalagmite deposition for extended periods (Figure 3).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/09/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rhawn&nbsp;F&nbsp;Denniston</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1502917/1502917_10357499_1631230314220_Figure1-nocaption-small--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1502917/1502917_10357499_1631230314220_Figure1-nocaption-small--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1502917/1502917_10357499_1631230314220_Figure1-nocaption-small--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photographs of field areas.
