 "awd_abstract_narration": "Young life science researchers, after completion of their post-doctoral apprenticeship, may elect to begin their careers by either entering academia, or by joining biotechnology or pharmaceutical firms.   These choices clearly depend upon scientist?s individual preferences for salary and degree of research autonomy. However career choice is also affected by external constraints such as the availability of, and competition for, research funding.  Historically the amount of public research funding has changed over time reflecting congressional priorities. This project will provide the first quantitative evidence on the heretofore hidden costs and potential benefits of variability in the public funding of science research. Research funding variability may lead to a misallocation of talent and reforms that create more certainty in the budget allocation process could generate greater social benefits at lower costs. At the same time, research funding variability may increase the transmission of knowledge between academia and industry with potentially important policy implications for advancing scientific innovation, improving health and promoting economic growth. \r\n\r\nExogenous variation in the availability of public funding for research (both over time and across fields) is used to examine the initial career choice of recipients of elite postdoctoral fellowships in biology. These career choice constraints are then used in an instrumental variables framework to estimate the long-run consequences of this initial career choice, with a focus on both patent and publication outcomes. The degree to which scarce public R&D funding leads to positive productivity shocks for private sector firms who can more readily draw from the academic elite to staff their laboratories will also be directly assessed.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary goal of our project is to deepen our understanding of factors that influence the training of new scientists across institutional boundaries in order to advance scientific innovation and promote economic growth. We employ modern econometric methods in order to examine how organizational, institutional, and financial structures shape the career decisions of young scientists.\n\n \n\nOur understanding of the evolution of technological advances and economic growth depends, to a large degree, on where the most talented members of society &shy;&shy;&ndash; the \"best and the brightest\" &ndash; apply themselves.  Much of the scholarship on the topic of sorting (of ideas, or of individuals) into various sectors and professional capacities focuses on the contrasting role of pecuniary and non-pecuniary incentives.  Our results thus far suggest that young would-be innovators can be created through inducement subsidies, but that the benefit from confidence-building of the sort that is standard management practice in many firms appears to depend on the technical capabilities and intrinsic motivation of the scientists engaged in entrepreneurial activities.\n\n \n\nThis project sheds new light on the nature of personnel and information flows between academia and industry.  It also offers new insights on the nature versus nurture debates that pervade both popular and academic debates about entrepreneurship.  Since some young scientists appear to be held back by uncertainty about their ability to perform, efforts to help them overcome the psychological barriers that inhibit their participation could potentially enhance innovative output across a wide range of settings.   At the same time, encouragement must pay careful attention to the underlying aspirations of potential participants and whether extrinsic motivations might crowd out intrinsic ones.\n\n \n\nShould innovation policy and strategy limit its attention to optimizing conditions for the workforce already engaged in that space or might they be better served by designing institutions and incentives to lure more individuals into the fray? If incumbents and induced entrants differ in the quantity and quality of their innovative output, what is the optimal mix of efforts to expand the knowledge frontier? Understanding whether innovators can be created, and how they fare relative to those who self-select into innovative activities, has important implications for public and private policy and ultimately for the prosperity of those very institutions and societies that shape those investments.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/16/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Pierre Azoulay"
