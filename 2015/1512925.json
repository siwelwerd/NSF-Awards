 "awd_abstract_narration": "Density-stratified fluids support internal gravity waves due to the restoring force of buoyancy.  Although not as familiar as free-surface waves, internal waves in fact are ubiquitous in oceans, lakes, and the atmosphere.  In these natural settings, stratification is caused by temperature variations as well as changes in salinity (in oceans) and pressure (in the atmosphere).  Internal wave motion is inherently anisotropic because gravity provides a preferred direction.  As a result, energy is transported in the form of wave beams, which are the analogues of the familiar circular wave fronts in isotropic media.  Internal wave beams are of great geophysical interest because they form the backbone of the oceanic internal tide; moreover, in the atmosphere, they frequently arise due to thunderstorms.  In contrast to most prior studies, which assume strictly two-dimensional disturbances, this project is concerned with internal wave beams featuring three-dimensional variations, as expected in the field.  Motivation comes from recent findings, by the investigator's group and others, that suggest that the propagation of internal wave beams in three dimensions differs fundamentally from its two-dimensional counterpart.  Apart from making basic contributions to applied mathematics, this project is expected to also shed light on the role of the oceanic internal tide in momentum deposition, material transport, and deep-ocean mixing.  These processes affect climate dynamics, pollutant dispersal, and nutrient cycles.  A graduate student is included in the project.\r\n\r\nThis research effort advances theoretical modeling to gain a fundamental understanding of three-dimensional nonlinear internal wave beams, particularly the attendant resonant nonlinear interaction with induced mean flows that is central to three-dimensional wave beam dynamics.  Using asymptotic methods, nonlinear evolution equations are derived for three-dimensional beam propagation under conditions of geophysical interest, taking into account the effects of forcing, non-uniform background, dissipation, and the Earth's rotation.  These new mathematical models are analyzed by analytical and numerical means in order to understand beam-mean-flow nonlinear interactions from a mathematical and a physical perspective.  The theoretical study is supported by companion laboratory experiments that exploit recent advances in three-dimensional flow visualization.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project studied, via mathematical modeling and companion laboratory experiments, the following phenomena/processes in stratified flows: (i) nonlinear interaction of a three-dimensional (3D) internal gravity wave beam (IGWB) with its induced mean flow; (ii) mean-flow generation by 3D reflection of IGWB at a sloping boundary; (iii) effects of background mean flow on parametric subharmonic instability (PSI) of IGWBs; (iv) various instabilities of steep IGWBs.\n\nOverall, the main findings are: (i) mean potential vorticity (PV) plays a key role in 3D IGWB--mean-flow interaction; and (ii) the stability properties of IGWBs are markedly different from those of sinusoidal plane waves studied previously.  Specifically, in regard to (i), 3D IGWBs can generate strong mean flow of the \"streaming\" type due to irreversible production of mean PV by dissipation and nonlinear effects, whereas for other types of internal wave disturbances this mechanism is relatively weak.  Furthermore, the horizontal mean flow induced by 3D reflection of IGWB from a slope is controlled by mean PV dynamics.  In regard to (ii), the beam width and steepness are important factors in the stability of IGWBs.  Furthermore, the presence of background mean flow can weaken PSI of IGWBs dramatically.\n\nThe mathematical models developed in this project make novel contributions to the asymptotic analysis of the hydrodynamic equations of stratified flow.  Furthermore internal gravity waves play an important part in ocean and atmosphere dynamics.  The results obtained here advance fundamental understanding of the dynamics of the internal tide in oceans and the generation of atmospheric gravity waves due to thunderstorms.\n\nThe project also had significant impact on student education, particularly a graduate research assistant who completed his Master's and doctoral degrees with support from this grant.  Furthermore, the results of this research effort have been widely disseminated via several archival publications as well as presentations at university seminars and meetings in the US and abroad.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/04/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Triantaphyllos R Akylas"
