 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a time when our nation must think strategically, and globally, about how to use the resources of our planet. An important task is to predict the changes that this use will cause, so we can act wisely while flourishing as a community. The mechanical and chemical interactions of fluids throughout the earth's crust are believed to drive many geological and anthropogenic processes, the ramifications of which raise major societal concerns, from contaminating ground and surface water to triggering seismic activity and deformation. Time-lapse monitoring with seismic methods is an effective approach to recognize such variations in physical properties in the ground. However, quantitative interpretation of such data is not reliable for predicting changes that result from complex, dynamic interactions of thermal, chemical, and mechanical processes due to lack of fundamental laboratory data. Current models for the seismic response to pore fluid changes stem from a purely mechanical approach, which is inadequate for predicting the effects of coupled physical and chemical alterations. This is a challenging problem, because of its complexity and multi-disciplinary nature. A major shift is required in the way experiments are conceived so to dynamically track changes both in the rock and the fluid, and how they feedback upon each other. To succeed students also need to be trained across multi-disciplines as well as the design and operation of laboratory instruments-this task can be a mission by itself. Experimental investigation is an indispensable element of scientific inquiry and must play a central role in the way current and future generations of scientist make decisions. The objective of this project is thus twofold. It leverages research by integrating innovative experiments that simulate earth conditions and chemo-mechanical processes with a combination of measurements and computations on 3D printed models of CT-scanned rocks. The project also aims to broaden education opportunities through the creation of an online laboratory that can facilitate the process of learning experimental techniques and adapt its content to the high-tech student's lifestyle. The virtual laboratory reproduces in form and function the PI research laboratory at Stanford University through interactive, 3-D animated renderings of instruments used in a geophysics laboratory that students can virtually assemble and operate. The objective is to build the necessary infrastructure allowing students to appreciate more easily the dual functions of laboratory systems: learning what these systems do and how they work, and actually using them for future research endeavors. The project will provide fertile ground for a series of new technologies and cyber capabilities both in classes and research and help turn the complexity of laboratory work into dexterity, engagement, and expanded learning opportunities to anyone, anywhere. The overall goal is to make it possible to teach introductory laboratory classes in geoscience facilities lacking research laboratories and raise awareness of professional practices among early-stage or inexperienced students so that they can hit the ground running and efficiently take on the challenge of becoming future geoscientists.\r\n\r\nWhether the goal is fluid disposal or storage, the thermal and chemical stimulation of reservoirs, or healing or weakening processes across geothermal and seismogenic areas, real-time geophysical monitoring is emerging as a way to rapidly control processes at depth and turn data observations into decisions. The proposed research aims to improve our fundamental understanding of how to decipher changes in the earth's crust due to fluid movement and rock-fluid interactions using remote geophysical monitoring methods. Currently, quantitative interpretation of 4-D seismic data is not successful for predicting the behavior of dynamic systems underlying thermo-chemo-mechanical processes, because we lack fundamental laboratory data. Conventional laboratory experiments as well as models for seismic signatures of pore fluid changes stem from a purely mechanical approach, which is inadequate for predicting the effects of reactive transport fluids on the microstructural properties of the rock skeleton-the pore space of the rock deforms chemo-mechanically while the fluid reacts and flows through a deforming pore space. The innovative aspect of this proposal is to interlace the rock elastic properties with deformation and reactive transport flow through basic-science experimentation and multi-scale imaging. The proposed research will use laboratory experiments and time-lapse, multi-scale imaging to track both geochemical (fluid chemistry and flow, mass balance, pH) and physical parameters (transport and elastic properties, pressure buildup, dissolution-driven strain) in rocks during chemo-mechanical processes. This research will advance our knowledge by (a) measuring chemical and physical quantities continuously and simultaneously to truly couple cause and effect in the time domain and (b) complementing the experimental measurements with time-lapse, multi-scale imaging techniques to correlate the trends in the geophysical observables with the spatial changes occurring in the rock. The education component of the project leverages a current PI project to create a virtual laboratory through interactive, 3-D animated renderings of rock-physics instruments for the geophysics community. Complementing time-consuming high-pressure/high-temperature experiments and time-lapse imaging with the 3D printing of actual rock models is a way to open research to innovative tools, and possibly, to new learning perspectives through the skills of the high-tech students of this nation and abroad.",
