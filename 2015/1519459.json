 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project is to greatly improve the efficiency of hydraulic fracturing oil/gas wells in tight shale reservoirs and other highly heterogeneous oil/gas producing formations.   Such increase in efficiency will drastically reduce the quantity of fracture water required for the same oil/gas production.  This will yield reduced overall hydraulic fracturing effort for the same recovery of oil/gas, thereby much reducing the environmental impact and providing improved economics. The innovation will allow fracture growth manipulation to allow cutting across discontinuities such as bed/layer interfaces in some cases or to stop at an interface to limit fracture height growth in other cases.   Commercialization of the concept using new fracturing fluids and pumping techniques offers a large market opportunity for the several hundred billion dollars annual market. Increased  recovery  from  these  low  fluid  mobility  formations  is  critical  for  sustaining  the continued move toward energy independence, for maintaining the significant economic development being provided to the Nation, and for reducing the carbon footprint associated with recovering gas from these formations.   Additionally, this work will extend the scientific understanding of fluid driven fracture propagation, particularly in highly heterogeneous materials. The technology for true fracture manipulation is novel and offers the potential for a large step change.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this Phase I research project are to establish priorities for key parameters for new fracturing fluids and fracturing techniques that have been developed that would manipulate the fracture propagation in a desirable manner.   This will be accomplished by approximate modeling of hydraulic fracture propagation used for horizontal well completions, and validating with simple laboratory tests.  The research will include calculations in a practical manner of the transient fluid-driven fracture propagation considering the reservoir rock fabric. The calculations will vary key fracturing fluid properties, and based on the calculations laboratory tests will be conducted to validate predictions.  The fracturing fluid properties change will be accomplished by fluid variation and by pumping/injection schedule variations.   Manipulating the fracture propagation by using the fracturing fluid properties in collaboration with the reservoir rock fabric is unique.  In some cases the intent is to cause the fracture to step across a plane of weakness to proceed into another 'layer'.  In other cases it is desirable to cause the fracture to step-over and branch to create a more complex fracture network.  Still in other cases, it is desirable to limit the fracture extension by stopping at an interface and thus maintaining fracture height containment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEfficient Hydraulic Fracturing Fluid and Pumping Schedule for Fracture Manipulation in Highly Heterogeneous Formations\n\nPhase 1 SBIR  /  Sidney Green PI\n\nFor the recovery of oil and gas from tight shale formations, hydraulic fracturing well stimulation is required.  This is indeed a very large market in the US; at the peak of the shale development about 30,000 wells were hydraulically fractured in a twelve month period.  Each well required on average about four million gallons of liquid as the fracturing fluid, and cost $10-$12 million to drill and complete each well.\n\nMany, many calculations have been performed to model the hydraulic fracturing process, and sophisticated computer codes developed.  Theoreticians have tended to treat the reservoir rock as a continuum, homogeneous material, most often as elastic brittle.  On the other hand, practitioners have advanced the art greatly by trial-and-error techniques.  Clearly there is an opportunity to more accurately define the phenomena of fracturing near the fracture tip, and thus to provide 'game-changing' optimized hydraulic fracturing.\n\nUnfortunately optimization has not progressed well.  Industry--and researchers guided by what seemed to be the industry desire--have attempted to solve the complete problem of hydraulic fracture propagation, fluid flow in the fracture, defining the complex fracture geometry, handling (or just ignoring) rock-fluid interactions, calculating proppant transport, and defining fracture connectivity and conductivity all in one calculation.  And, doing such a calculation all in a short time, possibly even in 'real time'.  To do this rigorously is certainly not possible because of mathematical complexities, and because the rock and the insitu stresses are not well defined.  As a result, simplifications and approximations are made in order to yield an \"answer\" that is typically calibrated by perception and filed experience.  The final result is calibrating the calculation, as opposed to the calculation optimizing the actual process.\n\nDividing the probem into \"main dirvers\" and understanding each better based on rigorous physics and real rock and fluid properties yields opportunities that have been ignored.  In considering the main drivers, the key feature of the so called unconventional \"tight shales\" is their heterogeneity at all scales.  Considering this heterogeneity is key to improved understandings.\n\nThis research has pursued the main drivers, aiming for a commercial product of \"designer\" fracturing fluids that have critical properties--and matching the pumping schedule--to favorably manipulate the fracture propagation to achieve fracture height control in some cases or in other cases to deliberately cut across formation layer interfaces to connect different layers.  The fracturing fluid and how it is pumped certainly affect the created fracture.  Yet, to date the fracturing fluid properties have been considered primarily only in terms of its viscosity and its ability to carry proppant and leave a conductive fracture.\n\nThe first part of the research was to insure an adequate mental picture--a virtual model--of the process.  Careful review of expert modeling calculations--most for \"ideal\" materials, understanding of laboratory simulations, and knowledge of field fracturing and subsequent production observations have been combined to develop this virtual model.\n\nThe research then used the virtual model to allow \"first principle\" calculations of the main drivers and laboratory experiments to validate certain main driver consequences.  From this, new fracturing fluids--designer fluids--and pumping schedules can be applied to achieve the desired goal considering the formation properties and the insitu stresses as are known.  Such calculations and experiments will be undertaken in Phase 2 of the research.\n\nThe market opportunity for improved \"designer\" fracturing fluids and pumping is very large.  However, final commercialization will require demonstrat..."
