 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry is supporting Professor Cherice M. Evans at CUNY - Queens College and Professor Gary L. Findley at the University of Louisiana-Monroe to undertake complementary experimental and theoretical studies of the role of solvent structure in important chemical reactions.  Their work seeks improved understanding upon which to base better, more efficient, and less environmentally invasive chemical manufacturing and processing.  It is congruent with the aims of sustainable chemistry, including the principles that the use of solvents should be made unnecessary wherever possible, and solvents should be innocuous when used.   By involving graduate and undergraduate students from CUNY as well as undergraduates from Louisiana - Monroe (many of whom are from low-income families and are first generation college students), the work makes available exciting research opportunities intended not only to advance science, but to retain student interest and expand capabilities in STEM fields.  Some of the research utilizes synchrotron facilities at the Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices in Baton Rouge, LA, allowing all participating students to interact with scientists from a high caliber user facility, while introducing CUNY students to new aspects of United States culture in a Living/Learning community environment. The requirement that Monroe participants present their research results at Queens College ensures that these students will be exposed to a major urban environment -a first for many of these students.\r\n\r\nThe research specifically focuses on solvation of quasi-free electrons as probes of the solvent structure in the target media across the broad temperature and density range represented by these solvents.  The systems chosen for study include supercritical carbon dioxide, high temperature water, and supercritical water.  These solvents are targeted because their solvation properties can be adjusted by small changes in temperature and pressure, potentially enabling product isolation and solvent purification in a single step.  A free electron in solution makes an ideal probe of local solvent structure, and will help illuminate reactivity in these important media. Electrons with low energies are produced by field-enhanced photoemission from electrode surfaces in the solvent and the resulting current is detected with a second electrode.  Experiments are being conducted at a new synchrotron facility at the Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices in Baton Rouge, LA, and the resulting data are used to develop empirical models for the microscopic structure of the supercritical solvent systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe critical question being addressed in the research grant Quasi-free Electron Energy in Supercritical Carbon Dioxide and Water: A Research Program Involving Rural and First-Generation STEM Students was the role that the local structure plays in reactivity in supercritical solvents.  The goal was to investigate the local structure using a quasi-free electron photoemitted into supercritical carbon dioxide and in high temperature and supercritical water (primary fluid in supercritical oxidation of organic waste).\n\nWhile our group was equipped to study supercritical carbon dioxide using field enhanced photoemission, probing fluid structure in high temperature and supercritical water required the development of significant new equipment.  Window mounts, windows, gaskets, pressure gauges, electrical connections, photoemission material, fluid handling and the sample container all had to be redesigned to withstand extreme temperatures and pressures.  The final cell is shown in Figure 1 in comparison to the original low temperature medium pressure cell.  The bulky cell required significant engineering for the heating systems and, therefore, delays resulted.  All equipment is in the laboratory at Queens College and is ready for full assembly and testing.\n\nWhile equipment development was underway, we adapted the 3-meter normal incidence double tailed monochromator (NIM) at the Louisiana State University Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices for scanning spectroscopy.  This required changes in the data acquisition system, as well as servicing and realignment of the monochromator to improve reproducibility in the energy scan capability.  While these changes were successful, changes to the storage ring decreased reproducibility of electron beam position which, in turn, led to issues in the reproducibility of the energy scans on the 3-meter NIM.  We created standard operating protocols that allowed us to complete studies on the quasi-free electron energy in carbon dioxide and in carbon tetrafluoride.  The carbon tetrafluoride measurements show very different behavior than that observed in methane (cf. Fig. 2), which was surprising and indicates that additional studies of perfluorinated compounds are warranted.  Similarly, the carbon dioxide studies (cf. Fig. 3) showed a distinct quasi-free electron energy at low density and at high density, which indicates significant changes in the Gibbs free energy of solution in this fluid.  Both of these studies are in the process of final analysis for submission to peer reviewed journals by the end of Summer 2021.  Further studies of electron mobility in supercritical and near critical carbon dioxide would allow the Gibbs free energy to be quantified and would be worthwhile given the importance of supercritical carbon dioxide in green chemistry industrial processes. \n\nThe measurement of the quasi-free electron energy in carbon dioxide indicated that the higher temperatures led to a current leak between the photoemitter and the collector.  Probes of this thermionic emission (which was at a significantly lower temperature than a bulk platinum photoemitter would generate thermionic free electrons) indicated that this low temperature thermionic emission was sensitive to voltage and to the density of the fluid.  However, this leakage current creates significant problems in the acquisition and analysis of field enhanced photoemission.  Thus, further studies on this thermionic emission as a function of metallic film thickness, type of metal, electric field, and cell configuration will be required before successful measurements of the quasi-free electron energy in high critical temperature fluids (e.g., ammonia, water, and benzene) will be possible.  Thus, we designed and created a sample holder (cf. Fig. 4) to allow for the testing of thermionic emission from thin metallic films as a function of temperature up to a temperature of 800 K.  The initial studies of electrode configuration, metal thickness, and field/temperature effects -- which will be completed under low pressure (i.e., mbar) and then with up to 1 bar of argon (or dry nitrogen) in the chamber surrounding the cell -- were delayed due to COVID-19.  These studies will begin in Summer 2021.\n\nThe newly developed data acquisition procedures developed to investigate the low temperature thermionic emission from thin films also allowed for very accurate measurements of the dielectric constant in both carbon tetrafluoride and carbon dioxide, which are shown in Fig. 5.  These studies indicate significant critical point effects in the permittivity of fluids, which warrants additional future studies and modeling.  The initial theoretical work is in progress with a review of integral theory models for thermodynamic properties in preparation for submission in 2021 -- 2022.  An additional review paper on the quasi-free electron energy in atomic and diatomic systems is also in preparation for submission during the 2021 -- 2022 academic year.\n\nIn summary, this grant generated the equipment to allow for a variety of future studies on supercritical fluids of importance in green chemistry industrial applications, while supporting a significant number of undergraduate researchers (all of whom have remained in STEM fields).  Many of those future studies have been outlined in the outcome summary above.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cherice M Evans"
