 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines: African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion.  For the U.S. to remain globally competitive, it is vital that it taps into the talent of all its citizens and provides exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, namely to \"integrate education and research to support development of a diverse STEM workforce with cutting-edge capabilities.\"  The University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), lead institution of PROMISE: MD's Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) and the University System of Maryland (USM) LSAMP, will be the host site for the 2015-2017 USM BD Program. The activities of UMBC's program provide BD Fellows with a positive doctoral experience that includes meaningful initiatives such as professional leadership, community networking, and improved discipline-specific group and individual mentoring that have demonstrated positive impact on retention and successful graduation. Therefore, the efforts at UMBC will continue to contribute to increasing the diversity and representation in academia and the STEM workforce, thereby increasing the nation's competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe proposed training for the 2015-2017 cohort of BD Fellows is extensive. The academic departments at UMBC have enthusiastically embraced the BD Program and are true partners in the success of the BD Fellows who will be heavily mentored to ensure they receive strong academic and professional preparation. UMBC's BD Fellows are provided excellent training in core competencies in their disciplines. The BD Fellows will also have the opportunity, early in their academic careers, to conduct cutting-edge research with top research scientists on campus and at national laboratories located in close proximity to UMBC. The proposed activities such as the required university-wide and state-wide research presentations, and training for participation in national and international research efforts, provide the BD Fellows with creative ways to enhance their preparation for STEM careers. Furthermore, the planned training in leadership, teaching, and mentoring will position the fellows well for future faculty positions, or other areas of the STEM workforce. The team has worked cohesively to facilitate the success of BD Fellows since 2005 and Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) students since 2003. Since the first BD cohort matriculated at UMBC in 2005, 108 BD Fellows have enrolled in STEM graduate programs at UMBC and at the University of Maryland, College Park. USM BD Fellows have earned 9 STEM Ph.Ds. and 47 master's degrees; 63 Fellows are currently persisting in an MS or Ph.D. program (17 students in master's programs and 46 students in doctoral programs).",
