 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continuous drill cores from scientific ocean drilling provide an unparalleled insight into the Earth. The Rutgers Core Repository archives cores obtained during Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Legs 150X and 174AX, as well as site survey cores from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expeditions 303/306 and the International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 363. Drilling completed during Legs 150X and 174AX has provided an exceptionally well-documented series of continuous cores from the coastal plain, which have been the basis for over 100 scientific publications and continue to contribute insights into global sea-level change, sequence stratigraphy, basin tectonics and sedimentation, climate change, and major events in Earth History. During the time period that the Rutgers Core Repository has received NSF funding for curation of ODP and IODP legs, it was designated an official IODP Repository; acquired additional space and renovated ? purchasing two refrigerated core storage vans and building climate controlled dedicated core splitting and description laboratories; developed a website which includes links to metadata, datasets, and other repositories for ODP legs; developed exhibits for the Connecticut Science Center and the Rutgers Geology Museum, distributed over 4,000 samples from ODP and IODP cores, and provided many outreach activities for both the scientific community and the community at large.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported study and curation of International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) cores.  These cores provide continuous samples of sediments and rocks drilled from beneath the surface and are housed at the Rutgers University-IODP Core Repository.  The cores are mostly from IODP Legs 150X and 174X drilling of sands and muds of the U.S. Atlantic coastal plain that record paleoenvironmental changes of the past 100+ Million years.  Starting in 1993, drilling of 17 holes in the coastal plain in New Jersey, 1 in Delaware, and 1 in the Chesapeake Bay crater (Virginia) has provided an unprecedented core record that allowed determining the timing and magnitude of sea-level changes.  The cores also record major events in Earth history, including: 1) the Cretaceous/Paleogene boundary 66 million years ago (\"death of the dinosaurs\"); 2) the Paleocene/Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) 56 million years ago (potentially an analog to modern release of anthropogenic carbon dioxide release); 3) a massive carbon burial event of the Cenomanian/Turonian 93 million years ago; 4) the decent into the Icehouse world of the past 34 million years, with large ice volume and attendant sea-level variations that profoundly impacted ancient nearshore and continental shelf environments; and 5) Pliocene peak sea level during a time when atmospheric carbon dioxide levels were similar to modern.  We are the permanent \"library\" of these cores that are open to sampling by all qualified investigators.  This grant distributed over 2500 core samples in 2012-2015 and 1483 samples from 2016-2019 to investigators from all over the world and provided over 50 oral presentations to citizen groups and geologists.  In the three years of this grant, we published new results from the PETM at Wilson Lake, NJ and from the Cretaceous to Recent at Sandy Hook, NJ.  The Sandy Hook cores were used to evaluate past sea-level variations and to extend this knowledge to future sea-level projections. In particular, we show that the contributions to the sea level (highest to lowest) appears to be global rise, glacial isostatic adjustment, local/regional groundwater extraction, and compaction of thick Quaternary silts\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/15/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth G Miller"
