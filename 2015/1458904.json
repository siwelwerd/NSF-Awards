 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1\r\nThe research to be performed will help inform projections of regional and global mean sea-level rise as well as contribute to the climate change impacts assessment. The investigators will reconstruct the relative sea-level variability during the Common Era (~ last 2000 years) along the Atlantic coasts of Newfoundland and Florida and the Florida Gulf coast at higher resolution and in greater detail than is now available.  The investigators will work with the National Estuarine Research Reserves Coastal Training Program, the Rutgers Climate and Environmental Change Initiative, and Rutgers Cooperative Extension program to develop applied use of the information from this project. The project seeks to offer an Earthwatch IGNITE project to high school students to provide them with the opportunity to participate in field trips and experience the scientific research firsthand. Results will be showcased to the local community at Tufts Research Days and Rutgers Day, annual events held on campus which will allow the public to engage with the researchers. Undergraduate students will be involved in the research, in both field work and laboratory analysis. Two early-career investigators will be supported by this work and partial support will be provided for postdoctoral scientists from Rutgers University and Tufts University and for graduate students at Rutgers University and the University of Rhode Island. \r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\nThe proposed work will use geological proxies to reconstruct Common Era relative sea level variability along the Atlantic coasts of Newfoundland and Florida and the Florida Gulf coast at ~<0.2m vertical resolution and decadal-to-centennial temporal resolution. To estimate global mean sea level and the spatio-temporal field of eastern North American Common Era relative sea level, the new relative sea level reconstructions will be combined with existing relative sea level reconstructions and tide gauge measurements in an empirical Bayesian statistical framework. The data and statistical model would be used to test the following research questions: 1) whether sea level along the North American Atlantic and Gulf coasts has varied as a direct consequence of a warmer climate during the Medieval Climate Anomaly and cooler climate during the Little Ice Age; 2) whether spatial variability of sea level during the Common Era can be attributed to static-equilibrium effects of land ice changes and/or ocean dynamics; 3) whether Earth models with depth-varying Earth structure are sufficient to capture the spatio-temporal geometry of Glacial Isostatic Adjustment along the east coast of North America; and 4) whether the rate of sea-level rise since ~1850 in eastern North America has been greater than any other centennial trend during the previous two millennia. The proposed work is of significant societal relevance as it will provide more accurate data for use in the projections of regional and global mean sea-level rise as well as contribute to the climate change impacts assessment.",

This limitation prevents accurate assessment of the relationship between temperature and global mean sea level (GMSL) during the Common Era, including the sea-level response to temperature change during climate intervals such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly, the Little Ice Age, and the modern anthropogenic climate change.\n\nWe used geological proxies to reconstruct relative sea-level variability at seven sites along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America from Newfoundland to the Florida Keys (Figure 1) at &plusmn;&lt;0.2 m vertical resolution and decadal-to-centennial temporal resolution. We mapped the sediment preserved beneath salt marshes using a large number of hand-driven cores and selected one of these cores from each site for detailed laboratory analysis.  Radiocarbon dating of the sediment cores coupled with recognition of pollution and land-use markers of known age (e.g., the introduction and phasing out of leaded gasoline) established when the sediment was deposited.  The remains of microorganisms that can only live in saltwater (foraminifera) were counted and identified to the species level in each core to tell us how high sea level was in the past.  Together the core chronology and foraminifera enabled us to reconstruct relative sea-level changes at each of the sites during the Common Era.  Each reconstruction took approximately 1&ndash;2 years of field work and laboratory analysis.  A key result is that there was little sea-level variability in Florida and the Gulf of Mexico until the onset of modern, accelerated rates of rise in the late 1800s or early 1900s.

The geographic distribution of these sites is important for explaining why sea-level varied across space and through time because key physical processes that cause sea-level change (e.g., melting of land-based ice, vertical land motion, and redistribution of existing ocean mass by ocean currents and prevailing winds) have a distinctive geographic fingerprint.

The new records and compiled database of sea-level reconstructions are archived at NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI): https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/19823.

A residential Earthwatch IGNITE gave high school students first-hand experience of fieldwork.  We worked with K&ndash;12 educators by visiting local schools, contributing to teacher-development workshops, and participating in programs such as Pop-Up Science Encounters and STEM weeks.  We gave talks to public audiences such as the New Jersey Society of American Military and served on the Boston Research Advisory Group to help the city plan for future sea-level rise.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin P Horton"
