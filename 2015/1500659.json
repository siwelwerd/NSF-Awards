That is the hypothesis that Racquel Sapien Yamada of the University of Oklahoma (Norman) will test by implementing a new collaborative fieldwork model which extends the notion of community-inclusive field research by facilitating the documentation of one endangered language (Lokono) by native and heritage speakers of another (Kari'nja).\r\n\r\nKari'nja and Lokono (Arawak-arw) speakers live side-by-side in the Konomerume village of Suriname.  They often intermarry.  Data on Lokono and Karinja will elucidate the processes of language contact evidenced between these two languages.  The data will also help the place of Lokono (Arawakan family) and Kari'nja (Cariban family) within their respective language families. Yamada and her team will document, analyze, and describe aspects of Lokono to further investigate these issues.\r\n\r\nThis project is at the forefront of a greater movement to encourage members of endangered language communities to play more active roles in research that affects them.  The project team will provide training to build local infrastructure for future documentation.  A graduate student from the University of Oklahoma will receive field research and international experience through participation in the project.\r\n\r\nThe project is supported by co-funds from the National Science Foundation's International Science and Engineering Office.",
