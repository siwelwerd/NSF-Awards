 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting Professor John Protasiewicz of Case Western Reserve University to prepare conjugated main group element compounds to investigate how the identity of the heavier elements influence their photophysical properties (light absorption and light emission). This work focuses on the synthesis of compounds with group 15 elements such as phosphorus, antimony and bismuth.  The investigation of conjugated systems allows the design of new materials that display unusual fluorescence and phosphorescence properties, which can aid the design and development of materials with potentially high impact in the energy, display, and lighting industries. Professor Protasiewicz will integrate the research and educational components of this project by working with a UNCF-Merck funded postdoctoral fellow, under the auspices of the university's the Leonard Gelfand STEM Center, to carry out a series of outreach and STEM activities to promote diversity in the sciences.  Graduate and undergraduate students will receive education and training in interdisciplinary areas.\r\n\r\nIn this research, new methods will be developed for the synthesis of conjugated main group compounds. As the electronic structure of conjugated materials is highly tunable by synthetic manipulation, a range of photophysical and redox properties will be accessed. This research will facilitate the design of materials that are photo- and electro-luminescent. Their individual electronic properties will be investigated and characterized, with particular attention to materials of potential interest for OLED and photovoltaic applications. Organo-bismuth compounds may offer materials that are phosphorescent and that are less toxic, sustainable, and more economical than related compounds having heavy transition metal elements.  A number of heterocyclic compounds feature unusual main group-carbon double bonds.  Photo-physical properties will be correlated with structural and theoretical results.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes\n\n1.  Intellectual Merit\n\n    This project has sought new synthetic strategies to prepare photoresponsive materials, which could lead to better understanding of light emitting technology and how matter influences the interconversion of light and energy.  Our approach is based upon developing novel materials based on main group elements.  These systems also exhibit novel reactivity and bonding modes that can advance and create new paradigms in photophysical chemistry.   This research builds upon past successes in multiply-bonded organophosphorus chemistry from the PI's labs, and ventures into new areas such as dynamic carbene chemistry, electropolymerization, and fluorescence turn-on chemosensors.  Luminescent  1,3-benzoxaphopsholes (BOPs) and 1,3-benzazaphopsholes (BAPs) were examined.  Some key outcomes include (a) development of new relationships between heterocyclic organophosphorus ring structures &amp; photophysics [Figure 1],(b) development of new routes to &pi;-conjugated materials [Figure 2], and (c) new uses of isolable carbenes to modulate photophysics of &pi;-conjugated materials [Figure 3].  The results also reveal that materials featuring main group elements have novel properties different from their all organic counterparts.  These properties offer opportunities to create new types of advanced functional materials that include organic conjugated polymers &amp; molecules, molecular electronics, OLEDs, OPVs, flexible electronics, and various energy conversion technologies.  The reversible reaction of isolable carbenes with NH functional groups, an unanticipated outcome of the project, offers unique opportunities to develop new fluorescent turn-on sensory materials.\n\n    The PI has presented results from this project as an invited speaker at numerous national and international meetings and conferences.  The students and postdocs have also presented research outcomes a national meetings.  The project results have been published in nine papers thus far, with several more being finalized.  \n\n    The research outcomes were achieved, in part, by numerous productive local, national, and international collaborations. \n\n \n\n2. Broader Impacts\n\n    Our research outcomes have impacted a broad spectrum of scientific fields, including photophysical chemistry, synthetic inorganic chemistry, fundamental aspects of main group chemistry, and &pi;-conjugated materials chemistry.  The science behind this project also impacts the greater field of advanced functional materials that includes organic conjugated polymers &amp; molecules, molecular electronics, organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaics (OPVs), flexible electronics, and various energy conversion technologies.  \n\n    The interdisciplinary nature of our research program has led to broad training to participants in main group, inorganic, and photophysical chemistry.  The students and postdocs trained and educated as part of this research program are needed as part of the country's highly skilled workforce in industry and education.  Among skills they have learned include synthesizing and characterizing new classes of photoactive main group compounds and materials.  They have also learned critical thinking and writing and communication skills.  At least six graduate students, seven undergraduate students, two high school students, and two postdoctoral associates have received training while working on this project.  One postdoctoral associate received both United Negro College Fund-Merck Postdoctoral Science Research and Ford Foundation Fellowships and was active in collaborations with researchers at the ETH in Z?rich, Switzerland, spending one year at the ETH and one year at CWRU.  This former postdoc is now an assistant professor at University of Virginia. The PI has been very active in the chemical community and was the Secretary for the Division of Inorganic Chemistry (DIC) of the ACS from 2010-2015 that served a broad community of students, faculty, and industrial chemists.  From 2016-2018 he served as Chair-Elect, Chair, and past-Chair for DIC.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John D Protasiewicz"
