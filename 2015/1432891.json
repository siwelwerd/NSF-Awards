These alliance schools will also partner with Central State University and Tuskegee University. This project was created in response to the NSF's Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program solicitation (NSF 14-505) for the AGEP-Transformation (AGEP-T) track. The AGEP-T track targets strategic alliances of institutions and organizations to develop, implement, and study innovative evidence-based models and standards for STEM graduate education, postdoctoral training, and academic STEM career preparation that eliminate or mitigate negative factors and promote positive practices for underrepresented minorities (URMs). The NOA-AGEP project will develop, implement, and study a model to improve URM student participation, preparation, and success in BCE graduate education, and to prepare them for entry into the professoriate\r\n\r\nThis AGEP-T project will uniquely contribute to foundational knowledge about the recruitment, retention and graduation of doctoral URMs in BCE. The emphasis on inclusive graduate education, an \"umbrella\" of supports for graduate students, and extensive diversity training for BCE faculty and staff offers an exceptional opportunity for a regional group of universities with low URM STEM doctoral student enrollment to investigate the promotion of inclusive policies, practices and initiatives.  The lessons learned as this project progresses, and the ultimate results from the work, will provide information that will be beneficial to educators, administrators and policymakers, as well as the general public.",

NOA-AGEP is a consortium of seven STEM PhD-granting universities: Bowling Green State (BGSU), Case Western Reserve (CWRU), Cleveland State (CSU), Kent State (KSU), Akron (UA), Toledo (UT), and Youngstown State (YSU).</p>\n<p><strong>The Cohort</strong></p>\n<p>NOA-AGEP recruited 32 African American and Hispanic/Latine American Scholars who matriculated at an Alliance PhD program in biological sciences, chemistry, or engineering in 2016 and 2017 to form the Scholar cohort. At the conclusion of the NOA-AGEP NSF award, 6 Scholars had completed their dissertations and 21 plan to graduate by the end of the next academic year.</p>\n<p><strong>The Model</strong></p>\n<p>NOA-AGEP leveraged the unique campus communities across the Alliance to share current successes and challenges in supporting URM STEM doctoral students through graduate school and into the professoriate. This resulted in an Alliance model in two parts: Professional Development and Institutional Engagement.</p>\n<p><strong>Professional Development</strong></p>\n<p><em>Bridge Weekend</em> occurred over three days at the end of the summer in 2016 and 2017 to induct new Scholars into the NOA-AGEP community, allow Scholars to forge and expand connections with peers, faculty, and administrators, and become oriented to NOA-AGEP goals, values, and strategies. Activities included a Diversity 360 session (details below), discussion panels on URM graduate student success, URM STEM faculty keynote speakers, group coaching, and open dialogue on the NOA-AGEP project.</p>\n<p><em>Academic Coaching</em> inspires, develops and supports Scholars for realizing their academic and career-life goals; recognizing and leveraging their unique strengths, characteristics and realities; and engaging in proactive, intentional development of academic, research and leadership competencies that lead to learning, performance and success. The coaching process explores a Scholar passion for STEM, expectations for the doctoral journey, and ideal self, including reflection on their core values, career-life aspirations, and personal vision. Scholars participated in an individual and a group coaching session each semester.</p>\n<p><em>Mentor Circles</em> provided a purposeful network of support to our Scholars. NOA-AGEP recruited mentors from various roles associated with an academic research career: faculty, postdoc, senior graduate student, university administration, and industry. Participants attend a plenary event to explore mentorship best practices, establish group norms and expectations of the mentor/mentee relationship, and begin identifying the circle of mentors for each mentee. Each Scholar Mentor Circle contained 4-6 mentors with a commitment to engage with their mentee at least once per semester.</p>\n<p><em>Annual Research Symposia</em> integrated URM STEM-specific programming within larger research conferences on Alliance campuses. Hosting duties rotated around the Alliance and focused on a new theme each year, leading to unique and varied activities for Scholars. In addition to traditional research conference participation, Scholars attended NOA-AGEP-specific keynote and breakout sessions to cover topics in support of that year theme. These themes included Tools for Academic Conference Success (UT 2017), Roles of a STEM Scholar and Mentor (YSU 2018), Thriving in the STEM Professoriate (CWRU 2019), and Beyond the PhD (KSU, 2020; postponed to 2021 due to COVID-19).</p>\n<p><em>UA activities</em>: The annual Rethinking Race STEM speaker allowed Scholars to meet and interact with a URM speaker/role model. Collaborations with American Chemical Society Project SEED allowed Scholars to informally mentor high school students.</p>\n<p><strong>Institutional Engagement</strong></p>\n<p><em>Diversity 360</em> provided customized modules for a campus community to advance its efforts to be a welcoming, inclusive environment for learning, leading, and innovation. Representatives from each Alliance campus visited the CWRU campus in February 2016 to participate in a day-long train-the-trainer session to deeply explore the Diversity 360 model, and Co-PI Marilyn Mobley later visited Alliance campuses to present Diversity 360 with these collaborators. Scholars, NOA-AGEP leadership, and other Alliance community members have since participated in Diversity 360 sessions. Beginning with an exchange of information about campus culture and on-going initiatives with chief diversity officers across the Alliance, the Diversity 360 modules engaged participants in learning to: increase capacity to recognize and engage in dialogue across the breadth of differences; deepen understanding of how affiliations in privileged and marginalized groups impact treatment on campus, campus climate and productivity; deepen awareness of types of microaggressions and how they affect experiences on campus and in the local community; and discover ways to become a change agent and diversity champion with new knowledge, ideas and resources about university policies, programs and best practices.</p>\n<p><em>Diversity Scorecard</em> examined the Scholar experience related to the non-AGEP graduate student experience via a survey on each campus. Students self-reported all data across five question blocks related to: Demographics, Milestones Reached, Professional Development, Program Experience/Climate, and Campus Climate. The survey was sent in recurring years to see progression of students through their programs. Results led to internal examination of our institutional practices and consideration of programmatic changes in the academic climate.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/26/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Claire&nbsp;A&nbsp;Tessier</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1432891/1432891_10395706_1632492761831_1BridgeWeekend--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1432891/1432891_10395706_1632492761831_1BridgeWeekend--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bridge Weekend\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1432891/1432891_10395706_1632492761831_1BridgeWeekend--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bridge Weekend\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">AGEP Scholars at NOA-AGEP Bridge Weekend, summer 2017</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Claire Tessier</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Claire&nbsp;A&nbsp;Tessier</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bridge Weekend</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1432891/1432891_10395706_1632664691405_2017-02-UA-NOA-AGEP-Scholars--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1432891/1432891_10395706_1632664691405_2017-02-UA-NOA-AGEP-Scholars--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UA NOA-AGEP Scholars, Feb 2017\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1432891/1432891_10395706_1632664691405_2017-02-UA-NOA-AGEP-Scholars--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UA NOA-AGEP Scholars, Feb 2017\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UA NOA-AGEP Scholars, Feb 2017</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">UA NOA-AGEP Scholars, Feb 2017</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Claire&nbsp;A&nbsp;Tessier</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UA NOA-AGEP Scholars, Feb 2017</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1432891/1432891_10395706_1632664952223_2018-YSUPosterSessionA-NoNames--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1432891/1432891_10395706_1632664952223_2018-YSUPosterSessionA-NoNames--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"April 2018 YSU Poster session\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1432891/1432891_10395706_1632664952223_2018-YSUPosterSessionA-NoNames--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"April 2018 YSU Poster session\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A UA NOA-AGEP scholar presents her poster at the YSU poster session, April 3, 2018</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Claire Tessier</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Claire&nbsp;A&nbsp;Tessier</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">April 2018 YSU Poster session</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1432891/1432891_10395706_1632667426110_2020-03-0220.57.11--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1432891/1432891_10395706_1632667426110_2020-03-0220.57.11--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"After the 2020 Rethinking Race presentation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1432891/1432891_10395706_1632667426110_2020-03-0220.57.11--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"After the 2020 Rethinking Race presentation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">NOA-AGEP Scholars and UA PI with the 2020 Rethinking Race speaker</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Claire Tessier</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Claire&nbsp;A&nbsp;Tessier</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">After the 2020 Rethinking Race presentation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
