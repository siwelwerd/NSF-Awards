 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will conduct a study of fundamental questions in function theory and operator theory using the tools and techniques of harmonic analysis.   The project will address important questions now open to exploration because of recent advances made by the principal investigator and his collaborators.  Resolution of these problems raised will find applications in function theoretic operator theory and yield new tools and techniques that can be adopted by the larger analysis community.  The principal investigator will advise graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, include them in the proposed research projects, and provide mentoring, in order to assist them in transitioning to the next stage of their careers.  Broad dissemination of the results will take place by participation in conferences and posting of the research to the arxiv preprint server.\r\n\r\nThis project will combine recent results of the principal investigator with motivation from function theory and operator theory to study questions related to the two-weight Hilbert transform and properties of model spaces.  The first research direction to be explored couples the results of the principal investigator with questions about boundedness and invertibility properties of products of Toeplitz operators.  In particular, the problems to be studied are aimed at obtaining a better understanding of the composition of paraproducts and determining necessary and sufficient conditions for their boundedness.  Connections to the two-weight inequality for the Hilbert transform suggest related problems to investigate.  Resolving the proposed problems will provide more insight into the recent characterization of the two-weight inequality for the Hilbert transform and related properties for Toeplitz operators on the Hardy space.  An additional research direction, based upon the principal investigator's recent results and their connection to the description of the Carleson measure for model spaces, will be pursued.  The open question of obtaining a characterization of the Riesz bases for model spaces leads to problems related to reverse Carleson measures for the model spaces, and their relation to two-weight inequalities for the Cauchy and Hilbert transforms.  Additional directions of investigation connect to bilinear forms and commutators on model spaces.",
