The work is supported by the Course Social and Cognitive Engagement (CSCE) Framework.  The expected outcomes of this project are: (1) an exploratory framework for how engineering faculty make choices and engage in evaluation processes; (2) a deeper understanding of processes that underlie cognitive and social engagement in engineering classrooms; and, (3) a valid and reliable CSCE instrument with modular subscales to measure student engagement of STEM education.",

NSF Award# 1544103\n\n \n\nProject Title: Collaborative Research: An Instrument and Adoption Framework for Student Cognitive and Social Engagement with a Course.\n\n \n\nRecipient Organization: Washington State University \n\nProject/Grant Period: 01/01/2016 - 12/31/2019\n\nPrincipal Investigator: Olusola Adesope\n\n \n\nThis project addressed three key goals: (1) developed, assessed, and validated instruments to measure cognitive and social engagement in the field of engineering; (2) developed an understanding of how engineering faculty engage in measurement of their teaching practices by using the instruments we developed; and (3) propagate research findings with the framework and instruments developed.\n\n \n\nTwo instruments were developed to address the first goal of the project.

However, the disengagement factor suggests students might be completely disengaged from the tasks. This is an important theoretical extension of the ICAP framework. In addition, a key outcome of this project is the development of the social engagement instrument. Social interactions with peers have long been recognized as one of the critical factors for facilitating the learning process. Such social and interpersonal skills are ranked by employers as the highest expectation for construction engineering and management students to possess upon entry into the workplace. The interaction is critical for construction engineering students for building their collaborative skills and abilities of common goals, communication, coordination, and cooperation (4Cs). The survey tool we developed measures the network and social connection aspect of student-student interactions and student- teacher to represent in- and out-of-class individual student social belonging.\n\n \n\nA study was conducted to address the second goal of the project. Specifically,  we investigated the adoption process of the engagement survey using the sensemaking framework and found that faculty had specific needs related to their interests in student engagement that were not all met with the cognitive engagement survey. Based on findings from the sensemaking study, researchers are working on modifying the surveys to be more broadly adopted by practitioners, while simultaneously ensuring validity and reliability of the surveys. \n\n \n\nThe third goal of the project was to propagate research findings with the framework and instruments developed.
