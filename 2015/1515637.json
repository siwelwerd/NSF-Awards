 "awd_abstract_narration": "Semiconducting polymers promise to deliver low cost electronic devices such as solar cells and transistors due  to  their  easy  processabililty.  Fabrication  conditions  have  been  identified  that  allows poly(3-hexyl thiophenes) (P3HT), an extensively studied semiconducting polymer, to crystallize into nanowires  (NWs),  which  can  improve  a  solar  cell?s  efficiency.  This project  aims  to  understand  the assembly of P3HT into NWs. Both the NW alignment and the orientation of the polymer chains with respect to the substrate are crucial parameters to control for ensuring efficient transport of charges in solar cells. In order to characterize the structural features of the NWs, near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS), a highly specialized  technique  capable of proving  the molecular  orientation  of thin films down to monolayers of the material will be used. Dr. Kilwon Cho, an expert in surface and electronic device characterization at Pohang University of Science and Technology, will be the host for this research, providing a U.S. graduate student vital access and expertize for NEXAFS analysis.\r\n\r\nThis  project  will  focus  on  the  surface  crystallization  of  P3HT  from  graphene  deposited  on supporting   substrates.   Utilizing  a  metastable   solution  of  P3HT,  with  a  strong  driving  force  for crystallization that is not sufficient to induce homogenous crystallization, NWs of P3HT will be formed selectively on graphene.  During the crystallization, the polymer chains in solution interact with graphene and the underlying substrate. A systematic study of the NW growth from graphene deposited on modified substrates  employing  surface  characterization  techniques  such  as  NEXAFS  will  unveil  the  surface properties   and  the  morphology   evolution   of  P3HT.  This will help us determine   the  effects  of intermolecular forces on the P3HT crystallization. Ultimately, the beneficial effects of the NWs will be assessed by the fabrication and characterization of solar cells. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.\r\n\r\nThis award is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea.",
