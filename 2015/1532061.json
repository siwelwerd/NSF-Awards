 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, developing a new integrated instrument for neuroimaging and brain mapping, based on specialized software and unique hardware designs, aims to elicit new understanding of the functional mappings of the brain in its normal and pathology states focusing on key neurological disorders. Envisioning the brain in terms of the structural, functional, and brain connectivity maps under fully integrated recording modalities breaks the barriers of very challenging time and space alignments. This also bridges scientific premises in building system designs and novel software techniques that improve the delivery of patient-care in terms of enhanced diagnosis as well as well-thought-out treatment protocols. The work focuses on challenging neurological disorders of epilepsy, Alzeimer's disease and Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD-ADHD) and related cognitive challenges so as to provide effective subject-centric care. The general construct of the software algorithms and the hardware components of this instrument facilitates research endeavors and applications that extend to other neurological disorders (such as Parkinson) to be addressed using novel hardware interfaces and related software modules and protocols. \r\n\r\nThis project utilizes a unique approach at collecting data in a fully integrated setting across different recording modalities to elicit new understanding of the functional mapping of the brain and in delineating normal state from the specific pathology state of these challenging neurological disorders. It performs pioneering work on integration in a same setting of non-invasive navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) for mapping the eloquent cortex and instigating new protocols with embedded alignments and full registration to                                                                                                         \r\n  -\tNeuro-navigation and pre-surgical evaluation,  \r\n  -\tAnatomical and functional MRI for MRI/fMRI-guided magnetic stimulation, and\r\n  -\tMicrocoil designs embedded into MRI and fully integrated with EEG electrodes for pinpointed TMS-MRI-fMRI and EEG integration, all of which are to yield a fully integrated instrument with the ability to augment capabilities for mapping, analysis, and diagnosis, followed by elaborate intervention and treatment protocols for these different neurological disorders.",

Through this NSF support, the research goals we address are also of great interest to NIH, and consequently, we were able to leverage NIH support as well as support from Hospitals nationwide in the collection of large datasets in both Alzheimer?s disease (AD) and epilepsy that are providing added statistical meaningfulness with the inclusion of a large number of Hispanics and African Americans, which is much needed given the current demographics of the available databases for research.

The research environment of such an instrument extends the scientific reach of these interdisciplinary efforts to overcome the primary barriers in identifying the different factors that influence the functional organization of the brain in both its healthy and diseased states, as new imaging, machine learning, and deep learning paradigms are designed to benefit the scientific community as a whole and provide critical help to hundreds of patients yearly through enhanced diagnosis and prognosis. Another unique aspect of this instrument is the design of new visualization mechanisms, as we consider the adage \"a picture is worth a thousand words\" together with the challenges imposed by the variability and complex choreographies of brain activity patterns that would allow us to understand brain function in its healthy state and to delineate all forms of disturbances or dysfunctions due to the disease state itself.&nbsp; It is thus incumbent upon us to create novel machine learning architectures together with new visualization mechanisms that could serve as a tool that augments the prospects for a more informed decision process in making a diagnosis and prognosis. This cross-disciplinary work together with our common research goals is bringing engineers and computer scientists to work alongside medical experts in finding solutions to these yet to be understood brain disorders. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although the design construct of this instrument focuses on brain research in direct relation to epilepsy and Alzheimers disease, its modular structure could extend to other application domains involving other neurological disorders and health related issues where imaging, neuropsychological testing, genetics, physiological recordings, and other risk factors are part of any subjects critical care. Our vision from inception was to develop methodologies and systems that could extend to other health domains and other fields of critical need to the nation. With the generalized concepts framed within our software developments and hardware designs, we were able to extend our application domains to depression, Parkinsons disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and other cognition-related health issues. Perhaps a unique feature of this instrument is the inclusion of therapeutic interventions through repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to offer FDA approved early interventions to slow down disease progression in neurodegenerative diseases and to reduce or eliminate (in an optimal scenario) the occurrence of seizures in subjects with epilepsy, and help other subjects overcome or alleviate their depression. Hence, this instrument includes uique design aspects of non-invasive brain stimulation protocols with well-planned sessions to be conducted on patients with epilepsy and depression, ongoing at present, and to expand these protocols for improving cognition in diseases such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the early stages of Alzheimers disease.
