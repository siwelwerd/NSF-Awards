The conference covers topics such as random structures and algorithms, random graphs and networks, probabilistic combinatorial optimization, and concentration inequalities. \r\n\r\nThe conference brings together a diverse set of speakers and participants in probability theory and combinatorial optimization, and it is devoted to discuss how to make progress on some of the most important questions in the field. The conference tentatively features eleven talks delivered by exceptional scholars alongside with a number of short presentations delivered by graduate students, postdocs, and other young researchers. The conference seeks to facilitate the interaction between the new generations of mathematicians and the key figures of the field. The conference organizers are committed to trying to help advance the careers of graduate students, postdocs, women, minorities and other young researchers in the field. Priority for financial support will be given to several members of such groups. \r\n\r\nMore information is available on the conference website at http://sites.duke.edu/steele2015/.",
