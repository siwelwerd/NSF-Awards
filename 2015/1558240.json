 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently, the access to microscopes is limited to laboratories. Although there are low cost microscopes, these microscopes are generally of a low optical quality, and are quite bulky to carry around.  In many cases, these microscopes only work with samples mounted on glass slides before being able to see what needs to be seen. This I-Corps team believes there is an untapped market for customers who want to bring around their own microscopes, both for curiosity and for professional purposes. By coupling with a wireless-ready device, the proposed technology ?DotLens Microscopy? enables easy sharing and documentation. The primary motivation of the project is to enhance K-12 STEM education in the US. DotLens microscopy will enrich the current science curriculum by lowing the barrier of access to microscopes, both in the classroom and in the field, thereby improving teaching effectiveness and student learning.  Ultimately, DotLens microscopy may help inspire a new generation of children and young adults to consider STEM fields as their future career path, by demonstrating the transformation of a smartphone into a microscope. The simplicity, versatility and flexibility of DotLens microscopy on virtually any camera-ready mobile electronic devices will enable a wide range of innovative formal and informal education activities. As for industrial and professional applications, DotLens microscopy provides imaging quality competitive to professional imaging systems at a fraction of the cost and weight.\r\n\r\nDotLens is a revolutionary polymer lens that can transform any smartphone or tablet camera into a microscope with a magnification from 5 to 150 times and resolution approaching 1/100th the width of a hair. DotLens can be simply attached to any camera port in a fashion similar to contact lens for human eyes, and its microscopy capabilities can find a variety of applications, for example, vision aid for the elderly, biological imaging, and classroom usage in K-12 education. DotLens is manufactured by a proprietary 3D printing method, producing high quality lenses with precise magnification. The team's goal is to refine the market research and develop strategies to address individual vertical segments, including pricing analysis, competitor analysis, distribution channels, etc. The team will engage in interviewing potential users such as researchers, academicians, students, teachers, and other professionals their user experience and acceptance. Ultimately, the team would like to introduce DotLens microscopy to the international arena, and provide it at affordable cost for all whom can benefit from it.",
