 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human influences on the environment have transformed natural vegetation and altered natural fire regimes, leaving researchers and land managers with an incomplete understanding of natural fires and their response to changes in vegetation and environment.  This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate long-term vegetation and fire interactions in response to Holocene environmental variability.  This project will provide a better understanding of past interactions among fire activity, vegetation, and environment on the U.S. southeastern coastal plain.  The research project will provide new insights regarding the modeling of ecosystem responses to future environmental change, and it will identify past environmental changes that may have affected prehistoric societies.  The project will inform land managers who are conserving and restoring imperiled plant communities dominated by fire-dependent longleaf pine, an economically and environmentally important tree species.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\nThe restoration, conservation, and management of longleaf pine forest ecosystems has gained recent importance because of their commercial and environmental value. The conservation and management of these imperilled ecosystems requires an understanding of the long-term histories of vegetation and fire as well as their interrelationships with environmental change.  The doctoral student will investigate historical natural fire activity and its response to past changes in the composition of vegetation.  He will analyze pollen and stable carbon isotope ratios in sediments for evidence of temporal changes in vegetation composition, and he will analyse stable carbon isotopes to identify past drought intervals.  The quantification of these biophysical properties will document changes in fire activity and fuel sources.  These analyses of changes in vegetation, fire activity, and the environment during the Holocene will provide new insights into conditions analogous to those predicted under current environmental change scenarios.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLogging, land clearance, and modern fire suppression efforts have transformed the natural vegetation and altered fire regimes throughout the southeastern United States, leaving us with an incomplete knowledge of natural fire activity and its response to past changes in vegetation and climate.  This lack of knowledge impairs restoration and management planning and hampers efforts to accurately predict potential ecosystem responses to future changes in climate.  We studied pollen, charcoal, and other indicators of environmental change at two sites to better understand the effects that changes in vegetation and fire had on the landscape, how each has influenced the other through time, and how climate has influenced these changes.  \n\nAt a small spring-fed wetland in western Tennessee, we found sediment deposits dating back almost 8000 years.  Analysis of the sediments revealed evidence for increasingly waterlogged conditions as the site transitioned from an area with well-drained, silty soil to a wetland characterized by peat deposition.  This shift to wetter conditions came during a period of time known as the middle Holocene (8200 to 4200 years ago).  During this interval, climates in the southeastern United States west of the Appalachian Mountains have been characterized as generally warmer and drier, with an increase in drying with increasing distance westward, making this site rather unique.  Charcoal abundance appears to correspond with changes in climate, as fire activity increased with increased evidence of aridity and drought.  Pollen analysis reveals that during the middle Holocene, an oak-hickory forest with an understory dominated by sedges and ferns grew near the site, very similar to what grows there today.  Stable carbon isotope analyses corroborate the dominance of plants that use the C3 photosynthetic pathway, as found in most trees and shrubs worldwide and in herbaceous plants found in cooler, shaded conditions.  However, the isotope analyses document some drought intervals leading to moisture stress among C3 plants or the increased presence of C4 herbs that thrive under higher light levels or drier conditions.  At approximately 3300 years ago conditions at the site began to change.  Evidence for a general drying trend appears, and with this drying trend came increased fire activity as the environment adjusted to the new conditions.\n\nAt two small sinkhole ponds in southern Georgia, we found evidence for periods of slow or no sediment accumulation, indicating dry conditions, during the early Holocene (11,700 to 8200 years ago) and during an earlier interval known as the Younger Dryas (12,900 to 11,700 years ago), which marks the end of the preceding Pleistocene epoch or \"Ice Age.\"  Climate records from many sites show that the Younger Dryas was a period during which climate, which had been warming up during the end of the Pleistocene, briefly reverted to colder and drier conditions that were similar to cold glacial periods of the Pleistocene.  At our sites in Georgia, vegetation consisted of oak woodlands and grasses and the environment was generally drier, leading to less available fuel for fires to burn.\n\nWhile climates west of the Appalachian Mountains are more typically dry during the middle Holocene, climates east and south of the Appalachians have been interpreted as warm and wet. A strong shift toward warmer and wetter climate seems to mark the transition from the early Holocene (11,700 to 8200 years ago) to the middle Holocene.  At our sites, evidence for wetter conditions first appears by approximately 9300 years ago.  As conditions warmed and rainfall patterns changed, vegetation began to change to a pine-dominated ecosystem.  During this transition, fire activity increased substantially, before declining to more moderate levels as the landscape stabilized by 6000 years ago.  We found evidence for changes in vegetation and fire activity similar to records of changing climate from as far away as Massachusetts, indicating large-scale changes in the distribution and timing of annual rainfall.\n\nStudies such as ours, that reconstruct detailed records of past changes in fire-vegetation-climate relationships, are valuable because they fill gaps in our knowledge important to conservation and management.  Conservation and management decisions are based on how fire, vegetation, and climate interact in modern times.  But modern conditions, as research is continually showing, may not represent the full range of past variation.  By documenting past environmental variability, this research provides valuable background information of use to conservationists, land managers, and those seeking to model how ecosystems respond to changes in climate and disturbance history.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/02/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mathew S Boehm"
