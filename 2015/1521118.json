While there is extensive research into shock induced void collapse, if there are mechanisms for wave attenuation or if the impact velocity is relatively low, stress wave loading will instead occur. The objective of this research is to quantify the effect of loading wave profile on the hydrodynamic interaction and damage mechanisms of multiple void collapse. Under distributed loading, the wave profile and void and inter-void length scales can be comparable, potentially resulting in a strongly coupled interaction and precluding the direct application of shock wave collapse models, for example to predict cell and tissue injury in biomedical applications. Tissue and cell destruction by pulsed laser induced waves can have enormous biomedical treatment benefits for example in retards to cancerous tumor growth, however, severe collateral damage of surrounding tissue can also result. One mechanism for trauma is the dynamic response of voids subjected to the pressure pulse, which is attenuated from an initial shock with an increase in rise time by interaction with acoustic heterogeneities in the body. Predictive models for tissue damage under these loading conditions are critical to the use of these powerful techniques.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\n\r\nDynamic experiments are designed to highlight the interaction and damage mechanisms of voids collapsing after passage of a stress wave. In biomedical applications, the ramped wave profile (or rise time) is found to correlate better with tissue damage than the peak pressure. To the PI's knowledge, the collapse of voids under these conditions has not been previously studied.  Experimental time resolved visualizations of void collapse, the first velocity field measurements in the surrounding material, and internal and external temperature measurements will be carried out in a model experimental setup which allows accurate placement of 2D and 3D void arrays in a tissue surrogate polymer material. Initial work by the PI has shown the internal volume history is nonlinear, in agreement with simulations but in contrast to existing linear experimental data fits. The role of rise time will be examined as additional parameter to the overall pressure ratio across the wave. In the case of multiple voids, velocity measurements show the stress wave diffracts in response to the upstream void, affecting the subsequent loading condition.  Both collapse-inhibiting (shielding) and collapse triggering effects are observed and will be quantified.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts\tThe capability for accurate prediction of tissue and cellular damage has a profound impact on treatment options across a broad range of biomedical applications including extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy, laser induced plasma surgery, and ultrasound. The CAREER research and educational plans are interwoven through the incorporation of research results in hands on activities that reach three age groups: local community children, middle school students, and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThrough this integrated research and education plan, undergraduate students will be exposed to interdisciplinary study and will showcase their research results to demonstrate opportunities to middle school students, particularly through the Girls Adventures in Mathematics, Engineering, and Science (GAMES)and Girls Do Science programs. These programs target girls at middle school age level, when a dramatic decrease in self esteem in academic settings has been widely reported. The Aerospace Engineering GAMES program is currently being developed by the PI in coordination with the College of Engineering at Illinois. The overarching goal is retention of academically talented middle school girls in math and science by demonstrating the social validity, breadth of opportunity, and the community benefits of engineering, and by providing the opportunity for learning through team based projects, exposure to the University, and meetings with role models and mentors. The PI will also continue her successful record of recruiting and mentoring undergraduate and graduate students in engineering, as well as on going participation in outreach activities such as Girls Do Science.",
