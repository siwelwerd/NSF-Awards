Some of the foci of the 2015 event are the following: the Elliott classification program for C*-algebras; rigidity for ergodic actions and von Neumann algebras; subfactors and their invariants; graph C*-algebras; free probability and its applications; quantum groups. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
