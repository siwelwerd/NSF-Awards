The 2nd International Next Generation Wind Energy Workshop will be tentatively held from October 6-8, 2015 at Lund University in Sweden.  This workshop will highlight the complex processes involved in harnessing wind energy for the generation of electricity, and their impacts on current and future wind turbine development issues facing the expansion of wind farm operations in both the United States and Europe.  The workshop will provide support for both senior and early career researchers based in the United States to travel to Sweden to attend this international workshop.  The senior scientists will provide the keynote lectures, and both senior and junior scientists will participate in the panel discussion sessions.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will be a forum to promote the development and application of new wind turbine designs of the 21st century, based on state-of-the-art experimental, computational, and/or theoretical research methods being developed in the academic community.  The diverse and complex processes encountered in wind energy harvesting have fundamental considerations that drive new concepts for wind turbines.  The workshop will bring together researchers working on many of the central challenges facing the fluid dynamic, aerodynamic, material science, structural, and manufacturing aspects of the wind turbine rotor blade performance and design.  The participants will define new frontiers in wind energy aerodynamic and structural modeling research needed to guide the development of computational tools to explore the commercial potential of future wind turbine blade designs, including vertical axis turbines, blade-less systems such as turbines with cyclone technology, and hybrid wind turbines.  The workshop will also focus attention on common problems of current wind turbine designs and their manufacturing challenges that are faced by the commercial wind energy industry both in the United States and Europe.  The participants will come from academia, independent research organizations, governmental agencies, and industry, from both the United States and Europe.  The workshop proceedings will be published in a special issue of ASME Transactions - Journal Energy Resources Technology (JERT), and workshop outcomes will be posted the workshop website.",
