 "awd_abstract_narration": "Solar cells are a cornerstone technology for generating clean and renewable energy by harnessing the power of the sun. Advancements to existing solar cell technology are presently limited to incremental improvements in power density. The main challenge in achieving widespread adoption of solar energy generation remains the high cost of power compared to traditional, non-renewable energy sources. The proposed innovation enables manufacturers to produce solar cells that are substantially more efficient in converting sunlight to electricity, resulting in significantly improved energy density and reduced installation costs relative to conventional commercial solar cells. Continued development of solar energy technologies offers many economic and societal benefits, including: (1) mitigating carbon emission levels by using clean, renewable energy; (2) enhancing living standards through sustainable, low cost power; and (3) strengthening national security by reducing dependence on energy imports.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps team aims to address the market need for high energy density photovoltaic cells by developing a tandem thin-film technology. The proposed innovation utilizes two solar absorber materials with unique properties that substantially increase the conversion efficiency of a solar cell, enabling a 40% improvement in energy density in comparison to conventional cells. These new materials can be integrated into existing photovoltaic technologies as well as emerging production processes planned by solar cell manufacturers for the future expansion of fabrication facilities. The scalability of the technology to terawatt (TW) production levels using materials with unrestricted supplies, and the manufacturability of the technology using an already installed equipment base to minimize capital investments, are two differentiating features that may drive rapid adoption in the marketplace. This I-Corps team seeks to explore and evaluate the market need, the current competitive environment, and determine feasible approaches for adapting the new solar absorber material technology to meet customer requirements and satisfy market demand.",
