 "awd_abstract_narration": "Economists have a good understanding of how prices are formed in competitive markets, featuring large numbers of small, anonymous, well informed people, as well as how these markets allocate resources.  These markets are useful examined with the supply-and-demand analysis that makes its first appearance in introductory economics, and is still the workhorse approach to a great deal of economic analysis.  Of course, not all markets are competitive, and large bodies of work have moved beyond this point of departure to study the effects of various frictions; some participants may constitute sufficiently large parts of the market as to be able to affect prices, giving rise to the study of oligopolistic and monopolistic markets; some people may not be well informed, giving rise to the study of asymmetric information; and so on.  The research described in this proposal takes the study of resource allocation in a complementary direction by relaxing the anonymity that plays an important role in competitive markets.  Instead of assuming that economic activity is mediated through common but faceless prices, with people not caring and often not knowing with whom they trade, we examine cases in economic activity is mediated through personal interactions whose participants recognize and know one another.  These personalized interactions may arise in the context of markets, but with agents who are neither homogeneous nor anonymous, or may arise in the context of more individual relationships.  The standard finding in economics is that market frictions lead to inefficient outcomes.  In contrast, we show that personalized resource allocation mechanisms may often have salutary efficiency implications, and may play an important role in cases where prices and markets are ineffective.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research has three components.  The first component will examine market interactions between agents who can use distinguishing features -- skills and investments that they bring to the market, or reputations they have accumulated in past interactions, or connections in a network structure -- to tailor the attendant resource allocation to individual characteristics.  We will identify cases in which the resulting personalization enhances efficiency, and will examine the forces behind these effects, as well as cases in which the result is a misallocation of resources.  Attention will be particularly devoted to cases in which the matching process that brings people together in the market creates the appropriate incentives to undertake efficient pre-match investments or to reveal critical information.  The second component will focus on personalized relationships between individuals.  This research will begin by examining an abstract model of agency that uses duality techniques from convex analysis to extend and simplify many existing results.  This analysis will provide new tools and results and will also establish a useful connection between agency problems and matching markets.  This abstract analysis will be complemented by more specific applications to repeated agency and to bargaining.  The third component of the research will examine the foundations of the preferences and belief-formation processes that shape individual behavior.  This work will emphasize evolutionary foundations, and will spill over into the evolution of communication in biological settings.   The goal here is a better grounding for the models of individual behavior that provide the inputs for the study of markets and relationships.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEconomists have a good understanding of how markets filled with anonymous agents allocate resources, culminating in supply-and-demand models that are the workhorse of applied economics.  An equilibrium in such a market is relatively straightforward, requiring a price that appropriately sorts each side of the market into those who trade and those who do not trade.  These models direct attention to market forces, with individual characteristics typically swept into the background.\n\nIn contrast, many markets consist of heterogeneous agents to whom it matters not only wehther they trade and at what price, but also with whom they trade, under what information, and in which circumstances. An equilibrium in such a market requires matching the agents and crafting a potentially idiosyncratic outcome for each interaction.  These outcomes in turn reflect the characteristics of the agents in the match, while being shaped by the forces of the surrounding market.  We refer to this process as \"personalized resource allocation\" and refer to the markets as \"personalized markets.\"\n\nThis research studies personalized resource allocation.  The resarch begins with abstract theoretical foundations, and then moves toward applications.  The goal is a better understanding of how personalized markets operate, and how economic policy and market regulation might push these markets toward more efficient outcomes.\n\nThe first step of the research constructs and analyzes a theoretical model of personalized resource allocation, with the goal of characterizing the set of possible outcomes in such markets.  This research makes connections to the mathematics literature, borrowing techniques from convex analysis and the mathematical theory of \"optimal transport.\"  It also draws together and unifies a number of theoretical models in economics, including matching models and principal-agent models, that have hitherto been studied separately.\n\nThe second step of the research puts this theoretical model to work to study a collection of more applied economic problems.  For example, we examine why a relatively closely-knit community, reflecting either geographic proximity or other ties, may prefer that its members \"buy local.\"  Similarly, we examine why the members of such a community may prefer to interact via reciprocal favors rather than via cash transactions.  We examine when markets for skilled labor, or other markets in which people must invest in skills or other characteristics before coming into the market, will create the appropriate incentives for people to undertake efficient investments.  We examine the circumstances under which agents in repeated interactions may prefer to \"start small,\" increasing the scale of their interaction as they build trust.  Finally, we examine when unexpected costs and benefits in such interactions give rise to immediate payments or similar compensation, and when the requisite balancing is undertaken by adjusting the future nature of the relationship.  The theme behind all of these studies is that there are many avenues behind monetary payments that may be used to mediate relationships, and that understanding how these other avenues are used helps us understand and potentially improve the performance of such markets.\n\nThe third step of the research examines the foundations of the individual preferences and other characteristics that shape behavior in such markets.  This step of the research makes connections to biology, including a paper on animal communication that exploits the techniques developed in the course of this research.  The emphasis on this aspect of the research is on the evolutionary foundations of preferences, risk attitudes and information-processing rules. \n\nThe markets in our economy are becoming increasing specialized, with anonymous interactions increasingly being replaced by personalized interactions.  Together, the three components give us a better understanding of these markets.  The research has the potential to play an important role in our assessment of these markets and in determining appropriate policy responses.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Larry W Samuelson"
