 "awd_abstract_narration": "1512297(Archer)\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed research is to study particle dynamics and relaxation in so-called soft glassy materials. Such materials are printable functional inks for additive manufacturing, fluids for batteries and fuel cells, and pharmaceutical formulations. Successful completion of this study could lead to the manufacturing of new types of fluids with properties tailored to specific engineering applications.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed to develop a general framework for understanding how particle dynamics in jammed suspensions (nanoparticles in polymers) impact the transition from diffusive to hyperdiffusive dynamics. Recent reports on terminal relaxations in soft glasses have found that they are invariably and surprisingly hyperdiffusive. Hyperdiffusive relaxations are in fact now thought to be a characteristic of the soft glassy state and to reflect a material's out-of-equilibrium response to internal stresses, which are either built in at the glass transition or build up due to a variety of reasons. The PI and his group have recently discovered a class of soft glasses comprised of hairy nanoparticles that manifest a series of contradictory traits: (i) they are jammed and glassy; (ii) they manifest an accessible Newtonian flow regime and are able to reach equilibrium; (iii) they show little signs of aging; and (iv) they exhibit hyperdiffusive relaxations on long length and time scales. However, it is argued that the contradictory behavior is only superficial, and the dynamics of the system can reveal the fundamental behavior leading to these traits. They plan to use hairy nanoparticles as model systems, and a battery of experiments (photon correlation spectroscopies, small-angle X-ray scattering, mechanical rheometry, dielectric relaxation) and theory to shed light on the fundamental origins of hyperdiffusive relaxations in soft glasses. What makes this work exciting is that it goes after general models for dynamics of soft glasses, i.e., it looks to relate findings from experiments performed on limited time scales to dynamics in soft glasses on extended timescales. In addition to graduate education, plans to reach out to K-12 students and their teachers are laid out.",

The particle motions, now termed&nbsp;<em>Brownian,</em>&nbsp;and the overall process by which the particles spread as a result of the motion, termed&nbsp;<em>Diffusion</em>, are among the pillars of all modern theories for transport of matter in liquids. This project was motivated by a growing body of work, which shows that small particles dispersed in more complex liquids, including molten plastics, particulate suspensions, and the fluid in the interior space of living cells, move less randomly and oftentimes faster than would be expected for Brownian motion. This new mode of motion, termed&nbsp;<em>hyperdiffusion</em>, has been hypothesized to arise from unbalanced, residual forces exerted on the particles by the medium.</p>\n<p><em>Intellectual Merit</em>: With the specific aim of understanding the origins of hyperdiffusion, research in this project first developed a methodology for homogeneously dispersing nanometer-sized particles (Fig. 1) in fully equilibrated fluids - with no residual forces. The effort led to the discovery that nanoparticles grafted with small molecules on their surface that exert weak attractive forces on the dispersing fluid can be homogeneously dispersed (Fig. 2) in equilibrated fluids under a wide range of conditions. Further, by means of optical, fluorescence, and x-ray analysis of the particle motions in such fluids, it was experimentally demonstrated that a transition from diffusive to hyperdiffusive particle motions does occur (Fig. 3) in an equilibrated fluid, but that the transition coincides with the appearance of structure/entanglements in the fluid (Fig. 4) on length scales comparable to the average size of the nanoparticles. Building on these observations, a theory for hyperdiffusion is proposed in which particles dispersed in fluids are assumed to exist in either of two states, isolated or clustered, in equilibrium with each other. The theory is used to create a mathematical model for particle motions, which is solved to reveal a transition from diffusion to hyperdiffusive particle motions analogous to that observed experimentally (Fig. 5). The theory shows further that the appearance of hyperdiffusive particle motions in complex fluids is the result of an overlay of contributions from isolated and clustered particle motions in these fluids.</p>\n<p class=\"TAMainText\"><em>Broader Impacts:</em>&nbsp;Beyond our discovery of the origns of hyperdiffusive particle motions in complex fluids, the research performed over the three-year period of this project provided unique training in fluid dynamics, polymer physics, rheology, and x-ray analysis to the two PhD students supported by the award. &nbsp;These students have both graduated with doctorate degrees from Cornell University and are now employed at leading institutions in India and the USA.&nbsp;<strong>Rahul Mangal</strong>&nbsp;(PhD, 2016) is now an Assistant Professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur.
