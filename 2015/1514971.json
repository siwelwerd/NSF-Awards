 "awd_abstract_narration": "Contaminants such as pesticides are ubiquitous in today's world. Though they are a useful agricultural tool, pesticides can also cause unknown harm to the surrounding environment and wildlife. In collaboration with Dr. Jennifer Lavers at the University of Tasmania, this project will investigate: 1) the exposure of an Australian seabird, the Great-winged Petrel (Pterodroma macroptera), to contaminants through its diet of fish and squid in Western Australia; and 2) the relationship between contaminants and Petrel breeding hormones. The researchers hypothesize that contaminants cause a decrease in breeding hormones, which could negatively affect the birds' breeding behaviors, possibly causing egg abandonment and nest failure. This collaboration provides a unique opportunity to: 1) research how contaminants affect seabirds in an area heavily-used for both agriculture and fisheries; and 2) provide data on a little-studied species. Petrels eat the same types of fish and squid that humans eat, so the results of this project will inform issues affecting human health.\r\n\r\nContaminants such as organochlorines are ubiquitous in coastal areas, but transport to more oceanic habitats and thus, organisms, remains little-studied. The effect of organochlorines on wildlife vary among species, and although many studies report contaminant loads, there are few data on what specifically drives changes in behavior and physiology. This project will address this gap by evaluating organochlorine pesticides and concurrent concentrations of a breeding hormone (prolactin) in Great-winged Petrels (Pterodroma macroptera) in relation to their diet and foraging habitat characteristics. This project will collect blood samples from Petrels at breeding colonies in Western Australia; deploy GPS tracking tags on Petrels to study foraging ecology; and conduct lab analyses at RMIT University in Melbourne. This project?s results will provide information about organochlorines in fish and piscivorous birds in King George Sound, a highly productive area for fisheries that is adjacent to a large agricultural delta, and thereby provide information for human health.\r\n\r\nThis NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.",

Although pesticides can be a useful agricultural tool, they can also cause unknown harm to the surrounding environment, thus affecting humans and wildlife. Organochlorine compounds are small and easily bind to other compounds, and also accumulate in organisms&rsquo; tissues. These characteristics enable organochlorines to be transported large distances via the atmosphere, and on the ocean&rsquo;s surface currents. As organochlorines enter the food chain, the concentration of organochlorines increases with trophic level, so that top predators like seabirds are exposed to large amounts of potentially harmful compounds. Although many studies report contaminant concentrations in predators, there are few data on the effects of contaminants on changes in behavior and physiology. This project addresses this gap by evaluating organochlorine pesticides and concurrent concentrations of a breeding hormone (prolactin) in Great-winged Petrels (Pterodroma macroptera) in relation to their diet and foraging habitat characteristics. This project is a collaborative effort with the University of Tasmania, RMIT University, and the Centre d&rsquo;Etudes Biologiques de Chize, France, thus linking this research across three continents.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The objectives of this research project were to: 1) evaluate the organochlorine contaminant concentration and prolactin concentrations in Great-winged Petrels; and 2) determine the foraging habitat characteristics of these seabirds, who forage in the Southern Ocean for fish and squid. Over the course of the EAPSI program in July-August 2015, I collected data to address these objectives. First, I collected blood samples from Great-winged Petrels at a nesting colony in Western Australia in July 2015. Due to some unfortunate and unforeseen delays in laboratory analyses (e.g. broken equipment; delay in obtaining proper chemical standards for analyses), these blood samples are still awaiting analyses. I am confident that I will have results to answer my research question by June 2016. I predict that organochlorine contaminants will exert a negative effect on Great-winged Petrels&rsquo; ability to use the prolactin hormone, and that there will be a negative relationship between organochlorine concentrations and prolactin concentrations in the birds&rsquo; blood samples. This adverse relationship could have long-term consequences for this species, which uses a lot of energy and resources to raise one chick once per year. The organochlorine contaminant concentrations that will be measured in this study will shed light on the contaminants that are found high in the food chain. Because many seabirds like Great-winged Petrels eat fish and squid, they eat fish that humans also eat (e.g. sardines) and that larger predators like tuna also eat. The Southern Ocean near Western Australia is an important fishing ground, from which many tons of fish are extracted each year.

I learned that although these birds are small (500-600 grams; about the size of a grouse or a small sea gull), they travel long distances to fly to deep (over 5000 m), pelagic water that is 400 km (250 miles) away from their nest!
