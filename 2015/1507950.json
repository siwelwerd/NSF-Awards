 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aggressive down-scaling of silicon (Si)-based transistor technology over the past five decades has resulted in an exponential increase in computing power due to the corresponding up-scaling of logic device densities and operational speeds. Moreover, this continued miniaturization has led to the proliferation of affordable, powerful, and compact computing devices that have made Si microelectronics an essential and ubiquitous aspect of modern society. To prolong these trends and address the fundamental technical challenges that have arisen as transistor technology approaches the atomic length scale, research into novel transistor materials and device architectures is paramount. The adoption of new semiconducting materials, e.g., germanium (Ge), germanium-tin (GeSn) and indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs), and transistor architectures, e.g. tunnel field-effect transistors operating on the principle of quantum mechanical tunneling, offer paths to reduce power consumption and increase performance-per-watt in future integrated circuits. However, unlike Si, these novel transistor technologies and materials do not benefit from half-a-century of process maturity. Therefore, the central thrusts of this research are to investigate the materials and optical properties, electrical characteristics, and heterogeneous integration of novel Ge(Sn)/InGaAs tunnel transistors on large area, cost-effective Si substrates. Moreover, the implementation of a monolithic, heterogeneous integration scheme for non-Si materials and devices on Si is a transformative goal that leverages the existing mature process infrastructure for Si with the performance benefits of novel, scalable non-Si transistor technologies. By addressing these technical challenges, this research will benefit a wide range of applications, ranging from industrial, medical, commercial and personal use that require cost-competitive, low-power and high-performance computational devices. Furthermore, this international co-operative interaction between partners allows for a comprehensive project that trains and mentors students through exchange programs, exposure to education and culture in Ireland as well as lay a foundation for continued and growing US-Ireland collaboration. \r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the viability of the proposed approach, several key technical and scientific concerns must be addressed, including: (i) materials synthesis and characterization of Ge(Sn)/InGaAs heterostructures; (ii) numerical simulation of the proposed complimentary Ge(Sn)/InGaAs tunnel transistor device architectures; (iii) development of a process flow for fabricating the n- and p-channel Ge(Sn)/InGaAs tunnel transistors; and (iv) implementation of an integration scheme on Si. To address (i), (iii), and (iv), the proposed research will utilize the state-of-the-art in-house epitaxial growth (interconnected group-IV and III-V molecular beam epitaxy chambers), collaborative materials characterization and simulation (e.g., high-resolution x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, and ab-initio interfacial molecular dynamics and electronic band structure simulation), and in-house nanoelectronics fabrication facilities. To address (ii), a combination of commercial and custom software packages will be leveraged to develop precise, experimentally-calibrated Ge(Sn)/InGaAs device models necessary for large-scale circuit integration feasibility. By investigating these topics, this research will elucidate numerous as-of-yet unexplored avenues of fundamental research, including: (a) the control of heterointerface atomic intermixing between group IV (Ge, GeSn) and III-V (In, Ga, As) species and formation of atomically abrupt tunnel junctions; (b) the role of group-III or group-V surface termination on the electronic, optical and energy band alignment properties; (c) the reduction of effective tunneling barrier heights in Ge(Sn)/InGaAs TFETs and conversion of Ge(Sn) to a direct band-gap material through epitaxial tensile strain engineering and Sn alloy incorporation; (d) the simultaneous chemical and electrical passivation of group-IV and III-V materials; and (e) the realization of device-quality epitaxial heterostructures on Si through minimization of threading dislocations and anti-phase domains in in-situ III-V buffer architectures on Si. Through a comprehensive examination and understanding of the aforementioned issues, this research will offer a path to achieve next-generation, non-Si nanoelectronics that will benefit industry and society via extending technological and computational innovation towards the physical scaling limit.",
