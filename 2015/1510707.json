 "awd_abstract_narration": "#1510707\r\nKrueger, Paul S.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this proposal is to improve propulsion by using superhydrophobic surfaces. A surface is defined as superhydrophobic when water droplets bead on the surface, and the angle between the drop and the surface is larger than 150 degrees. In cases like this, one can achieve drag reduction, since water slips on the superhydrophobic surface, and energy savings can be realized in propulsion.  \r\n\r\nThe introduction of apparent slip at the superhydrophobic surface using gas trapped near the surface by the microtexture of the surface can lead to drag reduction. However, it is known that such surfaces have their own challenges, including collapse of the gas film under increased hydrostatic or dynamic pressure, gradual depletion of the gas film by diffusion, and slip lengths limited by the spacing of the microtexture features. The proposed effort seeks to expand the applicability of superhydrophobic surfaces by pressurizing the gas film, which will allow for robust stabilization of the gas film against pressure disturbances and diffusion. Pneumatic stabilization has the additional advantages that changing the gas film pressure will allow mictotextured features to be spaced further apart, increasing the apparent slip, and dynamic variation of the pressure will allow for direct control of the surface behavior, including re-initialization of the gas film. Pneumatically controlled surfaces will be constructed from polydimethylsiloxane using laser micromachining and soft lithography techniques and tested on flapping-fin and pulsed-jet propulsion methods at intermediate Reynolds number (Re) flows. The effect of apparent slip introduced by the superhydrophobic surfaces on the propulsive performance of flow fields generated by flapping-fin and pulsed-jet propulsion will be investigated as a function of Re. The ability to dynamically actuate the gas film will also be investigated. A secondary outcome would be an improved technical capability in developing and sustaining superhydrophobic surfaces broadening the areas of their application to other cases of drag reduction and self-cleaning surfaces. Activities on undergraduate education through summer immersion were proposed and a web-based tutorial on mechanical and biological propulsion will be developed and made available to students and the community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project investigated methods for reducing viscous friction on surfaces and how this change could affect the flow development for small scale propulsion systems based on pulsed jets (like squid) or flapping fins.  The method developed for reducing skin friction utilizes a perforated surface with an underlying cavity.  The perforated surface allowed air to be trapped in the perforations for submerged surfaces, which allows for liquid flow to \"slip\" over the entrapped air bubbles and thereby reduce the flow resistance.  The underlying cavity allows pneumatic access to the surface to replenish air that has diffused into the liquid, provide supporting pressure to prevent the bubbles from collapsing under high liquid pressure, or to purge liquid and re-establish the bubbles on the air interface.\n\n \n\nThe entrapment system for providing surface slip flow was tested in channels to demonstrate its effectiveness and the dependence of the reduction in flow resistance on the geometry of the perforations.  It was also demonstrated on the internal surface of a nozzle for jet flows, where the surface slip provided by the perforated surface produced more compact flow \"puffs\" with each jet pulse that may be useful for enhancing the thrust for small-scale propulsion systems.   Likewise, the perforated surfaces modified the flows developed for flapping fins.\n\n \n\nBeyond the potentially useful modifications to propulsive flows provided by the entrapped air system, the broader impact of this work is the potential to reduce fluid dynamic drag.  The system can be applied to reduce drag on submerged vehicles, but by filling the cavity with the same fluid surrounding the vehicle (air or water) the viscous friction can also be reduced by allowing the fluid to slide over the pores (liquid-liquid or gas-gas interfaces).  Moreover, the approach accommodates structures that are accessible with more traditional large scale manufacturing methods, making it practical to apply to vehicles or portions of vehicles of common size.  The ability of this approach to reduce drag can improve efficiency, reduce transportation costs, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n \n\nDuring the lifetime of the project involved, 12 different students and one post-doc were engaged with the work in various capacities.  Of these, 5 were graduate students and have gone on to careers in technology or advanced degrees in supporting disciplines. The remaining 7 students were undergraduate students and three of them were from underrepresented groups.  The students have pursued various avenues in technology for their careers, most of them going on to advanced studies in engineering.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul S Krueger"
