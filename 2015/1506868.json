 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry is supporting Professor John Doyle of Harvard University to study molecular chirality through advances in molecular beam techniques and interrogation with microwave spectroscopy.  Atoms and molecules are the basic building blocks of all substances. Understanding their essential behavior is necessary for a full understanding of chemical processes, including those underlying living systems. In living cells, many molecules have a fundamental 'twist', very similar to the direction of spiral ridges on a screw. Just like a screw, the direction of the molecular spiral, known as 'chirality', determines function. For normal screws ('right handed' ones), if you turn them clockwise they tighten; a 'left handed' screw would loosen. This is a very pronounced effect in molecules also. For example, many new drugs have a single handedness (i.e. chirality). In order to understand the basic behavior of molecules, their chirality must be detectable. In this project researchers will use their newly discovered tool for measuring chirality to study fundamental quantum behavior of chirality in molecules. In particular, they will look for the slow transformation of a molecule with a spiral in one direction to a molecule with a spiral in the opposite direction. This effect can only be described by the fundamental theory of the microscopic realm, quantum mechanics. Researchers in the Doyle group will test these predictions and in carrying out these studies gain valuable experience in modern physical and analytical chemistry research.\r\n\r\nIn order to study chirality of molecules, the Doyle group will use molecular beams and interrogate these with microwave radiation. The molecular seams will be generated by injecting them through a small hole into a nearly perfect vacuum. This will form a stream of molecules that have no interactions 'a nearly pristine physical setup' except with the applied electromagnetic radiation. The molecules that will be studied have electric dipoles (similar to a bar magnet, except with electric charge on the North and South poles). These dipoles will absorb and emit radiation in the microwave regime. By creating a screw-type pattern of microwave radiation, the molecule can be caused to emit radiation that depends on the direction of the spiral (chirality) of the molecules. This is similar to testing if a screw is left or right handed by trying to insert it in a right-handed screw hole. The researchers will initially prepare molecules of one chirality (e.g. right handed) and then use microwaves to see if they transform into the other chirality (left-handed). Comparison with theory will be done to test our understanding of this fundamental phenomenon.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nMany molecules are chiral, meaning that they come in left and right handed forms.  Just as a left handed glove fits badly on your right hand, a molecule's chirality typically has a very strong effect on the behavior of a molecule when interacting with other chiral molecules.  This is particularly important in biological systems, where many molecules are chiral.  Despite this importance, a general, accurate method for measuring chirality remains difficult; the most common method in use today, chiral chromatography, must typically be reconfigured for each new compound to be studied.  In this grant we refined a new method, microwave three-wave mixing, which we first demonstrated in 2012.  In the first demonstrations of this method, it took many hours to exchange one sample for another, and to re-calibrate the machine for a given compound; in addition, the technique had only been demonstrated on pure samples of chiral compounds, rather than the common case where the compound of interest was dissolved in a solution, likely amid other chiral compounds.  Over the duration of this grant, we have reduced the sample analysis time to a few minutes, and developed new sample injection techniques which allow distinct samples to be tested in rapid succession with minimal cross-contamination.  We have further shown that the technique can not only measure chirality, but control it - for example, we can selectively rotationally excite left-handed molecules but not right-handed molecules.  This promises to be a transformative tool for studying processes by which molecules of one handedness can transform into the other.\nWe have in addition made several improvements to our microwave spectrometer as a general tool for chemical analysis.  Our spectrometer, which leverages buffer gas cooling as a versatile and powerful alternative to traditional pulsed-jet instruments, is now the most sensitive per unit time of any in the world.  We have used this sensitivity, and microwave spectroscopy's unparalleled ability to definitively detect trace gasses amid a complex background, to characterize several compounds at  an unprecedented level of detail - for example, we can watch molecules changing shape in real time as they cool in our buffer gas cell, or watch the process by which single molecules combine to form dimers.\nThe promise of this technique as a chiral analysis technique will only be realized when it proliferates to other groups.  During the duration of this grant, we have trained many students, including two high school students, in the technique, and there are now six groups worldwide exploring diverse science with in the technique.  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/13/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Doyle"
