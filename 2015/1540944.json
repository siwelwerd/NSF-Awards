 "awd_abstract_narration": "This fund supports students from US institutions to attend the Doctoral Consortium and the main conference program of IEEE International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2015) to be held on May 4 2015, in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Graduate students play critical roles in conducting innovative and groundbreaking research. The goal of the doctoral consortium is to accelerate the research careers of the junior researchers in the community of image and video-based face, gesture, and body movement recognition. Furthermore, this doctoral consortium serves as an opportunity for graduate students to start building connections in the community, which can significantly prompt their future career. The successful career of graduate students would be imperative to advance the state of the art in new algorithms and applications related to face, gesture, and body motion, leading to new capabilities in areas such as biometrics, interactive systems, surveillance, healthcare, and entertainment. \r\n\r\nThe doctoral consortium allows each participant to present their work to a group of mentors, who provide feedback. The mentors are selected based upon similarity of research interest and their research experience in that area. The event includes a career panel where mentors describe their career paths, providing valuable suggestions to doctoral students. The conference has a dedicated poster session for consortium participants to present their work to conference attendees. These activities encourage more graduate students to directly interact with senior researchers as well as their peers to boost their careers at a critical stage of their development.",
