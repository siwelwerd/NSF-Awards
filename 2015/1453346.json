 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program project is to investigate legged robots that are faster and energetically more efficient.  The project capitalizes on the currently untapped possibility of using different gaits at different locomotion speeds.  This idea is inspired by nature.  Humans, for example, switch from walking to running as they increase speed; horses transit from walking to trotting and galloping.  Switching gaits is analogous to switching gears in a car.  It increases versatility and reduces energy consumption.  Additionally, in nature the choice of gaits is strongly coupled to an animal's morphology.  A massive elephant moves differently than a filigree gazelle.  This project will investigate this complex relation of gaits, motions, and morphologies, and will transfer the underlying principles to robotic systems.  The work will be conducted in simulation studies and with actual robots.  In the long term, this CAREER plan aims at the development of robots that reach and even exceed the agility of humans and animals.  It will enable us to build robots that can run as fast as a cheetah and as enduring as a husky, while mastering the same terrain as a mountain goat.  Moreover, it will provide us with novel designs for active prosthetics and exoskeletons.  The project will also leverage the fascinating topic of legged locomotion to spark the interest of K-12 students, underrepresented groups, and a broader audience for science, technology, and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to understand the fundamental principles of designing, building, and controlling legged robots that embrace and exploit their inherent mechanical dynamics.  The underlying premise is that locomotion can emerge in great part passively from the interaction of inertia, gravity, and elastic oscillations.  The goal of this project is to identify systems in which such dynamics can be excited in a variety of different modes.  Different modes would correspond to different gaits, and would enable efficient motion in different operational conditions.  The work will extend optimal control and machine-learning techniques, such as multiple shooting, direct collocation, or probabilistic direct policy learning methods, to allow the simultaneous generation of gaits, motions, and morphological parameters (including stiffness values, mass distributions, or actuator sizes).  Since performance criteria such as speed, efficiency, robustness, and agility only fully manifest themselves in actual hardware implementations, the research team will study these concepts not only in simulation, but also with hardware prototypes.  In particular, the methodology will be employed to examine the benefits of flexible spines in quadrupeds and of articulated ankles in bipeds, as well as to compare series elastic actuation and parallel elastic actuation concepts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHumans and animals employ different gaits as they locomote at different speeds.  Humans walk at slow speeds and run at high speeds, horses, for example, typically walk a slow speeds, trot at intermediate speeds, and gallop at high speeds.  As shown by previous research in biomechanics and biology, this is done primarily for the sake of energetic economy: adapting the gait to the chosen locomotion speed can reduce the amount of energy needed to travel a given distance.\n\nThe primary goal of the project \"CAREER: Using Multiple Gaits and Inherent Dynamics for Legged Robots with Improved Mobility\" was to investigate whether the same idea can be employed to the world of robotics: can legged robots (and, in extension, robotic exoskeletons and motorized prostheses) exploit the use of different gaits to reduce their energy consumption?\n\nOur research was able to confirm this question.  By using computer-based optimization, we were able to find the energetically optimal motions for a number of models representing legged robots.  This process was done over a range of speeds, and we showed that switching between gaits reduced simulated energy consumption by as much as 50%.  More detailed studies on model variations highlighted the morphological requirements that a robot had to fulfill to exploit such gaits.  For example, we showed that in order to perform an effective gallop, a quadrupedal robot needs a articulated flexible spine.  The ability to quantify the potential energy savings of such a design feature allows designers to understand whether including additional joints in a robot would pay off and lets them compare the energy savings with the added complexity of the resulting robot.\n\nA surprising result of our work was that the gaits found for robotic systems were strikingly similar to the gaits found in nature: bipedal robots should walk at slow speeds and run at high speeds, quadrupedal robots should walk, trot, toelt, and gallop.  We did not anticipate this result, as robots and biological systems are quite different in terms of their structure, actuation, and control.  To better understand the underlying reason for this similarity, we investigated carefully designed conceptual models of bipedal systems.  These models are a stark abstraction of a real legged system: they had no actuators or controllers, and did not exhibit any dissipation of energy.  In other words, they only represented the passive mechanical dynamics of a legged system.  Yet, these simple models, which were essentially just masses on springs, were able to exhibit the exact same gaits that are found in the complex systems in nature and robotics.  Furthermore, they were not able to produce any other motions.  Our results hence suggest that the existence of different gaits is directly linked to \"nonlinear normal modes\" of mechanical systems. In addition to the implications for biological systems, these insights will allow for a systematic design of energy efficient legged robotic systems as well as for the development of energy-saving controllers.\n\nThese theoretical studies were supplemented by work on actual robotic hardware, in which we investigated the influence of different parameters on gait energetics, including, for example, the stiffness of the robot\u2019s feet. In addition, we developed a methodology to perform gait optimizations on actual hardware.\n\nFinally, educational and outreach activities were an integral part of this project.  In collaboration with the Ann Arbor Hands on Museum, we conducted STEM workshops for K-12 focusing on legged locomotion.  In these workshops, participants were building their own \"passive dynamic walkers\", exploring the meaning of gait and dynamics hands on.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: C.
