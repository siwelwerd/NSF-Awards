 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will be used to support travel of students and early career researchers to the 2015 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) Conference on Applied Algebraic Geometry, to be held at the National Institute for Mathematical Sciences (NIMS) and at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) in Daejeon, South Korea on August 3-7, 2015. This is the biennial conference of the SIAM Activity Group on Algebraic Geometry.  The SIAM activity group was founded in 2009 and the SIAM Conference on Applied Algebraic Geometry has quickly grown to be the premier conference on applications of algebraic geometry. This conference presents a significant opportunity to establish new connections and collaborations with the algebraic geometry community in Asia. The meeting promises to have a significant impact on the growth of Applied Algebraic Geometry, and the conference offers a unique opportunity for students and early career researchers.\r\n\r\nThe 2015 SIAM Conference on Applied Algebraic Geometry will continue the tradition of covering a very wide range of topics in applied algebraic geometry. \"Algebraic Geometry\" is interpreted broadly to include at least: algebraic geometry, commutative algebra, noncommutative algebra, symbolic and numeric computation, algebraic and geometric combinatorics, representation theory, and algebraic topology. The conference will include more than 60 minisymposium sessions with approximately 250 invited talks, and 9 plenary addresses given by internationally renowned experts.  The conference is a satellite of the International Congress on Industrial and Applied Mathematics (ICIAM 2015) to be held in Beijing on the following week, so the participants will have an opportunity to attend both conferences.
