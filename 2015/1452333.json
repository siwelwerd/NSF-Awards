 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will measure winds at ~250 km altitude in Earth?s auroral thermosphere. These winds remain poorly understood, especially at spatial scales spanning ~100 km or less. The project is based on the hypothesis that eddies and waves at horizontal length scales of ~100 km or less are important contributors to the dynamics of Earth?s auroral thermosphere and that their cumulative impact is important both for the basic physics of the thermosphere and for operational prediction of space weather. To determine small-scale flow structures, all seven of the Fabry-Perot spectrometers now in Alaska will be configured to focus their attention simultaneously onto one small geographic region roughly coinciding with the field of view of the PFISR radar. These instruments will simultaneously monitor thermospheric temperatures and wind vectors, producing two-dimensional maps of temperatures and 3-component vector winds, with a spatial resolution of around 80 km. The array will operate in this mode for three campaigns each lasting around two-months.\r\n\tTo quantify the importance of small-scale eddies and waves in the thermosphere, the project will address three focused science questions: (1) What is the occurrence frequency, intensity, spectral distribution, and overall morphology of the small-scale eddies and waves in Alaska?s auroral thermosphere, for both quiet and active conditions? (2) Is it possible to identify the driver mechanisms and source regions for these small-scale features, based on timing of their occurrence relative to other measurements, the spatial alignment of their phase fronts, and the directions in which they?re propagating? (3) Is it possible to estimate the momentum flux and dissipation rates of these waves, based on the amplitudes, periods, and horizontal & vertical wavelengths of the temperature and 3-component wind perturbations, and on the time evolution of these quantities? This project will include training one graduate student, enhancing the research facility at Toolik Lake in Alaska, supporting rocket missions from Poker Flat, and bringing cutting-edge scientific research to remote Alaskan villages.",

Even so, Earth's atmosphere actually extends out to altitudes of at least many hundreds of km, in a region known as the thermosphere. It continues to behave like a fluid at these heights, with well defined fields of pressure, temperature, and wind. These fields in the thermosphere experience highly variable \"weather\", due to disruption from above by the sun &amp; the solar wind, and by complex wave and tidal oscillations propagating up from below. Understanding this weather was the objective of this project. It is of direct importance to modern society, as it perturbs spacecraft orbits, degrades navigation systems, and disrupts long-range communication.<br /><br />While it has long been known that thermospheric weather is highly variable, theory also predicted that winds at these heights should be restricted to smooth and laminar flows for length scales up to 1000 km or so. However, careful study of historical thermospheric winds has called into question the assumption of smooth thermospheric wind fields, and instead led to the following hypothesis: \"Eddies and waves at horizontal length scales of ~100 km or less are important contributors to the dynamics of Earths auroral thermosphere and, although individual motions are not important at these scales, their cumulative impact is &ndash; both for the basic physics of the thermosphere and for operational prediction of its weather.\" <br /><br />INTELLECTUAL MERIT<br />The purpose of the investigation reported on here was firstly to test the above hypothesis, secondly to quantify the nature and possible impacts of any such small-scale motions and, thirdly, to examine the implications of the observed small-scale thermospheric dynamics for the goals of the US upper-atmospheric science program as a whole. To address these goals, we operated an array of Fabry-Perot optical Doppler spectrometers across Alaska that produced two dimensional maps of temperatures and 3-component vector winds, with a spatial resolution of around 80 km, a temporal cadence of a few minutes, and with absolute measurement accuracies of around 5 m/s in wind and 10 Kelvins in temperature. <br /><br />Optical Doppler spectroscopy only measures the thermospheric wind's line-of-sight component. Reconstruction of vector wind fields thus requires merging data taken from several geographically separated observing sites. Several new algorithms were developed for this application as part of this project, to produce both real-time quick-look products, and also higher-fidelity post-processed products. Resulting wind and temperature fields were merged with supporting data from many other instruments studying the aurora, ionospheric plasma motion, and the geomagnetic disturbances.<br /><br />Principal results were that sharp features in the thermospheric neutral wind field do occur on length scales as short at 100 km, these features are highly correlated with external drivers and, in particular with ionospheric plasma flows and with auroral precipitation. Waves were also found to be common in the neutral thermosphere. Low amplitude (a few m/s) waves are almost ubiquitous above Alaska, whereas the occurrence of waves of larger amplitude is highly correlated with geomagnetic activity.
