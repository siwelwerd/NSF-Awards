CRYPTO is a highly selective conference in cryptography, attracting students, researchers and industry specialists from all over the world. The scope of research papers accepted to CRYPTO range from the theoretical foundations of cryptology to application and implementation of cryptographic schemes. As such, it fits closely with the goals of NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which include applied cryptography and implementation of cryptographic schemes.",
