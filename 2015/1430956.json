 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will be to provide researchers and educators a powerful device to monitor biochemical reactions and physical conditions inside living cells in real time. The probe, which is microscopic in size and powered by incoming light, will be inserted into living cells and will report parameters such as pH and concentration of selected molecules via radio transmissions to a nearby receiver. The transmission will contain both the identity of each cell and the parameter(s) being recorded-hence it will be possible to monitor many cells simultaneously. The ?radio p-Chip? will greatly advance the science of probing cell physiology and create a new area in basic and applied research by providing scientists the ability to study localized functions within living cells. As such, it will be a powerful new tool for advancing knowledge in the fields of mechanisms of disease, drug discovery, and control of biochemical functions, metabolism and other areas. The radio p-Chip and receivers are projected to be low enough in cost that they will also become scientific tools for students to study cell physiology and thus become incorporated into educational curricula. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project will result in a system that will, for the first time in history, allow scientists to monitor conditions in a living cell with a device that will not interfere with normal functions including movement. The system will be based the current p-Chip, the world?s smallest microtransponder that continuously emits a radio signal with an identification number (ID) when illuminated with light. The     p-Chip is used today to tag, track and authenticate a wide variety of objects. In order to realize the radio p-Chip, the current version of the chip will be shrunk by a factor of 10, and a variety of sensors will be added to its surface. Once complete, the radio p-Chip will be able to alternately transmit its ID and sensor value continuously to a nearby receiver. The receiver will process the signal for further use by the operator. In parallel, a series of tools will be developed to reliably implant the chips into living cells. In order to accomplish the goals of the project, PharmaSeq will combine leading edge technologies in semiconductor device design and fabrication, advanced sensor technology, digital and analogue electronics, optics and software.",
