 "awd_abstract_narration": "Embedded deep in the ice cap at the South Pole, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) is the world's largest and most sensitive high energy neutrino telescope. It is a 1 billion-ton detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe PI effectively mentors junior faculty, including women and members of underrepresented minorities and is committed to enhancing diversity in STEM fields through participation in an NSF ADVANCE program. The project provides an excellent environment for students and postdocs, who are well-equipped to contribute to scientific and economic progress in academia, government, and industry. The award includes development of planetarium content on high energy astrophysics, cosmic rays, and neutrinos. This will bring the excitement of cutting-edge research to young students and the community.\r\n\r\nIceCube incorporates an air shower detector, IceTop, a water Cherenkov detector which covers the energy range from 10^15 to 10^18 eV where hadronic interactions are better constrained by data from the Large Hadron Collider. The analysis work funded by this award focuses on the problem of disentangling the composition of the highest energy cosmic rays from hadronic interactions. The behavior of ultrahigh energy cosmic ray air showers is not well-described by current models of hadronic interactions. Resolution of this problem may result in transformative improvements in our understanding of interactions beyond the reach of terrestrial accelerators.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported our work on analysis of data from the IceCube and IceTop detectors at the South Pole. IceCube consists of a cubic kilometer of clear deep ice instrumented to measure flashes of light produced by subatomic particles that traverse the region.  These include particles resulting from the interaction of neutrinos as well as deeply penetrating muons produced by cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere above the detector.  IceTop consists of instrumented ice tanks on the surface above IceCube that measure showers of particles produced by cosmic ray interactions.  We have used IceCube and IceTop to study cosmic ray composition and to search for cosmic ray sources by measuring the distribution of cosmic rays on the sky.\n\n Scientific studies conducted include an all-sky search for point sources of cosmic ray showers.  If found these would be an indication of sources of neutrons or other neutral particles, since charged cosmic rays are deflected by the Galactic magnetic field and lose their directionality.  No sources were found.  The results of this study were published in The Astrophysical Journal [1].  Additional work on the correlation of cosmic ray and neutrino directions in IceCube resulted in an undergraduate honors thesis [2].  We have also been working to improve our understanding of cosmic ray composition using neural network techniques to analyze IceCube and IceTop data [3].  We also work with others in the collaboration by reviewing analyses in progress and papaers being prepared for publication.\n\n In addition to our research work, we also perform service work that contributes to the operation of the detectors.  This includes validation of the IceTop data from the annual test run conducted at the end of the austral summer.  This validation ensures changes to the detector configuration each year are understood and that good data will be taken during the year.  We also participate in the IceCube Software Strike Team, which addresses issues in the project?s scientific software that have impact across the collaboration.\n\n Broader impacts included an annual IceCube MasterClass.
