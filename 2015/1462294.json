This year in coordination with the GRC, the second Laser Diagnostics in Combustion Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) is organized, which is a forum for graduate students and post-docs to present and exchange new data and cutting edge ideas immediately preceding the GRC. The GRC itself brings together approximately 170 scientists for a week of intense interaction and scientific discussion. This is not a conference for reviewing previous research, but rather to concentrate on novel and often controversial advances for the near- and longer-terms.",
