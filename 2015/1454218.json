 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research proposes new mathematical and algorithmic tools for identifying patterns in and effectively \r\nmining time-series data, i.e. a sequence of data points, measured typically at successive time instants\r\nspaced at uniform time intervals. A large variety of real-world data sources such as speech and audio,\r\nbiomedical signals, health care records, network-traffic and stock market data etc. manifest as time-series\r\nand their analysis is of significant interest to both government and industry. The explosion of such \r\ndata sources has only been exacerbated by the digital revolution, viz. the generous amount of audio-video\r\nstreams on the internet, the storage of large amounts of chronological health care records in electronic\r\ndatabases and the continuous generation of new time-series data from advances in sensing. Automated software\r\ntools that can find patterns in a large time-series sequence, help in fast and scalable retrieval, and\r\ncategorize large time-series collections are hence highly desirable. The proposed research is in developing \r\nsuch software (algorithmic)tools with a particular focus on robustness and scalability. The problem of \r\nrobustness refers to the fact that time-series that may have the \"same appeal\" to a human consumer, e.g. \r\ndifferent versions of the same song/video, may not necessarily be digitally identical. Hence, robust \r\ntechniques are needed that can withstand distortions which do not change the essence of the time-series \r\ncontent. Scalability requires that the pattern-matching techniques be fast and easy to implement, so that\r\nthe solutions can be deployed to mine large collections. Further, to prepare the next generation of\r\nengineers in electrical engineering and computer science, the project includes a strong educational\r\ncomponent. At the heart of this educational component is an edutainment game where a human player, i.e.\r\nstudents with varying levels of academic preparation (high-school, undergraduate and graduate), compete \r\nagainst a computer algorithm in a video piracy challenge. The game is aimed at making the learning \r\nprocess more interactive, particularly for undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nA serious practical challenge in mining time-series data for emerging applications is the ability to\r\nwithstand distortions - that is often instances of the \"same underlying\" time series are observed\r\nunder noise, amplitude and/or time scaling and other miscellaneous operations. Many existing\r\ntechniques for time-series comparisons do not enable distortion robustness and the ones that do,\r\noften come at a substantial computational cost. Further, existing algorithmic techniques enable\r\ncontrol of key properties of time-series features such as robustness and uniqueness only at an\r\nintuitive, often heuristic level. The proposed research advocates judicious selection of time-series\r\nextrema and aims to break the classical trade-off between computational efficiency in time-series\r\nfeature extraction and comparison vs. enabling robustness to distortions. Unlike existing methods,\r\nwhich employ pre-processing time-series filters \"inspired\" from intuition, explicit optimization of the\r\nfilter is proposed in the sense of cost functions that capture key feature attributes such as robustness\r\nand uniqueness of the extracted extrema. Optimal extrema extraction will be investigated in two\r\ndifferent setups: a.) a deterministic framework where example training time-series are used in the\r\noptimization, and b.) a statistical framework where stochastic models on time-series are used. A\r\nvariety of related sub-problems also emerge, namely: a.) connections to edge detection problems\r\nin image processing and vision, b.) encoding and comparisons of time-series extrema, and c.)\r\nextensions to finding robust extrema under non-linear operations on the time-series. The research\r\nplan is to juxtapose the development of the algorithmic tools with two real-world applications: 1.)\r\nmultimedia fingerprinting, and 2.) bio-medical time series analysis. Additionally, software tools\r\nnamely edutainment games will be developed based on these applications which will play a crucial\r\nrole in enhancing the PI's research and classroom teaching. Dissemination of research results will be\r\ndone via articles in leading Journals and conferences, and via online MATLAB software toolboxes.",

A key outcome of the project was the development of new algorithmic methods that break the classical trade-off between computational efficiency in time-series feature extraction and comparison vs. enabling robustness to distortions (e.g. noise) and limited training samples in learning tasks. A second related outcome was the development of new solutions to signal processing and pattern recognition problems that advance both generative (recovery) as well as discriminative (classification) tasks. In the 5 year duration of the project, we developed new optimization centric algorithms for sparsity constrained estimation, exact rank con- strained minimization and a variety of methods to deal with real-world non-convex constraints. A significant practical impact was the advancement of real-world applications in multimedia (particularly video) fingerprinting, imaging inverse problems such as super-resolution, dehazing, image deblurring, high dynamic range imaging, image alignment and analysis.
