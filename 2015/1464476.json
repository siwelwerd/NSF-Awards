 "awd_abstract_narration": "Random numbers are vital resources for modern day information processing, especially for information security. Random Number Generators (RNGs) are ubiquitous in computing and communication devices. However, none of the current solutions is completely satisfactory, undermining the very foundation of digital security. Thus enhancing the security of the current RNGs is imperative for safeguarding a prosperous secure information society.  The proposed technology exploits a new solution space, and represents one of the first concrete applications of quantum information science, and has the potential to draw even more public interest to the field. Randomness is universal, and its applications are across many fields. The target customer is a business which uses random numbers on a routine basis, and who has the potential for large losses if its randomness sources turn out to not be random. Two examples might be companies that manage electronic transactions and gambling casinos.   \r\n\r\nThe proposed technology is a certifiable random number generator based on quantum physics. The team can design an apparatus that will generate random bits while at the same certifying that the bits are random - even without any trust in the apparatus used. At the center of the technology is the idea that measurements on an entangled quantum state cannot be faked by any classical process. Based on this principle, a client can fully trust the outputs of the generator based on a simple assumption about the operation of the device (specifically, that no communication occurs between two separate components of the device).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur I-Corps experience began shortly after the Entreprenurial Lead and Principal Investigator completed a research project on quantum random number generation.  Quantum information is an emerging science which has incubated largely in academia.   It offers, in particular, important potential applications to information security: quantum random number generators give data encryption keys that are (thanks partly to our work) provably safe to use.  I-Corps offered us the possibility of business training to bridge the gap between academic and industry.   Through the University of Michigan we were connected with a Mentor and began the two-month I-Corps training session. \n\nWe interviewed 93 people, including professionals at government agencies, information security services, and car manufacturers.  We found pain points that future technology could address: threats to information security are rising, and there is a need for better trust in security products that are used.  We identified segments where the need for information security was the highest (such as vehicle cybersecurity, where lives are at risk).\n\nThrough training and interviews we learned more about how information security professionals think, and in particular about how new solutions are adopted.  We connected with security equipment manufacturers and government agencies who have large-scale responsibility for the shape of the field.  We learned about typical paths for the introduction of new technologies and made connections to possible partners.\n\nSince the I-Corps training, we have continued our own research on the development of a quantum random number generator at the University of Michigan.  The I-Corps program gave us a clear sense of direction and motivation for further developments of the product.  Quantum technology has unique capabilities, and we have obtained a clearer idea of how these features can be of benefit to society (specifically, as a defense in the ongoing information security crises).  I-Corps data have informed how we motivate our work during academic talks and the directions we undertake with experiments in the lab.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yaoyun Shi"
