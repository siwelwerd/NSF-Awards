 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding support to the Conference on Complex Analysis and Geometry to be held on the campus of the University of Wisconsin-Madison on March 27-29, 2015.  The conference is devoted to recent developments in several complex variables in connections with fields of harmonic analysis, partial differential equations, conformal geometry, complex geometry, and dynamical systems. It will feature 10 main speakers who are leading mathematicians or junior researchers who have made significant contributions to the fields. There will also be 5 short-talks presented by young researchers who obtained their Ph.D. recently. The conference will create opportunity for exchange of new research results and new frontiers, which will benefit the recent Ph.D.'s and graduate students. The organizers encourage women and members of underrepresented minority groups to participate in the conference, and partial travel support will be provided. \r\n\r\nThe conference will feature recent research results and methods in several complex variables. The main topics of the conference include the normal form theory in several complex variables and dynamical systems, extension property of biholomorphic mappings, d-bar-Neumann problems, the rigidity and classification of holomorphic mappings between balls, the local and global theory of CR manifolds, Levi-flat hypersurfaces and the lamination theory in complex projective spaces.",
