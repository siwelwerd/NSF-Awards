 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is estimated that somewhere in the universe a few pairs of supermassive black holes merge every single year, leaving behind a still more massive single black hole at the centers of the galaxies where this occurs.  The energy released is enormous, and the effect on galactic evolution profound, but no such event has ever been identified because the overwhelming majority of the energy is released in gravitational waves, which are as yet undetectable.  This project will characterize the visible light signals that should be given off by nearby gas under the influence of the event, using complex numerical simulations.  Training in these techniques will be of great value for the future activities of the junior researchers on the team.\r\n\r\nAlthough there should be sufficient gas close enough to the merger events to give off visible radiation, the character of any emitted signals is unknown.  Particular questions include in which band most of the light will emerge, what is its spectrum, and how does the radiated power vary in time? This work will start to answer these questions.  The extremely complex interaction between the surrounding gas and a pair of black holes bound to one another involves strongly nonlinear physics, including magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, shocks, and dynamical spacetimes, which can only be tackled numerically.  This requires carefully structured simulations using radiation transfer post-processing to predict key observable features, using the team's new infrastructure that supports consistent MHD calculations on separate grids and across qualitatively different spacetimes.  Calculations with astrophysically plausible parameters should identify unique photon signals for observers to locate black holes on their way to merger.\r\n\r\nThis computational system should also be useful to many other astrophysical simulations.  The work will train a number of graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in the techniques of large-scale numerical simulation, skills that are valuable far beyond the confines of astrophysical research.  The team is active in outreach both to non-science students and to the general public, including work to engage deaf and hard-of-hearing students in the sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEvery sizable galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center, and every such galaxy is believed to have grown through mergers of smaller galaxies. There must then be galaxies with two supermassive black holes at their centers, bound to one another and gradually approaching one another as this binary radiates energy in gravitational waves.   As they do so, they can be surrounded by substantial amounts of gas, drawn from the interstellar gas of the galaxy around them.\n\nFinding examples would be of great interest because they embody both a fundamental mechanism of galaxy formation and one of the most dramatic events in the Universe---the merger of two very massive black holes accompanied by the radiation in gravitational waves of an energy equivalent to the mass of as much as millions of stars.  It was the goal of our project to predict what sort of light might be radiated during this process, its distribution in color and its variation in time, so that observers combing through existing and new sky surveys could find some of these rare systems.   Our method was to employ very large-scale numerical simulations of magnetized gas flow in this relativistic environment and then translate the dissipated heat into light. \n\nDuring the grant period, we made several discoveries relevant to this problem: a way in which general relativistic effects make it much easier for gas to \"slosh\" back and forth between one black hole and the other; surprisingly rapid inward motion of orbiting gas around black holes when they are part of a relativistically close binary; and oscillations in the light output from such systems as the gas around one black hole alternates with that around the other in dominating the light output.\n\nOur work also connects to the world beyond astrophysics: we have trained numerous graduate students and post-docs in large-scale computing; we have developed new fluid simulation software that potentially may be useful in fields from astrophysics to biology to engineering; and we have participated in the direct public outreach efforts conducted by the Johns Hopkins University Department of Physics and Astronomy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Julian H Krolik"
