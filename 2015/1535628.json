 "awd_abstract_narration": "A very powerful laser can be used to accelerate electrons to high energies by interacting with a state of matter known as a plasma, an ionized gas of charged particles. The laser achieves this by creating waves in the plasma, like a boat pushing through water, on which the electrons can surf and be accelerated to high energies. In this specific project the pulse of laser light will be controlled and the structure of these waves mapped out in time and space, both with unprecedented precision. These techniques should help the development of compact particle accelerators. Accelerators represent a $3B per year market, but their overall impact is even greater since they find use in everything from cancer therapy to imaging stresses in aircraft wings. Thus, the development of compact and cheap accelerators is likely to have a significant impact both economically and technologically.\r\n\r\nThe research project will use the high repetition rate of the relativistic intensity (~10^19 W per square cm, 35 fs) laser, \"Lambda-cubed\", located on campus at the University of Michigan - Ann Arbor to enable unique measurements of laser propagation and wakefield formation, to exert unprecedented control of laser wakefield acceleration, and to generate up to 10 MeV, few fs duration electron beams at 0.5 kHz. Stable, high quality relativistic electron beams at up to 10 MeV at 0.5 kHz repetition rate using the Lambda-cubed laser will be generated by making use of advances in pulse compression and feedback control made at the University of Michigan. A 5 fs pulse will be used as an ultrafast 4D probe of the plasma wakefield structure, allowing unique tomographic characterization of the accelerator structure.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n The research performed under the NSF grant \"Laser Wakefield Acceleration at kHz Repetition Rate\" at the University of Michigan was an experimental project designed to develop compact laser-driven particle accelerators which have the potential to revolutionize applications of particle acceleration technology such as those in medicine and homeland security. Several graduate students were funded by this grant and used the data obtained as part of their MSc and PhD thesis work.\n\n            The use of high intensity ultra-short laser pulses as drivers for the next generation of accelerators has received considerable attention in the research community over the past decade and demonstrations of electron beam acceleration to multi-GeV energies, ions to about 100 MeV and even positrons have been made.  The quality of the particle beams produced is approaching that needed for applications such as x-ray generation and neutron production.  However the main disadvantage of laser driven sources is the relatively low repetition rate of the laser drivers and consequently the relatively low average flux of electrons and x-rays.\n\n At the University of Michigan in the research funded by this grant we have performed work on high rep. rate lasers using machine learning techniques, genetic algorithms, and adaptive optics to enhance the beam quality of high average flux sources of particles and radiation by more than an order of magnitude.  In particular we found that adaptive optics can be used to control the structure of laser generated wakefields in order to optimize the properties of the electron beam with respect to energy spread, beam divergence and peak energy at higher peak laser power than previously possible and with a longer wavelength driver (i.e., using a laser operating wavelength of 3.9 &micro;m rather than 800 nm as in our previous work).  Such work is only possible using kHz sources and indeed is critical to the use of laser driven sources since feedback techniques also dramatically enhance beam stability.\n\n            We have also combined these with genetic algorithms and feedback to work with a \"Dazzler\" (acousto-optic programmable dispersive filter, i.e., an ultrashort laser \"pulse-shaper\"), in order to control the temporal shape of the laser pulse which was also demonstrated to improve beam parameters substantially.\n\n            Another critical component for laser driven accelerators is control of the \"laser contrast\" at relativistic intensities and at high rep rate which has never been previously done. We have performed work using a micron thick flowing water or ethylene glycol \"window\" formed by controlled collision of dual 10\u2019s of microns thick liquid jets in vacuum, which can be used as a plasma mirror to enhance laser contrast at the required kHz rep rates or higher.   In this project we have also used these high repetition rate electron beam sources as ultrafast probes of the dynamics of materials and non-equilibrium plasmas.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/15/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karl Krushelnick"
