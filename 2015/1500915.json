The main foci of the 2015 event are the following: classification of  C*-algebras; von Neumann algebras; recent advances in operator theory; noncommutative geometry; C*-algebras and dynamical systems. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.\r\n\r\nConference web page:  www.math.purdue.edu/~mdd/GPOTS2015/index.html",
