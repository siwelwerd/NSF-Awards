This is the 5th in the series of workshops that have allowed a growing community of directional dark matter researchers to meet, exchange ideas, set priorities for the field, discuss international scale-up possibilities and, generally, encourage growth of the field.\r\n\r\nFor Broader Impacts, this award has a particular focus on graduate students. It will allow 10 to 20 graduate students to attend this workshop. This will be an exciting and engaging activity and attending it will broaden the perspectives of this group of students as they interact directly with the more experienced scientists who are attending.",
