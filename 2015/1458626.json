 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate software to mine data from imaging flow cytometers. These instruments can capture thousands of images of cells per second. The images can in theory be analyzed to precisely measure hundreds of features related to a cell's appearance (\"morphology\"); this project is to develop advanced machine-learning software to accomplish this, unlocking the otherwise hidden information within the images. The software will be developed, improved, and validated in several demonstration experiments involving the cell cycle, the component cells of primary blood, immune cell activation, and stem cell identity. The goal will be to use as few or indeed no fluorescent biomarkers, eliminating the need to perturb cells. The resulting open-source software will be freely available to scientists worldwide for both applied and clinical research, and will be accompanied by user-friendly training materials and in-person workshops. The project is collaborative and interdisciplinary and includes training early career-stage scientists in computational biology, via the existing Scientists without Borders program.\r\n\r\nThe project involves close collaboration with researchers using imaging flow cytometers and builds on successful interdisciplinary work in biological data mining. In order to devise the novel software and methodology to mine the large datasets acquired using imaging flow cytometry, the team will develop algorithms to seamlessly import data from an imaging cytometer, robustly segment cells, quality-filter them (e.g., for debris and blur), and quantify morphological parameters (usually hundreds) for each cell (usually thousands), including various measures of size, shape, and texture. Using these features, trained machine-learning algorithms will identify cell phenotypes of interest or otherwise characterize the state of cell in driving biological projects from project partners who use imaging flow cytometry in a host of biological research studies. The goal will be to use as few or indeed no fluorescent biomarkers, eliminating the need to perturb cells. The project will give the scientific community a validated, open-source software toolbox of image processing and machine learning algorithms readily usable by biologists.
