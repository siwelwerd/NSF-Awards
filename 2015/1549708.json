 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide support for 12 students (10-11 undergraduate students, 1-2 graduate students) per year from diverse backgrounds to attend the annual meetings of the Botanical Society of America (BSA). The goal is to increase the number of students from underrepresented groups who attend these meetings and to increase their motivation to complete advanced degrees in the plant sciences. The PLANTS (Preparing Leaders and Nurturing Tomorrow's Scientists) program supports a mentoring network of graduate students, post-doctoral scholars, and faculty who assist the students before, during and after the meetings. The program promotes retention of students in graduate school by encouraging the academic development of those in the pipeline (including but not limited to PLANTS alumni), encouraging them to serve as role models and mentors, and to participate in other PLANTS activities (e.g., panel workshops, admissions committees). Recognizing that the vitality of the discipline depends upon inclusion of people from the broadest possible base, and given the low diversity of the membership within the plant sciences, the BSA actively seeks to increase participation of underrepresented groups. The BSA includes a broad membership, with members with different ages, types of institutions, and academic areas. This breadth offers far-reaching opportunities for students to explore their interests in the plant sciences and to broaden their career opportunities. Greater visible involvement and engagement of all BSA members in these activities emphasizes to all the critical need for continued diversity recruitment for the vitality of the discipline\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting, each undergraduate is assigned a peer mentor (usually a graduate student), and a senior mentor (post-doctoral scholar, faculty, or other professional). The student and mentors determine the talks of greatest interest to the student, attend and discuss the content of those talks together, attend required activities and networking events together, and mentors introduce students to faculty, postdocs, and students in their academic field. The PLANTS graduate students serve as peer mentors and role models. The mentors not only interpret the content of scientific talks to students, but also point out their broader relevance and pass on to students the genuine intellectual excitement and involvement of the conference participants. Required sessions include research talks, professional development workshops (e.g., how to apply to graduate school, careers in the plant sciences), and application of the plant sciences to societal needs.",

The conference offers opportunities to meet with scientists at different career stages and from diverse backgrounds through conference-wide talks, mixers, and meetings, whether a BIPOC or Asian-Asian American-Pacific Islander gathering, LBGTQ+ mixer, or a mixer for all undergraduates.</p>\n<p>The mentoring program is a critical part of PLANTS, designed so that each student has two volunteer mentors, one a peer mentor (advanced undergraduate or graduate student) and one senior mentor (postdoctoral fellow or faculty/professional). The mentors facilitate discussions of research, networking, and professional development. The PLANTS student and two mentors often meet daily&nbsp;during the meeting to organize their activities, plan to attend specific talks and discuss them afterwards, and answer student questions. Mentors received pre-conference training on how to mentor students from underrepresented groups. They introduce students to other faculty attendees with similar interests, and in general, point out the broader relevance and application of the discipline to the students, passing on their genuine intellectual excitement and fostering a sense of belonging. Students found the various professional development programs useful, but student feedback indicated that the most critical and best part of the PLANTS program was their mentors. Many of the 104 mentors participated several years, and several mentors were former PLANTS students.</p>\n<p>PLANTS students came from different backgrounds (community colleges, tribal colleges and universities, HBCUs, small colleges, larger universities), and were chosen in part because they had demonstrated interest in learning more about botany, had limited opportunities to learn about the plant sciences or experience these types of activities at their home institutions, had limited resources to attend BOTANY meetings, and could contribute to the diversity of the conference. The majority of the 84 PLANTS students were women, and for in-person meetings (2016-2019), about 84% of the PLANTS students were from groups under-represented in the plant sciences as defined by NSF (by ethnicity, because of disabilities, or veterans). Diversity in the PLANTS program was less during the two virtual meetings (2020-2021) so that over the six years of PLANTS II, about 75% of the students participating were from groups under-represented in the plant sciences. Because many of these students were early in their college careers, many have not yet graduated and started specific training for careers. Many students from PLANTS I (2011-2015) are now well into career pathways. Considering the first three years of PLANTS I, 45% of the 31 students tracked (out of 37) received PhDs and about 80% received either PhD or Master?s degrees or were in graduate school in 2021. Six of the PLANTS I students now hold some kind of faculty position.

The PLANTS program encourages students from under-represented groups to become part of the scientific community and continue on to careers in botany and related fields. In return, PLANTS students have made a significant difference in the awareness of the botanical societies about the importance of diversity and inclusion and&nbsp;the need to provide a welcoming environment for all.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/22/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ann&nbsp;K&nbsp;Sakai</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1549708/1549708_10384580_1640195982065_2018PLANTSGroupPhotoAJBfinal--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1549708/1549708_10384580_1640195982065_2018PLANTSGroupPhotoAJBfinal--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2018 PLANTS students and mentors\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1549708/1549708_10384580_1640195982065_2018PLANTSGroupPhotoAJBfinal--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2018 PLANTS students and mentors\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2018 PLANTS students and mentors.
