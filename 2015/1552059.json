The workshop will be organized in two meetings, one in Brazil in the fall of 2015, and one in the US in the spring of 2016. The attendees will be comprised of about 35 American and Brazilian researchers in cyber security and privacy in universities in the US and in Brazil.   \r\n\r\nThis workshop promotes innovation in solving cyber security and privacy problems, by having the top researchers from both countries, from several sub-fields sharing their research and brainstorming solutions for open problems in the area. Having a scientific discussion on cyber security and privacy with Brazilian academics can increase the visibility and applicability of American technology in other countries, and increase the diversity of students applying to undergraduate and graduate programs in the US. Brazil is a large a diverse democracy with significant scientific strengths, and this proposal helps improve connections between the two countries.  Additionally, this workshop will strengthen the US-Brazil Bilateral Cooperation on Education, which includes the Brazil Scientific Mobility program, which has funded almost 30,000 Brazilian students at various levels in American educational institutions.",
