Students who are accepted into the program will participate at one of the 3 campuses in a 10-week program that involves conducting research in a cutting-edge engineering project, attending scientific seminars and industry tours, and presenting their results. The Center recognizes the importance of students in academic research to be able to interact and appreciate the industrial culture. As a result, a goal of this grant is to leverage these partnerships to enable alumni REU interns to be placed into industry internships. The Center also has active partnerships with minority serving institutions and is committed to providing opportunities for students from underrepresented minority groups. The Center will broaden participation by joining efforts with, Professor Willie Rockwood of Morehouse College, a Historically Black College/Univ. (HBCU), who has a >10 year history of working with the Center and is co-PI of this grant.\r\n\r\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nLight in the EUV region of the spectrum (wavelengths approximately 5 - 50 nm) is the key enabling technology of critical importance to the semiconductor industry and national economy. The EUV ERC will provide summer research internships that involve EUV science and technology topics such as laser systems, nanoscience (quantum dots), electronic (printed board) circuit design, photonic techniques (ellipsometry, phase shifting interferometry and both ambient condition and low-temperature vacuum spectroscopy), optics design (Brewster's Angle plate beam splitter), lithography (essential to next generation computer processor manufacturing), chemistry and material science (photo resists), and high voltage systems. Titles of possible projects include: Nanoscale resolution mass-microscope by EUV laser ablation mass spectrometry; Photoelectron dynamics using high harmonic EUV light; and, the Design and construction of a new vacuum chamber test bed for characterizing magnetic materials at the nano-scale with ultrafast time resolution. \r\n\r\nThe Center has an active partnership with Industries in the development of EUV-technologies that derive from research conducted at the Center. The Center recognizes the importance of students in academic research to be able to interact and appreciate the industrial culture. As a result, a goal of this grant is to leverage these partnerships to enable alumni REU interns to be placed into industry internships.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) Engineering Research Center (ERC), which graduated from NSF funding in 2014, used the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site Grant to enable students to participate in world-class research experiences that will prepare them for entry into graduate studies in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) disciplines and into the industry workforce in the field of EUV science and engineering.  \n\nThe Center is dedicated to conducting research and training engineers and scientists in the area of lasers and photonics, focusing in particular in the generation and application of extreme ultraviolet light.  This laser-generated shorter wavelength light is opening new revolutionary opportunities in science in areas including nanotechnology, materials, chemistry and biology.  Moreover, it will have an enormous economic impact by enabling the mass production of the next generations of computer processors and memory.  Industry started to use extreme ultraviolet light in the mass production of the most advanced integrated circuits in 2018.  The EUV ERC REU program provided students with a unique opportunity designed to understand EUV science and technology and to become involved in EUV-related research projects with state-of-the-art equipment that are technically and scientifically challenging, and highly interdisciplinary.  The Center faculty and research labs are producing cutting-edge research and have partnerships with industries that are leaders in the development and commercialization of products that will be at the forefront of the next generation of technology, including critical tools for the fabrication of all future cell phones and computers.\n\nDuring Summer 2018, ten undergraduate students participated in the 10-week program at two campus locations: Colorado State University (CSU) in Fort Collins and the University of California at Berkeley (UCB).
