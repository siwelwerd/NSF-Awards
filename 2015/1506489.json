 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is now a well-established fact that nucleons, protons and neutrons, are made up of more elementary particles called quarks. The main physics program supported by this grant is to study of the quark structure of nucleons. More information is needed about the details of this quark structure. One aspect that is particularly interesting is the existence of anti-quarks in the proton, which is a consequence of quantum mechanics. An experiment called Seaquest uses high-energy protons from the Fermilab accelerator to study these anti-quark distributions in the nucleon and in nuclei. This experiment will achieve unprecedented accuracy in the determination of the anti-quark distributions. Beyond the field of particle physics, these distributions are useful in cosmology as they seek to understand matter at the galactic scale.  Beyond the scientific goals, the proposed detector commissioning, data acquisition and analysis activities will continue to offer education and research experience to undergraduates and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis three-year research program will study the ratio of anti-down quarks to anti-up quarks in the nucleon and in nuclei using the Drell-Yan reaction at Fermilab. At high momentum fraction these poorly known anti-quark distributions may provide a partonic understanding of the well known \"pion cloud\" model of classical nuclear physics. The reaction in nuclear targets will also be used to study quark energy loss. The Colorado group has nearly completed a new tracking detector for the Seaquest spectrometer, providing a larger acceptance and higher rate capabilities, and plans to complete, install, and commission this detector.",

A particular focus was the relative numbers of high momentum anti-up and anti-down quarks. Some theories predicted equal numbers, indicating that the mechanisms of producing the antimatter were the same for both flavors of antiquark, while other theories predicted that there would be a predominance of anti-down quarks at high momentum. In order to investigate this question, the Seaquest Collaboration used the Drell-Yan reaction in which a high-energy proton strikes a target nucleus (hydrogen or deuterium) and produces a high-energy, oppositely-charged pair of subatomic particles known as muons. This muon pair primarily results from the annihilation of an antiquark from the impinging proton and a quark from the target nucleus. Detecting the angles and energies of these muons allow us to reconstruct the momentum of the initial quark-anti-quark pair. Switching between hydrogen and deuterium targets (which have different numbers of up and down quarks) allow us to extract the ratio of anti-down to anti-up quarks. The apparatus to detect these pairs was assembled and installed by the collaboration at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois, and used one of the high-energy proton beams to perform the experiment. In addition to the hydrogen and deuterium targets, targets of carbon, iron and tungsten were used in order to investigate the possible effects on the Drell-Yan reaction when taking place deep inside a nucleus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The results of the experiment support the conclusion that there are indeed more anti-down quarks at high momentum, as shown in Figure 1. The results have significant impact outside the field since they are used as the basis of understanding particle productions in cosmic rays and high energy collisions of particle physics experiments, and due to their importance, were published in the prestigious journal <em>Nature</em>. Besides publication, the results of this work have been presented at numerous international scientific conferences as well as in talks for the general public.</p>\n<p>This scientific project provided a host of opportunities to train young scientists in the techniques and apparatus used to detect high energy particles. The particular contribution of the group from Colorado was the prototyping, construction, installation and operation of a large particle tracking chamber in the Fermilab apparatus. Undergraduate students, a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow were involved in the development of this detector, learning not only fabrication and construction skills, but also becoming adept in the use of the electronic readout instrumentation. The graduate student supported by this NSF grant, Dr. Po-Ju Lin, not only participated in the detector operation, but also in the analysis of the data collected. This formed the basis of his PhD thesis, in which he used the production of the muon pairs from heavy nuclei to look at whether the quark-antiquark annihilation was affected by the nucleus, in particular possible energy loss effects. Figure 2 shows Dr. Lin in front of the tracking detector built by the Colorado group, along with the PI. Figure 3 shows the primary result of his PhD thesis, indicating that energy loss deep inside the nucleus does in fact occur.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/28/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Edward&nbsp;R&nbsp;Kinney</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1506489/1506489_10369394_1632875033905_Outcomes-F1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1506489/1506489_10369394_1632875033905_Outcomes-F1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ratio of Anti-down to anti-up quarks\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1506489/1506489_10369394_1632875033905_Outcomes-F1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ratio of Anti-down to anti-up quarks\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ratios of anti-down to anti-up quarks in the proton (red filled circles) as a function of momentum fraction x with their statistical (vertical bars) and systematic (yellow boxes) uncertainties extracted from the presentdata based on NLO calculations of the Drell-Yan cross sections</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">SeaQuest Collaboration</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Edward&nbsp;R&nbsp;Kinney</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ratio of Anti-down to anti-up quarks</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1506489/1506489_10369394_1632875172025_Outcomes-F2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1506489/1506489_10369394_1632875172025_Outcomes-F2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Po Ju Lin and PI with Detector\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1506489/1506489_10369394_1632875172025_Outcomes-F2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Po Ju Lin and PI with Detector\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PhD student Po Ju Lin and PI Ed Kinney in front of the installed tracking chamber built at the University of Colorado - Boulder.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Edward Kinney</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Edward&nbsp;R&nbsp;Kinney</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Po Ju Lin and PI with Detector</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1506489/1506489_10369394_1632876008253_Outcomes-F3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1506489/1506489_10369394_1632876008253_Outcomes-F3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Drell-Yan Nuclear Cross Section Ratios\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1506489/1506489_10369394_1632876008253_Outcomes-F3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Drell-Yan Nuclear Cross Section Ratios\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Preliminary analysis of ratio of Drell-Yan cross section in iron to that in carbon (left plot) and tungsten to carbon (right plot), as a function of fractional momentum xf.
