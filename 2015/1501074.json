 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the \"Dynamical Systems and Ergodic Theory Conference\" hosted by the Department of Mathematics of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, May 18 - 20, 2015. Dynamical systems, ergodic theory, and probability are important fields of modern mathematics dealing with complicated systems and their development over time. By noticing and analyzing patterns of such developments, dynamical systems and ergodic theory often allow one to describe stable states of a system, predict changes in a system, and assess their likelihood. The connection to probabilistic models often aids in these goals. The conference will bring together senior and junior researchers who will be exposed to the most recent results in the field and will participate in fruitful scientific exchanges. This will create a true synergy, push the bounds of our understanding of mathematics further, and lead to new discoveries. \r\n\r\nThe meeting features presentations by leaders in dynamical systems, ergodic theory, and their interface with probability theory. This conference will advance knowledge through communication of recent results to a wide audience that includes graduate students and recent Ph.D. recipients, as well as members of groups that are not well represented in the mathematical sciences. An important contribution of the conference is the special opportunities afforded to junior participants to present their work to the international leaders in this area. \r\n\r\nConference web site: people.cas.uab.edu/~ablokh/Chernov-conference-2015",
