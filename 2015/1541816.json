 "awd_abstract_narration": "1541816 (Watkins). This workshop will bring together experts from a broad range of disciplines to identify climate change mitigation strategies based on improved understanding and management of coupled food, energy and water (FEW) production-consumption systems. The focus is on climate change mitigation based on FEW conservation strategies, with the following overarching research question: How can we best design FEW conservation strategies that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions, avoid unintended consequences to individual FEW sectors and the environment, be financially viable for FEW producers, and be acceptable to FEW consumers? \r\n\r\nOn the FEW production side, data and models are needed to quantify and predict resource use, greenhouse gas emissions, and costs associated with alternatives for meeting FEW security goals. However, there is also a need to recognize that these goals are not defined ex ante, but rather are based on human goals and behaviors which are complex, heterogeneous, and continuously evolve as new information and alternatives become available. While the state of the art in analyzing sustainability of socio-ecological systems continues to advance (e.g., resiliency), these concepts have not been brought to bear on the FEW nexus. To add this important dimension to the FEW nexus dialogue, this workshop will focus on reducing consumption and developing integrated climate change mitigation-adaptation strategies accounting for endogenous socio-economic feedbacks. An integrated mitigation-adaptation approach is needed because land, energy, and water management strategies for climate change mitigation must account for changes that will already occur given current greenhouse gas levels. Furthermore, moving towards sustainable consumption will require understanding of how FEW production systems may be affected. Workshop outcomes will be widely disseminated through a white paper and Eos article identifying critical research frontiers for FEW conservation strategies based on a coupled production-consumption systems approach.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overall goal of this project is to better understand interactions among the food, energy, and water (FEW) sectors, and how reducing consumption can mitigate resource scarcity and climate change.  With the planet\u00c6s population surpassing 7 billion, many regions face growing threats to food, energy, and water security.  Supply-side solutions focusing on one of these resources often have implications for the other two, as well as for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  For example, desalination of sea water uses large amounts of energy; some forms of bioenergy signficantly impact water resources and use up land that could otherwise be used to grow food; and increasing food production typically requires more intensive use of land, energy, and water resources.  In contrast, conservation in one of the FEW sectors often contributes to reduced consumption in the other two, along with reduced GHG emissions.\n\nIn October 2015, a two-day workshop was held at Michigan Technological University in Houghton, MI, bringing together social, natural, and engineering scientists to discuss these issues.  The 47 workshop participants represented 25 institutions, including multiple U.S. universities, government agencies, non-profit organizations, and international research institutions.  About one-third of the participants were early career scientists, including 6 graduate students and 2 post-doctoral researchers.\n\nWorkshop participants examined several important aspects of FEW conservation strategies, including human behavior, policy levers, and potential side-effects.  Like supply-side solutions, FEW conservation strategies can have unintended consequences.  One example is the well-known \"rebound effect,\" which occurs when conservation of one resource is offset, or partially offset, by increased consumption of another resource.  Reduced consumption of FEW resources can also affect the revenue streams of FEW producers.  Thus, to be sustainable, conservation strategies must be acceptable to consumers and have lasting effects on their behavior, be financially viable for FEW producers, and avoid adverse impacts on the environment.\n\nThe primary outcome of the workshop was a report submitted to National Science Foundation that identified potential FEW conservation strategies for climate change mitigation, key gaps in knowledge that may affect the outcomes of these strategies, and recommendations for studies to close these gaps. Several priorities were identified for future research, including:\n\nComparative studies of alternative development pathways to food, energy, and water security for the world\u00c6s growing and increasingly affluent population.\nUnderstanding and addressing the issue of \"lock-in,\" i.e., how the economies of industrialized societies become dependent on particular technology and infrastructure settings.  One example is the traditional approach to water withdrawal, treatment, distribution, and use; followed by wastewater collection, treatment, and discharge to the environment.\nUnderstanding the pros and cons of land use intensification--using smaller tracts of land more intensively as a potential means of conserving natural resources and protecting the environment.\nUnderstanding societal, institutional and individual factors that affect consumer behavior, along with the direct and indirect impacts of behavioral changes on FEW consumption.\n\n\nAnother important outcome of the project was the development of new partnerships and strengthening of existing networks for interdisciplinary research on food, energy, water and climate.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/17/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David W Watkins"
