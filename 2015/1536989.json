 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ocean microbes produce half of the oxygen that humans breath and drive much of the energy and nutrient transformations that fuel ocean ecosystems. Viruses of microbes alter these microbial impacts through mortality, moving genes from one organism to another, and reprogramming a host cell's metabolism during infection. However, current understanding of ocean viruses is limited to just a few specific model systems or study sites. This project will produce a foundational dataset - the Global Ocean Virome (GOV) - for contextualizing newly discovered viruses, and use this dataset to evaluate the environmental conditions that structure viral communities or how viral communities change over time and space. Additionally, the project will illuminate 'viral dark matter' by experimentally identifying viral structural proteins and generating and investigating single-cell genomic datasets to link novel and abundant viruses to their host cells. The project will train 6 researchers, as well as lead to curriculum, seminars and a public exhibit at The Wellington School and the Columbus Center Of Science and Industry that will together reach approximately 500 students and 250,000 members of the public.\r\n\r\nThe GOV dataset is comprised of 104 viral metagenomes from around the world's surface and deep oceans. This project seeks to analyze the GOV to identify and quantify viral populations globally, then evaluate these data for ecological patterns to determine the ecological drivers of surface and deep ocean viral community structure. These patterns and drivers will be interpreted in the context of (i) viral metaproteomic experiments to maximally annotate unknown viral proteins that are structural, (ii) paired microbial sequence datasets (metagenomes and metatranscriptomes) that will enable assessment of how biotic factors impact viral community structure and (iii) single-cell amplified genomes and phageFISH experiments that will enable identification of hosts for abundant and novel viruses identified in the GOV. In total, this project will further optimize recently developed genome- and population-based viral ecology methods to establish a first available global map of surface and deep ocean viral populations from both free viromes and infected microbes. These analyses will help evaluate and establish myriad hypotheses about viral roles in marine microbial ecology and biogeochemistry, and the dataset will be a foundational resource for microbial and viral ecologists to contextualize new viruses, identify viruses in microbial datasets, and explore virus-host interactions both phenomenologically and through ecosystem modeling. The GOV will be made publicly available through the NSF-funded iPlant Cyberinfrastructure and metaVIR (http://metavir-meb.univ-bpclermont.fr/).",

On the latter, the oceans absorb human-released carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, having, in effect, approximately halved the climate change impact of these gases. Critical to this ocean ?ecosystem service? are the floating organisms, or plankton, that are comprised of microbes and viruses, which effectively serve as a biological carbon pump on a grand scale. This is because it is these plankton that determine whether the ocean-absorbed atmospheric climate gases are incorporated into biomass and disposed to the deep sea or remineralized and released back into the atmosphere. For this reason, ocean scientists have long studied the organisms that drive the ocean carbon pump to better understand how the oceans will impact climate and the nutrient and energy flows that underpin much of how the Earth System works. In 2008, an ambitious, international project -- the Tara Oceans Expedition -- was launched to systematically study viruses, microbes, and small plants and animals throughout the world?s oceans.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This NSF-funded project focused on understanding the viruses, and their larger ecosystem roles throughout the Global Ocean. Using methods developed to be portable enough to function on a sailboat (the ?Tara? research vessel) and systematic enough to allow for global sampling, we discovered via sequencing over 200,000 new virus species, which predominantly infect bacteria. Because virtually every one of these viruses were new to science, we developed machine learning approaches to classify them. With this Global Ocean virus catalog, we then identified the most abundant viruses so that they could be studied in the laboratory, as well as in the field. Laboratory experiments of some of the most abundant viruses revealed complex mechanisms of resistance, and how virus infections change under nutrient limitation. Genome sequencing revealed viruses directly encoded genes for photosynthesis, as well as cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur -- which directly implicates viruses in the very biogeochemical cycles for which the oceans are so important. Most unexpectedly, ecological modeling revealed that of all the plankton community members, viruses best predict the flux of carbon from surface to deep waters in the oceans. This means that viruses likely play an even bigger role in ocean food webs and nutrient cycling than previously realized, and the findings have spurred the field towards new experiments to better understand this.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Beyond the science, which resulted in over 15 research articles including several ?top tier? in Science, Nature, and Cell, this award supported several efforts that will have long-standing impact. First, the Global Ocean Virome dataset developed here serves as a critical resource for researchers around the world that want to study viruses in the oceans. Second, this award supported world-class training and research experience to dozens of undergraduates, graduates, and postdocs, as well as several ?viromics workshops? for workforce training efforts that impacted more than 100 trainees from around the world. Third, students and postdocs were trained in a new generation of ?big team science?, as well as how to communicate in public-facing venues including with the press corps and a science museum. Lastly, to best communicate this novel view of the impact of viruses in natural ecosystems, we collaborated with the Center of Science and Industry (COSI), which is a science museum and research center in Columbus, Ohio, to design and multi-year exhibit showcasing the role, impact, and diversity of viruses in the oceans. The exhibit is set to open to the public in December 2021, and will share the excitement of ?Tara Oceans? science in a way that will impact a large fraction of the &gt;250K annual COSI visitors.</span></p>\n<div><span><br /></span></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Matthew&nbsp;Sullivan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1536989/1536989_10393079_1638284630339_01Tara_polar-uploaded--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1536989/1536989_10393079_1638284630339_01Tara_polar-uploaded--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The Tara research vessel sailing the Arctic\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1536989/1536989_10393079_1638284630339_01Tara_polar-uploaded--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The Tara research vessel sailing the Arctic\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The research schooner, Tara, navigating ice in the Arctic during the Tara Oceans Polar Circle Expeditions.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tara Oceans Foundation</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;Sullivan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">The Tara research vessel sailing the Arctic</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1536989/1536989_10393079_1638282436516_PastedGraphic-2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1536989/1536989_10393079_1638282436516_PastedGraphic-2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Marine viruses ride along ocean currents.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1536989/1536989_10393079_1638282436516_PastedGraphic-2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Marine viruses ride along ocean currents.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Analysis of 43 Tara Oceans expedition samples revealed, for the first time, a global ocean ecological view of virus diversity in the oceans.
