 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to better understand an operation on matrices called \"mutation.\"  A matrix is a collection of numbers arranged in a square grid.  Matrix mutation takes a matrix and changes it according to certain rules to make a new matrix.  The rules themselves seem strange and counterintuitive, but matrix mutation is happening behind the scenes in many very important mathematical areas, including Teichm\u00fcller theory, Poisson geometry, quiver representations, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, algebraic combinatorics, and even partial differential equations (in the equations describing shallow water waves).  Matrix mutation appears in certain kinds of algebra (manipulating multivariable functions in a setting called a \"cluster algebra\"), combinatorics (modeling cluster algebras by discrete objects) and geometry (measuring distances in two-dimensional spaces).  A key component of this project is to study matrix mutation, with a focus on the \"mutation fan.\"  A fan is a way of cutting space into pieces (subject to certain rules).  For example, if we draw three different lines through (0,0) in the xy-plane, they cut space into six pieces, and those pieces define a fan.  If we take two of the pieces that are right next to each other and glue them together to make one piece, the resulting five pieces are a simple example of a mutation fan.  \r\n\r\nOne part of the project concerns universal geometric coefficients and mutation fans.  Specifically, the goal is to construct the mutation fan for matrices arising from Cartan matrices of affine type and from surfaces, and to construct universal coefficients in those cases. Furthermore, the research will pin down the relationships between mutation fans and other fans, like tropicalized cluster algebras, fans of semi-invariants, and scattering diagrams.  A second part of the project concerns the dominance relation on exchange matrices.  A matrix B dominates a matrix B' if they have the same (weak) sign pattern and each entry of B is weakly larger than the corresponding entry of B'. The goal of this part of the project is to understand a phenomenon observed in many examples, namely (1) that dominance relations among matrices often lead to refinement relations among mutation fans and (2) that there is often an algebraic relationship between the two cluster algebras. The third part of the project concerns cluster algebras and Coxeter-Catalan combinatorics in affine type.  Here the goal is to construct the affine-type analogs of almost-positive root models for cluster algebras, and to relate them to affine doubled Cambrian fans.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThis project further developed our understanding of the combinatorics and geometry of matrix mutation, and the related Coxeter groups, root systems, and scattering diagrams.\n\nThe investigator and Stella extended the almost-positive roots model to affine type and used it to construct d-vectors and d-vector fans of acyclic affine type.  As part of the model, we refined known results about orbits of roots under the action of an affine Coxeter element.  We extended (from finite type to affine type) the key relationship between sortable elements and d-vector fans.  We used a completion of the d-vector fan, along with the known relationship between the d-vector fan and the g-vector fan to construct a completion of the g-vector fan.  We showed that our completed fan coincides with the mutation fan and with the cluster scattering fan.\n\nThe investigator proved many instances of dominance phenomena (involving mutation-linear maps, fan refinement, and ring homomorphisms of cluster algebras).\n\nThe investigator proved that scattering diagrams define complete fans.  I also carried out a combinatorial study of cluster scattering diagrams, connecting them to Cambrian fans and laying the groundwork for the work described above on affine cluster scattering diagrams and future work on cluster scattering diagrams in the surfaces case.\n\nThe investigator (with Speyer and Thomas) proved a Fundamental Theorem of Finite Semidistributive Lattices, analogous to the well known Fundamental Theorem of Finite Distributive Lattices.

The goal of the seminar is to recruit talented undergraduates to mathematics and broaden the mathematical preparation and background of STEM students.

He made his work on lattice-theoretic approaches to the combinatorics of Coxeter groups more available and accessible by giving a graduate lecture series at a LaCIM-CRM Spring School in Montreal in 2017.  The lectures were based on chapters that he wrote for the book Lattice theory:  Special Topics and Applications.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/22/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nathan Reading"
