 "awd_abstract_narration": "Amazonia is Earth's most iconic center of biological diversity and endemism and is among the most important terrestrial biomes due to its contributions to global systems ecology. This project seeks to answer an overarching question in biodiversity science: How was the modern Amazonian biota and its environment assembled across space and time?  The research is designed to understand the evolutionary and environmental-ecological history of late Neogene-Recent Amazonia through a comparative approach that integrates across the disciplines of systematics, population biology, ecosystem structure and function, geology, Earth systems modeling and remote sensing, and environmental history. The project also investigates how biotic and environmental change over this time-period influenced Amazonian functional diversity in biogeochemical flows, and how these, in turn, shaped the dimensions of biodiversity seen today as well as the history of global-scale changes in biogeochemical cycling. \r\n\r\nThe project, which is a collaboration with Brazilian scientists and funding agencies, represents the most integrative examination of Amazonian biodiversity and its history to date.  The approaches taken describe a methodological template for analyzing information about the history of biotic and environmental change across large, ecologically complex landscapes that can be generalized to other systems.  The project creates a large framework for formal and informal education including the training of students, development of a major museum exhibit on Amazonia, workshops for K-12 STEM teachers, publications in professional educational journals, and a web portal, The Evolutionary Encyclopedia of Amazonian Biodiversity, that will make all results available to the public, as well as serve as an informational platform about Amazonian biodiversity and its global importance. This award is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International Science and Engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMy team has been developing plant and animal species distributions products for this Dimensions of Amazonia Biodiversity project. One key type of species distribution product is species occurrence records, derived from natural history collections.  We worked with partners to assure these records were widely available using existing infrastructure such as Vertnet (vertnet.org), but specifically focused for discovery of data within the Amazon region.  \nEven if such collections are digitized and available, they may not yet be mappable using now pervasive geographic information systems.  This requires a georeferencing process which helps to convert textual locality strings to digital coordinates.  Our group, in collaboraton with the New York Botanic Gardens, worked to georeference focal taxonomic groups discussed below.\n Our georeferencing strategy was guided by trying to best sample the geography and environment where species are found.  Thus, we triaged which points to georeference for the intention of building species range maps and ecological niche models.  We did so using custom tools that we built. \nWe used these point records to make new products that better reflect species distributions, since point records can be biased.  One such product are range maps.  Range maps have a variety of uses, from production of field guides, to analyses of biodiversity.  However, such maps are only usable at relatively coarse spatial grain.  As well, we also wanted to assess the ecological niche characteristics of species.  We therefore also used modeling approaches to relate species occurrences to the environmental conditions to derive niche estimates.  \n We did this work for three plant groups who are primarily distributed in the Amazon;  Miconia (commonly called Glory Bush), Bignonieae (a subgroup of what are commonly called bignonias),  and Lecythidaceae (Brazil nut tree).  These different flowering plants have very different life histories.  Brazil nuts are long-lived trees, Glory bushes are understory plants and subgroup bignonias are all woody vines.  Using the products we developed, and a phylogeny that provides informnaton about which species are closely related to others, we can better understand how recent species diversifications happened.  \n Our efforts are leading to the first to look at geographic and environmental drivers of recent diversity in the Amazon, which is critical for understanding how future environmental change may impact diversity in an are harboring significant biomass and biodiversity.   \n Our work produced range maps and ecological niche models according to best practices and with strong adherence to assuring these products can be re-used by the broader community.  Doing so has meant scrupulous attention to reporting how products were made, which provides transparency and credibility.  These products are in the process of being archived for other uses, once other key knowledge products are made available.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert P Guralnick"
