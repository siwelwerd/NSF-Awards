 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Florida State University will acquire a transient absorption spectrometer. Transient absorption (TA) spectroscopy is a powerful technique for monitoring the change of absorbance of light by a sample (i. e., color) with respect to time after excitation by a flash of light. While nanosecond transient absorption technique is not new, its application to unexplored areas of research can yield important results on the photophysical properties of molecules and materials. These results will directly impact applications such as solar energy conversion, photodynamic therapy, photocatalysis, solid-state lighting, and metal ion sensing. The user-friendly nature of the proposed instrument will improve the scholarship, education and training of students at all levels. The TA spectrometer will be open to all academic institutions in the region, including minority-serving institutions, and women?s colleges as well as industrial partners.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research especially in areas such as (a) studying photophysical properties of molecules and materials; (b) providing insight into electron/energy transfer; (c) investigating excited state quenching; (d) studying photochemical reactions; and (e) investigating excition diffusion and charge separation.",
