 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at Midwestern State University (MSU) entitled Scholarship Opportunities for Academic Recognition (SOAR) will help to meet the demand in Texas for science and technology well-prepared employees. It will focus on strategies designed to increase retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) majors such increased peer and faculty supports, programs to facilitate transition to the college environment, and the development of student identity as scientists. These activities have been shown to be particularly effective for underrepresented student populations. Because a high percentage of students at the university are lower-income first-generation and minority students, these strategies will increase retention in those populations and contribute to the diversity of the local workforce. SOAR will serve to strengthen university connections with local high schools during recruitment activities while networking activities with employers improve career preparation and cultivate student interest in the regional STEM industry. SOAR will lead to sustained improvements at the university, in particular the institutionalization of living/learning communities and the science orientation programs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing financial support, SOAR will implement student success strategies to improve retention and graduation for student populations that, despite academic talent and initial motivation, have difficulty persevering in college when confronted with early struggles. The student support model will strengthen science skills early and enable students to develop personal assets that allow them to overcome the challenges of college. This will be accomplished through first-year transition supports, early research experiences in science, a living/learning community, stronger faculty and peer interactions and mentoring, and professional experiences such as internships. These activities will introduce students to scientific thinking, the college environment, and expectations. The university will evaluate the effects of these strategies on retention, graduation, and the success of the scholars post-graduation.",
