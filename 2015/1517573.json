 "awd_abstract_narration": "The birthplace of nearly all stars lies within the interstellar molecular clouds that reside in the disk of the Milky Way Galaxy. Previous observations of the Galactic disk suggest that many of these clouds are filamentary over a wide range of physical scales.  While astronomers agree that stars form within the densest regions of interstellar clouds, they currently do not understand the importance of interstellar filaments for the process of star formation. The only way to measure the three-dimensional structure of interstellar clouds is through spectroscopic radio observations. The investigator will use three spectroscopic surveys in concert to probe both the atomic and molecular internal structure of interstellar filaments within the southern Galactic plane.  The main research objectives are to 1) characterize the velocity structure of the filaments and compare this to numerical models to draw conclusions about their lifetimes, stability and star-formation efficiencies, 2) trace the turbulent structure of the filaments using higher order statistics on both the atomic and molecular observations.\r\n\r\nThe investigator volunteers with the University of Wisconsin-Madison McNair Scholars Program as a Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) Professional Advisor aimed at preparing first-generation, low-income, and minority undergraduates for graduate school and beyond.  This research will also provide training and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nIf filamentary clouds are the only structures with densities large enough to form stars, then the theory of Galactic star formation needs to be focused on the formation and evolution of filamentary molecular clouds, including filamentary sub-structures where proto-stellar activity occurs.  This research project will make a contribution by directly identifying and characterizing interstellar filaments through spectroscopic observations of both their molecular gas and atomic envelopes.  One of the main data products will be a catalog of filaments, along with the results from the dynamical studies done on them. This will allow future research on where proto-stellar activity resides in relation to filamentary structure.",

Filamentary clouds are ubiquitous throughout the interstellar medium (ISM), seen from within parsec scale regions housing proto-stellar activity to the tens-of-parsec scale giant molecular clouds (GMCs) comprising the spiral arms of the Milky Way.&nbsp; The goal of the project is to characterize the molecular filaments for determining how their morphological and kinematical structure, as well as their atomic envelopes, influence Galactic star formation using new high angular and velocity resolution data. <br />The Three-mm Ultimate Mopra Milky Way Survey (ThrUMMS) provides a uniform and unbiased mapping of a 6deg X 2deg region of our Galaxy?s southern plane in three CO isotopologues and CN. We derived a new catalog of southern molecular clouds identified from the 13CO (J=1-0) data. We have applied the SCIMES (Spectral Clustering for Interstellar Molecular Emission Segmentation; Colombo et al. 2015) dendrogram algorithm to construct our catalog using two different cloud extraction methods. First, we compiled an intensity-based cloud extraction (Iex), focusing on each sector independently. We binned the 13CO (1-0) data to a velocity resolution of ~0.37 km/s, an ~1? spatial resolution (24? binning). Although ThrUMMS has a limited sensitivity due to its fast mapping techniques (see Barnes et al. 2015), we were interested in cataloging larger cloud complexes (e.g., giant molecular cloud scale). Therefore, using an RMS noise limit of &sigma;~0.8 K per channel for the dendrogram tree construction, we set a 2.5&sigma; detection limit to maximize the connection between continuous lower limit intensity structures and a 4&sigma; minimum separation difference between neighboring leaf peaks. Next, we set the&nbsp; SCIMES configuration to consider both intensity and volume during clustering. Secondly, inspired by the current galactic disk and molecular cloud models that define cloud structures based on simulated mass or mass density data cubes, we perform a column density-based extraction (Nex). The 13CO (1-0) intensity data was converted into CO column density cubes by estimating the excitation temperature in each voxel from the ThrUMMS 12CO (1-0) data. The SCIMES detection and clustering limits from the Iex extraction were retained by converted to column density limits assuming a mean cloud voxel Tex of 7 K. For the Iex extraction method we find a total of 1,278 molecular clouds, of which 408 are clusters (i.e., comprised of at least 2 dendrogram leaves). For the Nex extraction, we find a total of 1,833 molecular clouds, of which 1,205 are clusters. Kinematic distances were estimated using the Bayesian distance calculator from the BeSSeL Survey (see Reid et al. 2016). Overall, the spatial distribution of the clouds aligns well with the Galactic spiral structure, especially the Scutum-Centaurus and Norma arms. <br />With kinematic distance estimates in hand, we find mean kinematic distances of 7.60+/-4.60 kpc and 7.86+/-4.34 kpc the Iex and Nex extraction, respectively.&nbsp; We estimated the total H2 cloud masses using an n12CO/n13CO abundance model from Milam et al. (2005) and an n12CO/nH2 abundance of 2 ? 10-4 (Lacy et al. 1994, finding a mean masses of log (M) = 3.94+/-0.85 Msun and log (M) = 3.54+/-0.81 Msun for the Iex and Nex clouds, respectively. Additionally, through our 12CO measurements, we find mean excitation temperatures of 10.8+/-1.1K and 7.50+/-0.75K for the Iex and Nex clouds, respectively. <br />We compiled the molecular filament sub-catalog using NetworkX o derive the 2D projected axis of each cloud (Hernandez et al. in prep).
