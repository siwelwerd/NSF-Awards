They are critical for electronic and energy applications, but it is rare for nature to provide one that can be readily switched near ambient conditions. This project builds on the recent prediction that some two-dimensional materials exhibit phase change properties near ambient conditions. These materials are nearly atomically thin, an aspect that provides potentially useful properties that ordinary phase change materials lack.  The two-dimensional nature of these materials provides fundamentally new physical mechanisms for controlling the transformations that do not exist in known, bulk materials. In this project, the PI and his team will explore the phase change properties of two-dimensional materials and their potential for applications in energy, information storage, electronic, optical, and other important applications with broad societal benefit.  The project will also elucidate the scientific theory of two-dimensional structural phase transformations, which is likely to be quite different from conventional theories for bulk materials. In the process, the research team will tackle some of the most challenging problems in computational materials science by extending the accuracy and scale of computational methods for predicting the properties of materials. \r\n\r\nTo integrate outreach with this research, the PI will host and mentor a group of college-bound, under-represented minority high school students during the summers and involve them in aspects of this project. The PI will develop interactive Java applications that run real-time atomistic materials simulations aimed at broad research dissemination and materials education at the undergraduate and K-12 levels.  These applications represent an exciting new paradigm for materials education that has potential to transform the way in which students learn about materials by putting them in the driver seat. These activities will have a high quality mentoring impact on a few students as well as broad dissemination of the research and teaching tools, potentially reaching thousands or more students.  Some of the activities will be facilitated by Stanford's Office of Science Outreach which will assist the research team with post-experience success metrics. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nPhase change materials like GeSbTe alloys are critical for electronic and energy applications but it is rare for nature to provide one with phase boundaries close enough to ambient conditions to be useful.  Phase change materials can be switched between multiple atomic configurations that have different properties. This project builds on the recent prediction that some of the newly discovered two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit such phase change properties and may provide new opportunities for energy, electronic, information storage, optical, and other important applications with broad societal benefit. The nearly atomically-thin nature of these materials provides fundamentally new physical mechanisms for controlling the transformations that do not exist in known, bulk materials. Furthermore, this project will elucidate the purely scientific theory of 2D structural phase transformations, which is likely to be quite different from conventional theories for bulk materials.\r\n\r\nThe objectives are to discover how 2D phase change materials can be controlled and reduced to practice in experiments and device applications.  This project seeks to understand the role of substrate interactions, electrostatic gating, temperature, and chemical alloys in the control and stabilization of these phases.  In the process, the research team will tackle some of the most challenging problems in computational materials science by exploring new statistical techniques for systematically improvable analytical interatomic potentials and advancing density functional theory approaches for monolayers on substrates with van der Waals interactions. \r\n\r\nTo integrate outreach with this research, the PI will host and mentor a group of college-bound, under-represented minority high school students during the summers and involve them in aspects of this project.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project aims to identify new classes phase change materials, or materials that can be switched between multiple atomic configurations.  Changing the atomic positions within the material can lead to different material properties, functionality that is critical for electronic and energy applications.  The phase change alloy GeSbTe is used to store information in re-writable optical discs and paraffin wax is used to reduce energy consumption in buildings by regulating the temperature. However, it is rare for nature to provide such materials that can be switched with relatively small stimuli, a trait that is frequently required for practical application. \n\nThis project identified a new class a phase change materials consisting of transition metal dichalcogenides, including MoTe2.  These materials are distinguished from others by the fact that they exist in a layered structure, from which a single layer can be exfoliated.  Single layer forms of these materials are nearly atomically thin, an aspect that provides useful properties that normal phase change materials lack. \n\nThrough detailed simulations followed by experiments, single layer MoTe2 was found to exhibit a phase change that can be controlled via electrostatic gating, a novel mechanism that is useful for electronic devices.  The electrostatic gating adds or removes electrons from the material, causing the atoms to rearrange.  This is a new type of mechanism for inducing a phase change, different from the usual temperature or mechanical stress types of mechanisms. Furthermore, there is a large contrast in properties between phases so that the phase transition can be readily observed.  By considering theoretical limits, we furthermore found that the energy required to drive this phase transformation has potential to be far smaller than other phase change materials. This is an important consideration for electronic devices, where the energy required to change phase limits the number of devices that can be put on chip. \n\nThis project also explored the impacts of phase changes in these layered materials on the van der Waals interactions that bind them together.  We developed a new, fast method to calculate the magnitude of the inter-layer interactions based on how the electromagnetic properties of the individual layers impact the quantum energy fluctuations of electromagnetic modes between layers.  This fast method enabled the calculation of large numbers of inter-layer interactions for different types of layered materials, including the multiple structural phases of MoTe2.  Among the more exotic predictions of this electromagnetic theory is the potential for the interactions between layers to be repulsive, a property that could lead to very interesting effects like low friction sliding for lubricants, etc.  However, our screening determined that such repulsive interactions can occur, but are rare, weak, and likely difficult to observe and utilize.\n\nThis project had a number of broader impacts, including the development of a computational laboratory class at Stanford allowing undergraduates to discover key concepts in materials science through interactive simulations.  Traditional approaches to materials education involve teaching the wisdom and concepts gained by others through experimentation.  While this is efficient, it has potential to give the impression that the concepts are already known and definitive, and does not develop the exploratory and creative processes that are required to advance the field.  By using interactive computer simulations, this class flips the educational process around, encouraging students to identify and characterize on their own what happens for example, when stress is applied to a material.  Through the simulations, the students will discover dislocations, their role in the relaxation of stress, and how to characterize these dislocations.  They construct their own quantitative theories of materials phenomena, from phase transformations to crack propagation, to plasticity and then compare with conventional wisdom.  The software utilized for this class was also packaged with a lesson plan for K 12 educators, and presented to them through summer seminars for educators. \n\nThis project also facilitated the participation of more than a dozen PhD candidates, undergraduate, and high school students, more than half of whom belong to categories that are underrepresented in the sciences and engineering.  Several dozen talks at professional conferences were given by these individuals and the principal investigator to disseminate the results of the research.  More than one dozen peer reviewed publications have been produced.  This project produced a database of over 1000 layered materials that has been made available on our group webpage, and incorporated into a number of the commonly used materials databases.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/10/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Evan Reed"
