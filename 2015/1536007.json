This fifth summit, International Gender Summit Africa 2015 (GSA), recognizes the multitude of scientific and economic opportunities available on the continent.  The summit will provide a link between enhancing African economic prosperity and increasing the presence and status of women in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago School of Professional Psychology conducts a project titled Opportunities for UnderRepresented Scholars (OURS), which provides leadership training, culminating in a post-graduate certificate in academic leadership, to STEM women of color in faculty and administrator positions at minority-serving institutions of higher education.  The project leaders and four alumnae of the program will attend and make presentations on aspects of OURS at GSA, focusing primarily on concerted efforts to:  (1) raise awareness; (2) disseminate effective best practices; and (3) contribute to the ongoing leadership development of women of color in the academic STEM disciplines.",
