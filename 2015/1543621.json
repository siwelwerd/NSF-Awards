The workshop will bring together an international group of about 50 isotope geochemists and biomedical researchers to explore the use of high precision isotope analysis, particularly of the heavy metals or metallomics, as disease biomarkers.  \r\n \r\nIt is known that disruptions in the metabolism of inorganic elements can be the cause or result from some diseases, such as Alzheimer, osteoporosis, and cancer.  The aim of the workshop is to identify medical questions where sophisticated technologies, methodologies, and concepts that have been used in the geological and environmental sciences can be applied to combat disease. Results of the workshop will be published in a report that will serve as the founding document of the new field of isotope metallomic biomarkers and will be available to researchers and the public.",
