 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. This project will develop and test a digital monitoring tool that will enable teachers to track student learning within a digital learning system and quickly adjust classroom instructional strategies to facilitate learning.  The tool will be developed for use with an existing digital curriculum for high school genetics, and it will be tested in both introductory biology courses and advanced courses.  The tool will be designed to analyze student progress within the digital curriculum and provide feedback to both students and teachers about challenges to learning as they are occurring.  The system will simultaneously monitor and analyze the learning patterns of all students in a class, providing targeted feedback to individual students as needed, or enabling the teacher to make informed decisions about when some students need individual attention, or groups of students need help with a particular concept or learning challenge.  As more digital learning experiences are incorporated into classroom practices, digital guidance systems such as this will be needed to help students and teachers effectively blend a variety of classroom learning experiences.     \r\n\r\nThis design and development study focuses on improving student learning of domain-specific content and practices within traditional, technology-enriched classroom environments.  The project will be guided by findings from prior research in two areas: the learning outcomes of game-like, simulation-based digital learning environments, and the effectiveness of intelligent tutoring systems.  The system being developed in this project will construct analytic models of student knowledge and behavior from clickstream data and provide contextualized information at optimal junctures to students or teachers.  This approach will enable a three-layered response system: a) direct, targeted support to individual students struggling with basic content; b) referral of a student to another student or group of students having encountered similar learning challenges; and c) feedback to teachers that would facilitate strategic guidance of student learning.  Research questions guiding this project will focus on what information about student learning is most useful for guiding learning in digital environments, how can this information improve support for student learning within classrooms, and how does the availability and use of this information improve student knowledge and practices?  The design and development work will be conducted over 4 years and will involve teachers and students in 22 classrooms in New England and North Carolina.",

Educational games can pose engaging challenges for students, using typical game features such as narrative, scoring, and competition to draw learners in. In contexts carefully constructed by an educational game, decision-making reflects an understanding (or lack of understanding) of principles and precepts. However, as past research has shown, educational games can pose unintended challenges to teachers and students due to individualized learning patterns. Students progress at different paces through the game, and each student&rsquo;s progress must be understood in order for a teacher to assist them with concepts they find challenging.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The Guiding Understanding in Digital Environments (GUIDE) Project at the Concord Consortium sought to address this problem by designing and implementing a powerful new approach to game-based teaching and learning in biology. Starting with our existing online game for learning genetics, we created Geniventure, a new game incorporating both an intelligent tutoring system that supports students and a real-time teacher dashboard that informs teachers of student progress. Geniventure is designed for students to discover the principles of genetics, molecular biology, and trait inheritance in an inquiry-based manner, through active engagement and decision-making in the game. Students breed mythical organisms and maneuver genes and proteins inside of cells. All of the genes in Geniventure are based on real world genes and accurate genetic inheritance. A core feature of the game is that it simulates behaviors of genes and proteins with high fidelity to how these mechanisms really operate in biological contexts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Geniventure&rsquo;s narrative features a world of dragons and their model species (Dracomimus familiaris, colloquially referred to as drakes), in which a war has broken out between kingdoms, endangering the dragon population. The goal is for each player to breed drakes to help to win the war and prevent dragon extinction. To do this they must also learn about dragon genetics. A diverse cast of characters in a scientific Guild appear one at a time to present a total of 65 genetics challenges that are organized into missions of three to eight related challenges. The missions, in turn, are organized into six distinct game levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As they start to progress through the game, the intelligent tutoring system (ITS) tracks each student&rsquo;s understanding based on how they are addressing the early cognitive challenges. Using the student&rsquo;s track record of game decisions, the ITS is continually building a model of student understanding to estimate the probability that the student will succeed on a challenge. When the probability estimate is high, the game permits the student to make mistakes and learn from them. If the estimate drops below a threshold value, the ITS shows the student a hint to help them get back on track. If a series of hints does not help the student, the ITS poses a simplified challenge that focuses on the difficult concept. At the same time, the teacher dashboard reports on the student&rsquo;s attempts, helping the teacher see the students that are meeting the game&rsquo;s challenges knowledgeably, and others who are struggling with a specific part of the game and genetics concept.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Our research on students and teachers using Geniventure showed us that students can and do learn genetics when their teachers use the game, and that the ITS and teacher dashboard are components that enable teachers to 1) work more effectively with students who are having difficulty, 2) attend to arranging their lessons to meet the needs of the entire class, and 3) focus on discussions that enable students to reflect and learn more deeply. These factors, in turn, helped teachers feel more confident about allowing the game&rsquo;s ITS to guide student learning&nbsp; and to target their instruction toward individual students, small groups or the whole class. A pattern of instruction emerged that resembled co-teaching&mdash;a reciprocal and supportive &ldquo;relationship&rdquo; between the teacher and the game. The game informed teachers&rsquo; thinking about their genetics curriculum and enhanced their instructional practice, while teachers leveraged digital tools to shape students&rsquo; gameplay and to improve on what the game offered.
