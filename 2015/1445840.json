The meeting is scheduled to have 14 technical sessions covering recent advances in membrane research, development and applications. Some examples include wastewater reclamation, gas and liquid separations and purifications, and energy issues. A poster session is also an integral part of the meeting.

Its use in the chemical industry is growing due to its versatility and low-energy consumption as compared with other separation processes, such as distillation. Because of the industrial needs for efficient separation technology and the advances in material science, many new membrane materials, processes, and applications are being commercialized. These advances are often seen at the interfaces between different technical areas, such as reactions and separations. The basic science to develop hybrid technologies and push the limits of existing membrane technology is critical for making progress toward meeting industrial needs.  Increasingly, collaborations bridge international borders, and the problems to be addressed do as well. Given the scope of this meeting, its more intimate meeting structure and diverse internationally renowned attendees, the ECI Advanced Membrane Technology VI Conference provided an exceptional intellectual training opportunity for graduate students and young faculty.\n\nThe potential to improve advanced membrane technology rests on our continuing ability to harness results from basic science and engineering, of the kind supported by the National Science Foundation, to continually improve our understanding of the materials science and engineering aspects of membranes and separations.  An excellent route to enabling this improved understanding comes from participation, particularly by students and young faculty, who are the next generation of researchers in this field, in international meetings.  Exposure of students to the leaders in this field gave them the opportunity for extended discussion of their own work with other scientists and engineers and provided them with an opportunity to see state-of-the-art presentations in other areas of the field.  For this reason, support of student participation in the ECI Meeting on Advanced Membrane Technology VI proved vital for the future of the science and engineering in this field.\n\nThere were 61 oral papers, 39 posters, and 103 participants from 23 countries with representation from academic, government, industry, and student sectors. A comprehensive Program book including abstracts of the lectures and posters presented was prepared and disseminated to each of the participants. Funding from NSF as well as other sources was used to assist in the travel costs of young researchers (graduate students, beginning faculty, etc.).  Diversity was a key consideration in allocation of funds.  Additionally, we gave an opportunity to a particularly outstanding graduate student to co-chair a session, providing a professional development opportunity that is unusual for someone so early in one\u00c6s career.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/11/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benny D Freeman"
