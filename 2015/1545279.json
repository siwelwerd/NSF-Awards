 "awd_abstract_narration": "NRT-IGE: Nanomedicine Academy of Minority Serving Institutions\r\n\r\nNanomedicine is an emerging paradigm that seeks to develop engineered nanometer size particles to solve key problems in modern medicine, such as early diagnosis of disease and targeted delivery of therapeutics. This field is exciting to students and there is worldwide demand for training in this area. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) track to Northeastern University will translate cutting-edge advances in nanomedicine research into an education model to pilot and test a scalable, interactive network that empowers low-resource institutions to build capacity in nanomedicine training and develop degree programs in this emerging field.  This project will create a reciprocal knowledge-sharing relationship among a large national pool of students across five institutions. The successful implementation of this new model of higher education is expected to broaden the participation of minorities in the nanomedicine workforce thus reducing disparities in the health workforce, establish new degree programs, and serve as a blueprint for the creation of similar education programs in other disciplines. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to create a scalable network for knowledge delivery and scientific collaboration that is designed to enable student learning from expert instructors as well as from peers unrestricted by geographical location. The partners include five research universities with a tradition of providing higher education to underrepresented communities ? Northeastern University, University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez, Tuskegee University, Morgan State University, and Florida International University.  The project will offer synchronous content through live, web-based videoconferencing protocols, allowing students to interact with instructors and peers at other universities in real-time. A parallel enterprise-level online learning environment will be created to enable team-based discussions and assignments. Courses to be offered include Introduction to Nanomedicine, Nanomedicine Research Techniques, Nano/Biomedical Commercialization, and a Nanomedicine Seminar Series.  Faculty facilitators at each institution will coordinate the physical and online classroom environments, contribute to cross-institutional assignments, and provide supplementary instruction. Students will receive degree credit at their home institution through the establishment of course-equivalency at each partner institution. The implementation of these learning tools, together with the assessment of student learning, student demographics, and career development, is expected to generate sufficient new knowledge to enable expansion of this new and unique higher education model to a nationwide program.\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative, and scalable models for STEM graduate education training.  The Innovations in Graduate Education Track is dedicated solely to piloting, testing, and evaluating novel, innovative, and potentially transformative approaches to graduate education.\r\n\r\nThis work is supported, in part, by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program.  The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.",

This interdisciplinary field, known as nanomedicine, is made possible by collaboration, knowledge sharing, and creation of a research culture across a range of disciplines including physics, chemistry, biology, materials science, health science, and engineering. Recognizing that few universities outside large metropolitan areas have the resources and expertise to offer nanomedicine training, faculty at Northeastern University, Morgan State University, Tuskegee University, Florida International University, and University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez sought to find new ways to remove barriers to nanomedicine accessibility in low resource settings. The Nanomedicine Academy of Minority-Serving Institutions was created in 2015 with the goal of increasing the diversity of the nanomedicine workforce by piloting new strategies for student learning and collaboration across multiple institutions. <br /> The Nanomedicine Academy of Minority-Serving Institutions established a one-of-a-kind graduate education program that provides enhanced access to specialized knowledge, training in essential nanomedicine tools and techniques, and opportunities for interactivity among geographically remote students. This was accomplished through the creation of a ?national nanomedicine classroom? where students from all 5 institutions collaborate together to learn new knowledge and skills while earning degree credit at their home institution. This education model was made possible through the development of a custom scalable, interactive online network that supports synchronous multi-institutional web-based lectures and symposia, asynchronous multi-institutional team activities, and synchronous face-to-face activities in local classrooms led by local faculty. <br />Using this online network for teaching and learning, the Academy developed and implemented five multi-institutional courses including: Introduction to Nanomedicine, Nanomedicine Research Techniques, Nano/Biomedical Commercialization, and Nanomedicine Seminar 1 &amp; 2. Each course was designed to be unique in its design and implementation, such that students could engage with course materials, local and remote faculty, and their peers in a variety of different ways grounded in evidence-based principles of learning. Collectively, these courses offered students the opportunity to: 1) learn, practice, and reflect on enabling innovations in nanomedicine, 2) teach peers about research and career opportunities using a flipped classroom setting, 3) conduct experiments and analyze data in a virtual laboratory setting, 4) create a virtual startup company under the mentorship of biotech industry experts, and 5) hear first-hand accounts of nanomedicine research and innovation from guest experts across the nation. The courses were integrated into 24 M.S. and Ph.D. degree programs across the 5 institutions in order to attract and retain graduate students from a range of STEM disciplines. Additionally, a stackable Graduate Certificate in Nanomedicine was created at Northeastern University in 2017. All courses were rolled out in a hybrid format (2015-2018), and then piloted in parallel hybrid and online sections in the final year (2018-9). <br />Since 2015, the Academy courses have been attended by 322 M.S. and Ph.D. students from 18 different STEM disciplines, including 110 underrepresented minority (URM) students. 139 students completed 2 or more Academy courses and 33 Northeastern students enrolled in the 5-course Nanomedicine Certificate (22 complete to-date). Over two-thirds of URM students completed 3 or more nanomedicine courses, attesting to the unique value these courses add to degree programs in low resource settings. Even when Hurricane Maria necessitated a complete restart of the 2017-18 academic year in Puerto Rico, all 20 participants from UPRM opted to complete their nanomedicine studies that year. In surveys, students from all 5 institutions unanimously reported that the Academy courses offered new learning opportunities not previously available at their home institution. For 90% of students, this was their first time participating in interdisciplinary courses, and as such, they were particularly appreciative of the opportunity to engage with a large variety of students, resources, and faculty. Over 91% of all Academy participants reported that they were concurrently involved in nanomedicine or nanotechnology research while attending Academy courses and thus stood directly benefit from their coursework. Over half of these students reported directly applying concepts learned in class to their thesis, dissertation, co-op, or work-related research projects. <br />In summary, the Nanomedicine Academy of Minority-Serving Institutions is an entirely new model of education that empowers universities to provide a graduate coursework in a field that is resource-intensive and rapidly changing. Through careful design and implementation, it is possible to broaden student and faculty access to specialized knowledge, facilities, instrumentation, and expertise in a way that promotes interdisciplinary learning in an authentic collaborative setting.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/16/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Srinivas&nbsp;Sridhar</p>\n</div>\n<div
