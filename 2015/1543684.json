Christopher Beard and Michael Taylor\r\nUniversity of Kansas, EAR-1543684\r\n\r\nABSTRACT\r\n\r\nThis INSPIRE project is jointly funded by the Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology Program in the Earth Sciences Division of the Geosciences (GEO) Directorate, the Biological Anthropology Program in the Division of Behavorial and Cognitive Sciences of the Social, Behavorial and Economic (SBE) Directorate, the SBE Office of Multidisciplinary Activities, the Office of International Science and Engineering (OISE), and the Office of International and Integrative Activities (OIIA) INSPIRE program.  \r\n\r\nThis project investigates how dramatic changes in the Earth's environment impacted the evolution of early primates and other mammals in southwest Asia and adjacent regions. An international team of scientists from the University of Kansas and partner institutions in the USA, Turkey and France will explore Eocene (~40-45 million years old) fossil sites that include both African and Eurasian mammals. These Eocene mammals lived in an environment wrought by remarkable climatic and geologic changes. The team will explore potential links between plate tectonics, environmental change, and the evolution of both native mammal groups and \"invasive species\" such as early anthropoids (primate ancestors of modern monkeys, apes and humans) that were colonizing Africa for the first time. Early anthropoids and other Asian mammals may have traversed southwest Asia in order to get to Africa, a hypothesis that will be tested by the PIs work. The project will strengthen scientific cooperation and educational opportunities between American and Turkish scientists and students, while fundamentally advancing the understanding of early mammalian evolution, including our own anthropoid primate ancestors, at the crossroads between Africa, Europe and Asia.\r\n\r\nThe multidisciplinary team working on this project will collect new data in the field and perform detailed investigations in the lab aimed at: (1) documenting and characterizing the Eocene mammal fauna in order to understand the phylogenetic and biogeographic relationships of individual taxa and how the entire fauna was assembled; (2) constraining the timing and processes of accretion of Gondwanan microplates onto Turkey and their relationship to the Eocene mammal faunas there; (3) establishing a multi-proxy reconstruction of Eocene environments and its impact on the local fauna and environment; (4) assessing the potential role of Turkey as a pathway for the colonization of Africa by early Asian anthropoid primates and other mammals; and (5) conducting macroevolutionary analyses of the mammalian fossil record to investigate predictable links between the physical environment and patterns of faunal dispersal and faunal turnover.",

However, the complicated geological history of this region, highlighted by multiple tectonic collisions during the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic, caused dynamic geographic changes that impacted the evolution of regional ecosystems. This project supported geological and paleontological field work that enabled our team to show that, roughly 44 million years ago during the middle part of the Eocene epoch, much of what is now Turkey and adjacent areas formed a large island or archipelago that we have named <strong>Balkanatolia</strong>. Balkanatolia was sparated from Europe to the northwest and Asia to the northeast by relatively shallow seas. Africa/Arabia was an island continent to the south of Balkanatolia that drifted northward for millions of years before finally colliding with Eurasia near the Oligocene-Miocene boundary. As a result of being sandwiched between these major landmasses, Balkanatolia was colonized by terrestrial mammals from three distinct biogeographic sources. The fossil mammal fauna that our team has uncovered in Balkanatolia is utterly unique, not only because it contains multiple new taxa that were previously unknown to science, but also because it comprises a biogeographic melange of African, Asian and European mammals that are unknown to co-occur elsewhere. Highlights of our paleontological discoveries to date include: (1) the first Eocene primates and bats to be found across the vast area spanning from Switzerland to Pakistan; (2) an anachronistic radiation of archaic ungulates on Balkanatolia that went extinct elsewhere ~13 million years earlier; and (3) two new groups of Gondwanan mammals that apparently colonized Balkanatolia from Africa. Highlights of our geological discoveries to date include: (1) new information on the nature and timing of the tectonic collision between the Pontide microcontinent and the Tauride-Anatolide Platform, which are the two most important tectonic blocks contributing to modern Turkey; and (2) the first age constraints for the uniquely endemic mammal fauna of Balkanatolia, showing that it dates to ~44 million years ago. Additionally, because most of the mammals that inhabited Balkanatolia during the Eocene had to disperse across marine barriers to arrive there, we developed a synthetic framework of the geological and biological factors contributing to what is known as \"sweepstakes dispersal\" (the extremely rare dispersal of terrestrial organisms across seaways). Our results show that sweepstakes dispersal is far less random than its name would imply, and that it happens relatively frequently during greenhouse climatic conditions like those prevailing during the Eocene.</p>\n<p>This project has fostered deep collaboration among scientists and students from the USA, Turkey and France, both in the field and in the lab. Three former postdocs have been heavily engaged in all aspects of the project, each of whom now has a tenure-track or equivalent position at research institutions or government agencies. Four graduate students completed Master's or doctoral theses based on this work, while five additional PhD students participated in field and/or laboratory research related to the project. Partly through an REU supplement to this award, two undergraduate students were able to participate in field work with our team, and another six undergraduate students participated in laboratory research related to the project.</p>\n<p>A pedagogical innovation derived from this project employs Wikipedia to teach undergraduate students about mammalian paleontology, scientific peer review and open access.
