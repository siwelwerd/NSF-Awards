 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is to increase the efficiency of identifying, mapping, and remediating water sources contaminated with chlorinated solvents.  Chlorinated solvents are used in vast quantities as solvents and degreasing agents, and in the dry cleaning industry. The necessity of monitoring chlorinated solvents in water will continue for many generations due to their widespread occurrence in water sources around the world, their toxicity, and their high stability. A significant need exists and will grow for devices that can continuously measure the concentration of chlorinated organic chemicals in water, and that can do so accurately and inexpensively. Continuous in-situ data production in the field of environmental sensing will greatly increase efficiency in all processes that require a measurement of these chemicals, having a significant impact on the costs and timelines associated with remediation of contaminated sites. This sensor will allow for continuous monitoring of possible contamination sources in the case of a contamination event. Also, it will afford easy profiling of contamination plumes in aquifers. This technology will replace the current laboratory-based measurement protocols, which are not readily adapted for in-situ, on-line, or in-the-field measurements, and cannot produce data continuously.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop an optical enzymatic biosensor for continuous, quantitative monitoring of chlorinated solvent concentrations in water. Chlorinated solvent contamination of groundwater is a widespread ongoing issue around the world. The biosensing concept will be implemented in an optical fiber format, in which optical biosensor tips are linked to a small electro-optical unit. Analyte detection takes place on biosensor tips that are coated with enzymes and fluorescent chemicals. The scope of the research includes two parallel strategies for obtaining highly stable detection enzymes such that long lifetime sensors are achievable, development of a system to deliver required reagents to the sensing tip, development of signal processing algorithms to enable high accuracy measurements in variable environmental conditions and speciation of chlorinated compounds within mixtures, a manufacturing study for high throughput fabrication of the sensors, and field testing of the device at multiple contamination sites. Attainment of these objectives will advance the sensing technology to a robust and readily manufactured system for chlorinated solvent monitoring with low detection limits, high accuracy, and reliability.",

This biosensor platform is modular and can be adapted for many analytes. The biosensing platform is implemented in an optical fiber format, in which optical fiber biosensor tips are linked to a small optical sensing unit (Figure 1). The biosensor tips incorporate a two-layer detection element. The outer layer of the detection element contains an enzyme that catalyzes a reaction with the analyte, resulting in a change in the local chemical environment. The inner detection layer contains a fluorescent chemical selected to be sensitive to the specific chemical change caused by the enzymatic reaction. In the sensors developed under this award, the enzymatic reaction with an analyte changes the oxygen concentration on the sensor tip, which can be measured as a change in fluorescence lifetime. Since the magnitude of the change in fluorescence lifetime depends on the analyte concentration, these optical, enzymatic biosensors provide quantitative output that can continuously track increases or decreases in the analyte concentration. The biosensor output is monitored using the OptiEnz optical transceiver, which converts the optical signal into an electronic signal. The product consists of a base instrument with a sensor probe, a PC-based software application (with a laptop PC connected with a USB cable), and replaceable sensor caps with multiple sensor tips (Figure 2). The sensor tips are unique to each chemical to be measured. Two versions of the biosensor system were developed: a low-cost, rapid, at-line assay system for discrete measurements and an in-situ measurement system with sterilizable sensor probe for continuous measurements.
