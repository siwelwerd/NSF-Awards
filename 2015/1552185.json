 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Fellowship award to Lincoln Park Zoo (LPZ) provides a unique venue to engage the public in research and conservation. The project also facilitates conservation and science education in schools. The Fellow gives talks at grade schools, focusing on how apes help us understand human behavior, plus threats apes face in the wild and how to help. This research is dominated by women and underrepresented minorities, providing students with visible role models as they view presentations. As a field scientist the Fellow helps students understand the breadth of scientific inquiry, an important component of early science education. This research also supports scientific training and conservation education of Rwandan nationals, who work as lab personnel and research assistants. Their training qualifies them for the emerging scientific workforce in a developing country. Many Rwandans do not realize the gorillas and their ecosystem are unusual and highly valuable. Employees quickly come to understand the importance of protecting this resource, and educate others in the community. Findings are regularly featured in LPZ's diverse public outreach domains and integrated with LPZ's education initiatives at all levels. Results also reach 500,000 per year people via Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International's social media resources. These two venues help the public better understand the implications primate physiology and behavior have for understanding human behavior, connections between different fields of scientific inquiry, and the value of behavioral sciences.  \r\n\r\nThis project analyzes non-invasively collected hormonal data from the mountain gorilla population monitored by the Karioke Research Center in Rwanda. Hormone results are integrated with behavioral and genetic data to test hypotheses about the proximate factors affecting male-immature relationships in mountain gorillas, a socially flexible great ape. Current understanding of evolutionary origins of the hormonal correlates of male parenting comes from a small group of socially monogamous species. The scientific literature has few papers on hormonal regulation of such relationships in multi-male social systems, and studies about the hormonal correlates of male parenting behaviors come to different conclusions. The research program is interdisciplinary, incorporating behavioral sciences, genetics, and endocrinology. All work takes place at the Lincoln Park Zoo's Davee Center for Epidemiology and Endocrinology.",

As a PhD student, I received extensive training in the methods required to collect and analyze behavioral data. In this fellowship, I learned how to collect and analyze data on hormones. Integrating behavior and hormones helps researchers learn more about the function and consequences of both.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>The research goal of this project was to understand if, and how, social relationships (bonds) between adult male, adult female, and infant mountain gorillas are related to their stress and reproductive hormones. Social bonds and hormones create feedback loops in many species, including humans, but scientists understand relatively little about the relationship between these two things in a species that has considerable variation in the structure of their social groups. Mountain gorillas can live in many different types of groups (e.g. one male and many females and infants; many males, females, and infants; only males; or males may be solitary). The variation in these group structures may mean different types of social bonds have different value or consequences. I analyzed thousands of hormone samples (collected from feces and urine) to characterize hormonal &lsquo;profiles&rsquo; for individual wild gorillas. I analyzed these samples for testosterone (a reproductive hormone), and cortisol (a stress hormone). Results are preliminary because final analyses of these data are ongoing, but to date the analyses indicate: 1) infants&rsquo; cortisol levels are not associated with the number of adult male social partners they have, nor the strength of their social bonds with them; 2) adult males&rsquo; testosterone levels are not related to the strength of their social bonds with infants; 3) adult males&rsquo; testosterone and cortisol levels are not related to their place in their group&rsquo;s dominance hierarchy, and 4) males&rsquo; long-term reproductive success&mdash;how many infants they sire over their lifetime&mdash;is predicted by how tolerant they are of infants early on in their lives. These results are interesting because they are quite different from our understanding of the relationship between these variables in humans and some other primates.</p>\n<p>In addition, I also developed new methodological tools. I created a protocol to non-invasively measure prolactin in mountain gorilla urine, in collaboration with a company that developed a prolactin enzyme immunoassay for use with human serum. In the future, this protocol can be used to measure urinary prolactin levels in gorillas and other great apes. Prolactin is of interest to many scientists because of its role in social bonding. Second, in collaboration with environmental chemists, I am developing a protocol for identifying unknown hormone metabolites in gorilla feces using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Non-invasive hormone measurement requires creative validation tools like these, since measuring the metabolite byproduct of hormones is not identical to measuring the hormone itself (e.g. in blood, which is frequently infeasible in animals, and sometimes humans).</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>This project has had far-reaching broader impacts. First, I made considerable contributions to K-12 and public science education efforts. I gave talks for &gt;1,000 people (ranging from 2<sup>nd</sup> graders to members of retirement communities) about the links between behavior, physiology, and conservation of mountain gorillas, which are a critically endangered primate species. The lessons from this work can be applied much more broadly, to other ecosystems and species where scientists are monitoring animal populations. I organized a workshop called &ldquo;Savings Species with Feces&rdquo; for 6<sup>th</sup>-8<sup>th</sup> grade girls in Chicago, to teach them about field science careers and give them hands-on experience with laboratory equipment and protocols. I gave guided tours of the hormone laboratory to middle school, high school, and college students, and talked to them about career opportunities in conservation biology, evolutionary sciences, and field sciences. I designed and am creating a new curriculum that uses animal behavior and endocrinology to teach elementary school children about the science of social bonds. This can be integrated into &lsquo;social and emotional learning&rsquo; lessons, a data-backed approach to improving children&rsquo;s academic and personal outcomes. Two of the research papers I published during the fellowship received considerable press coverage from outlets such as The Atlantic, BBC, Ars Technica, and Elsevier Press.</p>\n<p>This fellowship also helped support the Karisoke Research Center in Rwanda. Karisoke is one of the world&rsquo;s longest-running field sites. It monitors and studies the critically endangered gorilla population and its highly valuable habitat, which contains many endemic species. Research funding for Karisoke supports the infrastructure necessary to hire, train, and support the local staff. It provides people with desirable conservation jobs in a very poor community, which helps alleviate poaching and deforestation pressure on the gorillas&rsquo; habitat. It also provides professional development and educational opportunities for local Rwandans, many of whom go on to pursue higher degrees and become conservation and science advocates and leaders in their communities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/05/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
