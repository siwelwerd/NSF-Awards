 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI:  Mark E Thompson\r\nProposal Number:  1511757\r\n\r\nThe sun represents the most abundant potential source of sustainable energy on earth.  Solar cells that use light-absorbing organic polymers to convert light to electricity ? organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices - offer a potentially low-cost route for renewable electricity production.  However, in order to achieve parity with other solar photovoltaic technologies, organic solar cells must increase their power conversion efficiency past the current 10.5% world record.  One reason for this low efficiency is that OPV devices do not harness the light energy in the infra-red range of the solar spectrum, which is beyond the visible range of light.  The overall goal of this project is to design new light absorption materials for OPV that simultaneously increase infra-red light absorption and improve the voltage output, leading to a potentially significant incremental increase in solar energy conversion efficiency.  Through this research, fundamental scientific understanding on how to more rationally align the energy conversion processes within OPV devices will be also gained.  As part of the educational activities associated with this project, students from a community college in Los Angeles will participate in summer research on solar energy, hosted through the laboratory of the principal investigator.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the proposed research is to enhance the performance of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices through the development of new materials and device architectures that extend light absorption and conversion into the near infra-red (near-IR) portion of the solar spectrum, and concurrently increase the open circuit voltage towards its theoretical limit. Towards this end, small molecules that absorb strongly into the 950-1000 nm range will be used as part of single and multiple sensitization strategies to achieve broadband absorption in the visible to near-IR spectral range.  Furthermore, intramolecular symmetry breaking charge transfer materials, which contain both electron donors and acceptors, will be designed to narrow the offset between the energies of the charge transfer state, exciton, and the open-circuit voltage. In this context, the research plan has two primary objectives that will be carried out interactively.  The first objective is to prepare and characterize the photophysical properties of new materials, and then second objective to develop novel structures that utilize these new materials in OPV devices.  Theoretical models will be used to predict absorption energies for a wide range of cyanine-like dyes for near-IR, and from these studies, the most promising small molecule materials will be synthesized, characterized by photophysical methods, and then tested in OPV devices.  Synthetic and photophysical characterization studies will also be carried out to determine the parameters that control symmetry breaking charge transfer (SBCT) in strongly absorbing materials.  This fundamental understanding will be used to design OPV device architectures to accommodate these SCBT materials. The device physics of OPV devices containing SCBT materials will be then characterized to understand the phenomena that could lead to increased open circuit voltage.  Finally, all dye targets will be designed to serve as suitable ligands for preparation of zinc-dye complexes. These new zinc complexes are expected to promote symmetry breaking charge transfer, making it possible to simultaneously increase near-IR spectral response and increase open circuit voltage.  If successful, these new OPV materials will improve solar energy conversion efficiency through synergistic design of light absorption and charge transfer processes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of this project is to develop new materials for high efficiency organic photovoltaics (OPVs).  We are investigating two basic classes of materials, targeted at enhancing short circuit currents  (Jsc) and open circuit voltages (Voc) of OPVs.  \n\nThe materials targeted to enhance short circuit currents involved two appraoches: 1. shifting absorption deeper into the red/nearinfrared (NIR) and 2. filling gaps in the absorption spectra of other materials to give a uniform absorption profile across the visible and into the NIR.  We explored dye systems, including boron-dipyrrins (BODIPY), boron-dipyridylmethenes, squaraines and pentacenes.  The approach being pursued here was to red shift the dyes by extending the pi-system of the heterocycles that comprise the dipyrrin or dipyridylmethene.  These materials were chosen due to their high absorptivity and the significant body of work that has been done to understand the electronic structure of these materials. These dyes can be readily substituted to shift HOMO/LUMO energies without significantly altering their absorption spectra.  This property is very important when paring donor and acceptor materials in OPVs, to ensure the highest possible efficiency for charge separation and the highest possible Voc.  In this research we investigated the effect of extending the dye pi-systems through benzannulation and found we could push the absorbance and thus OPV activity into the red/NIR part of the spectrum.\n\nThe second part of our materials development for achieving high Jsc involves filling gaps in the absorption spectra of the donor+acceptor materials.  When a donor and acceptor are chosen, the active wavelengths of the OPV will be the sum of the absorption spectra of the two materials. Thus, an addition parameter to the energetic offsets that control Voc and the efficiency of charge separation is the complementarity of the two absorption spectra.  Ideally the spectra of the donor and acceptor should not strongly overlap, such that the broadest possible wavelength range can be covered by the sum of the donor and acceptor.  It is often the case that the donor+acceptor do not uniformly absorb and there will be gaps in the spectra.   We were interested in improving the efficiencies of the symmetry breaking charge transfer based OPVs described below.  Here we found that doping coumarin and other dyes into the donor phase of the OPV can lead to an enhanced short circuit current, due to better spectra coverage in the doped system. \n\nThe materials and device approaches explored here promise to give high efficiency photovoltaics and could be used in a wide range of optoelectronic applications.  The research here was carried out by graduate students from USC and undergraduates from local community colleges.  The undergraduate researchers (two of them) participated via summer internships and both have gone on to the University of California system to complete their BS degrees.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark E Thompson"
