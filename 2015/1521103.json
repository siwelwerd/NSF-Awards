 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the 2015 and 2016 meetings of the Maurice Auslander International Conference series, held at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, Quissett Campus in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.  The first will be held on April 29 - May 4, 2015, and the second in May, 2016. The conference is a combination workshop/conference/student presentation event. Each day of the conference starts with expository lectures by known international experts in various fields. There will also be student presentations explaining their own results. The rest of the lectures will be traditional conference talks. The goal of the expository talks and student talks is to make current research in algebra accessible to graduate students and postdocs and to give beginning researchers a platform to display their achievements. The meetings also introduce international leaders in the field to young US researchers, who become better known in the world and make outside contacts. The conference will help make current topics in new branches of algebra more accessible and more popular in the US. This successful yearly event will continue to expand its participation and extend support to more young researchers.  \r\n\r\nIn the twenty-first century, Auslander-Reiten theory has had considerable new impact in many fields; particularly important is the fact that the cluster theory of Fomin and Zelevinsky, which is connected to so many different fields, is also intimately related to the representation theory of finite dimensional algebras. The Maurice Auslander International Conference is intended to be a center of activity for this area of algebra in the United States. The meeting brings together mathematicians from representation theory and related areas of algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and mathematical physics.  This conference places special emphasis on:  Representation theory of algebras, usually noncommutative; Relation of representation theory of algebras to other fields such as representations of groups, vector bundles over weighted projective space, the topology of surfaces, Poisson geometry, and cluster structures on Grassmannians;  Application of techniques from the representation theory of algebras to related fields such as invariant theory and combinatorics;  Applications of results from other fields in order to motivate new methods in the representation theory of algebras in terms of both problem solving and development of new questions, in particular for cluster algebras, which were invented to study Lusztig's canonical bases arising from quantized enveloping algebras, and applications to quantum field theory such as the Cecotti-Vafa theory of BPS quivers. \r\n\r\nMore information can be found at the conference web site www.northeastern.edu/martsinkovsky/p/MADL/MADL.html",
