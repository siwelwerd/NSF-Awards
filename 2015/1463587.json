 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this project is to better understand the means by which focused ion beam (FIB) instruments remove material from surfaces.  FIB instruments, already common tools in the semiconductor industry, use extremely narrow beams of ions, as small as a few nanometers wide, to mill or etch surfaces.  As FIB processing finds broader applications in other areas of nanotechnology, such as in the drilling of nanopores for DNA sequencing, which is an enabling technology in the multi-billion dollar molecular medical diagnostics industry, there is an emerging need for better understanding of FIB processing at the finest scales. This project will lead to more effective use of FIB instruments through the development of predictive models for the material response to the ion beam.  The project will involve collaboration with a leading European research group working on improving the resolution of FIB nanopore fabrication, and regular consultation with the leading US producer of FIB instruments.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in both the computational and experimental science of ion interactions with materials, and an outreach program aimed at K-12 students will be developed.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis driving the project is that the fundamental mode of material removal in FIB processing is strongly flux-dependent at the smallest scale, changing from an erosion-driven process at low fluxes to a phase-change process at high fluxes.  To test this hypothesis, FIB nanopore drilling will be investigated over a range of conditions, with particular emphasis on the effects of ion beam flux.  Large-scale parallel molecular dynamics simulations will be carried out to simulate FIB nanopore drilling in a freestanding thin film target.  The simulations will involve up to 10 million atoms over millions of time steps, and will be the first-ever full molecular dynamics simulations of FIB drilling.  Material removal and rearrangement mechanisms, in particular explosive boiling and thermocapillary mass transport, will be fully characterized and explained.  A multiscale statistical model will be developed to extend the molecular dynamics simulations to study long time-scale processes such as low-flux FIB processing.  Finally, targeted experiments on FIB nanopore drilling will guide the development and validation of the computation-based model.  FIB nanopores, with diameters of less than 10nm, will be fabricated using a high-resolution dual-beam FIB instrument and characterized for comparison to the simulation results.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project explored the mechanisms by which Focused Ion Beam (FIB) processing affects materials and surfaces. FIB is an important tool in microelectronics, microscopy, and materials research generally, because it is used to cut, section, mill, and otherwise modify surfaces at nanometer scales.  One important application is in nanopore fabrication, in which a FIB instrument is used as a microscopic drill, removing material in a few-nanometer area and creating a nanopore, which may be used for DNA sequencing and other nanofluidic applications.\n\nAt these extremely small scales and high temperatures, the nature of the material removal and rearrangement is complex and difficult to monitor.  In this project, computational methods were used to study these questions, along with a set of simple targeted experiments.  A specialized molecular dynamics computer program was developed to model the process of nanopore drilling, and then made available to other researchers as an open-source software package on the NSF-supported NanoHUB website.  In the first year of its release, the program has been used by more than 100 other researchers, who have run more than 1000 separate analyses.  \n\nIn addition to the molecular dynamics studies, a continuum model was developed to understand another FIB phenomenon, in which high-dose low-energy FIB milling leads to formation or condensation of nanodroplets, which are then highly mobile, and found experimentally to migrate around the surface.  The model adopts an unusual approach, treating the topmost layer of the solid surface as a thin fluid film, which is justified by the fact that the material is at extremely high temperatures while subjected to FIB irradiation.  Indeed, under this assumption, the model accurately predicts the formation (including the size and shape) of nanodroplets at conditions consistent with experimental observations, and it predicts accurately the resulting motion of the highly mobile droplets.\n\nThe progress made under the support of this project will help scientists and engineers make better use of Focused Ion Beam processing in nanomanufactuing and nanofabrication.  The dissemination of the method will ensure that other researchers have access to the state-of-the-art modeling approaches developed in this work.  As a result of this project, two MS students and a postdoctoral researcher were supported as they pursued their studies.  Finally, as part of the project, a K-12 outreach activity was developed, in which an immersive visual reality (VR) program was created and offered to students to help them understand the concept of atoms and molecules.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/10/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Harley T Johnson"
