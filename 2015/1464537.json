 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal requests Phase II funding for Florida Atlantic University to remain as an active site in the I/UCRC for Advanced Knowledge Enablement (CAKE). FAU is a \"Partner\" site, with Florida International University (FIU) serving as the lead institution. The faculty of the I/UCRC CAKE will carry out research in big data analytics, multimedia and data mining, video and multimedia processing, and cloud computing systems, sensors and networks, and their applications in healthcare, medical, environmental, industrial, and public applications. The research will be conducted by faculty at FAU, as well as the I/UCRC CAKE's ongoing lead and affiliated sites, which are investigating a broad range of aspects of the science of data management and search.\r\n\r\nThe research proposed by the Center addresses challenges that cross scientific domains and vertical markets, as many industries are facing existential problems due to the sheer influx of data generated. The Center broadens participation of underrepresented groups in several ways. FAU is one of the U.S. universities with the highest number of Hispanic students, and they will be actively recruited to participate in the projects. As I/UCRC CAKE continues to grow, the Center, jointly with FIU as the lead site, will build a cohesive structure spanning multiple institutions by enabling extended research visits at partner sites for both faculty and graduate students.",
