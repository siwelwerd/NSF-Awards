 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award aims to support a planning meeting to explore the potential for an NSF I/UCRC for Complex Adaptive Systems for Society 2030 aims to solve cross-cutting challenges faced by the mobility and health-care delivery industries that will result from ongoing demographic changes in society. These challenges will be addressed through the Center's innovative and inter-disciplinary research to develop and deliver technical and systems solutions that positively impact the lives of people of diverse age, sex, racial, ethnic and cultural backgrounds. The center will Advance Discovery and Understanding While Promoting Teaching, Training, and \r\nLearning, for example, by training graduate students and junior faculty and involving undergraduates in research experiences. \r\n\r\nWorking with the proposed industrial partners, the PIs have developed two preliminary thrust areas where they have significant shared expertise and interest. The first is Mobility and Transportation Across the Lifespan, focused on maximizing the impact of new technologies such as smart and connected vehicles, active safety, and automotive human-machine interfaces. The second is Technology-Health Interface Across the Lifespan, focused on advances in  wireless sensor and microelectronic devices and the revolution in smartphone application development.",
