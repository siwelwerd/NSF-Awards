 "awd_abstract_narration": "Purdue University is planning to join the I/UCRC on Biophotonic Sensors and Systems (CBSS) as a new university site. CBSS has a goal to establish a national center of excellence in biophotonic sensor and system research, cultivate embryonic biosensor applications, develop methods for improved technology transfer and train a pipeline of skilled engineers and scientist to work in this field. Ultimately, CBSS intends to provide solutions for disease diagnosis, patient monitoring, drug efficacy testing and improved food and water safety. Purdue will expand the scope of corporate connections and brings exciting complementary areas of research to support the CBSS mission. \r\n \r\nThe Purdue team will offer research topics including: compressive optical imaging, flow cytometry, nonlinear optical microscopy, single cell detection, biodynamic imaging of 3D tissues, and point of care medical devices. These research topics fit perfectly with the current CBSS research thrusts and roadmap areas of Imaging, Bioanalytics and Diagnositcs.\r\nThe Purdue Site Director (Dr. Ji-Xin Cheng) has extensive connections in industry that include Olympus and Leica, which offer products in their portfolios based on his inventions. Companies that intend to participate in the planning meeting include companies such as Johnson & Johnson,Ocean Optics and Riverside Research, which are committing to full membership.",
