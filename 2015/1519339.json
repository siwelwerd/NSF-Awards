 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Polytechnic School at Arizona State University focuses on the education ecosystem that empowers faculty to be agents of change in the way that they teach engineering courses -- with a special focus on the four year project sequence, the 2nd and 3rd year engineering fundamentals courses, and the upper division concentration area disciplinary courses. The project takes a systems and community building perspective on how to sustain a mindset of risk-taking, making and innovation to instill creative confidence in students and faculty. The project approaches this challenge by attending to the larger ecosystem within which innovation happens, and by using evidence-based methods to make continuous teaching and learning advances within the engineering program. The specific objectives of this project are to:\r\n\r\n1. Characterize the ecosystem within the Polytechnic School to establish the foundation for enacting innovation across the faculty, impacting students and other stakeholders.\r\n2. Realize a mindset of additive innovation in the students and faculty to promote sharing, scaling, sustainability, and propagation of unique understandings within the community.\r\n3. Establish an understanding of the engineering program culture and dynamics to assess the catalysts and barriers to establishing a culture that is risk seeking.\r\n4. Identify and implement administrative structures to support cultural change and remove perceived barriers that may inhibit such innovation.\r\n\r\nThis project leverages several pedagogical innovations from the project team's prior research. For example, making is integrated into the curriculum; the Lean Launchpad methodology is implemented to characterize the engineering educational ecosystem; and previously tested/refined engineering education research methods are implemented, particularly as it relates to the project team's expertise on faculty development, in order to contribute knowledge on advancing engineering faculty teaching practices. By taking an entrepreneurial approach and using a rapid and iterative process of customer/user/stakeholder discovery, the project captures influencers and potential barriers of the ecosystem that contribute to, or inhibit impact of the proposed work. This research provides guidance for how to establish administrative structures that lead to supporting faculty as change agents, and how embracing a mindset of making and risk-taking can lead to desired professional competencies in engineering students. Characterizing the ecosystem within which change happens serves as a model for other engineering programs that strive to excel in their educational enterprise. The leadership team is disseminating all aspects of this project using an additive innovation philosophy so that others can modify and improve innovations for their own context. The longer-term impacts of creating a culture that values risk taking and making include attracting a new kind of student to the field of engineering. In particular, students who seek out career options in which they can make a positive impact on the world or on their specific community may not have traditionally considered engineering but now may consider it as a career choice. By changing the conversation from having an impact to having the agency to make an impact, the project aims to engender a measurable increase in student interest and persistence.",

This effort supported assessment of the catalysts and barriers to establishing a risk-seeking culture. \n\n\nCommunal Observations of New EXperiences in Teaching (CONEXT) Protocol: We designed a protocol to support the creation of a self-sustaining community of pedagogical exploration. This effort innovated status quo professional development protocols by asking questions to ensure educators receive targeted and useful formative feedback and peer observers think about how they might apply similar teaching practices in their own classroom(s).\n\n\nCapturing the Engineering Program Culture: We used Schein?s organizational cultural framework and a critical incident narrative research approach to better understand the engineering program culture and dynamics. This approach analyzed faculty members? experiences around critical incidents in the organization?s history to assess the culture of the overall program.  Other programs can adopt this same approach to develop an understanding of their own organizational cultures.\n\n\nStudying Making in the Mezzanine: Qualitative research was conducted to understand three case studies of making-based pedagogy in our mezzanine-level mechanics, robotics, and statistics courses.  These efforts supported extending making further into the curriculum.\n\n\nUnderstanding the Effect of COVID-19 Disruption on Faculty Pedagogical Practices: We surveyed faculty about the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the delivery of their courses. The intent was to harness what could be learned from this difficult time, providing individual faculty with formative feedback on changes made due to the pandemic and the community with new ideas for pedagogical risks and additive innovation.\n\n\nTracing Impact Beyond ASU: Our tracing impact work explored the impact of our project beyond the local context.
