 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this proposal is to initiate research on how compassionate design activities can help develop engineering students' self and social awareness. Engineers design solutions within complex contexts that often have broader social, political, economic, and environmental impact. However, research has shown a culture of disengagement in the professional formation of engineers. This culture of disengagement is one where engineers often separate the technical aspects of their work from the social context of the solution in an attempt to be impartial and objective in their decision making. Yet the complex social contexts in which engineers design are becoming more and more important as engineered solutions now have an expanding reach in our global society. To more fully engage engineering students' in social contexts, the work of this proposal will challenge engineering students to be compassionate in their design work to develop solutions that address users' fears, dignity, freedom, and emotional well-being. For example, they may design cancer diagnostic equipment that moves away from the sterile, robotic aesthetic toward a softer, friendlier experience for these highly emotional situations. The research team will explore how this kind of design experience develops engineering students' self and social awareness as well as their overall approach to the engineering design process. Engineering societies and accrediting boards have recognized a need to develop a more well-rounded engineer who has: a commitment to all aspects of innovation where they will need to assess societal impact, a better systems perspective, and greater strength in understanding design contexts. This project impacts the professional formation of engineers, helping students to become ready to solve the complex issues currently facing society.\r\n\r\nThis research initiation proposal aims to explore issues related to these outcomes in the professional formation of engineers by addressing three primary objectives:  1) Integrate perspectives from mechanical engineering and engineering education scholars to develop a robust Compassionate Design framework for raising first-year and mechanical engineering students' self and social awareness; 2) Initiate research on the efficacy and impact of the Compassionate Design framework on students' professional formation related to both their professional and technical skills; and 3) Develop a proposal to more fully explore the technical and social relevance of the Compassionate Design approach. The team will test out potentially transformative approaches to teaching engineering design in mechanical and first-year contexts (locally) to initiate the development of a more comprehensive education and research project to impact the teaching of engineering design more broadly (nationally). The research team will test these activities in a first-year engineering course as well as sophomore and senior mechanical engineering design courses. A series of surveys, reflection assignments, and interviews will be administered and analyzed to provide insights into the effectiveness of this approach in raising students' awareness and ability to consider multiple perspectives (an important ability in engineering design). While this is a research initiation proposal where the initial work will be to more systematically develop a research plan, the PIs have begun to conceptualize a plan for the research. This plan follows a design research approach and will take place in the PI's design courses for initial testing and preliminary data collection as the team builds toward a larger research proposal. The team will work to address three guiding research questions: RQ1: Does compassionate design enable students to develop self/social awareness?; RQ2: Does compassionate design appeal to a different type of engineering student?; RQ3: How does the compassionate design framework impact the students' design process? The broader impact of such a professional orientation could attract and retain a new kind of student in engineering as well as promoting a professional orientation that emphasizes the humanitarian values of engineering.",

The PI?s Tahira Reid and Morgan Hynes combined their expertise to develop and test this framework, and examined how it influenced professional formation. The traditional mechanical engineering education paradigm is adept at training engineers in analytical, modeling, and other technical skills needed to address functional/objective aspects of problems they solve.  Professional skills such as communication, the ability to work in teams typically occur in conjunction with course projects, especially team-based projects.

Raising students? self and social awareness has the potential to improve the students? design skills and abilities related to adopting client perspectives, thinking broadly about the design context, considering ethical implications of design decisions, and recognizing their responsibility for promoting public welfare.\n\nAs a result of this work, the PIs had the opportunity to implement changes in the curriculum of the first year and sophomore engineering students to incorporate compassionate design thinking in their projects.  This work has impacted more than 500 students in the first year engineering and sophomore mechanical engineering programs. The research results from this work demonstrate that students had transformative learning experiences that helped them develop new perspectives as they solved engineering design problems.  In addition, we found that compassionate design provides a framework for helping engineers/designers enhance end-user experiences which supports decision-making in the design process.  \n\nThe collaboration across the Engineering Education and Mechanical Engineering programs provided a richness in the experiences of all the team members.  The two graduate students gained relevant knowledge needed for their careers in both educational settings and user experience  work in industry.  The PIs also benefited from the various methods and perspectives held by the other disciplines.  Such intellectual diversity is enabled through interdisciplinary collaborations of this kind.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/12/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tahira Reid"
