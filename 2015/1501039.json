 "awd_abstract_narration": "The thirteenth annual Graduate Student Topology and Geometry Conference (GSTGC) is to be held March 29-March 30, 2015, at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. This will be the largest GSTGC ever, with over 150 graduate students from across the country at various stages of their careers expected to attend.  The schedule includes a broad range of talks: 24-32 graduate student 30 minute talks on expository and original research topics in geometry/topology; plenary speakers, Kathryn Hess (EPFL), Misha Kapovich (UC Davis), and Daniel Wise (McGill); and six invited young faculty speakers, Anna Marie Bohmann (Northwestern), Jeff Danciger (UT Austin), Jo Nelson (IAS), Vivek Schende (UC Berkeley), Hiro Lee Tanaka (Harvard) and Jing Tao (Oklahoma). This conference will include talks in many subfields of topology and geometry, including hyperbolic geometry, geometry of positive curvature, global analysis, 3-manifolds, homotopy theory, symplectic geometry, dynamics, knot theory, cobordism theory, category theory, Teichmuller theory, 4-manifolds, differential topology, geometric group theory, algebraic K-theory, and more.\r\n\r\nThis conference provides a venue for communication among young mathematicians from different geographic regions. Participants include graduate students at all stages of their careers. This is one of the few conferences in topology and geometry that is dedicated to graduate students. Student participants at this conference have the opportunity to learn about cutting edge research, to refine their communication and networking skills, and to establish collaborations with peers. Geometry and topology are fundamental mathematical fields with deep connections to many other areas of research, such as dynamical systems, physics, computer science, and mathematical biology. This conference serves to foster research and communication about research in these areas, and to enable and encourage graduate students in these fields.\r\n\r\nConference URL: http://www.math.illinois.edu/gstgc2015/",
