 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal investigates properties of newly formed massive clusters of stars, which are thought to be analogs of the large star clusters (so-called \"globular clusters\") that formed very early in the history of our Milky Way Galaxy and many other galaxies. The team will acquire molecular-line and dust-continuum data, using the most advanced millimeter and submillimeter radio telescopes such as the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array, to investigate the star formation efficiency in these young massive clusters. Characterizing this efficiency has important ramifications for a star cluster's survivability, as well as for how star formation will progress near the cluster and throughout its host galaxy. The team's low-resolution pilot study of a young massive cluster hints at a surprisingly efficient conversion of gas into stars. To make progress, that cluster and a similar one will be studied with the high angular resolution and sensitivity that have only recently become available for southerly clusters. A low-resolution study of a northerly cluster will also be undertaken to begin exploring this important topic in a third setting. The PI will continue her successful efforts to involve women and other underrepresented groups in her research. She will also continue to give public talks",

The intellectual merit of this activity is to address a poorly understood, but key process, the formation of the most massive star clusters, which are the largest sub-galactic units in the universe. There is to date little information on the formation of giant star clusters since there are no such clusters currently forming in the Milky Way. Because of their large populations of luminous young stars, giant star clusters are individually capable of affecting the structure and evolution of their host galaxies. Hence defining their formation and evolution process is critical to the understanding of galactic evolution. In the studies comprising this project, data from ALMA was used to extend our reach to gas clouds forming giant clusters in nearby galaxies. The goal was to measure gas masses and kinematics of these gas clouds. The project targets were clusters in the dwarf galaxies, NGC 5253, Henize 2-10, and II Zwicky 40; the spectral line of CO at a wavelength of 870&mu;m was used to image the molecular gas clouds. There were numerous discoveries and unexpected findings arising from this work. In all three sources, it was revealed that giant clusters form by the accretion of filaments of gas from outside the galaxy and not from gas pre-existing within the galaxy itself, which is very different from Milky Way star formation. The youngest massive star clusters, despite containing extremely massive and windy stars, do not rapidly blow out and disperse their gas as previously believed. Thus the clusters can continue to accrete gas from the infalling filaments and grow, potentially leading to more massive systems, such as intermediate mass black holes or even larger bodies, an idea that is currently being pursued in theoretical simulations by other groups. Another discovery is that the massive stars within these giant star clusters are rapidly enriching their local gas clouds to super-solar metallicities. This finding could explain why dusty galaxies have been seen very early in the history of the universe. Finally, these studies have revealed that the stars within the clusters heat the gas to unusually high temperatures, so that the chemistry and excitation of the molecular gas in these clouds is very different from gas clouds of the Milky Way or other local galaxies, both spiral and dwarf. Thus CO emission from clouds near giant star clusters does not scale with molecular gas mass in the same way as it does in the Milky Way. Because of this difference, although the parent molecular clouds of massive star clusters appear to be forming stars at efficiencies exceeding 50%, it is not yet clear precisely how efficient the process is. This project has pointed the way to the next directions to pursue to understand the gas chemistry and excitation in these extreme conditions, which are probably more typical of star formation of the early universe. The broader impacts of this project include, in addition to extending our basic astronomical knowledge of galaxies and the universe, the training of students, including underrepresented minority students, and preparation of these students for graduate studies.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/26/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: J.&nbsp;L&nbsp;Turner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1515570/1515570_10398639_1580072367455_ALMA_CO32_Halpha_cropped--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1515570/1515570_10398639_1580072367455_ALMA_CO32_Halpha_cropped--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Gas Clouds in the Starburst Galaxy NGC 5253\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1515570/1515570_10398639_1580072367455_ALMA_CO32_Halpha_cropped--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Gas Clouds in the Starburst Galaxy NGC 5253\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Emission in the 870micron line of CO from the ALMA observatory in contours, atop a Hubble image of Halpha from ionized gas.
