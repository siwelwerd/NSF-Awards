 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to help address urgent public health problems (specifically the spread of the Ebola virus) of national and global significance by advancing the state of the art in computer science, big data analytics, data visualization techniques, and decision support systems. Specifically, the effort, developing computational models to predict the spread of Ebola utilizing both 'forward simulation' from a given patient and the propagation of the infection into the community and backwards, aims to trace a number of the verified infections to patient 'zero.' The work utilizes big data analytic techniques, data about underlying personal relationships, health center locations, and the known mechanisms for the spread of the Ebola virus.\r\n\r\nThe project connects directly to the Florida International University (FIU)?s TerraFly system, a web-enabled system designed to aid in the visualization of spatial and remotely sensed data. The system allows users to ?fly? with fine resolution over the surface of the earth to explore various kinds of data (e.g., local information, street maps, aerial photography, satellite imagery, etc.). The Ebola spread patterns are then fed into a Decision Support System (DDS). These inputs also consist of information about social groups or individual persons. Based on spread patterns, the DSS will then calculate probabilities for a social group or a given person to get infected with Ebola. The system will be able to present data mashups to operators responding to hotline calls and field workers encountering patients and deciding about triage. The data will also be presented in report form to responsible government agencies. This time-sensitive project necessitates prompt collection and analysis of the spread of the Ebola virus in order to enable the development of the correct models.",

We used massive amounts of data from various sources including Twitter feeds, Facebook and Google. This data is then fed into a decision support system that models the spread pattern of the Ebola virus and creates dynamic graphs and predictive diffusion models on the outcome and impact on either a specific person or a specific community. As a result of this research, computational spread models for Ebola in the U.S. are created, potentially leading to more precise forward predictions of the disease propagation and tools to help identify individuals who are possibly infected, and perform trace-back analysis to locate the possible source of infection for a particular social group.&nbsp; Besides collaborating with FIU, we also closely collaborated with LexisNexis (LN), which is a leading big data company and a member of our I/UCRC for Advanced Knowledge Enablement. LexisNexis has provided the large amount of data about relationship of the people in US, and we combined it with data analytics techniques and tools to model disease spread patterns. In this part of research we used Cloud Computer system located in our College at FAU as well as LN&rsquo;s High-Performance Computer Cluster (HPCC), which is intended for big data applications. We performed modeling, analytics, and development of a Decision Support System (DSS), which provides a probabilistic outcome of Ebola impact on either a specific person or a community at a specific location.

Mathematical compartmental models have been applied to predict the behavior of disease outbreaks in many studies. These models aim to understand the dynamics of a disease propagation process and focus on partitioning the population into several health states. With information from multiple sources indicating infected individuals and their personal relationships and social groups, dynamic graphs can be created, and predictive diffusion models can be used to study key issues of Ebola epidemics, e.g., location, time and number of expected new cases. Two fundamental diffusion models are Independent Cascade Model (IC) and Linear Threshold Model (LT), both of which follow an iterative diffusion process where infected nodes infect their uninfected neighbors with certain probabilities. Based on fundamental models, we developed advanced propagation models to estimate an influence function by examining past and newly infected notes and predict subsequent infections.
