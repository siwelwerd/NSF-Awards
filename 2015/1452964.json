 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both healthy and diseased tissues are composed of multiple cell types whose interplay underpins their\r\nfunctions. Even within a given cell type, individual cells will differ in their exact state due to distinct external\r\ninfluences, cell's history, or random noise. Such heterogeneity presents a major challenge for modeling and\r\nunderstanding biological tissues. Rapidly progressing single-cell measurements can now provide\r\ncomprehensive data on cell state, enabling unbiased analysis of composition of complex tissues. Such\r\nmeasurements, however, are inherently noisy and require specialized statistical and computational tools for their\r\nanalysis. The project will develop sensitive statistical methods for identification and characterization of\r\nbiologically distinct subsets of cells from single-cell transcriptome data, and will apply them to investigate cellular\r\ncomposition and function of neural tissues in humans, mice and other organisms. Such characterization will\r\nlikely provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying brain development. The developed tools will be\r\nwidely applicable in other biological contexts. Finally, the instructional material created by this project will\r\nintroduce beginning and advanced students to the fundamental set of statistical and computational techniques\r\nnecessary to understand modern biological measurements.\r\n\r\nThe research will develop an approach for analysis cell heterogeneity based on the single-cell transcriptome\r\ndata. Model-based factor analysis will be used to capture the structure of the transcriptional heterogeneity within\r\nthe measured cell populations in a way that is highly tolerant of technical and biological variability inherent to the\r\nsingle-cell measurements. Methods for incorporating available spatial information and predicting spatial\r\nlocalization of subpopulations will be developed. Statistical methods will be developed to identify gene\r\nregulatory dependencies from single-cell data. The approaches will be applied to analysis of transcriptional\r\nheterogeneity and regulatory processes in neuronal tissues of humans and model organisms. To facilitate\r\nteaching of relevant analysis methods, the project will develop a series of interactive exercises, which will\r\nillustrate common counting processes that underlie the assumptions of most analysis methods, statistical tools\r\nfor estimating uncertainty from count data, and common algorithms used to process single-cell sequencing data.\r\nTo reach wider student audience the interactive instructional tools will have an adaptable difficulty level and will\r\nbe directly accessible over the web.
