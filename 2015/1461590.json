 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project contributes new knowledge and develops new approaches for understanding fire as a globally significant process, which has long been influenced by climate and humans.  Because fire is an important natural disturbance, alterations of fire regimes can have significant impacts on vulnerable ecosystems.  The investigators will develop new strategies to advance research about past human-environment dynamics from landscape to regional scales.  The project will provide new perspectives, information, insights, and approaches to advance basic understanding of recent fires as well as long-term fire trends in the U.S. and globally.  The project also will provide important insights about ecosystem resilience that can inform conservation and resource management of fragile ecoregions in various parts of the world.  Project results will enhance the capacity of public agencies to better understand impacts of fire and to develop more effective preventive and mitigation procedures.\r\n\r\nThe project will use new ecosystems modeling approaches to analyze paleoecological and archeological data in order to identify human-related burning activities.  It will examine the environmental consequences of fire and assess the biophysical feedbacks of such fires.  The investigators will focus on the late Holocene period to gain a better understanding of the controls of fire at a time when climate variability was high and human populations were growing and expanding in the southern hemisphere.  They will conduct analyses to answer three main questions:  (1) What is the nature of past and present fire regimes driven by climate and vegetation conditions?  (2) What are the ecological consequences of different land-use practices that require fire?  (3) What are the potential vegetation feedbacks that may have reinforced deliberate burning strategies?  The proposed data-model framework will help to identify the importance of changes in human land use and slowly varying drivers in climate, and they will help enhance understanding of climate variability and vegetation feedbacks in the mid-latitudes.  The interdisciplinary approach will improve current qualitative paleoecological and archeological reconstructions, and it will complement insights gained from ecological research underway in the U.S. and internationally.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe ecological transition from dry forest to grassland (or steppe) at the lower elevations of mountain systems is one of most sensitive regions in the world to the effects of climate-driven and anthropogenic disturbances.  Nowhere is this transition (or ecotone) more dramatically displayed than along the flanks of the eastern Andes in Patagonia, where Nothofagus forest is abruptly replaced by steppe.  This part of Patagonia is undergoing rapid changes, having experienced large fires, drought, non-native tree invasion, and urbanization in recent decades, and the lower forest-steppe ecotone has become a focus of international conservation concern.  \n\nPaleoecological records document the dynamic nature of the Patagonian forest-steppe ecotone over the last 20,000 years since the end of the last ice age, but the drivers of past ecological change have not been examined in detail.  This project has focused on the relative role that past changes in climate and human activity have played in shaping the vegetation and fire history at the forest-steppe border from lat. 34-52oS. Taking an interdisciplinary approach, the study has drawn on (1) lake-sediment records from new and published sites to reconstruct past vegetation and fire changes; (2) archeological and ethnohistorical data to discern past human activity; and (3) dynamic vegetation modeling to examine the interactions between disturbance, climate, and vegetation response.  \n\nThe findings of the project point to the dominant role of climate in shaping the region?s vegetation and fire history, and particularly to the role of changes in the position and strength of the southern westerly wind system in governing seasonal precipitation and fire potential.  For example, fire activity in the study region was highest during periods when the southern westerlies were weakened and shifted southward, creating seasonally dry conditions and abundant fuel biomass.  \n\nHumans have been present in southern South America for at least 14,500 years, and although initial hunter-gather groups may have altered vegetation through deliberate burning, this project found that their influence was negligible in most locations and indiscernible from that caused by climate.  Human impacts were first clearly registered in the 15th century with the appearance of non-native plant species in the pollen record, and then in the last 19th century as Euro-Americans exploited specific resources for livestock grazing and timber production and later established non-native pine plantations.  Unlike Native American influences, which were generally site-specific, subtle and metasynchronous, Euro-American land use in the last 200 years was concurrent and broad scale along the forest-steppe ecotone.  The interactions between past changes in climate and land use prior to Euro-Americans sharply contrast with those that are occurring at present with global warming, forest management and urbanization.  The study also utilized a dynamic vegetation model to examine the 20th century increase in forest cover at the forest-steppe border.  Model simulations indicate that recent afforestation is largely a result of changing climate and increasing carbon dioxide.  \n\nIn summary, this multidisciplinary research investigation highlights the importance of landscape-scale paleoenvironmental reconstructions for understanding human-climate-fire interactions in ways that regional and continental studies often overlook or overgeneralize.  It also points to the value of combining empirical and modeling approaches when examining past and present land-cover change. The results of this project were presented at several national and international conferences and published in 18 peer-reviewed publications and two book chapters.  The project supported two doctoral students, one successful filmmaker in the MSU Science and Natural History Filmmaking MFA Program, and several undergraduate interns in the lab and field.  It convened a workshop of scientists, modelers, and forest managers in San Carlos de Bariloche in 2016 to shape the vision and goals of this international collaborative effort.  In addition to the scientific products, a student-led video podcast was filmed and translated into Spanish to share with the public and resource managers in Argentina. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cathy L Whitlock"
