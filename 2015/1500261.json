 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a microscale sensor of water stress and temperature for real-time monitoring of the chemical state within concrete during curing, and for refined predictions of the concrete's mechanical properties. The HydroT sensor of water status and temperature, and the Extended Maturity Analysis that it will enable, are important because they will allow for improved control of the properties of concrete during curing. Improper curing of concrete structures can cause stress that may lead to cracking and ultimate failure. Real-time sensing and monitoring of concrete curing will lead to improved functionality, increased lifetime, and a reduction in the global use of this energy-intensive material. \r\n\r\nThe project will result in prototypes of the HydroT sensor, initial development of Extended Maturity Methods using these sensors in concrete curing, and an improved understanding of the priority markets for the commercialization of this technology. The HydroT sensor has the following unique features: 1) unprecedented sensitivity for the measurement of water stress in the range that is relevant in concrete. This capability will allow for water status to be incorporated, for the first time, into methods of tracking and controlling concrete properties during construction. 2) Integration of water and temperature sensing using microfabrication techniques. This approach will allow for simple, low-cost scaled-up and production by leveraging the existing capabilities of microfabrication foundries. 3) Small format and simple integration with electronics and communication. These characteristics will make the barrier for adoption by industry low. Taken together, these features mean that the HydroT technology will provide the concrete industry an important new functionality (sensing of water status) in a device that can replace the temperature probes used in conventional Maturity Analysis with similar costs and technical complexity.   \r\n\r\nTo translate the HydroT Probe and Extended Maturity Analysis toward commercial application, the team will pursue advances in the understanding and technical approaches on both hardware and application fronts. These developments will involve fundamental advances in the ability to manipulate the properties of critical materials such as the porous membrane and deeper understanding of the coupling of moisture and temperature in defining maturation in important classes of concrete. Additionally, the team will pursue a deeper understanding of the market, competitors, and potential partners for manufacturing and distribution. Throughout, the team will aim to reinforce its intellectual property position and to build a core group of entrepreneurs and technical staff to carry the project into a successful start-up company. As part of the project, the personnel involved - undergraduates, graduates, and post-docs - will gain experience in innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology translation through participation in the patent application process with Cornell's technology transfer office and activities such as Cornell's Pre-Seed Workshop and technology accelerator program, eLabs.",

Knowing the thermodynamic state of water within a given material helps us understand both the biological, chemical, and physical processes that can occur within it. Materials of interest in this project included biological tissues (particularly of plants), synthetic materials such as concrete, and natural materials such as soils. The most important thermodynamic property is the free energy or chemical potential, because it tells us how accessible a given molecule is to participate in a chemical reaction or to move from one place to another. Our tools for measuring chemical potential of water within complex natural and synthetic materials has been limited.

To improve the response time of the device required an innovation that was inspired by the vascular system of plants: the team integrated an array of microchannels into the nanoporous membrane that allows the device to maintain tension.
