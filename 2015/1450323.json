 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advanced software plays a fundamental role for large scientific projects. The primary goal of DIANA/HEP (Data Intensive ANAlysis for High Energy Physics) is developing state-of-the-art tools for experiments that acquire, reduce, and analyze petabytes of data. Improving performance, interoperability, and collaborative tools through modifications and additions to packages broadly used by the community will allow users to more fully exploit the data being acquired at CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other facilities. These experiments are addressing questions at the heart of physics: What are the underlying constituents of matter? And how do they interact? With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the Standard Model of particle physics is complete. It provides an excellent description of known particles and forces.  However, the most interesting questions remain open: What is the dark matter which pervades the universe? Does space-time have additional symmetries or extend beyond the 3 spatial dimensions we know? What is the mechanism stabilizing the Higgs boson mass from enormous quantum corrections? The next generation of experiments will collect exabyte-scale data samples to provide answers. Analyzing this data will require new and better tools. \r\n\r\nFirst, the project will provide the CPU and IO performance needed to reduce the iteration time so crucial to explore new ideas. It will develop software to effectively exploit emerging many- and multi-core hardware. It will establish infrastructure for a higher-level of collaborative analysis, building on the successful patterns used for the Higgs boson discovery and enabling a deeper communication between the theoretical community and the experimental community. DIANA?s products will sit in the ROOT framework, already used by the HEP community of more than 10000 particle and nuclear physicists. By improving interoperability with the larger scientific software ecosystem, DIANA will incorporate best practices and algorithms from other disciplines into HEP. Similarly, the project will make its computing insights, tools, and novel ideas related to collaborative analysis, standards for data preservation, and best practices for treating software as a research product available to the larger scientific community.  Finally, to improve the quality of the next generation of software engineers in HEP, DIANA will host an annual workshop on analysis tools and establish a fellowship program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nAdvanced software plays a fundamental role for large scientific projects; software is a particularly critical enabler for data analysis in the field of High Energy Physics (HEP). Without continuously advancing the state-of-the-art, particle physics experiments, such as CERN?s Large Hadron Collider (LHC), would overwhelm the community with data.  The DIANA/HEP (Data Intensive ANAlysis for High Energy Physics) collaborative project made critical R&amp;D contributions to the HEP community, particularly in improving the field?s approach to reading and writing data (I/O) and how the physics quantities in computer memory are serialized into long-term storage such as hard drives or tape archives.\nOne overwhelming problem for HEP data analysis is simply the volume of the data; one can reduce the impact on storage through use of compression at a cost of increased processing time.  DIANA/HEP led efforts to modernize the use of compression techniques within the field?s data formats and the reference implementation, ROOT.  This included integrating new compression algorithms (allowing users to better balance between disk size and CPU costs), offloading decompression from a computer?s CPU, integrating optimized implementations of widely used algorithms, and studies of potential performance gains for redesigns of the file format.  The project identified several inefficiencies in the file format and worked to remove redundant information while retaining backward compatibility.  Not only were the direct improvements done, but engineers helped build a library of reference samples representing a diverse cross-section of HEP data in order to allow direct, representative comparison of changes across projects.  The project performed continuous benchmarking of performance; several ROOT sub-modules utilized the approach and infrastructure beyond I/O.\nDIANA/HEP also prototyped ideas in ?bulk data reads?, allowing more physics data to be read at once from storage at a time.  Many of the simple data structures stored in files can be read in bulk, as opposed to a single quantity at a time; doing so can reduce the time-to-read by up to an order of magnitude.  DIANA/HEP implemented bulk read APIs for a number of simple data types and, since this work, a number of implementations have flourished, particularly for analysts working in the Python language.\nThe project explicitly worked toward improving HEP?s interoperability with other data analysis ecosystems, particularly Python, as this is seen as a path to improve sustainability.  As this accelerated over the last years, the DIANA team contributed to the development of the Coffea framework and its associated software packages, which aims to provide the end-to-end tools necessary for analysis in Python.\nThe project included education, training, and professional development as part of its core work.  As a part of this, project staff helped mentor students in the annual Google Summer of Code, an annual training program run by Google but requiring mentors from across many fields, and taught at training events for using Python in HEP.  Project staff also worked with a DIANA-HEP Fellow on a Coffea-related project, and had the opportunity to help organize sessions in the field?s annual conference, Computing in High Energy and Nuclear Physics (CHEP).\nBy contributing to the reference I/O implementation used by HEP (ROOT), DIANA/HEP aimed to have a wide impact; essentially every physicist working in experimental particle physics can benefit from the project?s developments.  This work allows users to tune their data files, whether for smaller files - helping to reduce the overall cost of experiment?s storage - or for faster analysis, reducing the time to insight.  Overall, this will improve the community?s ?velocity? to produce scientific output and make it more sustainable in the future.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/22/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth A Bloom"
