 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics.  The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high energy gamma-rays.  VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  This award supports scientists at Georgia Institute of Technology to carry out research with VERITAS.  The group will study pulsars that emit very high energy gamma-rays to test models of particle acceleration and to look for evidence of the quantum-mechanical structure of spacetime.  The group will work with undergraduates in research projects.  They will also participate in the GIFT program, integrating a teacher in the group's research activities and developing classroom activities.\r\n\r\nThis award with support the Georgia Institute of Technology group as they begin the first comprehensive survey of pulsars in very high energy gamma-rays with a goal of finding more pulsars like the Crab that emit pulsed gamma-rays at energies above 100 GeV.  They will perform a deep exposure of the Crab pulsar with VERITAS.  This will extend spectral measurements into the TeV range in order to discriminate between model predictions of particle acceleration and to test Lorentz invariance.  Photon detectors for future gamma-ray observatories will be characterized and simulation software will be developed.",
