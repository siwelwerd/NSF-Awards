 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research seeks to develop a systematic understanding of the fundamental optical and life-cycle properties of biomass-burning aerosols from freshly emitted to several days of aging.  The variations in aerosol properties will be quantified as a function of various combustion processes, such as:  phase of burning, fuel type, and moisture content; as well as atmospheric processes such as oxidation, relative humidity and condensation of volatile organics.  The significance of this research is to improve our understanding of the role that biomass-burning aerosols play in the direct radiative effects.  Current models assume a spherical shape for these aerosols, whereas this research will combine laboratory and field experiments focused on the fractal shape of biomass-burning aerosols.  This research has the potential to lead to two important societal benefits: reduced uncertainty in direct radiative forcing (DRF) effects from biomass-burning aerosols and the development of modules to enhance K-12 education through internet-based learning.  This research and education plan uses the resources of Washington University's Institute for School Partnership (ISP), providing outreach to K-12 students and teachers in underrepresented minority communities.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research combines a significant theoretical component coupled with well-conceived laboratory experiments.  The goal is to develop a look-up-table (LUT) to replace the Mie-theory based modeling efforts currently in use.  This study proposes a significant effort aimed at reconciling predicted refractive index and asymmetry parameter determined experimentally and using numerically exact T-matrix codes.  If successful, this could lead to transformative understanding of the physical and optic properties of biomass-burning aerosols.  Specifically this new knowledge may help reduce uncertainties associated with direct radiative forcing due to biomass-burning aerosols.  Datasets resulting from this research will improve parameterization of aerosol radiative transfer interaction in global and regional modeling efforts.",

A total of 45 peer-reviewed publications and a patent application have resulted till date from this project. A total of 9 PhDs, 4 Masters, and 8 undergraduate students along with 3 post-doctoral scholars received training as part of this project.</p>\n<p>First, we designed a comprehensive study to address one of the grand challenges in atmospheric climate science, which is quantitative estimation of enhancement in light absorption by atmospheric black carbon (BC) aerosol. Atmospheric BC has been identified as the second most important global warming agent after greenhouse gases. Field observations carried out worldwide have shown that greater than 75% of BC in the atmosphere exists as internal mixture with organic and non-refractory materials. Coating of nascent BC with these materials results in enhancement, by as much as three times, of its mass absorption cross-section (MAC<sub>BC</sub>). MAC<sub>BC</sub> is a key parameter in radiative transfer models to estimate the impact of BC aerosol on Earth?s radiative budget. Our objective was to identify and establish universal power-law expressions between MAC<sub>BC</sub>, its enhancement, and BC mixing ratios. We showed that MAC<sub>BC</sub> evolves with increasing internal mixing ratios in simple power-law exponents of 1/3. Remarkably, MAC<sub>BC</sub> remains inversely proportional to wavelength at any mixing ratio. When mixing states are represented using mass-equivalent core-shell spheres, as is done in current climate models, it results in significant under prediction of MAC<sub>BC</sub>. To demonstrate the universality of our findings, we consolidated observational BC light absorption dataset collected globally, over USA, UK and Asia, and showed that atmospheric BC accurately follows the scaling laws predicted by our model.</p>\n<p>Second, we investigated the effects of atmospheric processing on Brown Carbon (BrC) aerosol light absorption reduction and clear-sky Direct Forcing Efficiency (DRF) efficiency. At 4.5 equivalent days of aging, the BrC <em>Babs </em>at 375 nm decreased by ~46%. The radiative forcing effect over snow (as well as other bright surfaces such as low-level clouds) is vital to climate models, especially since this type of surface is characteristic of regions over which boreal forest fire emissions are likely to be found. BrC aerosol contributes to positive forcing (warming) over bright terrain throughout the atmospheric aging time scales investigated in this work. However, with increased atmospheric residence time from 0 to 4.5 equivalent days, the integrated DRF efficiency decreased by approximately 27%. Corresponding decrease in DRF efficiency over ground was ~5%, from -4.04 ? 0.03 W m-2 to -4.25 ?0.05 W m&#8209;2 for particle aging from fresh to 4.5 equivalent days.</p>\n<p>Next, we investigated the impacts of biomass cookstoves, the largest source of fine particulate emissions and ambient particulate pollution in South Asia, over regional atmospheric warming. We found that cookstove emitted BrC contributes roughly as much as BC to total absorption cross-sections in the mid-visible wavelengths and should be classified as a ?strongly absorbing? type of organic carbon in climate models. Our findings highlighted the strong near-ultraviolet wavelength absorption characteristics of emitted BrC aerosol from household stove combustion of nationally-representative biomass fuels.</p>\n<p>Two major technological innovations arising from this project are the design and development of i) a portable small-angle light scattering (PLS) instrument capable of <em>in situ </em>and real-time measurement of the aerosol scattering intensity, which is interchangeable with the phase function <em>S11 </em>with a multiplication factor, in the scattering angle range 0.3 to 180 degrees for a total of 1024 angles, and thus calculates the asymmetry parameter. Additionally, one can determine the fractal dimension or morphology of the particles using this device; and ii) the Python Mie Scattering package, or PyMieScatt, which is a complete tool for both forward and inverse Mie theory calculations. In addition to over twenty functions for Mie theory calculations, it contains an implementation of a highly visual method for solving the inverse Mie problem for the complex refractive index, given known or assumed size parameter and optical measurements. It is open-source, fully documented, and now being used by researchers from over 50 Institutes world wide.</p>\n<p>Finally, on the outreach and broader impacts section of this project, we co-developed middle school course modules on weather, climate, and energy concepts and applications.

Approximately 700 middle school students enrolled in four middle schools were administered the modules as part of their earth sciences curriculum.
