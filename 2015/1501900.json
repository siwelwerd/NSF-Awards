 "awd_abstract_narration": "Northeastern University is awarded a grant by the NSF Faculty Early Career\r\nDevelopment (CAREER) Program to develop statistical and computational\r\ntools for functional proteomics, metabolomics and ionomics. The\r\nproposed research will address three inter-related aims: (1) Accurate\r\nidentifications and quantifications of proteins, metabolites and ions\r\nfrom high-throughput experiments, which generate sparse data in form\r\nof mass and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra; (2) Joint\r\ninterpretation and integration of these sparse heterogeneous datasets;\r\nand (3) Optimal design of global and targeted follow-up experiments.\r\nThe proposed program is innovative in that it closely accounts for the\r\nbiological and technological characteristics of proteomics,\r\nmetabolomics and ionomics. As the result, it will increase the\r\nsensitivity, accuracy, and scope of interpretation of the\r\ninvestigations. The utility of the developed methods of statistical\r\ninference, and of the associated open-source software, will be\r\ndemonstrated on functional screens of S. cerevisiae, which integrate\r\nheterogeneous transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic and ionomic\r\ndatasets.\r\n \r\nThe proposed program will contribute to bridging the communication gap\r\nbetween biologists, chemists and statisticians. The project will promote the\r\ncomputational thinking, and the appropriate use of statistical\r\nmethodology, by making available case studies that are relevant to the\r\nuser community, by offering interdisciplinary tutorials and short\r\ncourses at scientific meetings and interdisciplinary courses at\r\nPurdue, and by providing mentoring for graduate and undergraduate students across\r\ndepartments.",
