 "awd_abstract_narration": "American society is experiencing an influx of \"post-9/11\" military veterans returning from war.  Sociologists understand civilian reentry as the process of leaving the military and integrating into civilian institutions and communities.  On the surface, popular rhetoric to support the troops and initiatives like Joining Forces suggest that veterans enjoy strong institutional and public support.  Nevertheless, research suggests that many veterans still struggle to connect with employment, housing, and other institutional resources.  Although there is little academic research on veterans' social reintegration, reports from national surveys, war memoirs, journalists, and others reveal perceptions of a military-civilian gap.  Historically, scholars have struggled to identify the mechanisms underlying differences between veterans and civilians in employment, educational attainment, and other outcomes.  This project examines the disjuncture between proclaimed and experienced support for veterans by focusing on one critical aspect of civilian reentry: the exchange of military-related information when veterans present themselves as candidates for institutional and social opportunities.  \r\n\r\nA survey experiment simulates gatekeeping scenarios to test how a national sample of the American public normatively evaluates veteran candidates with different military backgrounds.  Interviews and document analysis capture how 50 post-9/11 veterans recount navigating these normative contours; specifically, how they translate and tailor their military information when seeking work, applying for college, pursuing romantic interests, and meeting the families of potential life partners. This study builds on previous research by offering data on how veterans and gatekeepers shape gatekeeping outcomes during civilian reentry.  Findings can inform veterans on how disclosing different aspects of one's military service may influence the success of their efforts and how other veterans have navigated these challenges.  Policymakers and programmers working on reintegration initiatives will gain clarification in what contributes to veteran candidates' desirability (or stigmatization) and how veterans are selecting and attempting opportunities after returning from war, and the research contributes to more general social science interest in impression management in interaction.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis study examined how different understandings of military service shape the professional and social reintegration experiences of post-9/11 veterans.  Forty-two in-depth interviews with veterans, nine months of observing veteran communities, and a national survey experiment with members of the American public revealed that veterans and civilians latch on to different facets of military service to make sense of someone?s military past.  I call these varied interpretations of what being a veteran means, \"institutional legacies,\" since, accurate or not, they influence where and how post-9/11 veterans reintegrate into civilian society.\n\nIn describing their pathways through the military, veterans focused on transformative aspects of military service, helping them develop professionalism, a greater sense of purpose, and skills that occasionally felt out of place in college and at work.  In recounting their social reintegration experiences, transformation was less important than what others projected onto your service.  Veterans reported an overall lack of understanding in the non-military, or civilian, population about the wide range of experiences possible in the military.  Repeated questions about killing and negative stereotypes about veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress added further strain to these interactions, leading some respondents to withdraw from civilian peers.\n\nTo examine the credentialing aspects of military service among veterans, I triangulated interviews with nine months of observing three student veteran communities in a northeastern city.  Findings showed that social interactions among veterans were loosely structured by military-based power and status hierarchies that respondents recreated in their civilian lives.  Veterans used information about military occupations, deployments, and special assignments to infer how much danger, secrecy, and lethality others had experienced in the military.  The more risk-taking and unpredictability inferred from someone?s military records, the more respect and social support he or she received from veteran peers.\n\nThe study concluded by turning to the perspectives of the American public.  I used a national survey experiment to test how post-9/11 military veterans are judged as potential co-workers, classmates, and suitors.  The predominantly civilian sample had generally favorable views towards the hypothetical veterans profiled in the study &ndash; that is, unless the veteran had joined the military for personal reasons (e.g., to avenge 9/11) or had killed an enemy combatant on a deployment.  Considering the military exists, in part, to enact controlled violence on behalf of the country, these findings suggest a need for increased awareness about the roles that the military can and should fulfill.  The experiment also showed that hypothetical veteran candidates were less welcomed in inner social circles (e.g., dating a best female friend or dating the respondent?s daughter) than in schools or places of employment.  But civilian reentry involves more than professional pursuits; like anyone else, returning veterans seek companionship with others.  Future work is needed to understand how veterans navigate these social minefields and how they negotiate potentially conflicting understandings of their military pasts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/22/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexis Pang"
