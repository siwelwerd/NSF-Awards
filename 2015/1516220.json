 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will address a key feature of an organism's response  to DNA damage that permits it to survive and divide.  Cells as diverse as yeast and humans package their DNA with proteins called histones. One particular chemical modification of histone allows cells to recognize, respond to and repair damage to DNA.  However, this histone modification is present in some parts of the DNA but absent in others, and the regions lacking this special modification have a reduced response to damaged DNA.  This project will determine how this particular modification is excluded from some histones, and what role this exclusion has in normal cell growth.  The outcomes of this work will greatly improve our understanding of how humans and other organisms respond to environmental insults that damage DNA, and provide a vehicle for training graduate students in the thinking and practice of science.  This project will also provide undergraduate students with their first experience in scientific research beyond the classroom, and with real-world applications of their science, technology and math skills before entering the work force. \r\n\r\nTelomeres are the regions at the ends of chromosomes, and the manner in which the stable telomere ends are distinguished from the unstable ends generated by double-strand breaks elsewhere in chromatin is a fundamental question in the fields of genome integrity and chromosome biology.  While double-strand breaks cause growth arrest and promote genomic instability by DNA recombination, telomeres have functions that allow continuous cell growth and the complete replication of the chromosome end.  Telomeres are composed of DNA repeat tracts bound by specific proteins, and previous studies have focused on the role of telomere proteins in suppressing recombination and cell cycle arrest.  However, recent work in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has implicated an epigenetic modification in this process.  Specifically, a key feature that prevents damaged telomeres with bound DNA damage response proteins from causing cell cycle arrest is the lack of dimethylation of histone H4 lysine 20 (H4K20me2) in nucleosomes near the telomere DNA.  The H4K20me2 modification is conserved from S. pombe to mammals, and its absence near telomeres is thought to allow them to incur damage and still allow cell growth, making telomeres a DNA damage checkpoint-exempt region of the genome.  How telomeres exclude H4K20me2 is unknown.  This project will advance our understanding of H4K20me2 exclusion using a rapidly inducible telomere formation system in S. pombe.  This system will be used to determine how the H4K20me2-free state is established.  Defining how much of the chromosomal end excludes H4K20me2 has important implications for the portions of the genome exempt from DNA damage-induced arrest, and also for our understanding of how cells regulate genome stability. Using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation and genetic approaches, this project will determine if the H4K20me2-free state is restricted to telomeres, or also spreads into the adjacent chromatin.",

The work was performed by a graduate student, two postdoctoral fellows, a technician and several summer undergraduates.&nbsp; Additional work was performed in a collaboration with Dr. Art Lustig's laboratory at Tulane University in New Orleans. &nbsp;Graduate students and postdocs are trained in lab work, presentation and mentoring summer undergraduates, which enhances their grasp of the subjects they teach and provides them with valuable experience to use in their future careers in academics, research or industry.&nbsp; This grant supported 7 publications in the areas of DNA repair and telomere function, and had broad impact in the field, as shown by one collaborative publication where the Ishikawa lab in Japan who used our tool in their work.&nbsp; At least one other lab in our field has requested these tools for their own studies.</p>\n<p>A fundamental question in the fields of genome integrity and chromosome biology is why telomeres, the physical ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes, are stable ends while internal double-strand breaks are not.&nbsp; DNA double-strand breaks promote genomic instability by DNA recombination and cause growth arrest by activating cell cycle checkpoints, but telomeres are stable and allow continuous cell growth.&nbsp; Telomeres are composed of DNA repeat tracts bound by specific proteins that \"cap\" the chromosome end to prevent its degradation and block checkpoint activation. &nbsp;This project investigated how telomeres accomplish these functions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We developed a telomere formation system to leverage the powerful molecular genetics in the model system <em>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</em>.&nbsp; Briefly, the system allows the experimenter to rapidly induce a DNA break at a defined place in the chromosome.&nbsp; If sequences from telomeres are present (termed a \"proto-telomere\", Figure 1B), a new telomere can form and protect the chromosome end.&nbsp; If not, the DNA on both sides of the break is degraded (Figure 1A), causing DNA damage that results in cell death or chromosome rearrangements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We used this system to probe how fast the proto-telomere became a new telomere, based on how fast the cut proto-telomere could protect the end of the chromosome from degradation and change the expression of genes near the telomere.&nbsp; We found that the protective telomere functions occurred immediately (Figure 2).&nbsp; However, other changes occurred more slowly.&nbsp; Genes near telomeres are turned off by forming a DNA-protein structure called heterochromatin, which spreads inward from the telomere end towards the middle for about 0.5% the length of the chromosome.&nbsp; This heterochromatin spreading (the red bar in Figure 2) was slow and formed a dynamic structure that contracted and expanded as cells grew.&nbsp; We could visualize this spreading using the <em>ade6<sup>+</sup></em> gene.&nbsp; Cells that lack the <em>ade6</em> gene form dark red colonies (Figure 3) while cells that have it form white colonies.&nbsp; When the only copy of the <em>ade6<sup>+</sup></em> gene was placed at different distances from the telomere, we could see the spreading of heterochromatin in a colony.&nbsp; When a single cell cuts the proto-telomere and grows to form a colony, the cells are white because the heterochromatin has not spread to the <em>ade6<sup>+ </sup></em>gene.&nbsp; When spreading occurs, the <em>ade6<sup>+</sup></em> gene is turned off and red cells now grow at the edges of the colony.&nbsp; When the <em>ade6<sup>+</sup></em> gene is close to the telomere (Figure 3, 4 kb or 4000 base pairs from the telomere), spreading occurs quickly so the colonies are mostly dark red with white centers.&nbsp; When <em>ade6<sup>+</sup></em> is further from the telomere (16 kb or 16,000 base pairs), the white centers are much larger with smaller red portions near the colony edge (Figure 3).&nbsp; These red sectors where <em>ade6</em> is off can have white sectors inside them, which means <em>ade6<sup>+</sup></em> was turned back on.&nbsp; Turning on means that the heterochromatin that turned off the <em>ade6</em> gene in red cells contracted so that the <em>ade6</em> gene was no longer covered by heterochromatin and could be expressed.&nbsp; Thus, this system allows us to see the ebb and flow of heterochromatin spreading that comes from the newly formed telomere.</p>\n<p>In addition to this published work, this NSF project allowed 6 other publications on the repair of other forms of double strand breaks, the function of a specific telomere protein that prevents telomere degradation, how modifications of a DNA binding protein affect the cell's ability to detect a DNA break, the genes involved in preventing chromosome translocations and a review on telomere evolution.&nbsp; Finally, our results led to a hypothesis to explain how telomeres are distinguished from internal DNA double-strand breaks, which we are currently testing.&nbsp; Our results will provide fundamental scientific insights into the maintenance of genome integrity from yeast to humans.</p>\n<!--  /* Font Definitions */  @font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\";
