The research team will study atmospheric physics using small unmanned airborne systems (UAS). Oklahoma State University, the project lead, is collaborating with the University of Oklahoma, the University of Nebraska, and the University of Kentucky. The interdisciplinary project team includes researchers with expertise in robotics, autonomous control, unmanned aircraft systems, atmospheric physics, and numerical weather prediction. Education, outreach, and workforce development activities include public education about UAS technology and its policy implications, educational workshops on locally specific applications of UAS technology, and rapid dissemination tools for communicating and responding to severe weather threats and hazards. The project will support interdisciplinary collaborations among early career faculty in the three jurisdictions.\r\n  \r\nTechnical description\r\nThis RII Track-2 FEC collaborative research team will develop and test easily-deployable UAS-based remote sensing systems to characterize the Earth?s lower atmospheric boundary layer. Research topics include meteorological convection, storm-scale microphysics, airborne sensing of soil hydrology, infrasonic sensing of environmental phenomena, and local-scale temporal and spatial climate variation. The research team will also investigate cooperative control of UAS formations, spatially distributed data from moving sensor platforms, and heterogeneous autonomous systems. Expected outcomes from this project include complete UAS system packages suitable for measuring wind, atmospheric chemistry, soil moisture, and thermodynamic parameters. \r\n\r\n*Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research",

The multi-university team included atmospheric scientists, meteorologists, engineers, computer scientists, geographers, and chemists necessary to evaluate the needs and develop the advanced sensing and imaging, robust autonomous navigation, enhanced data communication, and data management capabilities required to use SUAS in atmospheric physics. The project focused on benefits obtained through the use of drones in low altitudes in the region known as the atmospheric boundary layer, where current observations are lacking but most of the weather humans interact with occurs. Annual integrated evaluation of the systems was conducted in coordinated field tests in Oklahoma and Colorado, including national and international partners. The team also advanced public policy related to adoption of SUAS technology and integration of unmanned aircraft into the airspace. The project added valuable infrastructure and institutional expertise to the team members' and combined partners' existing expertise and capabilities in atmospheric and meteorological observations, SUAS development, and STEM outreach and education, from which future scientific and technical developments in these areas will be developed.</p>\n<p>The project impacted over 100 undergraduate and graduate students through direct hands on research experiences including summer field campaigns. The team members conducted numerous outreach activities to K-12 and underserved student populations in tribal and Appalachian regions, which are particularly impacted by poor and limited forecasting capabilities and will be served by future improvements in weather forecasting through atmospheric observational innovations using drone technology. In addition to the technical and scientific goals, an additional primary long-term impact from the CLOUD-MAP project is the indelible multidisciplinary scientific and educational collaboration of the early-career faculty who were involved.
