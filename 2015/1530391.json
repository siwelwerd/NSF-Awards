The meeting will bring together a broad spectrum of scientists, engineers, and program managers to review impacts of ionospheric phenomena and space weather events. \r\n\tThis year the National RF Ionospheric Interactions (RFII) Workshop will be combined with the IES2015. The focus of the RFII workshop is the interaction of high-power RF waves from ground-based transmitters with the ionospheric plasma and resultant phenomena such as the generation of ELF waves, ionospheric irregularities, and induced optical emissions. There is a community of researchers dedicated to understanding these effects and an annual meeting provides a forum for communicating their results.",
