 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Major Research Instrumentation award is for the development of the Polarimetric Advanced Imaging Radar (PAIR).  PAIR will be a truck-mounted weather radar system capable of extremely fast updates and the ability to observe advanced characteristics of raindrops and snowflakes.  The radar will be a phased-array system, which has traditionally been used by the military but is now gaining broader usage by the weather radar community.  The radar will combine some of the best attributes of current mobile radar systems, such as very fast scanning, high-resolution, and dual-polarimetry into one system.  Radar uses will include studies of tornadoes, supercell thunderstorms, lightning, hurricanes, radar data assimilation into computer models, and even radar aeroecology, which is the study of the movement of birds and insects through the air.  The broader impacts of the project on society will come through increased knowledge of severe weather which will result in better warnings to alert the public of hazardous conditions.  Students will gain hands-on engineering experience to go along with a background in meteorological science.  The participation of underrepresented groups will be assured through partnerships with the University of Puerto Rico, Mayaguez and the OU American Indians in Science & Engineering Society (AISES) chapter.\r\n\r\nPAIR will be a phased-array radar system capable of electronic scanning in the azimuth and a floodlight mode in the vertical where a 20\u00b0 fan beam would be transmitted.  PAIR seeks to bridge the gap between existing systems by providing the highest sector volume update rate, simultaneous dual-polarimetric estimates, and the highest native range resolution of current mobile radars, while maintaining an effective beamwidth of 1.5\u00b0.  The radar will be used for the scientific topics mentioned above as well as more fundamental topics in weather radar technology and polarimetric phased array systems.",

The community has been advocating radar observations with high temporal resolution of 5-10 seconds to better capture and characterize the evolution of fast-evolving weather to advance our understanding and further improve warning lead time of those events.

On the other hand, the imaging technique offered by the advanced phased array radar can achieve both high temporal resolution and good data quality by forming simultaneous multiple beams digitally. This has been proven by the X-band single polarization Atmospheric Imaging Radar (AIR) developed in the Advanced Radar Research Center (ARRC), University of Oklahoma. Leveraging on the successful experience of AIR, this project designs, develops, and commissions the next generation Polarimetric Atmospheric Imaging Radar (PAIR). PAIR can provide polarimetric observations with extremely fast update times of 6-10 seconds for a volume of 20 degrees in elevation and 360 degrees in azimuth, comparing to 60 seconds or longer for most other mobile weather radars with pencil beam operation. The mobile platform has<em>&nbsp;</em>the unique capability of providing high spatial resolution by sampling the storm at close ranges with those simultaneous narrow beamwidths, and can match the temporal resolution gained by the imaging techniques. Moreover, the PAIR architecture offers versatile operation for scientific explorations. For example, PAIR can easily switch between pencil beam and imaging operations to optimize radar performance. PAIR can also offer various polarization modes to explore microphysics in the storms. PAIR also addresses several engineering challenges such as cross polarization isolation and calibration for C-band phased array system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The fast updates and flexible scanning offered by the PAIR can enable many research areas such as tornadogenesis, hurricane, cloud electrification, hailstorm formation, microbursts, boundary layer research, etc. PAIR provides not only a unique opportunity to advance sciences, but also an ideal platform for engineering research such as waveform design, digital beamforming, adaptive scanning, etc. The development of PAIR and lesson learned have been disseminated in conferences and workshops hosted by both engineering and meteorological societies. Even though this is an engineering development project, two PhD students were involved in the antenna design and performance test. One MS student has participated in the development of beam synthesis for PAIR. Moreover, PAIR is designed to be a shared facility and its capability and availability will be continually promoted to the community.
