The objective of this workshop is to bring together professionals from academia, industry, and government in areas of hydraulic fracturing and environmental impact to exchange ideas and discuss potentially improved methods of hydraulic fracturing and sustainable remedial technologies, and to identify important directions for future research. The workshop is scheduled for April 20-21, 2015 at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock. It will include a series of keynote talks, presentations, and panel discussions, categorized into four groupings: 1) Development of better green hydraulic fracturing fluids, 2) Understanding and prediction of transport and fate of fracturing fluid components, 3) Characteristics and behavior of fracturing fluids and green alternatives, and 4) Sustainable remedial and containment technologies to reduce environmental impact of fracturing fluids on ground and surface water. A website and publication will disseminate the results of the workshop.\r\n\r\nThis workshop seeks to facilitate research to mitigate potential environmental impacts from fracturing operations. The workshop will provide a forum for researchers from industry, academia, and government to present their current findings and exchange ideas for future development. The workshop will identify potential directions for the efforts of the research community to improve hydraulic fracturing and reduce potential adverse impact on water quality. As final products of the workshop, a website and publications will be made available not only to the research community and students, but also to the general public.",
