 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through this award, funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Division of Chemistry, Prof. Scott Rychnovsky and his research group from the University of California, Irvine, are developing a straightforward method to assign the absolute configuration of molecules.  Complex molecules may exist in two possible mirror-image forms, and the two mirror-image molecules interact with proteins, carbohydrates and other biological molecules to produce different results.  Most modern pharmaceutical agents are composed of only a single mirror image molecule with the best properties, and similarly natural products are isolated as one of two possible mirror images.  Assigning molecules to the correct mirror image structure (configuration) is an important step in the developing new pharmaceutical agents, studying new natural product molecules, and in understanding their interactions with cells, animals, humans and other living creatures.\r\n\r\nThe award supports development of the Competing Enantioselective Conversion (CEC) strategy for assigning the configuration of molecules. The new molecule is evaluated by measuring rates of reaction against two enantiomeric (mirror image) catalysts or reagents.  Kinetic resolution catalysts are ideal because they react with high enantioselectivity, showing significant rate differences between a matched case and a mismatched case. By measuring the rate or conversion of an enantiopure molecule against the two enantiomers of the reagent, the fast-reacting reagent can be identified.  Comparison with known examples allows the absolute configuration of the molecule to be assigned.  The program focuses on developing a highly sensitive method for alcohols, a high-throughput method for alcohols, and an improved method for amines.  A new reaction is being investigated to assign the configuration of oxiranes. The complementary methods that are being developed for amines, oxiranes and alcohols will make the determination of absolute configuration a straightforward process in organic chemistry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n   The goal of the project was to develop new tools for determining the absolute configuration of molecules. Many molecules can exist in a right-handed or left-handed forms, and these two different forms have different properties.  (Molecules that have this property are called chiral.) Often pharmaceutical agents exist in these two forms, where the left-handed form may be active and the right-handed form may lead to side effects.  Identifying absolute configuration is essential to understanding the structure and properties of molecules, and is a necessary step in pharmaceutical research.\n\n   The new strategy we have developed is the Competing Enantioselective Conversion (CEC) method.  In this method, the enantiopure target molecule will be reacted with left-handed and right-handed forms of a chiral reagent.    The fast-reacting form will be identified and comparisons with benchmark compounds will allow the unknown configuration (handedness) of the target molecule to be assigned.  Learning which reaction is faster is accomplished by an analytical method to assess the amount of product formed in the two reactions.  Three different analytical methods have been use in our CEC methods: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy, Electrospray Mass Spectroscopy, and Thin Layer Chromatography.  The latter two methods are more sensitive than the former, and this advantage was exploited to improve the sensitivity of the analysis. The CEC method is an improvement over classic methods for absolute configuration assignment, both in terms of time required and the simplicity of the analysis. The new CEC method is very sensitive, and can be used to determine the configuration of a few micrograms of an alcohol or an amine.  This level of sensitivity is a dramatic improvement over other methods used to assign configuration.\n\n   The Competing Enantioselective Conversion method is relatively simple to perform, and it has been developed into a laboratory experiment for the introductory organic chemistry course at UC Irvine.  Over 6000 students have performed this lab, and the vast majority of there were able to identify the correct configuration of their test alcohol.  The details of this experiment have been published, and other universities are beginning to make use of it.  It provides an excellent starting point to explain the concept of chirality (handedness) and teach students how the handedness of molecules affects their properties.  In this way, the laboratory experiment give students a direct demonstration of the effect of chirality and serves to popularize science.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/21/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott Rychnovsky"
