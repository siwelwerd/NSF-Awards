 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will assist approximately 15 United States-based graduate students to attend the 15th IEEE/ACM International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid 2015) that will be held May 4-7, 2015. Participation in conferences such as IEEE/ACM CCGrid is an extremely important part of graduate student research and career development, providing the opportunity for them to present their own work, attend panel and keynote speech sessions, attend doctoral symposium, interact with peers and more senior researchers, and expose themselves to leading edge work in the field of cluster, cloud and grid computing. The support requested in this proposal will enable more participation of the US-based graduate students who would otherwise be unable to attend CCGrid 2015. Women and minority candidates will be particularly encouraged to apply.\r\n\r\nThe student activities planned this year are separated into three categories: (1) Conference planning, where senior researchers who are more experienced with the conference will explain the various events at the conference and work with individual students to custom create an agenda for each student, (2) Posters and Doctoral Symposium where all students participating in this program are required to present a short talk during the conference and present a poster describing their research areas at the poster session, and (3) Lunchtime Mentorship Activities, where the students would interact with senior researchers, discussing various topics of interest with them, such as (a) how to write effective papers, (b) careers in academia, industry and national labs, and (c) paper presentation techniques. \r\n\r\nAt the end of he conference, travel grantees will be asked to write up about their experiences and what they learned from these discussions. A short report will be generated at the end of the conference explaining the full extent of these activities, and published on the conference website. A few selected students may be invited to participate in the report generation process.",
