 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program is funding Professors Anne Myers Kelley and David Kelley at the University of California at Merced to apply laser-based spectroscopic techniques and computational modeling to study mechanisms whereby light energy is converted to heat in quantum dots (QDs) which are small semiconductor structures containing hundreds to thousands of atoms.  The quantitative understanding that will be gained regarding these processes will enable the controlled chemical synthesis of QDs that are optimized for several types of technological applications.  These include efficient solar energy capture and conversion, low power dissipation artificial lighting, and laser-based biological imaging for medical diagnostics.  UC Merced is a Hispanic Serving Institution and more than half of its undergraduates are first-generation college students, and this research will actively involve both graduate and undergraduate students from traditionally underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to accurately measure and quantitatively understand the factors that determine the extent of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in nanometer sized semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) and to synthetically control the extent of EPC.  Preliminary calculations suggest that by judicious choice of materials and morphology it is possible to greatly increase or decrease the magnitude of EPC in core-shell and core-alloy-shell structures compared to single component QDs.  Both well-known and novel structures based on II-VI semiconductors are synthesized and characterized and their EPC measured through quantitative resonance Raman spectroscopy, including analysis of absolute excitation profiles, overtone intensities, and depolarization ratios,.  This study tests the hypothesis that EPC for optical phonons in polar crystals is determined largely by the amount of charge separation produced by electron-hole pair formation via the Fr\u00f6hlich mechanism, and that it can be varied by controlling the valence and conduction band energies such that the electron and hole wavefunctions have different amounts of overlap.  The novelty of this approach is to not only measure EPC accurately for specific materials but also engineer structures that permit the control of EPC.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n        Inorganic semiconductors are a class of materials that are widely employed in a variety of modern technologies.  Most of the huge advances in electronics that have occurred since the mid-20th century rely on semiconducting materials.  These materials are also widely employed in solar energy conversion, artificial lighting, and display technologies.  Many semiconductors can be produced in sub-microscopic sizes where their physical and optical properties are modified by quantum mechanical effects in interesting and useful ways.  These ?semiconductor nanocrystals? or ?quantum dots? have been studied extensively through both experimental and theoretical approaches, but much remains to be learned about them. \n\n \n\n        The technologically useful properties of semiconductors arise from the behavior of their electrons, which can be excited by electrical, thermal, or light energy.  These excited electrons can move through the material and carry electric charge, or can be de-excited to emit light.  The motions of the electrons are also influenced, often in undesirable ways, by the vibrations of the atoms that make up the semiconductor, called phonons.  The goal of this project was to better understand the interaction between electrons and phonons in semiconductor nanocrystals and to learn how to synthesize structures in which this electron-phonon coupling can be minimized.\n\n \n\n        This project employed a variety of optical techniques but focused on resonance Raman spectroscopy, a type of laser light scattering that is particularly sensitive to electron-phonon coupling.  We also employed a related and somewhat complementary technique, hyper-Raman spectroscopy, that is almost unique to our lab.  We synthesized and studied a number of types of nanocrystals including cadmium selenide, cadmium sulfide, and zinc selenide, both pure materials and heterostructures in which one material forms an inner core and the other an outer shell, in shapes that included spherical (quantum dots), tetrahedral, and thin plates (nanoplatelets).  We measured quantitative resonance Raman and, in a few cases, resonance hyper-Raman spectra using a wide range of laser wavelengths, analyzed and simulated the spectra, and carried out computational modeling of their phonons.  Much insight came from studies of nanocrystal alloys, in which two different materials are randomly mixed in a single structure.  These results greatly strengthen our hypothesis that electron-phonon coupling in binary semiconductor nanocrystals is driven largely by electrical asymmetry in charge distributions caused by alloying or by structural defects in the nanocrystal.\n\n \n\n        The research supported by this grant has been published in twelve peer-reviewed papers to date.  Many specifics were learned about the structure and dynamics of the materials studied and some new insights were gained into the spectroscopic techniques used, particularly hyper-Raman spectroscopy.  The main unifying theme is the role of structural asymmetry, which causes the electric charge to localize in one part of the nanocrystal rather than being distributed throughout the structure, in increasing the strength of coupling to phonons.  In order to minimize electron-phonon coupling, nanocrystals should be synthesized using techniques that minimize chemical or physical asymmetries.\n\n \n\n        This grant provided partial support for three postdoctoral fellows and four graduate students.  They learned a wide variety of concepts and techniques including nanocrystal synthesis, laser spectroscopy, spectroscopic theory, and computational modeling of nanocrystals.   Four undergraduate students worked part time on this project.  Aspects of this work were presented in seminars at several universities and also at American Chemical Society and American Physical Society conferences.  This research also provided some of the basis for a week-long workshop on ?Light, Lasers and Optics? that Anne Kelley organized in 2019 as part of the UC Merced Bobcat Summer STEM Academy, a ?summer day camp? for local middle school and high school students. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/02/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anne M Kelley"
