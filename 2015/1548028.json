 "awd_abstract_narration": "The commercialization of academic research begins with the invention report made to the university Technology Licensing Office (TLO).  Not all reported inventions are commercialized, raising questions about the reasons behind the decision and the potential impact on science.  This research exploits the information provided in invention disclosure forms (IDFs) submitted by faculty members to university technology transfer offices (TTOs). These are rich and under exploited data that provide a means to study commercialization in advance of patenting.  \r\n \r\nTo estimate the potential impact of orphaned inventions the project creates two matched samples. The first compares orphaned IDFs to similar inventions that were chosen for commercialization at the same university as the orphaned project.  This intra-university comparison allows a control for TTO organizational capacity and budget constraints. The second matches the sample IDFs to similar inventions commercialized at other universities or outside the university system. These comparisons permit an estimate of the potential impacts in terms of licensing revenues and firm creation of the orphaned inventions.",
