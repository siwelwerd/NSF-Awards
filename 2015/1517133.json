 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gene regulatory networks play a vital role in nearly every process of life as they are responsible for receiving environmental stimuli and translating these into activity inside the cell. In this project, the PIs will develop new strategies for computer-based modeling, and hence understanding and predicting, behavior of complex gene regulatory networks. The computer programs (algorithms) that will be developed represent a novel strategy integrating scientific discovery with computational innovation. Although the algorithm is being used to explore the gene regulatory networks of a fungal cell's response to stress it should lead to principles applicable to other biological systems. The model will be validated by comparing model predictions with data collected from experiments and this data will then be used to further refine the model. This project also includes initiatives to advance undergraduate education by employing an interdisciplinary problem-based learning approach that will be comprised of multi-state teams that also involve graduate students. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to develop a new approach for modeling gene regulatory networks. The PIs will test the hypothesis that initial experimental characterization of a network subset will permit identification of the biomolecular constituents and their connectivity, thus establishing network topology. System wide time-course measurements can then be used to refine this network into a reaction kinetic model capable of making accurate system predictions. The cell wall integrity signaling pathway of the experimentally tractable model fungus Aspergillus nidulans will serve as a model. This pathway responds to cell wall damage by activating repair mechanisms that restore cell integrity. Because protein kinases play a pivotal role in mediating cellular regulatory activities, the PIs will focus on a subset of kinases and the discovery of their associated substrates to initially assemble a rudimentary network. Subsequently the system will be experimentally perturbed for measuring its dynamic response using a robust transcriptomic, proteomic and phosphoproteomic platform. Using this data, the PIs will take a two-step approach to developing the dynamic system of coupled ordinary differential equations able to describe dynamic behavior of a model gene regulatory network. First, an ensemble approach of approximate models will be tested and refined. In the second step, the ensemble will act as the seed population for use in an evolutionary algorithm to generate a more refined and accurate model. The PIs will then validate the model by iterative comparisons of in silico predictions with experimental results.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by programs in Systems and Synthetic Biology (Directorate for Biological Sciences) and Biotechnology and Biochemical Bioengineering (Directorate for Engineering).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGene regulatory networks play a vital role in nearly every process of life and represent numerous, highly-interconnected systems. This interconnectedness makes it tremendously challenging to understand relevant, functional relationships within these networks. Yet a robust understanding of network interconnections, and the dynamic relationships between them, would provide tremendous benefit. For example, it would allow identification of network bottlenecks, which might serve as novel drug targets, and would allow rational design of beneficial cellular behaviors for strains used in the bioprocess industry. \n\nWe hypothesized that initial characterization of a subset of network constituents (i.e., nodes) and their connectivity (i.e., edges) would allow us to build mathematical models able to predict approximate system behavior.  To that end, we developed new data-drive algorithms to help determine those network constituents.\n\n \n\nThe first step in model development involved building up a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to describe the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway in a fungal system, Aspergillus nidulans.  A parser was written to take advantage of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) application programming interface (API) and download pathway data into a series of chemical reactions.  A second parser was written convert the reactions into a system of ordinary differential equations based on mass action kinetics. This approach preserved the mechanistic information as converted from network pathways to ODEs.  \n\n \n\nWe then used genetic programming (GP) to infer new edges/reactions in our reaction network.  The GP accomplished this by inferring and manipulating entire systems of ODEs based solely on time course data of a system of interest.   To help address the computational burden issue, we used a relatively new \"fast\" programming language specifically designed for scientific computing (https://julialang.org).  Julia arguably has the best ODE solver of any software platform (including Matlab and Mathematica) available at this time.  We developed code that was capable of generating multiple mechanistic models in the form of ODEs constrained by the rules of mass action kinetics, estimating parameters for each of the ODE systems based experimental data, mutating &amp; recombining models, and then evaluating the accuracy of the models using a fitness function.  We tested our algorithm on a toy model system of viral dynamics consisting of three ODEs and six parameters.  We used the original model to generate faux data.  We then used our GP algorithm to try and recapitulate the original model.  The original code took 48 hours to run.  Through the implementation of domain specific knowledge and algorithm development, the code now runs in under 12 hours and provides more accurate results.  Enhancements include (1) the use of ensembles of symbolically regressed mechanistic models, (2) reaction rate  balancing for more rapid and efficient parameter estimation, (3) the use of simulated annealing for carrying out parameter estimation, and (4) limiting the scope of reaction rates to either first or second order reactions.  The combination of these approaches represents significant progress in how to generate mechanistic understanding from dynamic (time course) data.\n\n \n\nThe intellectual merits of this work are significant.  First, it advances the ability to better understand the theoretical underpinnings of biology directly from dynamic data.  Second, the approach provides insight into the use of domain-specific heuristics as applied to a more general algorithm (genetic programming).  The result was a substantial reduction in computational time.  Finally, the approach described here is not limited to biological applications.  It has the potential to be used in other disciplines, particularly chemistry and physics, and help advance those fields.\n\n \n\nThe broader impacts of this work are also significant.  Two graduate students were trained at the intersection of chemical engineering and computational biology.  While this might appear to be a relatively small contribution, when one considers a life time of contributions to this field and the additional individuals that they may impact, the scale of this contribution is better appreciated.  More immediately, the approaches developed here have the potential to impact the biotech industry.  Specifically, these methodologies should help in better identifying drug targets, determining more efficacious therapeutic strategies, and optimizing industrial bioprocesses.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/12/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ranjan Srivastava"
