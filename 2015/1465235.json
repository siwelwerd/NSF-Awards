 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports documentation and research on Naso (also known as Teribe), an endangered Chibchan language spoken in the mountainous region of Panama that borders Costa Rica. There are approximately 500 speakers of Naso, but only a few elders are fluent users of a special form of Naso called tlokwo r\u00f6nge 'profound words'. In tlokwo r\u00f6nge, pairs of rhyming words are the basis of couplets that convey metaphors relating to local, traditional indigenous life. The grammatical and sound structure  of this poetic register has not been documented before. Other Chibchan languages spoken nearby (Bribri, Cab\u00e9car, and Kuna) are known to have similarly structured poetic language.\r\n\r\nMethods used in this project will include elicitation of phonological and grammatical properties of the 'profound words', and interviews recording speakers' intuitions about the meaning, performative context, and knowledge surrounding the origins and areal diffusion of the words. The latter point makes the study relevant to the study of difrasismos, or poetic couplets, found across Mesoamerican languages.\r\n\r\nThe broader questions addressed in this project are: What are the motivations for using parallelism in verbal art across languages of the world? What do these structures tell us about the human mind? While definite answers are not assumed to result from this project, the case study of Naso verbal art aims to advance the scientific literature by building on theoretic models within phonology and poetics. This project responds to a need to document aesthetic and rhetorical properties of natural discourse, as motivated by the apparent loss of these structures in situations of language shift.",

Furthermore, the results show that speakers agree on precise and general explanations and interpretations of what verbal art is, from specific cases to accidental but successful verbal art forms.

The deep ethnographic approach to this dissertation also can impact the field of anthropology by showing its relevance for linguistics.
