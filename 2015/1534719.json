 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical abstract:\r\nAt the heart of electronic devices lies silicon, a semiconductor material that can be made\r\npure enough for high performance and is amenable to mass production. While such\r\ncircuitry is continually improving, silicon is unable to exhibit quantum phenomena\r\nrequired for complete solutions in weather prediction, genomics, and secure encryption.\r\nA new class of materials, the so-called topological insulators, holds the promise to\r\nrealize such phenomena and revolutionize computing. Topological insulators are, in\r\ntheory, non-metallic in the interior of the material but behave like a metal at the surface.\r\nIn addition, the quantum character of these metallic electrons can be switched, which is\r\nthe basic information processing function. While known topological insulators\r\ndemonstrate the metallic surface state, these materials have not been made pure enough\r\nfor incorporating into electronic devices. Specifically, they are not yet insulating in the\r\ninterior. This project will seek to find new topological insulators and to engineer them to\r\nlevels of purity needed for an insulating interior and satisfy the performance demands of\r\nelectronic circuits. The project will impact the electronics industry as well as train\r\ngraduates skilled in the computational and experimental techniques of this new class of\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract:\r\nThe goal of the project is to create topological insulator materials that are pure enough in\r\nthe bulk to exhibit true insulating behavior. Topological insulators are found among\r\nhigh-Z atom containing semiconductors with band gaps small enough that the spin-orbit\r\ncoupling related to the large Z-number can invert the conduction and valence band.\r\nThese materials must also possess spatial inversion symmetry for the relevant orbitals.\r\nThe project will explore candidate materials classes among pseudo-binary and\r\npyrochlore-related structures containing heavy metals such as Ir, Re, and Os. Materials\r\nsynthesis by solid state chemistry techniques will be guided by simulations based on\r\ndensity functional theory. Promising candidate materials will be synthesized in single\r\ncrystal form by appropriate methods including vapor transport, zone refinement, and\r\ngrowth from flux. Crystalline specimens will be studied with angle resolved\r\nphotoemission spectroscopy and conventional charge transport techniques. Prototype\r\ntransistor devices will be fabricated on a smaller subset of these systems. The results at\r\neach measurement stage will be fed back to the theory and synthesis efforts.",
