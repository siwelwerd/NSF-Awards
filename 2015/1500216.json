 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaboration between mathematical researchers at five universities, including young mathematicians at the early stages of their careers, who are joining forces to tackle fundamental problems at the confluence of mathematical logic, algebra, and computer science. The overall goal is to deepen understanding about how to recognize the complexity of certain types of computational problems. The project focuses on a suite of mathematical problems whose solutions will yield new information about the complexity of Constraint Satisfaction Problems. These problems (CSP's) include scheduling problems, resource allocation problems, and problems reducible to solving systems of linear equations. CSP's are theoretically solvable, but some are not solvable efficiently. The research will be aimed at identifying a clear boundary between the tractable and intractable cases, and at providing efficient algorithms for solutions in the tractable cases. Many fundamental problems in mathematics and computer science can be formulated as CSP's, and progress here would have both practical and theoretical significance. A second component of the project investigates classical computational problems in algebra in order to determine whether they are algorithmically solvable. A third component of the project is the further development of the software UACalc, which is a proof assistant developed to handle computations involving algebraic structures.\r\n\r\nThe researchers shall work to decide the truth of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture of Feder and Vardi, which states that every Constraint Satisfaction Problem with a finite template is solvable in polynomial time or is NP complete. They will further develop the algebraic approach to CSP's by refining knowledge about relations compatible with weak idempotent Maltsev conditions and about algebras with finitely related clones. A second goal of the project concerns the computable recognition of properties of finite algebras connected with the varieties they generate, such as whether a finite algebra with a finite residual bound is finitely axiomatizable, or whether a finite algebra can serve as the algebra of character values for a natural duality. One of the more tangible accomplishments of this project will be a broadening and strengthening of the applicability of the UACalc software. The agenda for this part of the project includes parallelizing the important subroutines, building in conjecture-testing and search features, adding further algorithms, and further developing the community of users and contributors.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project inlvoved senoir mathematicians, post-docs, and graduate students at five universities:  Vanderbilt University, the University of Colorado, the University of Hawaii, the University of South Caroline, and Iowa State University.\n\nThe project had two main goals, one scientific and the other to support young mathematicians carrying out the early stages of their research careers.\n\nThe scientific goal was to develop applications of the methods of general algebra to attack problems at the confluence of mathematical logic and computer science.\n\nThis is a report of the part of the project carried out at the University of South Carolina. I acted as PI and the senior mathematician.  Josh Grice, who is completing his PhD under my supervision was supported as a graduate research assistant for 3 summers.  Funds from the grant supported travel to workshops and mathenatical conferences connect directly to the scientific goals of the project.\n\nThis part of the project led to nine professional refereed publications (two still in the submitted stage) and one monograph.  The most of these publications gave accounts of the research of Dr. McNulty concerning the complexity of computational or descriptive problems in equational logic.  Several of the results arose from our 5-university focus on constraint satisfaction problems in computer science. The methods developed by our 5-university team have been taken up by an international group of mathematicians and computer scientists.  Our work has shown that certain kinds of computational problems frequently encountered in practice in government, the private sector, and in academic settings have only solutions that are extremely expensive in computational resources (desirable for example in cryptography) while other methods that emerged and are being refined provided more tractable computational means to address other problems of practical interest.  We anticipate that some of these methods will be put to use in practical settings in the near future, while other will require further development.  Dr. McNulty's contributions have centered on the intractible, computationally expensive aspects of this research program.\n\nConcerning the second goal of supporting the early stages of the research careers of mathematicians, Dr. McNulty's PhD student Joshua Grice has pursued problems at the borderline of general algebra and mathematical logic.  In particular, he has investigated the fundamental build blocks (i.e. the subdirectly irreducible groups) of the equational classes of generated by finite groups.  [Finite groups have a role to play in the Standard Model of subatomic particles...]  Grice has been able to show that the subdirectly irreducible groups in equational classes generated by finite nilpotent groups can be axiomatized by  finite sets of elementary sentences.  Indeed, Grice is well on the way to a similar result for nilpotent algebras that belong to congruence modular equational classes.  Grice's work is a direct conrtribution to the scientific goals of our project and will form the basis of a solid PhD dissertation in mathematics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: George Mcnulty"
