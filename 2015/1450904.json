 "awd_abstract_narration": "TransPAC4 is a cross-organizational approach to provide services and bandwidth connecting scientific researchers in the US with their counterparts in Asia. This connectivity has an immediate impact on the research environment, and also anticipates future application and technology advances.\r\n\r\nIndiana University (IU) leads the TransPAC4 Collaboration in a cooperative partnership with Asian regional partnerships including: Asia Pacific Advanced Network (APAN), the Trans-Eurasia Information Network (TEIN), and the Delivery of Advanced Network Technology to Europe (DANTE) project. Research and Education networking partners include the Japanese National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), the Japanese National Institute of Informatics (NII), the Singapore Advanced Research and Education Network (SingAREN), and the Taiwan National Network. Domestic partners include Internet2, the Energy Sciences network (ESnet), and Pacific Wave's international peering facility.\r\n\r\nIn addition to providing high performance network capacity in the form of 10G-100G circuits and associated services, the project focuses on increasing the partnerships needed to take advantage of these links, including but not limited to growing communities in geosciences, bioinformatics, and particle physics. The TransPAC4 Collaboration expands and enhances end user engagement and operational integration in Asia-Pacific. Close cooperation among participants serves to maximize US-Asia connectivity, increase collaborations, deploy dynamic circuit services to meet the needs of high-bandwidth applications, and increase reliability through alternative circuits. The project also extends the use of Software Defined Networking (SDN)and network acceleration services.",

These included the NSF-funded TransPAC3 Los Angeles-Tokyo 10G Circuit, and two circuits operated by our partners: the China Education and Research Network (CERNET) Beijing-Los Angeles 10G Circuit and the Japanese Gigabit Network (JGN-X) 10G circuit. In Year 2, several of the earlier circuits were decommissioned when we began operating the TransPAC-PacWave 100G Circuit between Seattle and Tokyo, jointly with Pacific Wave and the Pacific NorthWest Giga Pop (PNWGP).

After an open RFP, we began operation of two 10G circuits, each provided by separate carriers on different paths for redundancy, as well as the TransPAC Hong Kong Open Exchange, which offered a neutral, open exchange point in a data facility where there were many competing options. These circuits ran until Year 7. At that time, we began work with the Guam-Singapore Connectivity Consortium (GSCC), which collaborated to support a 100G circuit between Guam and Singapore.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Separate from circuits, TransPAC4 was one of the first adopters of the NetSage infrastructure, part of the IRNC:AMI award (NSF #1540933). The use of this tool changed how we viewed the networks, from simply measuring volumes to understanding their use and usability to the research community. The project used the NetSage Dashboards extensively to support not only understanding volume metrics with the collection of SNMP but also the use of the circuits, via the various Flow Dashboards. By the end of the project, NetSage has become an integral part of many of the user engagements for the project.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>TransPAC4 also saw the evolution of the project in terms of partnerships. Prior to this award, the TransPAC team collaborated mainly with the APAN-JP team, based in Tokyo. TranPAC4 saw an extension of relationships in Asia to include eight bi-lateral MOUs. Then in December 2017, we signed our first multilateral agreement with the Asia Pacific Ring (APR) MOU, jointly with ten other organizations. At the end of the project, and primarily supported by TransPAC5, we led the development and signing of a new multilateral MOU for the Asia Pacific Oceanic Network (APOnet) Consortium, which initially included eleven organizations.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We also significantly grew our engagement with the research teams using the network. Over the life of the project, TransPAC carried traffic for 158 of 195 countries in the world. We worked with sixteen networking organizations to ensure strong performance over our circuits and their connections. In addition, we actively supported science teams in high energy physics, geoscience/climate, astronomy, biology/COVID-19 research, and other science areas. This was a new field of work for the project team. We also supported the perfSONAR measurement and monitoring tool, both through our support of the IRNC and APAN perfSONAR meshes and our on-going training offerings for the community.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We also continued the TransPAC tradition of supporting networking experiments, primarily as part of SuperComputing Conference series (SCXY) and TNC meetings. We also pursued a small amount of research on the team, including a pilot study of BGP Path Hinting and a longer-term study of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Detection.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>TransPAC4 staff attended 166 meetings in 25 countries and 20 US States, as well as many virtual meetings.
