 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact of this workshop benefits society at large. NSF SBIR Grantees sometimes\r\nhave innovations that could afford societal impact in education. This makes them candidates\r\nfor foundations that fund projects for their societal impact in education. Exposing such\r\nNSF SBIR Grantees to such foundations could serve the societal objectives of the foundations, the National Science Foundation, and also support the commercialization path of the NSF SBIR Grantees.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThere are foundations whose missions are education oriented. These foundations make grants into organizations that support the foundation?s educational missions. These missions include K12, STEM, adult learning, and workforce. These foundations seek social impact from their grant making. Raising their awareness of quality education innovation enables them to improve the societal return on their investments. Presently, the awareness of NSF SBIR portfolio and program for education by educational foundations is minimal.\r\n",
