 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to develop the technology to power a more efficient platform for the most common method of production of biological therapeutics, the Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. Each batch production cycle of a given therapeutic is large and represents a significant investment and significant profit, and any methods to increase, even incrementally, the yield of such a batch would yield great profits. Currently, these cells split their metabolic energy into producing both the therapeutic, and a protein used to select for highest producers. The proposed system utilizes the transient expression of a different kind of selection marker - one that frees significant metabolic resources to focus solely on the production of the therapeutic once the selection phase is done. Increasing yields will drive down costs, and make these treatments available to a wider demographic. The biomanufacturing companies are searching for new methods to increase product yield, and are ready to spend significant time and resources to maintain their cutting edge status and profitability.\r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop a selection method to significantly increase CHO cell biotherapeutic production. Current methods sacrifice yield because the cells must produce the selectable marker as well as the product, at a heavy burden to the cells. The proposed technology will use the transient expression of the selectable marker, glutamine synthase, tightly controlled by and active only in the presence of the gene of interest (GOI) through our structural interacting RNA (sxRNA) technology. Once the selection phase is complete, metabolic costs of selectable marker will cease and metabolic resources will go to GOI production. sxRNA links the expression of the selectable marker on an ectopic mRNA to a miRNA in the splicing product during GOI mRNA maturation. Stringency of selection is, therefore, directly proportional to GOI copy number and production. The plan is to optimize sxRNA technology through computational and empirical screens, and use the most suitable candidates in a side-by-side comparison with the traditional CHO cell glutamine synthetase system. Benchmarks for success will include assays for gene copy numbers by real-time PCR, and active product yield versus costs. Long-term stability of the GOI also will be monitored over many passages following the termination of the selection phase.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Phase I STTR focused on development of a new protocol for cell line development in an effort to improve the manufucturing economics of making biopharmaceuticals. Over $200 billion dollars? worth of biological drug products, \"biopharmaceuticals\" including antibodies, vaccines and proteins, are produced each year.  Manufacturing costs for those products is estimated at $80 billion.  The biomanufacturing process is tedious and starts by picking a single cell that produces large quantities of the desired product.  Finding that single, high producing cell from thousands or millions of others has a significant effect on the overall cost determined by the ultimate yield of product when that one cell has grown to billions of cells.  Cell line development, the process of finding that cell, is akin to aiming an arrow.  The better the aim, the more likely to hit the target.  We believe, by taking advantage of post-transcriptional regulation, that we can achieve a 20%-50% improvement in productive yield, defined as titer, as well as significant reductions in workload and time.  For perspective, a 25% improved titer from each cell in production could save $16 billion in biomanufacturing costs.\n\n \n\nOur protocol, PTSelect&trade;, uses post-transcriptional regulation as an alternative to using a drug resistance gene, but is conceptually similar.  Rather than force the cells to transcribe and translate an additional drug resistance gene that serves as a proxy for the biopharmaceutical/gene of interest (GOI) expression, we introduce a custom short interfering RNA (siRNA) into an intron upstream of the GOI.  Expression of the tethered siRNA and GOI is thus directly coupled making future selection potentially more accurate. We then use mRNA to perform selection with an mRNA has sequences that are perfectly complementary to the siRNA to induce RNA interference (RNAi) ultimately down regulating the death gene mRNA. Thus, the more the GOI is produced, the more the siRNA is also produced which results in more degradation of the mRNA.  Instead of adding a chemical to select for resistance, we transfect a death gene encoding mRNA into the cells, or a fluorescent marker than identifies desired cells using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), or a cell surface marker gene mRNA coupled with magnetic-bead-Ab to perform magnetically activated cell sorting (MACS).\n\n \n\nDuring the Phase I, we demonstrated proof of concept that our selection protocol can be used to select cells producing a GOI.  We evaluated several strategies for controlling stringency and the variables to the components of PTSelect&trade;, such as the intron sequences surrounding the siRNA, the RNAi sequences on the mRNA, and more.  We were able to show that we can kill cells that are not producing the GOI with increasing stringency and enrich the population for positive cells as well as identify high producing cells using fluorescence activated cell sorting.\n\n \n\nCompared to current techniques, PTSelect?s value propositions include: (1) increasing the titer of GOI by eliminating the need for cells to produce a selection protein during production, (2) rapid selection of cells that produce high titers of GOI, (3) increasing the accuracy of selection by directly using an siRNA co-transcribed with the GOI rather than a marker protein that has a different promoter on the same plasmid, (4) potentially adding a non-coding RNA that may have positive physiological effects during production, and (5) a technique that can be integrated into the established processes and does not require a change in cells lines or investment in additional capital equipment.\n\n \n\nOur initial target is biomanufacturing of biopharmaceuticals.  Even small incremental enhancements in production yield obtained during biomanufacturing, would have a large economic impact on manufacturing costs.  In addition, significant reductions in cost, workload and time needed should also be achievable. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward S Eveleth"
