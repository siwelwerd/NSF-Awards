 "awd_abstract_narration": "Undergraduate Research Experience (URE) programs have positive effects on student understanding of the nature of science, motivation, and academic performance. However, little is understood about how UREs affect students' views of research, their identities as researchers, and their beliefs about knowledge in engineering. Investigating students' researcher identities and beliefs about knowledge (epistemic beliefs) in the context of URE is important because they shape the students' perceptions, values, and interactions with others, which can then be translated to their classes and future careers. The outcomes of this study help develop meaningful ways for students to engage, function, and learn in research spaces as well as classrooms and laboratories. Findings also expand theories about identity and epistemic beliefs in ways that are specific to engineering fields. The goal of the project is to address the challenge of producing engineers who are well-equipped to tackle complex, ill-defined, and open-ended problems similar to those encountered when doing research. The results enable engineering educators to provide novel educational experiences, developing students as future researchers and engineers such that these experiences will have long term impacts. The project's broader impacts include benefits to fields beyond engineering that engage students in research. Also, by including diverse student populations in the study, a deeper understanding is gained about how students from different backgrounds, engineering fields, and types of institutions experience and benefit from participating in research.\r\n\r\nThe overarching research question for this project is: How do undergraduate engineering students develop their identities as researchers and their ways of knowing engineering through research experiences?  There are four specific aims of this project. The first is to understand how undergraduate engineering students conceptualize and construct what it means to be a researcher. The second is to discover what factors the students think affect their researcher identity development. The third is to find out how these students describe what it means to know something in their fields. The fourth is to understand how students form their beliefs about the nature of knowledge and knowing during research experiences. A grounded theory approach is used to expand existing identity and epistemic belief frameworks to develop a theory within the context of research experiences in engineering. The three-phase study uses open-ended surveys and interviews to identify themes that answer the research aims and can be used to develop workshops. The intellectual merit of the project lies in developing an engineering-specific learning theory based on students' beliefs about ways of knowing and their identities as researchers. This theory is used to inform and work with engineering educators to find ways to apply research findings in engineering degree programs and UREs.  Workshops for engineering educators focus on ways to incorporate the aspects of UREs that help build students' ways of knowing and their identities as participants in their research communities and their engineering fields.",

Epistemology is a term that means understanding knowledge, where it comes from, who creates it, and what it means to know something. Although undergraduate research experience (URE) programs have been well-researched in terms of their effects on student learning, motivation, and academic performance, little is understood about how UREs affect students? views of research, being researchers, and understanding of knowledge in their field (epistemologies). The research skills that students develop through UREs align with important aspects of their beliefs about knowledge and practices in engineering (epistemic beliefs). This project aimed to understand how undergraduate engineering students conceptualize and construct what it means to be a researcher, and to identify what these students perceive to be the factors that affect their view of themselves as researchers. At the same time, the project aimed to understand how these students conceptualize and interpret the nature of knowledge and knowing in their field, and how those beliefs develop within the contexts of UREs.&#8239;The main outcome of this project was the Dynamics of Researcher Identity Epistemological Model (DRIEM), which visualized our project findings.</p>\n<p>DRIEM incorporates four main take-aways about researcher identity: 1) Students? dispositions and beliefs about who a researcher is influences their perceptions of researchers and themselves as a researcher (researcher identity), 2) Researcher identity can dissolve or solidify, 3) Researcher identity affects and is affected by reflection on research practices, and 4) Social interactions and context shape knowledge of research and researchers, researcher identity, and interest in research. Epistemic thinking is embedded throughout the reflective pathways in which students process knowledge and their research experiences. Reflection itself is a skill that is essential for forming student knowledge about how research works and about how knowledge is constructed in research. Another outcome for this project was a ?research-with-practice? cycle in which we developed and conducted multiple workshops with engineering instructors, aiming to collaboratively translate the research-based DRIEM into educational practice. Workshop participants generated ideas for applying DRIEM in classroom contexts in specific ways, such as: having students rephrase problems; intentional word choice for assignments (for example, asking students to report on their ?findings? or ?results? rather than a ?solution?); have students share their findings (for example, poster sessions or lightning talks within a course); and online reflection assignments that require students to explicitly think about how course activities relate to elements of DRIEM (for example, what a researcher does or how knowledge is created within their field). From these workshop discussions and brainstorming, five themes emerged for applying the research outcomes from this project into educational practice: enhance students? perspectives on obtaining and using knowledge; be intentional about classroom discussions of knowledge; encourage students to share their findings; focus on responsive teaching and assessment that enhances students? processes to build and use knowledge; and introduce research as a viable educational activity for students. Perhaps the most transformative feedback from workshop participants were their points of confusion about DRIEM itself, particularly with respect to terminology related to students? epistemic beliefs and practices. Thus these workshops served to not simply translate research to practice, or even propagate research findings to educators, but rather as a ?research-with-practice? phase in which researchers received and enacted feedback on how research findings were represented, visualized and explained.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/09/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lisa&nbsp;C&nbsp;Benson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1531607/1531607_10396927_1602275720764_Figure1_analyticprocess--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1531607/1531607_10396927_1602275720764_Figure1_analyticprocess--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Research Process\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1531607/1531607_10396927_1602275720764_Figure1_analyticprocess--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Research Process\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Overview of the analytic process to develop DRIEM.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Faber, C.
