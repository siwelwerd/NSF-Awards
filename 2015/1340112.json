Stevenson (New York Botanical Garden), Sinisa Todorovic and Eugene Zhang (Oregon State University), Elizabeth Arnaud (Bioversity International/CGIAR, France), Christopher Mungall (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory)\r\n \r\nSenior Personnel: Barry Smith (University at Buffalo), Georgios V. Gkoutos and John Doonan (University of Aberystwyth, UK).\r\n\r\nPlant researchers must be able to quickly search for genetic information from a wide range of online databases. Unfortunately, the researchers who originally provided the data and those who are analyzing it often use inconsistent terminology, making keyword searches less effective. To remedy this problem, the project will develop common gene annotation standards and a universal vocabulary of plant biology and diseases. It will also draw up standards and workflows for the creation and curation of such terminology. Additionally, it will develop a web portal and data warehouse to host this shared vocabulary and related annotation information to enable access by the broader plant community.\r\n\r\nThis project will create a centralized platform where reference ontologies for plants will be used to access cutting-edge data resources for analyzing plant traits, phenotypes, diseases, genomes, genetic diversity and gene expression data across a wide range of plant species. It will empower researchers to build hypotheses and discover, query, and analyze plant genomics data to address complex questions that would not otherwise be tractable.  Ultimately, plant breeders can use this information to develop higher-yielding, more nutritious crops that tolerate stress and resist disease. As an educational component, the project team will reach out to K-12 and undergraduate students and the plant research community. Through this project, the scientific community will be able to contribute genetic annotation data to the warehouse via a collaborative web site that will also provide multiple ways to analyze and download data and other resources.",

The Common Reference Ontologies and Applications for Plant Biology (cROP aka Planteome) project, an international collaborative effort, is developing tools and data infrastructure to support the standardized description, analysis and exchange of data from a growing number of plant genomics and phenomics projects. The Planteome project has developed a suite of reference ontologies (common standardized descriptors) to harmonize data annotations that facilitate data integration, search and discovery. It developed and maintained reference Plant Ontology (PO), Plant Trait Ontology (TO), Plant Experimental Conditions Ontology (PECO) and crop-specific application Crop Ontologies (CO) with help from major plant genomics consortia, as well as large scale phenotyping and genome annotation projects representing a wide range of plant species. The project&rsquo;s web portal (<a href=\"http://www.planteome.org/\">www.planteome.org</a>) and novel data warehouse host and serve these reference ontologies and the associated annotated data. It also provides tools for data analysis, visualization, semantic reasoning, and community-based curation. The online portal and the data repository are the primary plant community source for ontology-enabled analysis of annotated plant genomics data. The project engaged students in ontology exploration, bioinformatics data analysis, software development and classroom STEM learning in plant biology and informatics. We also engaged plant biologists through face-to-face workshops, exhibits and online webinars, focusing on fostering ontology and data standards training, adoption and community curation of data and genome annotation.</p>\n<p>The Planteome project is the primary reference resource for development, maintenance, sharing and distribution of ontologies for plant biology.
