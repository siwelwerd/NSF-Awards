 "awd_abstract_narration": "Legged robots have captured the imagination of society at large, through\r\nentertainment and through the dissemination of research findings.  Yet,\r\ntoday's reality of what (bipedal) legged robots can do falls short of\r\nsociety's vision.  A big part of the reason is that legged robots are\r\nviewed as surrogates for humans, able to go wherever humans can as aids\r\nor as assistants where it might also be too dangerous or risky.  It is\r\nin the expectation of robustness and walking facility that today's\r\nresearch hits its limits, especially when the terrain has granular\r\nproperties.  Impeding progress is the lack of a holistic approach to the\r\ncyber-physical modeling and control of legged robots.  The vision of\r\nthis work is to unite experts in granular mechanics, optimal control,\r\nand learning theory in order to define a methodology for advancing\r\ncyber-physical systems (CPS) involving a tight coupling of the physical with\r\nthe cyber through dynamic interactions that must be learned online.  The\r\nproposed work will advance the science of cyber-physical systems by more\r\nexplicitly tying sensing, perception, and computing to the optimization\r\nand control of physical systems whose properties are variable and\r\nuncertain.  Achieving reliable, adaptive legged locomotion over terrain\r\nwith arbitrary granular properties would transform several application\r\ndomain areas of robotics; e.g., disaster response, agricultural and\r\nindustrial robotics, and planetary robotics.  More broadly, the same\r\ntools would apply to related CPS with regards to terrain aware\r\nexoskeleton and rehabilitation prosthetics for persons with missing,\r\nnon-functional, or injured legs, as well as to energy networks with\r\ntime-varying, nonlinear dynamics models.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe CPS platform to be studied is that of a bipedal robot locomoting\r\nover granular ground material with uncertain physical properties (sand,\r\ngravel, dirt, etc.).  The proposed work seeks to overcome current\r\nimpediments to reliable legged locomotion over uncertain terrain type,\r\nwhich fundamentally relies on the controlled interaction of the robot's\r\nfeet with the physical environment.  The research goal is to improve the\r\nperception and control of legged locomotion over granular media for the\r\nexpress purpose of achieving robust, adaptive, terrain-aware locomotion.\r\nIt revolves around the hypothesis that simple models with decent\r\npredictive performance and low computational overhead are sufficient for\r\nthe optimal control formulations as the compute-constrained adaptive\r\nsubsystem will both learn and classify the peculiarities of the terrain\r\nonline.  The main research objectives will involve: [1] a validated\r\nco-simulation platform for legged robot movement over granular media;\r\n[2] terrain-dependent, stable gait generation and gait transition\r\nstrategies via optimal control; [3] online, compute-constrained learning\r\nof granular interactions for adaptation and terrain classification; and\r\n[4] validated contributions using experimental testbeds involving\r\nvariable and unknown (to the robot) granular media.  Given the high\r\nvalue of the robotic platforms and the research with regards to outreach\r\nand participation, they will be used as outreach tools and to create new\r\neducational modules for promotion of STEM fields.  Further, the\r\nmulti-disciplinary nature of the work will be highlighted in order to\r\nemphasize its importance.\r\n",
