This international symposium will emphasize advancements, practice and novel uses of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and related techniques. This meeting is the premier PIV event in world, bringing together experts, practitioners and worldwide expertise in a concentrated forum for exchange of new ideas and intellectual interaction. \r\n\r\nPIV has enabled detailed, high quality measurements in every aspect of fluid mechanics opening up the opportunity to develop new insights in a host of fluid dynamics research areas. Most recent developments include stereo, time-resolved, tomographic, microscopic PIV and many more.  In addition, applying PIV in challenging situations has required solving many complicated fluid/particle interaction problems.  The meeting will cover phenomena from several areas of experimental fluid dynamics image-based techniques, with emphasis in 1) Improvements in accuracy, resolution and robustness; 2) Measurements in difficult or extreme fluid flows; 3) PIV Theory and Algorithms; 4) Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV); 5) Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF); 6) Stereo and 3D techniques (e.g. Holographic, Tomographic and Plenoptic PIV); 7) Pressure Measurement; 8) Scalar Transport and Mixing; 9) Multiphase and Turbulent Flows; 10) Biomedical Applications; 11) Micro-/Nanofluidics; 12) Aerodynamics; 13) Combustion; and 14) Data post-processing",

The technique at its heart uses multiple images of a particle laden fluid moving in some domain.  The particles are tracked from image to image using statistical methods, specifically the cross-correlation function. PIV has proven to be the most widely used experimental method for measuring moving fluids since its invention about 30 years ago.  PIV has been used in every aspect of experimental fluid mechanics.  Furthermore, many extensions of PIV have been developed since the invention of 2D planar PIV.  These include stereo, time-resolved, tomographic, microscopic, and many more.  In developing and applying PIV in these many situations, it has been applied to diverse engineering and scientific problems.  In addition, applying PIV in challenging situations has required solving many complicated fluid/particle interaction problems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/12/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carl D Meinhart"
