This conference will bring together leading scientists from a variety of fields in quantum fluids and solids in a collegial atmosphere that supports open discussion to discuss issues at the cutting edge of soft matter physics. This meeting will focus on two topics at the forefront of quantum fluids and solids which include liquid and solid 4He, 3He and 3He-4He mixtures, hydrogen, trapped atomic gases and optical lattices, magnetism and superconductivity, condensed matter systems in the quantum limit, model systems in cosmology and high energy physics and novel experimental low temperature techniques.  In addition, this conference will include a number of tutorials for young researchers which will introduce them to senior workers in the field and provide an opportunity to build informal networks with their peers.\r\n\r\n",
