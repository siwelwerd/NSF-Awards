 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Mote Marine Laboratory will continue to host a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site located at their campus in Sarasota, FL. The program will support internships for a group of ten students every summer during a 10 week research and professional training experience. \r\n\r\nMote offers a diverse array of research in ocean sciences and emphasizes the essential interconnectedness of varied disciplines towards the common goal of fostering ocean health. Students are paired with Mote researchers from 24 research programs and conduct mentored research projects on one of several major threats to coastal habitats: aquatic pollution, natural toxins, habitat alteration, animal behavior due to habitat change, coral reef decline, ocean acidification, and climate change. In addition to research skills, students gain valuable experience in scientific communication by developing and presenting research proposals for independent projects and reporting findings in poster presentations. Career guidance on grantsmanship, scientific writing, presenting poster and oral research talks, and pursuing graduate study in the Ocean Sciences is provided in student-centered discussion groups. Students are also exposed to a broader range of topics in coastal and estuarine sciences through research seminars presented by Mote staff, visiting scientists, and Mote REU Program alumni. Participants are encouraged to present research findings in peer-reviewed literature and/or at professional conferences.",

Professional development activities include seminars on how to present a scientific talk, tips on applying to grad school, and visiting State and Federal agencies conducting research in marine science to provide insight on various career paths. A research ethics component is also included. Students complete the summer with a well-rounded view of the responsibilities of a research scientist.

Over the funded period (2015-2017), our participants included over 40% that were from groups underrepresented in Ocean Sciences and non-traditional students. We have a high percentage of our students who continue their education in science through pursuing graduate degrees. From interns participating during this funded period, we currently have 33% students that are either actively applying to or currently enrolled in graduate schools and or currently employed in a science field. Due to a recent emphasis on providing research experiences to students earlier in the career, many (50%) of our interns are currently still in undergraduate school. Past interns that participated during this funded period have also been productive, with 10 giving presentations at scientific conferences and six as co-authors on scientific publications. One intern from this funded period was the recipient of an NSF GRFP award (2018), and two previous interns received either an award or Honorable Mention in 2017.
