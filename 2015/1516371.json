 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to cues from their environment, plants strategically redirect their energy and resources from growth, development, and reproduction towards processes that enable adaptation, defense, and survival. Plants need to regulate these processes to minimize wasteful expenditures of resources. This project will investigate how plants respond quickly and precisely to attack by using the production of a class of defense-related compounds (called alkaloids) from the Catharanthus roseus plant (commonly known as the Madagascar periwinkle) as an example.  Under normal conditions, growth is promoted while the production of alkaloids is low.  But in the presence of pathogens or attackers the plant responds by producing chemical signals (such as the plant hormone jasmonic acid) which rapidly activates the communication system that leads to the production of these defense-related alkaloids.  This project seeks to determine how the plant coordinately regulates growth, development, and defense through a class of regulatory switches, known as the zinc finger transcription factors. This research will involve the interdisciplinary mentoring and advising of graduate students and undergraduates, and the outreach to K-12 and under-represented groups through a Research Experience for Teachers and Young Scholars Program.  \r\n\r\nIn Catharanthus roseus, the mechanism for controlling the rapid defense response is partially mediated through activation of the zinc finger Catharanthus transcription (ZCT) factors leading to the production of terpenoid indole alkaloids.  In addition to terpenoid indole alkaloid biosynthesis, zinc finger transcription factors appear to be involved in other defense and stress-related responses.  In plants, Cys2-His2-type (C2H2) zinc fingers are an important class of transcription factors involved in controlling growth, development, and stress-responsive genes (cold, drought, salt, and oxidative stress) that contain a unique motif involved in gene repression. However, only a limited number of plant C2H2 zinc finger proteins have been studied in detail. Of these, ZCT is unique in that it is the only one involved in regulating growth and development and defense-related alkaloid biosynthesis. The goal of this project is to better understand how plants coordinately regulate growth, development, and defense to improve fitness and adaptation. This project seeks to elucidate the regulatory network by which hormone inputs coordinate the outputs of growth, development, and alkaloid biosynthesis through ZCT.  This fundamental knowledge and insight regarding plant control mechanisms is anticipated to lead to improved resistance of crops towards stress and pathogens, to improved production of defense-related compounds that have medicinal value, and to artificial genetic circuits for enabling rapid regulation of a desired output. The aims for this project are to 1) elucidate the regulatory circuit by which ZCT's role in defense is activated through the hormone jasmonic acid; 2) elucidate the regulatory circuit by which ZCT's role in growth and development is activated through the hormone gibberellic acid; and 3) characterize how ZCT mediates growth, development, and defense-related alkaloid biosynthesis.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported jointly by programs in Systems and Synthetic Biology (Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences) and Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering (Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems).",

We identified additional members of the ZCT family and observed their ability to repress the promoters of several alkaloid biosynthetic genes.  To investigate how ZCTs are regulated, we specifically sequenced and analyzed the ZCT1 promoter.  The ZCT1 promoter contains an intriguing arrangement of hormone-responsive clusters, suggesting regulation by these hormones under growth and stress-related conditions.  We tested several growth and stress-related hormones and showed that ZCT1 is indeed induced not only to the defense-related hormone, jasmonate (previously known), but also the synthetic growth hormone, 1-naphthalene acetic acid.  ZCT1 also represses its own promoter, suggesting a feedback mechanism by which the expression of ZCT1 can be limited. \n\nThe long-term vision of this project is to better understand how plants coordinately regulate growth, development, and defense to improve fitness and adaptation through transcription factors.
