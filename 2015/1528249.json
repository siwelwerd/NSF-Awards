 "awd_abstract_narration": "Southern Africa is the world's largest emitter of biomass burning aerosols. Their westward transport over the remote southeast Atlantic ocean co-locates some of the largest planetary aerosol loadings with the least examined of the Earth's major stratocumulus decks. While much of the aerosol resides above the boundary layer cloud, free-tropospheric subsidence and marine boundary layer deepening as sea surface temperatures warm imply that absorbing aerosol can also be entrained into the boundary layer. Model representations of the solar-absorbing aerosol cloud- atmosphere-ocean system must consider not only the direct radiative effect, but also radiative changes arising from cloud adjustments to the atmospheric warming and from aerosol cloud microphysical interactions. \r\n\r\nONFIRE (ObservatioNs of Fire's Impact on the southeast atlantic REgion) is a field campaign; the intensive five-week deployment of facilities in the southeast Atlantic is scheduled for September 2017. A coordinated set of hypotheses that improve understanding of biomass burning aerosol composition and absorption, their relationship to cloud-top entrainment, and impact on cloud microphysics, are being examined. The award that is being funded is considered a Scientific Planning Overview document and serves as the scientific basis for the campaign.  Individual science proposals will be reviewed separately.",

To paraphrase from \"Smoke and Clouds above the Southeast Atlantic: Upcoming Field Campaigns Probe Absorbing Aerosol's Impact on Climate\" :From July through October, smoke from biomass burning fires on the southern African sub-continent are transported westward through the free troposphere over one of the largest stratocumulus cloud decks on our planet (Fig. 1).

Smoke warms the atmosphere, in contrast to the climate cooling provided by the reflected sunlight from the extensive low clouds residing mostly below the smoke layer. Yet, the low clouds also respond to the presence of the smoke, in counter-intuitive ways that can either strengthen or weaken the low cloud deck. Smoke can stabilize the atmospheric temperature profile, by warming the free troposphere, and cooling the surface below. The stabilization strengthens the low cloud deck, so that the net smoke+cloud effect is an enhanced cooling. At a larger scale, the change in atmospheric warming from the smoke affects the neighboring precipitation distribution. The smoke's influence on the surface energy budget ultimately affects the equatorial climate and its variability through the trade winds, and changes the energy distribution between the northern and southern hemisphere\".</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/13/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paquita&nbsp;Zuidema</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1528249/1528249_10379527_1471130264941_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1528249/1528249_10379527_1471130264941_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"FIg. 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1528249/1528249_10379527_1471130264941_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"FIg. 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">During September, 600 hPa winds escort the biomass burning aerosol (optical depth in warm colors) emanating from fires in continental Africa (green to red, 50 to 310 firecounts per 1$^\\circ$ box) westward over the entire south Atlantic stratocumulus deck (cloud fraction in blue contours).
