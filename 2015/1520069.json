A similar symposium was last held at the ACS spring meeting in 2013.The Symposium is designed to bring together high school teachers, university faculty, and graduate students involved in creating research-based class-room activities, laboratory experiments, and lectures based on current polymer research for implementation in the classroom. The symposium will serve as a venue for educators to share best practices, exchange classroom activities, and build a network for continuing exchange and collaborative development of research based curricula. Special consideration for the awards will be given for institutions  submitting for the first time, and those serving underrepresented populations.",
