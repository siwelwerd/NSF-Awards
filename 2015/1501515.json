 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on the subject of dynamics and rational solutions to several polynomial equations.  Polynomial equations over the rational numbers are among the oldest topics in all of mathematics; indeed, they are often called \"Diophantine equations\" after Diophantus of Alexandria, who was one of the first to study them, in the 3rd century AD.  Many of the most important questions have been solved, at least partially, in the case of one and two dimensional systems of equations, but there is much that is unknown in dimensions three and up.  One of the primary goals of this award is to use dynamics (simply the repeated application of a function) to solve an open question about solutions to certain types of three-dimensional systems of equations.  Another goal is to develop a good notion of what it means for tuples of points to be in \"dynamically special position\", which means loosely that the points don't interact upon repeated application of a function.\r\n\r\nAn important conjecture of Zhang asks that if f is a self-map of an algebraic variety X defined over a number field, then under reasonably general conditions, there should be an algebraic point of X whose orbit under f is Zariski dense in X.  We seek to prove this conjecture in the case where f is an automorphism and X has dimension 3.  The chief tool here is the p-adic parametrization of orbits, which may be thought of as a more general dynamical version of Skolem's method for treating linear recurrence sequences.  Another goal of the project is to prove that if n is larger than 1, then given n distinct points in C and a list of n preperiods and periods, there is a polynomial of degree n+1 in normal form such that each point has the desired period and preperiod.\r\nThe methods here are a combination of diophantine approximation over function fields and the \"unlikely intersection\" techniques pioneered by Masser, Zannier, Baker, DeMarco, and others.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project focused on the interplay between dynamics and number theory. Number theory is one of the oldest areas in mathematics, dating back to the Greeks and Egyptians, whereas dynamics is a newer field, with an emphasis on chaos and randomness, but there are many problems on the interface between the two fields.  For example, a better understanding of the number theoretic dynamics of simple polynomial maps would lead to better random number generators and perhaps to better computer security codes (ones that are more efficient and less vulnerable to attack) as well.\n\n\nWe studied several closely related questions.  Many had to do with the notion of preperiodicity, which I will now explain. Take a polynomial f and an integer m. If we start with m, then take f(m), then take f(f(m)), and so on, we get a sequence of integers.  We say that m is preperiodic under f we eventually get the same number twice in this sequence.  For example, if f(x) = x^2  - 2 and m = 0, then f(0) = -2, f(f(0)) = 2, and f(f(f(0))) = 2 again, so 0 is preperiodic under f. There is a well-known uniform boundedness conjecture, due to Morton and Silverman, that asks if it is true that there is an upper bound on how long it can take for the sort of sequence described above to start to repeat (assuming that m is preperiodic) when one restricts to polynomials of bounded degree.  We worked on a higher-dimensional version of this problem, where one moves curves (or even higher-dimensional objects) around under a map and one attempts to get control of how quickly the resulting sequence of higher-dimensional objects must repeat itself, given that it does repeat itself.  In some special cases, we were able to answer the question completely.  We also answered some questions related to the original one-dimensional polynomial case, where we answered a question about polynomials having certain preperiodic points in common.  \n\nAnother related question that we treated can be explained in very elementary terms.  Suppose we start with a polynomial, let us  say f(x) = x^2 + 1, and an integer, let us say 2.  While 2 is not preperiodic under f -- since it gets larger and larger -- it is preperiodic when we look at remainders upon division by p for any prime p.  For example f(2) = 5 and 2 and 5 have the same remainder on division by 3.  Likewise, f(f(2)) = 26, which has the same remainder as 2 on division by the primes 2 and 3.  It has been conjectured that you can get any number to return to itself after any number of iterations, with finitely many exceptions, simply by finding the right prime with which to take remainders.  We were able to show that this conjecture is true, aside from a few counterexamples, assuming the famous so-called abc-conjecture.\n\nThe broader impact of the project had various facets.  Three graduate students are currently working with the PI, and two post-doctoral researchers worked with the PI during the first two years of the project.  The results obtained from the project were disseminated through talks and publications.  Ultimately, we hope that some of the questions studied can be made into research projects that are accessible to undergraduate students as well.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas Tucker"
