 "awd_abstract_narration": "1542727\r\nFinneran\r\n\r\nOn March 9 two ships collided in the Port of Houston shipping lane. The Carla Maersk, which was carrying 216,000 barrels of methyl tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE), was ruptured and an estimated 200,000 gallons of MTBE leaked into the Port of Houston. MTBE is extremely water soluble, and visible sheens were absent within a day or two. Therefore, the \"surface response\" of placing hydrophobic oil skimming booms did not contain the MTBE, and a large volume likely diluted and dispersed within the channel. It is unlikely that standard \"oil spill\" responses will attenuate MTBE, and this research will provide the Port of Houston stakeholders with data to assist in the short and long term response.\r\n\r\nThe broad objective of the proposed work is to characterize how the microbial community responds to MTBE contamination in marine sediment, and to identify specific microbial processes that will attenuate MTBE with or without engineering intervention. This is the first time a spill can be tracked from its inception, and the data will assist in all future efforts related to both MTBE remediation and high volume spill response. The specific objectives are to: 1) use metagenomic sequencing and high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing to determine both the shifts in microbial populations, as well as microbial activity related to the MTBE spill, and 2) quantify the native MTBE attenuation rates, and identify processes that can increase the rate and extent of biodegradation. These objectives will be met by testing the following hypotheses: 1) The microbial community will shift in response to MTBE and be dominated by operable taxonomic units previously identified in MTBE-degrading enrichment cultures and sediment incubations; and, 2) Sulfate-reducing microorganisms will dominate all MTBE degrading microbial reactions. The research will use high throughput sequencing of microbial DNA extracted from marine sediment in the Port of Houston to characterize the shift amongst microbial populations as they respond to MTBE contamination. In addition, the PI will use standard anoxic batch incubations to determine the rate and extent of MTBE degradation, and the projected pathway of biodegradation by analyzing known intermediates such as tert-butyl alcohol and tert-butyl formate. All anoxic incubation techniques have been previously reported and will be standard anoxic, glass serum bottles sealed with a butyl rubber stopper and sampled with anoxic-gas flushed syringe and needle setups. The proposed activity will be felt at the responder and practitioner levels. These data can and will be used to assist all future engineering responses to large MTBE spills. In addition, the basic scientific data can be used to identify specific microbial populations that respond to and possibly degrade MTBE.",

Samples were collected in the contaminated area and in an uncontaminated area outside of the port.  Enrichments developed with the marine sediment degraded both MTBE and TBA, at rates comparable to previous studies.  Amending compounds such as sulfate, ferric iron, and nitrate had little impact on the rate and extent of biodegradation.  The marine sediment either had a capacity for degrading MTBE, or not.  In addition, the compound tert-butyl alcohol (TBA), which is the first breakdown product of MTBE, was degraded in the enrichments.\n\n \n\nGenomic DNA extracted from the sediment indicated the microbial community composition, which can be used to compare marine environments impacted with MTBE to those not impacted by MTBE.  Data are still pending as to the full microbial community. \n\n \n\nThe microbial community identified in this study will be compared to microbes identified in past studies with both marine and freshwater material that has been impacted with MTBE.  However, the data here indicate that a marine port already contaminated with fuel compounds from a number of activities is relatively resilient to additional contamination.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin T Finneran"
