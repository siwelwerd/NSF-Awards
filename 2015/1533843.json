 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forensics is a burgeoning field of importance to national security and law enforcement. New technology and scientific advancements allow for more sophisticated analysis of forensic data yet there are no standards for evaluating the reliability of new methods and to determine their usefulness as forensic evidence.  Improving the quality of forensic analyses should result in a higher degree of efficiently and appropriately analyzed evidence. \r\n\r\nThis workshop has the objective to improve capability within the forensic science community for greater scientific rigor in analytical methods. The workshop will bring together twenty highly reputed forensic science practitioners, research scientists, statisticians and policy makers to discuss the current shortcomings and to recommend ways to most effectively evaluate the forensic science literature. The speakers will contribute to a report that will be published and disseminated by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ).",
