 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to provide a detailed verifiable explanation of the origin of the heating of the solar atmosphere.  Most of the light reaching Earth originates at the 'surface' of the sun, a region called the photosphere. However, the regions of the solar atmosphere immediately above this surface, the solar chromosphere and corona, create most of the dangerous Ultraviolet (UV) and X-ray radiation. These regions also generate the solar wind, a stream of charged particles that pass the Earth at speeds in excess of 400km/s. Both the rapidly changing radiation and the solar wind create hazards for spacecraft, astronauts, and have a number of important terrestrial impacts. A long-standing mystery has prevented scientists from understanding and accurately modeling the chromosphere and corona. A short distance above the 'surface' of the sun, the solar atmosphere's temperature jumps up by a factor of two to three. The goal of this project is to provide an explanation of the origin of this heating.  The project will also provide opportunities to recruit and train student researchers in plasma and solar physics, simulations, and modeling at the Boston University.  Many of the Boston University PI's undergraduate research advisees, about half of whom are women, have continued on to graduate school. \r\n\r\nThis research will examine whether solar plasma flows emerging from the photosphere can transfer sufficient energy into turbulent plasma of the solar atmosphere, which, in turn, will heat the chromosphere sufficiently to explain whether the observed UV spectra originate there. It will also evaluate whether this mechanism can account for chromospheric spectral observations. This requires four linked research tasks: (1) solving for plasma drifts and fields when a convecting neutral gas pushes it across magnetic field lines; (2) analyzing the theory of streaming instabilities applicable to the collisional plasma found there; (3) performing a series of kinetic simulations to explore the nonlinear and thermal properties of the resulting turbulence; and (4) incorporating the resulting electron heating into a radiative transport code in order to evaluate its impact on chromospheric radiance. This research combines several research areas encompassed by the NSF/DOE Partnership in Basic Science and Engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThis research grant enabled the team at Boston University led by Dr.s Oppenheim and Dimant and the Northwest Research Associates researcher, Dr. Fontenla to study a mechanism that would explain a long-standing mystery in the solar physics: what role do small-scale plasma waves play in the chromosphere why does the chromosphere?s temperature shoot up from about 4000K to over 8000K at about 800 km above the solar photosphere.  \n\nSpecifically, they investigated a hypothetical process where neutral gas flows (winds), driven from below, would drag the low-density but important plasma across solar magnetic field lines.  This would then induce wave growth in the plasma, followed by turbulence, and heating.  These waves are somewhat analogous to sound waves in that, at the crests, the densities and pressures are elevated and, in the valleys, diminished. They demonstrated that such flows would easily generate waves and turbulence.  In fact, they found, through simulations, that the waves grow much more readily than they had thought at the beginning of the project. That?s because it turns out waves, if they propagate in the correct direction at certain wavelengths and speeds, will heat in such a way as to further enhance the wave &ndash; an odd but not unknown effect in plasma physics.   They also investigated how frequently and easily the solar chromosphere could set up conditions that would trigger these waves.  They found that these conditions appear at a range of altitudes and across most of the chromosphere.\n\nThese results have been communicated with the broader scientific community through a set of papers and talks supported by this grant.  This grant also enabled the training of 2 graduate students and one undergraduate in a range of skills including plasma physics, solar physics, and computational physics.  Overall, we believe this grant was highly successful and the team hopes to continue this research in order to establish the importance and frequency of the newly found thermal instability.  Also, it wants to estimate impact of the turbulence on chromospheric heating.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Meers Oppenheim"
