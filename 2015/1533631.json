 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) provides support to design, implement, and assess strategies that can lead to comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research at HBCUs. The project at Delaware State University seeks to \"change the equation for science and mathematics\" by focusing on introductory mathematics and science courses and the critical transition from the freshman to the sophomore year. The project focuses particularly on the College Algebra course, a preparation course for Calculus, since currently 89% of first time, first year students at Delaware State University place into a no-credit, developmental mathematics course.\r\n\r\nActivities that are part of this project are:  a virtual summer bridge program focusing on mathematics for all incoming freshmen declaring a STEM major; study hall for all freshmen STEM majors; and research opportunities for freshmen and sophomore STEM majors.  The activities are built on pilot results from previous projects and on intervention models shown to be effective at Delaware State University. The project will be guided by an on-going evaluation and external and internal steering committees.",

In year 1 we ran the virtual bridge program for 46 incoming STEM freshmen who took an on-line mathematics class, either College Algebra or Intro to Algebra.  In year 1 the virtual bridge program culminated with an on-campus training camp in which STEM students arrived on campus two days earlier than other freshmen.

Instead, the students participated in the regular \"Freshman Welcome Days\" run by the Office of Admissions, and a block of time was set aside for the students to take the common final exam in person.  As in years past, all of the students placed into Introduction to Algebra by the Accuplacer test, but a total of 11 students were advanced into the on-line College Algebra course based on their score on the quantitative section of the SAT and success in high school mathematics course.  For the students in College Algebra, 7 out of 11 students passed the course for a passing rate of 64%.

However, in contrast to the program administered under SMILE, we supported two undergraduate students in each of the funded projects, instead of just one.  The change was designed to formally introduce a peer-mentoring component into the program, which is has been shown throughout literature to be one of the most effective high-impact practices in research education.
