 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recognizing the national need for significant improvement in undergraduate STEM education, collaborators from six institutions (Rochester Institute of Technology, St. Mary's University, Oral Roberts University, Hope College, Ursinus College, and California Polytechnic University) will explore a new approach to introduce students to authentic research in biochemistry laboratory courses.  The project will test the hypotheses that engaging in authentic research will improve students' abilities to master key aspects of experimentation (experimental design, data processing and interpretation, and communication of research outcomes) and visualization (use of representations to communicate various aspects of the research process).  The project is likely to be transferrable to other institutions, and is an example of a cost-effective way to introduce course-based research into the undergraduate curriculum.\r\n\r\nBiochemistry laboratory courses will be redesigned to include modules in which students will integrate computational and wet lab techniques as they characterize proteins whose three dimensional structures are known but to which functions have not been previously ascribed.  Because the project is focused on discovery, it is reasonable to expect that some of the students will produce novel results that will contribute to the field of biochemistry.  Formative and summative evaluation will address assessment of student learning gains in terms of improved conceptual understanding and visualization of experiments using a validated instrument composed of open-ended and closed-ended questions.  Faculty members and teaching assistants will be surveyed and interviewed about their satisfaction with the project, its usability, and the extent to which they see the project as part of their own and their students' development.  The project team will create and disseminate modules (promol.org) that form the core of a new curriculum for undergraduate biochemistry laboratory courses.  The results of the work will be presented at professional meetings, such as the American Society of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, and submitted to scholarly journals.",

We also have had elbow-to-elbow experience with promising undergraduates who sought out individual research projects. This NSF project designed a new CURE (Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience) curriculum in Biochemistry, the possibility of instituting something in between.

They were shown how to investigate the properties of thirty proteins of known structure (stored in the RCSB Protein DataBank) but unknown function, and propose a function based on innate properties and similarities to known proteins. We ordered plasmid vectors containing the DNA coding for those proteins, and then switched from these <em>in silico</em> investigations to <em>in vitro</em> procedures. We overexpressed the proteins and purified them, then tested them for their hypothesized activities.</p>\n<p>In the first two years of the project, the professor steered students toward probable hydrolases. In the pilot semester, four proteins were studied; three were confirmed to be lipases and one was an endonuclease. In the second year of the project four different proteins were studied; two were lipases, one a glycosidase, and one probably a natural product acetylase. In both semesters in which the project was carried out, students were visibly energized by the authenticity of the process; they were personally invested in the discovery of new knowledge and were motivated to become part of the world of protein research. Our assessment team, headed by Dr. Trevor Anderson at Purdue, using surveys and interviews, concluded that students grew in knowledge, confidence, and engagement. More anecdotal observations were that students gained a deeper appreciation for research, and were proud to be part of it.</p>\n<p>Students were not the only ones to undergo personal and cognitive development during the performance of this project. The PI also underwent growth. The PI is an enzymologist who was experienced in every bench aspect of the new curriculum but quite inexperienced in bioinformatics.
