 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Eric Borguet of Temple University designs and performs experiments to investigate the characteristics of single molecules with a particular focus on the effect of external physical and chemical parameters on changing the electrical resistance.  To meet this challenge, target molecules whose properties depend on their immediate surroundings are investigated with state-of-the-art techniques. This research advances our understanding of the electrical properties of molecular components of sensors and electrical devices. The broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits from the discovery of single molecule sensors and switches which can help to miniaturize electronic devices as well as the education and development of a diverse scientific workforce trained in a multidisciplinary environment. In addition, by providing participants from the diverse student body of Temple University that includes underrepresented minorities and first generation college students, and allowing local high school students the opportunity to engage in this research, the preparation of the next generation of scientists is advanced.  \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the use of scanning tunneling microscopes to create nanoscale junctions that can trap single molecules for electrical measurements. Specifically selected probe molecules, whose electronic properties are sensitive to the characteristics of the environment in which they are located, are investigated. In addition, molecules are oriented in the measurement junction to determine the anisotropy of the electrical properties of the molecules.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMolecular-scale electronics promises low cost miniaturization of electronic devices.  At the simplest level molecule based electronic components are designed by wiring a single molecule between two metal electrodes.  The current passing through the sandwiched molecule is sensitive to the atomic level details of the molecule&ndash;electrode contact that can be optimized via collaboration between scientists who make molecules, those who can measure their properties, and those who can make calculations to help understand the results of the measurements. \n\nWe used the stabilization provided by formation of ordered two dimensional molecular structures to open up a high conductance transport pathway in single molecules.  Employing a special electron microscope (electrochemical Scanning Tunneling Microscope) and combining it with a method to measure the electrical properties of single molecules (the break junction method) has enabled us to control the orientation of single molecules between two gold electrodes and measure charge transport perpendicular to the molecular plane.  Consequently, we were able to investigate the ability of small benzene derivatives to conduct electricity along different directions of the molecule. \n\nOur results show that using the electrode potential as an external stimuli, the orientation-dependent conductance in the junction can be switched between two conductance states (high and low).  We employed a similar approach to investigate the combined dependence of the orientation and the denticity (the number of contacts a molecule makes with an electrode) on the electrical transport properties of molecules in the junction.  Our experimental results combined with DFT calculations show that there are a clear dependence of the conductance on the molecule denticity and orientation in the junction. This is the kind of information that will be useful to those who want to use molecules as components in miniaturized electronic devices.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/10/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric U Borguet"
