 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, the North Carolina A&Teach STEM Scholars project is recruiting undergraduate majors in mathematics and science (physics, chemistry, biology) and preparing them to become mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology teachers in grades 9-12. The project is funding 25 scholarships over 5 years. In this project North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University is collaborating with Guilford County Schools and is committed to work in areas with students who traditionally have underperformed in mathematics and science. The goals of the project are to emphasize inquiry-based teaching methods and culturally relevant pedagogical practices in the sciences and mathematics, and to retain novice teachers via collaborative induction support. The North Carolina A&Teach STEM project has three components: 1) a teacher preparation program that emphasizes inquiry-based and culturally relevant pedagogy with a summer application component with African refugee K-12 public school students, 2) a four-week summer internship with Guilford Education Alliance's STEM Externship project where students will work closely with middle and high school science and math teachers in a STEM-related business or organization, and 3) an induction program with individualized mentoring, instructional observations with explicit feedback, and release time to participate in the STEM Equity Education Institute, which will emphasize the links between inquiry in science and mathematics and inquiry-based teaching methods, and the On Common Ground Summer Conference, which will provide opportunities to work with university faculty and in-service STEM teachers in implementing culturally relevant pedagogy in science and mathematics as well as managing classrooms grounded in inquiry-based instruction. Noyce Scholars will develop a portfolio during their senior year that captures the depth and breadth of their content knowledge, content pedagogical skills, leadership ability within the school and community, and ability to personalize learning based on K-12 student needs. After attaining certification, Noyce Scholars will be placed in selected schools within Guilford County Schools, where they will be paired with experienced mentor teachers and will participate in ongoing professional development workshops throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes of the North Carolina A&Teach STEM Scholars project are (1) to produce qualified teachers who possess substantive content knowledge, (2) to develop teachers who will use pedagogical approaches that are proven to positively impact the student performance and standardized test scores of culturally and linguistically diverse students, and (3) to increase the retention rate of qualified science and mathematics teachers in Guilford County Schools. The strategies and activities developed by this project serve as a framework for recruitment at other institutions.  In turn, this knowledge is leading to a significant increase in the number of highly qualified mathematics, and science teachers nationwide.",

The program intended to recruit STEM majors to obtain licensure in STEM Education. Upon entering the program, candidates agreed that for every year of funding they received, they would devote two years of time to teaching. The goal of the program was to recruit, train, and retain culturally responsive pre-service STEM teachers. To date the grant recruited 18 STEM majors in the field, consisting of five MAT candidates and 13 undergraduate candidates. Another goal for the grant was to ensure that each of the candidates was involved in a research project for a semester. Each of the candidates participated in the hydroponics research project led by a STEM faculty member and supported by members of the grant team. Finally, the grant team was dedicated in ensuring that all candidates had a summer internship and participated in regular professional development. At this point, the major activities have been the retention of the candidates, research projects, internships, and professional development. </span></p>\n<p>The team has worked on retaining the teachers within the program. Twelve candidates are teaching or have completed some teaching experience. There are seven candidates in the program, three are scheduled to graduate December 2021, and the other four will complete the education portion of the program next semester (May 2022) or the following year (May 2023). For the current undergraduate candidates, the program was designed, so they would complete the work in the normal four years and each of the candidates will meet this goal. For the MAT candidates, they were scheduled to complete the program in a year and a half, and they all are scheduled to do this as well, one MAT candidate joined the team late, so this is why her expected graduation date is May 2022. The three undergraduate candidates are on target, and we will continue to support them through their final year of STEM and Education coursework to ensure their success in the program and matriculation into teaching.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ultimate goal was to increase the number of diverse STEM Educators totaling 25 candidates, the team met this at a 72% rate and have learned how to get the word out and support/retain the candidate. Sixteen of the candidates were black females, one an Asian male, and finally a white male. The PI team has had an 83.33% retention rate for the candidates entering the teaching field, and the team seeks to build this pipeline through continued funding.</p>\n<p>The Professional Development series supported the candidates with major educational topics such as: Assessment, Classroom Management, and Culturally Responsive Pedagogy. The candidates received 3-4 professional development workshops each semester, and alumni candidates were always invited to attend and support. Some alumni candidates have served as mentors to the new cohorts. The candidates have had an opportunity to attend a NASA MEI professional development series or training at the Ron Clark Academy, both of these experiences have been dynamic resources, supporting both content and pedagogical knowledge.</p>\n<p>Overall, the project has increased the number of STEM Education majors at North Carolina A&amp;T State University, and the pipeline of mentorship and ongoing professional development, as well as induction support, have proven to ensure the success of our candidates. The PI looks forward in further exploring these outcomes.</p>\n<p>The Grant Team and the scholars have presented at Noyce Conferences, DISES, DIVAS, and other professional organization conferences.
