Given that discoveries in nanotechnology are leading to significant advances in agricultural sciences, engineering and food sciences, the initiation of a Gordon Research Conference is very timely and, in fact, has been accepted for the a Gordon Research Conference in this area on June 7-12, 2015 at Bentley University. Such advances have the potential to revolutionize our agricultural and food systems in many ways. Recognizing that research and development in this area is only about ten years young, it is an exceedingly opportune time to bring together scientists and engineers, both senior and junior, postdocs and graduate students from academia, and scientists and engineers from business, government and NGOs to discuss advances and future directions and needs.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this workshop is: 1)To bring together experts in the field to discuss cutting edge research and for scientists/engineers to meet to discuss advances and future directions and needs in the field of nanotechnology for food and agriculture; 2)To identify cutting-edge, unpublished research in the field of nanotechnology likely to advance agriculture and food systems; 3)To identify the greatest opportunities for funding in this area; and 4)To identify emerging opportunities in the area of nanotechnology that will have the greatest impact in addressing global challenges of food security, environmental sustainability, food safety and agricultural productivity. The co-chairs of this GRC envision that the convergence between nanotechnology, biotechnology and information science applied to plant science, animal science, crop and food science/technology will lead to revolutionary advances in the next 5-15 years including: re-engineering of crops, animals and microbes at the genetic and cellular level, nano-biosensors for identification of pathogens, toxins and bacteria in foods; identification systems for tracking animal and plant materials from origination to consumption; development of nanotechnology based foods with lower calories and with less fat, salt and sugar while retaining flavor and texture; integrated systems for sensing, monitoring and active response intervention for plant and animal production; smart field systems to detect, locate, report and direct application of water; precision and controlled release of fertilizers and pesticides; development of plants that exhibit drought resistance and tolerance to salt and excess moisture; and nanoscale films for food packaging and contact materials that extend shelf life, retain quality and reduce cooling requirements.",
