They have to date been underutilized in solving critical problems in the US educational system, particularly in understanding Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and increasing retention for students traditionally underserved in STEM. The goals of the Directorate for Education and Human Resources through the Critical Techniques and Technologies for Advancing Foundations and Applications of Big Data Science & Engineering (BIGDATA) program are to advance fundamental understanding of key questions in the field, and catalyze the use of data science in Education Research. Collaboration has a long history of research and a solid research base. However, the work is hampered by the difficulty of replicating or aggregating results due to the standard research methods used in the field. The current standard practice in collaboration research is to record student activity on audio or video, create qualitative coding schemes, and code the data by hand. This is labor intensive and prone to personal judgment and error. This project will investigate the use of data mining and learning analytics to overcome this challenge of aggregation and accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the proposal is to conduct a series of workshops to catalyze the community of researchers investigating the effects of collaboration by introducing and investigating the best uses of learning analytics and data mining techniques.",

It can help researchers situate or advance their work through using existing coding schemes as a shared way of talking about collaboration.\nThe cross-disciplinary perspectives gained from from computer scientists helped learning researchers in understanding collaborative learning models, what a vision of Adaptive Collaborative Learning Support (ACLS) might look like for learning scientists, and the kinds of data needed to provide good ACLS to students and teachers. The project synthesized how cross-disciplinary collaborative learning researchers conceptualized high-quality collaboration and indicators of lesser quality. Such efforts can help to increase understanding among these different research communities and help different stakeholders in the Computer Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) community design for (and study) collaborative learning. \nThis project identified three specific qualities, and core practices of those qualities, that are associated with productive collaborative learning: task management and regulation, collective meaning-making, and socio-emotional regulation. \nThe core practices for productive collaboration in task management include:\n\n\nbalanced task participation, in which group members take on equal shares of the work and responsibility for its completion, ensuring that all have equal access to important materials;\n\n\nhigh quality cognitive strategy use, in which group members use different strategies to ensure that desired domain methods and techniques are carried out; and\n\n\npositive interdependence in which group members depend on each other for developing and refining ideas for the project and that the task not split up and completed by isolated individuals. \n\n\nThe core practices for productive collaboration in collective meaning-making include: \n\n\ndisciplinary engagement, in which group members collectively think about and discuss important domain concepts;\n\n\nbalanced verbal participation, in which group members contribute equally to collective meaning making process such that no member or members are dominating verbal discourse or are largely inactive during conversation; and \n\n\nhigh quality socio-cognitive strategy use, in which group members use different strategies to ensure that ideas are shared, elaborated, analyzed, and checked for understanding. \n\n\nFinally, the core practices for productive collaboration in Socio-emotional interactions include: \n\n\nemotional engagement, in which group members are invested in the well being of the group, its members, and the project; \n\n\nmutual respect, in which group members treat each other, their ideas, and their efforts with esteem; and \n\n\nhigh quality social strategy use in which group members use different strategies to ensure that all members feel that their ideas are valued, that they can admit when they do not understand something, and  their mistakes will be seen opportunities to learn.\n\n\nFinally, the project led to thinking of ACLS as an equity issue to provide access to collaborative learning to a broader range of students.
