 "awd_abstract_narration": "Remarkable patterns have been discovered in the structure of closed curves lying on surfaces. The goal of this project is explain as many as possible of these patterns theoretically and to discover further structures. This research combines methods from geometry and topology with probability and statistics. The tools include computer experimentation using algorithms developed by the PI, finding patterns, and then proving rigorous results about the patterns that are discovered. The PI will engage graduate and undergraduate students in research related to the project and she will organize the Stony Brook Women in Mathematics Group. The PI also plans to create a series of applets that can be used by other researchers.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the project is to understand the asymptotic statistical structure of five numbers that can be associated to the free homotopy class of closed curves on an orientable surface with negative Euler characteristic. Those numerical values are the self-intersection number, the word-length (that is the smallest number of letters of a word representing the curve in a chosen set of generators of the fundamental group of the surface), the geometric length of the unique geodesic, and the mean and the variance of the distribution of mutual intersection numbers with other curves. Another part of the project concerns development of a combinatorial description of the string topology of manifolds in dimension three, and exploring a relationship of string topology with the geometrization of three manifolds.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n  \n \nA surface can be seen as the mathematical representation of the \"outer layer of a solid\". A curve on a surface can be thought of as a \"rubber band\" clinging to the surface of the solid. Three numbers can be associated with a closed curve on a surface:   the number of times a curve crosses itself, the  two lengths of the curve on the surface,   computed  the first way using a notion of distance on the surface and the second way using the smallest word length description.  These words are written  in terms of   upper and lower case  letters which label the directed ways of going around certain basic holes in the topology of the surface.  \nTwo closed curves on a surface are considered to be ?the same?  if one curve  can be deformed continuously to the other without leaving the surface.  This relationship determines a class of curves  which consists in the  set of all curves that are related in this way.  By considering the smallest values taken on a class of curves , one can define the length, the word length and the self-intersection number of a class of curves.\nIn this work,  algebraic, combinatorial and statistical structure and relations between these three numbers associated to a class were studied. In some cases, conjectures were first established by means of computer experiments. Many of these experiments were performed by graduate, undergraduate and high school students\n We also studied how a certain algebraic structure defined by combining and splitting apart classes of curves is related to the number of intersections of these curves.
