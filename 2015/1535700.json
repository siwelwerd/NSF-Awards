 "awd_abstract_narration": "The progress of basic research into physics, biomedicine, materials science, and chemistry depends critically on the qualities of high-energy electrons. An important current application of electrons is x-ray radiology, used for medical diagnostics, homeland security, non-destructive analysis, and computer manufacturing. By developing novel methods to accelerate electrons with laser light, this project aims to demonstrate new techniques to greatly improve the quality of electron beams. In the process, a new generation of students in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics will receive training in disciplines deemed essential for national scientific and economic competitiveness. \r\n\r\nThe development of compact high-field-gradient laser-plasma accelerators has advanced rapidly in recent years. Several recent theoretical studies predict the possibility of ultra-low emittance beams (substantially lower than the current state of the art). However, these predictions have yet to be tested experimentally. Such experiments will be conducted during this project with the cutting-edge laser technology, including the petawatt peak-power-level DIOCLES laser, available at the University of Nebraska's Extreme Light laboratory. Laser light will be used to both inject and accelerate electrons, producing beams with record low emittance. Novel methods will be developed and implemented to measure ultra-low beam emittance. The experimental results will be compared with predictions of modeling and simulation?to either validate existing physical models, or develop new ones that agree with observations. It is anticipated that this research will significantly improve our understanding of the fundamental physics of laser-wakefield electron accelerators, as well as further advance their development.",
