Hartland of the University of Notre Dame is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Division of Chemistry to study chemical reactions and the conduction of electrons in metal nanowires. The results from these experiments are important for developing ultra-sensitive mass sensors and circuits that use light instead of electrical current to transport information.  If successful, this innovation will allow miniaturization of circuits and sensors to nanoscale dimensions. Both graduate and undergraduate students are participating in this research. The undergraduate students are being recruited to the project from the University of Notre Dame, as well as from nearby four-year colleges in the northern Indiana area that have limited research facilities.  The undergraduate and graduate students are also involved in a series of outreach activities that connect to local high school students in the South Bend area. \r\n\r\nThe experiments that are being conducted are providing new information about how nano-materials interact with their environment, and how these interactions are different to those of macroscopic objects.  The effects that are being explored include the role of surface bound molecules in mediating energy relaxation in nanomaterials, whether simple solvents such as water behave like viscoelastic solvents at nanoscale dimensions, and the way the environment influences the properties of surface plasmon polaritons - which are electromagnetic magnetic waves that propagate at the surfaces of the nanowires. These measurements are being performed using transient absorption microscopy, which is an experimental technique that allows ultrafast laser measurements to be performed on single nano-objects.  Simulations are also being conducted as part of the project.  Comparison of the experimental results to the simulations is generating information about the properties of the materials that can be used by other researchers in different areas of science and engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe work in NSF grant CHE-1502848 had three major thrusts: (i) the development of a new method to record images in the infrared (IR) spectral region with high spatial resolution, (ii) measurements of how the motion of electrons along the surfaces of metal nanowires are affected by adsorbed molecules, and (iii) studies of the ultra-high frequency vibrational modes of metal nanostructures ? how they are affected by the environment and by coupling to other nanostructures.  This work was performed by a diverse team that included five graduate students, seven undergraduates, two high school students, a postdoc and a visiting scholar.  The students who worked on the project gained experience in optics, nanofabrication, and data analysis and simulations.  They also helped disseminate the work by giving presentations at scientific conferences, and writing up the results of their studies for publication.\n\n(i)     Super-Resolution IR Imaging \n\nIn normal optical imaging experiments the resolution is limited by diffraction, which means a spatial resolution of approximately the wavelength of the light.  Because of this the spatial resolution of regular IR microscopes is on the order of 5 microns, which is not sufficient to resolved the structures of cells (for example).  At the University of Notre Dame, with the help from funding from grant CHE-1502848, the Hartland and Kuno groups have developed a novel way to record IR images that beats the diffraction limit.  In these experiments a IR laser is used to excite the sample, and a visible laser monitors the change in optical properties caused by the absorption of IR light.  The spatial resolution is determined by the visible laser and, so, is over an order of magnitude better than that expected from the IR beam alone.  The technique is dubbed IR photothermal heterodyne imaging (IR-PHI), and a diagram of the optical set-up and images that demonstrate the spatial resolution are shown in Figure 1.  The technology developed by the University of Notre Dame team has been patented (?Photothermal Imaging Device and System?, US patent, patent number 10,677,722), and a commercial instrument for IR-PHI is now available.  This technique has become widely used to image biological samples and different types of materials science systems.\n\n(ii)   Lifetimes of Surface Plasmons in Metal Nanowires\n\nSurface Plasmon Polaritons (SPPs) are excitations of electrons at metal surfaces.  For extended metal nanostructures, like nanowires or nanoplates, the SPPs move along the surface with a definite speed and direction.  Researchers in the Hartland group have developed a way to measure the lifetime of the SPP modes using a regular optical microscope.  The measurements show that plasmons at the surfaces of nanostripes (flat structures that are 50 nm high, a few microns wide and a hundred microns long) live almost an order of magnitude longer than plasmons in metal particles.  The effect of attaching molecules onto the surfaces of metal nanowires was also examined.  The SPPs of the metal nanowires and the optical transitions (?excitons?) of the molecules are strongly coupled.  This coupling creates unusual hybrid states that are a mixture of the SPPs and excitons.  These measurements generated new information about the lifetimes of these states, which is important for understanding their properties.\n\n(iii)  Liquid Damping, Mass Sensing and Vibrational Coupling in Nanostructures\n\nUltrafast laser excitation of metal nanostructures causes rapid heating, which can excite vibrational modes of the structures (primarily breathing modes).  The frequencies of these modes depend on the size and shape of the structure, and are typically in the GHz frequency range.  In NSF grant CHE-1502848 the Hartland group examined how the lifetimes of the breathing modes of gold nanowires are affected by adding liquid to the sample.  The measurements showed that the viscosity of the liquid has very little effect on the lifetimes ? even for very viscous liquids like glycerol.  In liquid environments the damping of the breathing modes is controlled by radiation of sound waves into the surroundings, just like what happens for a solid environment.  The way the vibrations of two nanostructures couple to each other was also investigated for gold nanoplates.  The coupled system can be accurately described by a simple harmonic oscillator model, which implies that this system is an excellent choice for studying coherent control in nanoscale systems.  The Hartland group also investigated how adding nanoparticles to the surfaces of gold nanoplates changes their vibrational frequencies.  Figure 2 shows an optical image of a gold nanoplates with polystyrene beads adsorbed to its surface.  The breathing mode frequency of the nanoplates is significantly lower when the measurements are performed at the beads ? which is attributed to a mass loading effect.  These results imply that the nanoplates may be useful as nanometer sized mass balances, that can be used to measure the masses of large particles (such as viruses) that are difficult to determine with conventional techniques.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/16/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory V Hartland"
