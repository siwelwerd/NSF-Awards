 "awd_abstract_narration": "Faculty from three areas (engineering, psychology, and linguistics) will be collaborating to design two engineering courses based on systems thinking, sustainable engineering, and cultural understanding.  They plan to research, develop, and teach two courses in engineering to demonstrate that a new approach based on systems thinking and spatial cognition applied to teaching and learning may lead to changing the way educators and students think about STEM learning.  The importance of cultural awareness and global perspectives will also be integrated into the new courses.\r\n\r\nA systems approach to learning helps instructors and students understand the complexity of the world and encourages them to think in terms of relationships, connectedness, and context. Interdependent healthy learning practices are therefore necessary and essential for the advancement of STEM academic achievement in an increasingly global and complex world. A major hypothesis of the Sustainable STEM Learning Program (S2LP) project is that when education is viewed from an interdisciplinary, systems, and cultural perspective, learning becomes student centered, holistic, and collaborative. The S2LP framework will make important conceptual contributions towards promoting holistic learning through spatial cognition and systems learning. In terms of the broader impacts, the courses will emphasize the importance of understanding culture in a global context in an increasingly diverse world.  Courses to be developed may potentially form a Science, Technology, and Society minor.  Effectiveness of the new approach will be tested against control courses.  This holistic approach should be of special relevance to international students and those with limited language proficiency.  Agreements with Minority Engineering and Science Advancement (MESA) and a community college are in place to conduct workshops for teachers and students. Both channels will engage members of underrepresented groups and may help increase their enrollment in STEM majors.  Dissemination activities will include teacher workshops, conferences and papers, and the delivery of one of the courses through the university's massive online open course program.",

Further, strategies such as back casting and concept maps that help students better comprehend systems concepts were incorporated into the lecture delivery. This course, in addition to helping students master environmental engineering topics, also provides them the opportunity to develop systems skills such as ability to recognize interconnections, understand feedbacks, analyze non-linear relationships, and grasp dynamic behavior that are prevalent in complex systems. In addition, an advanced and more in-depth version of these topics (systems concepts/ideas/lectures) were developed and incorporated into a graduate level course called systems analysis for environment and sustainability, which is also taught by the PI. This provides an opportunity for undergraduate students at CU-Denver who want to further acquire more in-depth systems thinking cognition to take this graduate level course as one of the three elective courses. This graduate level course also provides a pathway for current/future undergraduate students who want to pursue systems thinking and sustainability as a career path to transition to a graduate program that lays heavy emphasis on these topics. We believe the combination of a revamped \"systems oriented\" undergraduate course (introductory level) and graduate (in-depth) course provides a wonderful opportunity for our engineering undergraduate students to acquire a more holistic education within the context of environmental and sustainability engineering. These courses will help prepare our undergraduate engineering students to better handle and address real-world, interdisciplinary, and complex problems/challenges. Further the S2LP project utilized two other engineering courses: Technology &amp; Culture; International Dimensions of Technology &amp; Culture to collect baseline data on systems thinking skills and cognitive styles of undergraduate students. Co-PI Dr. Shyu and Co-PI Dr. Tang researched and identified suitable instruments for systems thinking and cognitive styles respectively. The baseline data was collected using the following two assessment instruments: Systems Thinking Scale (STS) and Object - Spatial Imagery - Verbal Questionnaire (OSIVQ). These two instruments were administered to a total of 121 students from the two courses. This baseline data was utilized to see if there was any correlation between systems thinking and cognitive styles. We analyzed the baseline data and some interesting patterns related to correlations between systems thinking and cognitive styles emerged: 1) While we had predicted some association between Systems thinking (as measured by STS) and OSIVQ Spatial style subscale, we did not find any significant correlation between the two; 2) The overall sample showed a significant moderate positive correlation between systems thinking </span></span><span><span><span>(as measured by STS)</span></span><strong><span> </span></strong></span><span><span>and the OSIVQ Object style subscale; 3) There was no significant correlation between </span></span><span><span><span>systems thinking </span><span>(as measured by STS)</span></span><strong><span> </span></strong><span><span>and the OSIVQ Verbal style subscale.</span></span></span><span><span> We also found several other interesting results by analyzing the </span><span><span>baseline data.
