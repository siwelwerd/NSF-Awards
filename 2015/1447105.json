 "awd_abstract_narration": "Remote triggering by large earthquakes at regional distances has been globally observed and intensely studied since the 1992 Mw 7.3 Landers earthquake in California. However, most of the previous studies were conducted at spatial scales of hundreds of kilometers and did not differentiate the actual operational geothermal fields with anthropogenic setting and their adjacent fault zones with natural setting. A two-year project is proposed for detailed analyses of the remotely triggered seismicity to examine hypothesis that geothermal fields respond differently from their vicinity to remote earthquakes due to the stress-state changes that are associated with the anthropogenic activity inside the geothermal field. The expected results will improve knowledge of the effect of pore fluid pressure on earthquake initiation and interaction and contribute to models of remotely triggered and induced seismicity, which will be important for evaluating the potential of future seismic hazards in geothermal fields due to remote earthquakes and human activity. \r\n\r\nIn this proposed work, three operational geothermal fields under active tectonic settings in California corresponding to three large distant earthquakes are selected. The focus of this research is to compare different behaviors between each geothermal field (~10x10 km^2) and their adjacent fault zones (~100x100 km^2) that are split into several subareas. The results will address the following questions: (1) How does seismicity rate change inside and outside the geothermal fields responding to each remote earthquake? (2) How different are the stress fields inside and outside the geothermal fields? (3) How do shallow and deep earthquakes respond to remote triggering? (4) Is there any correlation between the net production rate and the seismicity rate inside the geothermal field? (5) What is the difference in the seismic velocity structure and in situ Vp/Vs inside and outside the geothermal fields? \r\n",

Typically, aftershocks happen within 4-7 rupture distances of the corresponding mainshock, e.g., ~70 km for a magnitude 7 earthquake. However, since the occurrence of the 1992 M 7.3 Landers earthquake in California, remote triggering by large earthquakes at regional distances (hundreds of up to 3000 kilometers) has been globally observed and intensely studied. It has been shown that remote triggering seems to prefer geothermal and volcanic areas, such as the Geysers, Long Valley caldera, Coso, Salton Sea geothermal fields, and Yellowstone National Park, although triggered earthquakes have been documented in other tectonic environments, such as western Nevada, Greece, and the central United States. Most of the previous studies were conducted at spatial scales of hundreds of kilometers and did not differentiate the actual operational geothermal fields with anthropogenic setting and their adjacent fault zones with natural setting. In operational geothermal fields, anthropogenic activities of injecting and extracting fluids can perturb the stress state and affect the distribution of fluids within porous medium, as shown by induced seismicity and rotation of stress orientations. The in-situ conditions responding to remote earthquakes within the geothermal fields may be different from the surrounding areas without geothermal production.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this project, we select four operational geothermal fields that are under active tectonic settings in California and have been observed to respond to large distant earthquakes in previous researches. The focus of our research is to compare different behaviors, if there are any, between each geothermal field (~10&times;10 km<sup>2</sup>) and their adjacent fault zones (~100&times;100 km<sup>2</sup>), corresponding to remote mainshocks. Because accurate earthquake locations are essential for our remote triggering analyses, for each individual study area, we start by developing a high-resolution three-dimensional seismic velocity model to investigate local structural variations and to improve absolute earthquake locations. We then apply waveform cross-correlation and differential time relocation to further sharpen relative event locations. Based on high-precision earthquake location catalog for each study area, we invert for focal solutions using P-wave first motion polarity observations and stress fields by applying the focal mechanism stress algorithm. Seismicity rate change is calculated for each area given a certain time period (e.g., 10, 30, and 100 days) following a remote mainshock relative to the background seismicity using the &beta;-statistics, which compares the difference between the observed and expected seismicity in the time window, normalized by standard deviation of the expected seismicity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our detailed analyses of the seismic and structural distributions and variations show that despite unique features in each study area, in general geothermal fields do respond differently from their vicinity to remote earthquakes due to the stress-state changes that are associated with the anthropogenic activity inside the geothermal field.
