 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a new method for measuring strain in the Earth.  Earth strain is a measure of deformation in the ground from a variety of causes including earthquake processes, volcanoes, tides, and underground fluid  movement (for example, from hydraulic fracturing in oil and gas production).  Detecting Earth strain and mapping its variation in time and location can contribute to models of what is happening deep underground.   Measuring these tiny changes requires a very special sensor and extreme care in attaching it to the Earth.  In this project, a fairly new type of strainmeter will be tested; an optical fiber in a protective cable will be stretched in a trench several hundred meters in length and buried.   Precision laser optics will sense minute changes in the length of the buried optical fiber and hence detect Earth strain.   This type of strainmeter, if successful, will be significantly less expensive than alternative methods of strain measurement and allow wider use of strain measurements to study earthquakes and man-made sources of strain.  As well as making possible a number of new geophysical investigations, this work will advance the technology of optical fiber sensors and likely find applications in other disciplines.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, our group designed and installed a 250-m-long borehole optical fiber vertical strainmeter.  The instrument detects Earth strain by interferometically recording length changes in a tensioned optical fiber held fixed at the top and bottom ends of a long borehole.  Subsequently we developed a prototype horizontal optical fiber strainmeter in a 180-m-long 1-m-deep trench.  When analyzed in the teleseismic and tidal bands, excellent agreement is found between both optical fiber strain records and those from the 730-m long reference laser-vacuum strainmeters sited adjacent to them at our southern California field site, Pi\u00f1on Flat Observatory (PFO). Noting the cost savings from deploying in a trench rather than a borehole, we have identified several important improvements for the horizontal trench sensor, including a dual-fiber thermal compensation scheme, a simple braced-monument coupling system, and a compact, low-cost electro-optical system, that we are confident will make the horizontal sensor perform as well as the borehole sensor.  We propose to integrate these improvements and develop a robust, widely deployable, inexpensive, and sensitive optical fiber long-baseline strainmeter that we will evaluate at PFO.  One of our long term plans is to request additional funding to deploy this type of instrument, once proven, to study Slow Slip Events (SSEs) in Costa Rica where GPS measurements have indicated frequent slow slip, at both deep and shallow levels of the subduction zone.  A coastal deployment of the instrument would be quite close to the zone of shallow SSEs, allowing their recording with unprecedented detail.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, we designed, tested, and deployed an optical fiber strainmeter buried in a shallow trench in the high desert outside Palm Desert, California.  Tectonic forces cause the plates that make up the Earth's crust to slide past one another.   One side of the San Andreas Fault moves north, the other south a few cm each year. Friction causes stress to build up in both plates, to be released in major earthquakes, posing a hazard from shaking.  While such motions can be measured with GPS, an alternative, high precision method is needed in some situations.  In particular, sometimes there is a \"slow-slip\" earthquake, which proceeds so gradually that seismometers cannot detect them, and GPS can only detect them with a lot of averaging.  Our instrument measures strain over a 200 meter long baseline with a precision of about one part in 10 billion for strains that occur from seconds to minutes.\n\n \n\nSome of the interesting strain signals can accumulate very slowly: a few tenths or hundredths of a part per million per year.  That is, strain, defined as the ratio of the change in a baseline?s length to the baseline length itself can be as small as 10 raised to the minus 7 or minus 8 power.  For example, the distance between two markers on the ground separated by 1 km may change by only a tenth or a hundredth of a millimeter in a year.\n\n \n\nWe developed an optical fiber strainmeter to detect such tiny displacements.  The sensor consists of a 200 meter long optical fiber cable stretched elastically between two anchor points.  A laser at one end of the optical fiber sends light to the far end, where it is reflected back to the source.  There it is interfered with a second light beam.  As the length of the optical fiber cable changes, the two interfering light beams go in and out of phase with each other, producing a fluctuating total light level that changes from bright to dim when the cable length changes by only a thousandth of a millimeter.  Special  electronics track these light fluctuations and determine the change in length as a function of time.  One significant problem has been the sensitivity of the optical fiber to temperature change.  Even after burying the cable in a 1 meter deep trench, temperature change can mimic real strain change.  To solve this problem, in this experiment we used two fibers have different temperature coefficients.  By tracking the optical length of both together we can mathematically separate the effects of strain and temperature, and in so doing eliminate the temperature contamination of the data.\n\n \n\nWe installed the sensor in a 200 m long trench about 1 m deep in January of 2018 and we have been recording the length of it ever since.  It faithfully records the small solid Earth tide whose amplitude is only about 50 parts per billion of the length.  It is potentially a new tool capable of detecting slow slip events and we plan to deploy similar sensors near zones suspected to reveal these slow earthquakes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark A Zumberge"
