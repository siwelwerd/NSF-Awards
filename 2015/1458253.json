 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Mississippi State University will provide scholarships to academically talented full-time engineering students with demonstrated financial need who will complete an undergraduate degree in aerospace or industrial engineering. This program will use existing partnerships with local industry to motivate and strengthen the educational experience of the scholars. Through the program scholarship recipients will develop the personal and professional skills needed to be successful in the workplace. The program allows Mississippi State University to offer scholarships to directly address an area of national concern: maintaining US competitiveness in high technology industries. Scholarships for academically strong engineering students, who may not otherwise be able to afford college, will increase the number of engineering graduates prepared to support national, regional, and local companies. The success of the program will produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic growth of Mississippi and the nation.\r\n\r\nScholars will be selected the basis of academic talent and demonstrated financial need. The Aerospace and Industrial Engineering Scholarship Program at Mississippi State University will select six freshmen and six sophomores in the first year of the program. Six additional incoming freshmen will be added annually through year five of the program. The program will focus on supporting students in the areas of academics and professional development. These focus areas will be enabled through a program of mentoring, networking, and enhanced learning environments. The primary features of the program include mentoring of scholars by faculty and industry representatives, enrollment in common courses, and several cohort professional development activities each semester.  Assessment and evaluation will provide insight into the retention benefits of student scholarships, career development activities, and faculty mentoring and advising. Lessons learned and effective practices that emerge from the program evaluation data will be disseminated widely to the engineering education community and help enlarge the knowledge base regarding attributes and practices of successful scholarship programs of this type.",
