Women faculty in science, technology, enginnering and mathematics (STEM) fields at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) are supported to create and sustain new research networks at the international level, thus enabling them to learn about developing and establishing critical research collaborations. \r\n\r\nTwelve women faculty will travel to one of the three upcoming Gender Summits, to be held in South Korea and Germany in 2015 and in Mexico in 2016.  Attendance at the summits and follow-up activities will allow faculty to expand their networks, perspectives, and collaborations in the STEM disciplines which will enrich their research capacity and that of their institutions.  The participants will be able to benefit from an already existing gender-concerned community. This project will create a strong synergy and engagement from a variety of entities and partners, will help STEM faculty better understand international research priorities, resources for developing international research collaborations, and guidelines for U.S. STEM researchers traveling and conducting research abroad. The project has co-funding support from the Global Venture Fund in the Office of International Science and Engineering.",
