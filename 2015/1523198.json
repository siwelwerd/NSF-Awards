The approach consists of cross-document inference, unknown implicit event time prediction and reasoning, cross-document entity coreference resolution with global contexts, centroid entity detection, event attribute extraction and graph-based clustering algorithms for redundancy and contradiction detection, automatic new event clustering and active learning, abstractive summary generation based on extraction results, name translations with comparable corpora and cross-lingual co-training.\r\n\r\nThe experimental research is integrated with educational activities, including project-related curriculum development. The project involves PhD students as well as undergraduate students, engages non-Computer Science undergraduate students in utility evaluation and corpus annotation, and attracts elementary school and high school students by tutorials, regular research seminars and an extensive summer workshop. The results of this project will also have a benefit in E-Science and E-Learning by extracting and tracking the related knowledge from scientific literature and learning materials used in elementary schools and high schools.\r\n\r\nProject results, including open source software, task definition guidelines, annotated corpora, scoring metrics will be disseminated via project Web site (http://nlp.cs.rpi.edu/blendeet.html).",

The approach consists of cross-document inference, unknown implicit event time prediction and reasoning, cross-document entity coreference resolution with global contexts, centroid entity detection, event attribute extraction and graph-based clustering algorithms for redundancy and contradiction detection, automatic new event clustering and zero-shot transfer learning, abstractive summary generation based on extraction results, name translations with comparable corpora and cross-lingual co-training. This project develops state-of-the-art Information Extraction and Knowledge Base Population techniques for techniques for extracting, linking and tracking entities, relations, attributes, events, from unstructured data in a wide range of domains, genres and languages. These methods impose deep influence on the philosophy of combining symbolic semantic representation and distributional semantic representation for IE. This new paradigm extends extraction capability to hundreds of low-resource languages and thousands of entity and event types. The broader impacts of the project are two-fold. The experimental research is linked to educational activities including project-related curriculum development. This project supports and completes seven PhD students, involves non-CS undergraduate students through utility evaluation and corpus annotation, and delivers many conference tutorials, research
