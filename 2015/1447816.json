 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it will propel additive manufacturing into customized healthcare products, reduce environmental impact for manufacturing, and increase efficiency of supply chain fulfillment.  This will in turn result in the creation of lower cost for unique and small batch parts thereby reducing overall cost in these critical areas.   Presently very slow print speed is a universal concern for 3D printing processes.  By substantially speeding up the 3D process and reducing the amount of waste, the economic break-even point, where the cost of 3D printing equals the cost of plastic injection molding, is reached for a much smaller number of parts.  The system cost is also expected to be similar or less than the system cost of present 3D systems while the materials cost is comparable to present methods since very similar powdered thermoplastic materials are used.  The extremely high process speeds achievable with this innovative technology, coupled with the fact that this approach will work with full color thermoplastic materials, makes this a potential game changer for additive manufacturing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project uses the technology found in office laser printers.  This technology has never been used before in rapid prototyping systems.   There have been previous attempts to harness laser printing technology but they have all found it difficult to make parts thicker than about a quarter inch.  This project is a radical innovation in the application of the technology in that it separates two critical functions, transfer and consolidation, that have always been combined in previous attempts to use the technology.   This innovation enables much greater control of both functions in a way that resolves the problem of building thicker parts by making the process look much more like that used in a laser printer.  The innovation also allows the 3D printing of parts to be up to five times faster than any existing method.  The anticipated technical result is to build multi-layer blocks of material quickly and uniformly layer by layer.  The process does also include the capability to support parts during build.  This is accomplished by using a second laser printer engine that creates an image of support powder that is transferred with the build layer image.  The support layer can be dissolved away after the part is built.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nElectrophotography is the technology used to make prints in laser printers and copiers.  The technology places very fine thermoplastic powder onto paper and melts the powder in place in order to form prints or images. Electrophotography has been proposed as a technology that can be used in additive manufacturing.  It has significant advantages over most current additive manufacturing technologies in that it can use engineering plastics, provide faster build rates with high precision, and can make large parts.\n\nOne method of using electrophotography for additive manufacturing involves creating image layers of thermoplastic powder and then placing them successively on top of each other to build up a part.  Each powder layer is simultaneously transferred and fixed in place by a combination of heat and pressure in a process known as \"transfix.\" \n\nThe thermal management of the transfix process when used for additive manufacturing is complex and difficult to manage at the process speeds that can be achieved in normal electrophotography.  For some materials the use of this process gives rise to physical distortion in the parts being built, largely due to the buildup of thermal growth related stresses in the material.\n\nThe goal of the Phase 1 program was to prove a different method for transferring and fixing the powder layer so that less heat would be used and a faster process could be achieved.  The transfer method used was electrostatic transfer.  Electrostatic transfer must use a conductive surface on the part being made.  This may be accomplished by rendering the top surface of the part temporarily or permanently conductive after one or more layers have been transferred.  The fixing or fusing part of the process can then be separate and applied less frequently. \n\nIn order to prove this technology a demonstration system was designed, constructed.  The system enabled thermoplastic powder layers to be electrostatically transferred successively to a block-shaped part.  After a layer was applied, the system applied a layer of conductive material over the top of the deposited layer.  The system included a heater so that layers could also be fused together.  The operation of the system was optimized by varying deposition speed, transfer electrostatic field, and the temperature of the heater.  Following optimization the system was used to create a solid block of thermoplastic that was two centimeters thick, thereby proving the concept.\n\nThis technology will directly address the needs of the rapidly expanding US additive manufacturing marketplace including lower cost production-qualified additive manufacturing systems, the use of standard engineered plastics, lower cost build and support materials, higher processing speeds, larger build-envelopes, and easier ROI justifications.  Overall, this project was a success and the lessons learned during Phase I of this project will help enable us to build and demonstrate a new paradigm in additive manufacturing technology in Phase II.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James Mason"
