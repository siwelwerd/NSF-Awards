The goal of this project is to develop biodegradable surfactants for use in \"chemical herding\" as an effective oil spill response.  In this method of containment, surfactants are sprayed aerially into uncontaminated water immediately outside the spill.  The surfactants lower the air-water surface tension, which causes the floating oil layer to retract and thicken to the point that it can be removed by burning or mechanical skimming.  The investigators will synthesize surfactant herders that are easily degraded and conduct experiments to evaluate their performance in laboratory simulations of chemical herding.\r\n \r\nSurfactants will be synthesized using naturally occurring terpenoids with a unique single carbon branch repeating structure as the hydrophobic tail and a polar head group attached with an ester group that hydrolyzes after the herding action.  The air/water surface tension reduction by the herder will be measured.  An alternative strategy in which the surfactant is used to lower the oil/water interfacial tension, leading to retraction of the oil layer, will also be investigated.  The herding capabilities of the surfactants will be demonstrated in laboratory experiments and compared with the performance of commercially available surfactants currently in use.",

The study established that the polysaccharides can complex to the hydrophilic groups of the herding monolayer, thereby expanding the layer and increasing the surface pressure. This process can be enhanced by the presence of divalent cations which can act as a bridge between the negatively charged polysaccharide (sea polysaccharides are usually negatively charged) and the hydrophilic group of the surfactant if it is negatively charged (e.g. a carboxylate of a fatty acid, as in this study). The complexation also enhances the stability and increases the dilatational viscosity of the monolayer, and both of these effects increase the herding efficacy. Thus amphiphiles which can strongly bind the polysaccharides are a class of molecules which can potentially be effective as chemical herders. In this study, the glycolipid with the hydroxyl groups of the galactose polar part of the amphiphile allowed for strong dipole-charge interactions with the polysaccharide, and the phytanic acid, in the presence of calcium, provided an even greater binding &nbsp;due to cation bridging between the carboxylate and the polysaccharide.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/15/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Charles&nbsp;Maldarelli</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1512458/1512458_10371178_1657918517725_Picture2a--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1512458/1512458_10371178_1657918517725_Picture2a--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Chemical Herding\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1512458/1512458_10371178_1657918517725_Picture2a--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Chemical Herding\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Chemical herding: Surfactant is added to the slick periphery to lower the sea tension causing the slick to contract.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Charles Maldarelli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Charles&nbsp;Maldarelli</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Chemical Herding</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1512458/1512458_10371178_1657918432517_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1512458/1512458_10371178_1657918432517_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"An Oil Spill Spreading on the Sea Surface\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1512458/1512458_10371178_1657918432517_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"An Oil Spill Spreading on the Sea Surface\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An oil spill spreads rapidly because of an imbalance in tensions at the periphery of the spill</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Charles Maldarelli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Charles&nbsp;Maldarelli</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">An Oil Spill Spreading on the Sea Surface</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1512458/1512458_10371178_1657918717265_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1512458/1512458_10371178_1657918717265_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ecofriendly Marine Surfactant Herders\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1512458/1512458_10371178_1657918717265_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ecofriendly Marine Surfactant Herders\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) molecular structure of MGDG, phytanic acid and lambda carrageenan and the proposed complex formed at the air/water interface.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Charles Maldarelli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Charles&nbsp;Maldarelli</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ecofriendly Marine Surfactant Herders</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
