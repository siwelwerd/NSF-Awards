The combination of active research, professional development, and cohort-building will provide the next generation of scientists with a well rounded experience and strong encouragement to continue in one of many areas of science as a career.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on students underrepresented in chemistry and/or those who do not have opportunities for research at their home institution. Students will choose from research projects in analytical, biological, inorganic, organic, physical chemistry, and chemistry education research, with most projects being interdisciplinary, such as in the areas of bioanalytical, bio-inorganic, biophysical, and nanotechnology. Students will also participate in sessions that will cover a number of topics associated with professional development including (i) the development of research proposals and scientific presentations, (ii) understanding ethics in science and (iii) available career paths in chemistry and biochemistry, including science policy.  Activities are designed to prepare students for various job opportunities for chemists and to build a strong cohort. Many undergraduate chemistry and biochemistry students often lack exposure to scientific research career opportunities or opportunities to apply critical thinking skills to open-ended research. The broader impacts of Miami University's Chemistry and Biochemistry REU program are to promote research in chemistry and biochemistry as a career, especially for students underrepresented in the physical sciences.",
