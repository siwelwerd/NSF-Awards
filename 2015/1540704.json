 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an established need for well-qualified teachers in high-need school districts, which are often located in urban communities. New York City, in particular, has a need for teachers of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) who are competent with a diverse and international student population. With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, and in partnership with New York City District 31, as well as seven high schools and two middle schools in that district, the Robert Noyce Teacher Academy at the College of Staten Island (CSI) of City University of New York (CUNY) will recruit undergraduate STEM majors and prepare them to become secondary STEM teachers. The project will support an average of 8 Scholars per year, for a total of 24 new teachers. Each Scholar will receive 2 years of support. Most CSI students are first-generation college students and their families have high expectations. An honors program devoted to preparing high quality teachers of mathematics and science can play an important role in changing the perception of the value and prestige of teaching. Each semester these undergraduate STEM majors will spend 50 hours in a different high-need host school and will assume increasing teaching responsibilities from tutoring individual students, to tutoring groups, to presenting a \"do now\", to teaching a lesson. Through advisement, they will satisfy the requirements for New York State initial teaching certification. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the host school experience, CSI Noyce Scholars will engage in a cohort structure; learning community environment; mentoring by STEM discipline faculty, education faculty, and collaborating teachers; and international professional development opportunities. A longitudinal research study will address questions such as: (1) What is the effect of specific features of the Noyce program? (2) What topics or issues should be added to the Noyce Scholar's college experience to increase preparedness for teaching in a high-needs school? (3) How do changes in assessment and curriculum in the New York City Department of Education impact the CSI teacher education program and the preparation of Noyce Scholars? and (4) What are specific examples of discrepancies between CSI teaching preparation and school practices specifically in District 31? To address these questions, the project team will gather data from Noyce Scholars and collaborating teachers through surveys, portfolios, and the CSI institutional research office.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Robert Noyce Teacher Academy at the College of Staten Island (CSI) has as its principal goal the development of teachers in mathematics and science who are knowledgeable in their majors, who have had significant teaching experiences in high need schools as preparation to be effective teachers from the beginning of their teaching careers and who appreciate  the rigors and rewards of teaching.  Forty-five Noyce graduates are teaching as STEM teachers in high need middle and high schools:  35 mathematics teachers, 3 biology teachers, 4 chemistry teachers and 3 physics teachers.  The retention rate for CSI Noyce in-service teachers is 98% and 100% of the Noyce Scholar graduates who were candidates for tenure in the New York City School System have been awarded tenure.  The graduation, employment, and retention of well-prepared STEM honors majors are the key outcomes of this grant.\n\nThe components of the Robert Noyce Teacher Academy that made these successful outcomes possible were the embedding of the Noyce Teacher Academy in the CSI Teacher Education Honors Academy (one of only 3 honors programs at CSI); significant internships (5 hours per week for 10 weeks for every semester in the program) at local high need middle and high schools; a fieldwork seminar every semester that included school administrators, middle and high school teachers, Noyce Scholars, Teacher Academy students, STEM and education faculty at CSI; the development of collaborations between the host schools and CSI; and scholarships that enabled the Noyce scholars to graduate without debt.  Principals have emphasized that many of the Noyce graduates that they hired had been thoroughly vetted through the host school internship program where they could be observed in real classroom setting.  The Noyce graduates have cited this extensive clinical experience as critical in the successful transition from pre-service to in-service teacher and in determining what school culture they preferred.\n\nThere is now a community of CSI Noyce graduates teaching at 12 high need high schools and 8 high need middle schools in Staten Island and Brooklyn.  These Noyce graduates serve as collaborating teachers for the host school internships and mentors for newly hired Noyce graduates in their schools.  They are the best advertisement for this program and are successful recruiters for applicants to the Teacher Academy.  They are proof that honors STEM students can become excellent teachers.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jane Coffee"
