 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cytokinesis is the final stage in cell division in which the single mother cell is physically separated into two daughter cells, and is essential for the normal proliferation and differentiation of cells of every form of life.  Historically, studies of cytokinesis have focused on just two groups of organisms: the animals, fungi and their relatives, whose cells divide by forming an inward-growing \"cleavage furrow\", and the land plants, whose cells divide by forming an outward-growing \"cell-plate\".  Thus, there is currently an unresolved paradox at the heart of cell biology: by what mechanism did the common ancestor of modern cells divide, and how did that mechanism evolve into the seemingly very different mechanisms seen today?  This project will exploit the experimental advantages and favorable evolutionary position of the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (which is closely related to land plants but divides by forming a cleavage furrow like animals) to help elucidate the common core mechanisms that underlay cytokinesis in ancestral cells and are still shared in modern organisms despite their superficial differences.  Understanding these core mechanism will provide a better understanding not only of animal, fungal, and plant cells, but also of a broad range of other cell types that have been largely ignored by cell biologists but are of enormous ecological and economic importance.  In addition to basic knowledge, this project will provide new experimental tools that should be valuable both in basic research and in applied studies (particularly in biofuels development), and it will provide opportunities for postdoctoral, graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students (including students from underrepresented groups) to learn genetics, molecular biology, and cell biology as a prelude to continuing in careers in science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on elucidation of the mechanisms by which Chlamydomonas cells form cleavage furrows for cell division without a contractile actomyosin ring (CAR), a structure formed of filamentous (F) actin, type II myosin, and other proteins, which has long been thought to be necessary for furrow formation in animal and fungal cells.  However,it is now clear both that many cells that normally have a CAR can divide without it and that most eukaryotic cells in other phylogenetic groups divide by forming furrows but have no myosin-II, so there must another driver(s) of this process. To elucidate the mechanisms of furrowing in Chlamydomonas and the associated cytoskeletal functions, three interrelated aims will be pursued.  (1) Improved methods for expressing tagged proteins of interest and for microscopic visualization of cytokinesis processes and cytoskeletal dynamics will be developed and used to clarify the details of these processes and the questions to be asked at the molecular level.  (2) A combination of microscopy, biochemistry, genetics, and transcriptome analyses will be used to investigate the possible role of F-actin in the cleavage furrow and the mechanisms and roles of the recently discovered dramatic transcriptional regulatory response to actin depolymerization.  Similar approaches will be used to investigate the function(s) of the single Chlamydomonas septin protein, which is also expected (from comparisons to other organisms) to be involved in cytokinesis.  (3) Imaging-based methods and high-throughput platforms will be used to identify mutants defective in cytokinesis and/or cytoskeletal dynamics; characterization of these mutants should help to reveal the underlying mechanisms of furrow formation and cytoskeletal behavior through the cell cycle.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:  This project has addressed a centrally important question in cell biology, namely how cells form \"cleavage furrows\" during cytokinesis, the last stage in cell division.  A widely accepted model for this process proposes that the force for furrow ingression comes from the interaction of actin and myosin protein filaments, much as in muscle.  However, this model has now been challenged by numerous findings that it seemingly cannot explain, not least of which is the observation that most types of cells other than animal and fungal cells form furrows during division but do not possess the type of myosin protein that would allow the muscle-like action.  An example of such a cell type is the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, which was the focus of this project.  Effective study of cleavage-furrow formation in Chlamydomonas required the development of several new molecular-genetic and cell-biological methods; these methods have already been valuable also in studies of different problems and should see even wider applicability in the future.  Elucidation of the possible roles of actin and other cytoskeletal elements in Chlamydomonas cytokinesis also required a prior untangling of a complicated system for actin homeostasis involving two distinct actins and regulatory systems controlling both the transcription of their genes and their turnover during stresses to the actin system.  Subsequent studies then revealed that cells could form cleavage furrows in the complete absence of actin, although such furrow formation was less efficient than in normal cells and failed at the final abscission stage. These results should now force a re-evaluation of the prevailing model for cleavage-furrow formation.  In contrast, another cytoskeletal element, the microtubules, was found to be essential for furrow formation.  Future studies will focus on elucidating the exact role(s) of the microtubules, what exactly actin does to facilitate both the beginning and the completion of furrow formation, and the possible roles of the systems for generating new cell surface at the site of furrow ingression.\n\nBroader Impacts:  Because Chlamydomonas is widely used to develop methods that are then applied to algae used directly in biofuel production, the new methods and ideas developed in this project are quite likely to be valuable in such applications.  This project also helped to nourish the research career of a very talented senior postdoctoral fellow, who is now well positioned to seek an independent faculty position.  The project also provided a research opportunity for a very promising undergraduate who has subsequently entered a Ph.D. program at a major university, and it provided summer research experience (and specific ideas for later classroom work) to two high-school teachers\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/18/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John R Pringle"
