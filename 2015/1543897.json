 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research in the biological and health sciences has been characterized by the introduction of novel technologies for investigations of molecular machineries, where a huge amount of data coming from experiments or medical practice has been stored in novel databases; new algorithms for studying functions, structures, interactions of proteins and genes, and classification of patients into disease subgroups that shares a common biological basis of diseases have been introduced; and almost all \"omics\" areas have been touched by new data sources with large repositories, new computational tools and applications powered by new algorithms.  The ACM Special Interest Group on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, and Health Informatics (SIGBio; http://www.sigbioinformatics.org/) was instituted in 2010 with the aim of focusing on research on bioinformatics data management topics, with a focus on bridging computational, statistical and mathematical sciences with biology and biomedicine.    The ACM-Bioinformatics and Computational Biology meeting will provide a platform for researchers to bridge interdisciplinary research and also provide mechanisms to promote diverse and broad participation, especially through travel support for graduate students and young investigators.",
