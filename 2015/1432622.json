 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bay Path College will increase the academic success, engagement and retention of undergraduate women enrolled in baccalaureate degree programs in Biology, Forensic Science and Cybersecurity. The purpose of this design and development research project is to refine, expand and pilot strategies that will lead to improved learning, engagement and retention outcomes, particularly among low-income, minority and first-generation college students.  The project seeks to implement and extend recommendations for effective teaching in the biological sciences promulgated through the Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education Initiative.  This will include an expansion of course redesign and faculty professional development to implement active, student-centered teaching and learning strategies in upper-level science courses, and integrate core concepts and competencies throughout the curriculum.\r\n\r\nProject activities will be coordinated through the new Bay Path College Center of Excellence for Women in Science, a facility designed to nurture women's scientific career aspirations and ensure they develop the experience, skills and confidence to be competitive, to succeed and to thrive in their professional lives. The project will also build upon successful results from a prior NSF grant through the Scholarships in STEM (S-STEM) Program.  Broadening participation of students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM will be achieved through high impact practices, including early student research, mentoring by faculty and STEM professionals, academic enrichment and career exploration through internships and other experiential learning opportunities.  These strategies are expected to improve the academic achievement, engagement and retention of all participating students.  Formative and summative evaluation will address two questions (1) Does course redesign through implementation of Vision and Change recommendations lead to improved student learning outcomes in these courses at Bay Path College?  And (2) Does broadening student participation in high impact learning experiences through the project lead to increased student engagement and retention in STEM in the first two years, and are there differences for low-income Pell-eligible, minority and first-generation college students?   Descriptive and inferential statistics will be used to determine the effectiveness of course redesign on student learning.  Students will participate in the National Survey of Student Engagement during their first and final years of college.  Dissemination of new materials and results will be presented at national meetings such as the High Impact Technology Exchange and the National Association of Biology Educators conferences.  Journal articles will be submitted to The American Biology Teacher.",
