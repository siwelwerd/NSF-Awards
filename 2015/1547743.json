 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent developments in software for solving nonlinear polynomial systems may provide many scientists and engineers the tools needed to solve key problems in their research. To facilitate the training necessary to make best use of these powerful tools, the PIs will run a workshop May 23-25, 2016 at the University of Notre Dame. In addition to training, the workshop will also provide cross-fertilization between the mathematical sciences and other areas of science and engineering by bringing together a diverse group of researchers and software developers to exchange both knowledge and challenges. These interactions will spur practical research in applications while highlighting needs for future algorithm development. \r\n \r\nSince they arise in many areas of science and engineering, several approaches have been developed for solving polynomial systems. The software package Bertini, which is being redeveloped in C++ and Python for modularity and scriptability, implements key numerical algebraic geometric algorithms for solving and manipulating polynomial systems.  This workshop will bring together a wide range of computational scientists and practitioners to discuss recent progress and current challenges in software, algorithms, and applications of numerical algebraic geometry. This interdisciplinary workshop will include small group discussions, hands-on demonstrations of Bertini, and sessions focused on developing Bertini modules related to participants' particular interests.",
