Additional information is available on the seminar web site  http://www.math.purdue.edu/~mdd/Wabash/\r\n\r\nThe Wabash seminar and miniconference series, which is organized by a consortium of Midwestern mathematics departments, has for over forty years provided a catalyst for the stimulation and dissemination of significant contributions to a wide range of areas of modern analysis, with a primary focus on functional and harmonic analysis. The format for Wabash events provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
