 "awd_abstract_narration": "In a world where complexity of tasks abounds, teamwork is the norm rather than the exception. Formation of effective teams is therefore vital in nearly any organization, and across a broad array of domains, such as large-scale software projects, course projects, military operations, construction projects, and search-and-rescue tasks. Successful team formation, however, hinges on having knowledge about how individuals working on a team complement each other in service of a task, their ability to work together, as well as potentially misaligned preferences about goals that the different tasks may achieve. The goal of this project is to develop a general-purpose team formation exchange service, leveraging new theoretical foundations for designing team formation mechanisms when the abilities and preferences of prospective teammates are uncertain.  Such an exchange would significantly improve the ability of organizations to dynamically form agile and efficient project teams, reducing conflict and better aligning individual and organizational incentives. This project considers an exceptionally challenging conceptual and technical problem of mechanism design in the context of team formation in service of a set of goals. The core conceptual challenge lies in modeling the problem in sufficient detail to capture considerations such as achievement of sub-goals by tasks, agent capabilities, task requirements, and agent preferences about goals and teammates, but avoiding unnecessary detail to maintain tractability. The proposed research offers a novel modeling framework aimed at balancing these two considerations. \r\n\r\nThe technical contributions involve both novel theoretical treatment of the problem, such as characterizations of novel extensions of mechanisms from related domains, including combinatorial assignment, entirely new mechanisms tailored to the problem at hand, and algorithmic contributions to optimal scalable automated mechanism design leveraging specific problem structure. Additionally, the proposed research will blend experimental economics research with contributions in theoretical and computational economics by using human subject experiments as one of the means to evaluate the developed mechanisms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project had two major goals: 1) to develop economic mechanisms for team/coalition formation, with good incentive, coalitional stability, efficiency, and fairness properties, and 2) To develop efficient computational implementations of these mechanisms.  Additionally, the broader goals of the project involved foundational advances in economic decision making using computational tools and platforms, and development of educational materials and outreach activities in this area.\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary and highly collaborative project team was comprised of a Computer Science professor (the PI), two Economics professors (including the co-PI and her colleague), two computer science PhD students, a PhD student in an interdisciplinary PhD program at Vanderbilt University, two Economics PhD students, 1 computer science MS student, and 3 undergraduates.  This team enabled a series of advances at the intersection of economics and computation that would have been impossible without the strong interdisciplinary interaction.  This interaction also had considerable benefits to the involved students, both graduate and undergraduate.  In particular, two of the PhD students, and all undergraduate students, have graduated and moved on to successful careers (for example, two of the PhD students financially supported by this project completed their PhD in the summer of 2019; one is currently a post doc at Stanford, and the other is a researcher at Amazon).\n\n\nOn the research front, the project partially supported 20 top-tier publications, with two additional papers still under review.  The research advances both directly address the major project goals, as well as the broader project aims.  In particular, the project team has developed a novel mechanism for team formation, Rotating Proposer Mechanism, that is based on a novel model of team formation as a non-cooperative game of complete information.  This game proceeds through a series of proposals by players, with proposers following an exogenously specified order (e.g., random).  When it's a player's turn, they propose a team.  At that point, all the prospective team members have the chance to accept or reject the proposal, which they proceed to do sequentially.  We prove that this game has several appealing properties, including that it implements IMS (iterative matching of soulmates)---that is soulmates (teams the members of which prefer to be together; the iterative aspect is that we can apply this concept iteratively, with new soulmates emerging as players are matched).  However, in general the outcome of this game need not be Pareto optimal.  Our key result is then to show that a particular way of constructing the proposer order, in which each proposer can propose a sufficient number of times, always induces a Pareto optimal outcome.\n\n\nWhile the analysis above pertains to the non-cooperative complete information game, the next key insight is that we can implement the subgame perfect equilibrium of this game as an algorithm in a team formation mechanism, where preferences over teams are reported to the mechanism.  On the positive side, if all players are matched by IMS, this mechanism is strategyproof and yields a unique stable outcome.  On the other hand, in general this mechanism yields several challenges, some economic, others computational.  The economic challenge is that, in general, the mechanism is not strategyproof.  We use a computational implementation to assess precisely how severe this issue is, and found that in most settings, only relatively few players have an incentive to lie about preferences.  In addition, our experimental evaluation demonstrates that this mechanism yields high quality outcomes in terms of social welfare (stronger than Pareto efficiency, but assuming we translate ordinal preferences into cardinal), and outcomes that are much more equitable than other mechanisms, such as serial dictatorship. They key computational challenge is that a subgame perfect equilibrium of the game is intractable to compute.  We addressed this through a combination of heuristic procedures (e.g., IMS-based preprocessing) and approximations (demonstrating that we don't lose very much in the economic properties as a result).\n\n\nAs a part of both the broader impacts, as well as demonstrating computational feasibility, we deployed the developed team formation mechanism as an open platform on heroku.  This platform has now been used for forming project teams in courses taught at Vanderbilt University and Washington University in St. Louis.\n\n\nFinally, the project enabled the development of several innovating curriculum advances.At Vanderbilt University, it provided material for a newly developed Computational Economics course taught by the PI.  At Washington University in St. Louis, it provided materials for the course on AI and Society the PI has developed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/13/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yevgeniy Vorobeychik"
