 "awd_abstract_narration": "An important component for producing successful outcomes in engineering design and innovation is individuals' analytical problem solving abilities. These can be greatly enhanced by means of modeling and simulation processes. Yet, educational strategies for incorporating modeling and simulation skills into undergraduate disciplinary courses have not kept pace with equipping undergraduate engineering students with computational skills needed to solve problems in existing or new application fields.\r\n \r\nThis CAREER project seeks to understand and enhance modeling and simulation practices in undergraduate engineering education. Specifically, this project will identify and validate pathways that students may follow as they progress toward mastery of modeling and simulation skills now needed for workplace engineering readiness. Outcomes will also include factors that contribute to, or prevent, effective teaching and learning with modeling and simulation. As part of the effort, the project will explore the following research questions: \r\n\r\n(1) How do students experience model-based reasoning in the context of modeling and simulation practices? \r\n(2) How do students experience problem solving in the context of modeling and simulation practices? \r\n(3) How the observed patterns of students? use of computational tools support or hinder student model-based reasoning when problem solving (derived from Q1 & Q2)?\r\n4) What are different trajectories and levels of sophistication of modeling and simulation practices in engineering as evidenced by student performances and understandings?\r\n\r\nThe broader significance and importance of this project is in the way it can increase the chances for engineering discovery and innovation success, helping the nation take advantage of the role of modeling and simulation sooner, better, and with greater confidence. The project engages engineering faculty, undergraduate and graduate students in classroom design-based research and also provides outreach and dissemination through professional development of K-12 teachers and instructors at community colleges. The project overlaps with NSF's strategic goals of transforming the frontiers through preparation of an engineering workforce with new capabilities and expertise. Additionally, NSF's goal of innovating for society is enabled by supporting the development of innovative learning theories and systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This CAREER project increased an understanding of how integrating modeling, simulation, and computation practices into core engineering curricula promote model-based reasoning.\nIntellectual Merit: This project established an integrated, evidence-based research and education program centered on how people develop model-based reasoning by engaging in modeling and simulation practices.  An initial three-round Delphi study with 37 experts from industry and academia identified (1) a learning progression of modeling and simulation practices that could guide design instruction in engineering education through research with engineering professionals.  This finding provided a foundation for curriculum and assessment design that were used as data collection and dissemination methods throughout the project.\nRegarding new knowledge about how students engage in modeling and simulation practices, this project determined: (2) instances of when and how students benefit from and struggle when engaging in modeling and simulation practices; (3) the interplay between students use of cognitive and metacognitive knowledge when they engage in computational modeling and simulation strategies; and (4) students orchestration of their domain knowledge and meta-representational knowledge throughout the model-based reasoning process. These findings were critical in providing insights into how students learn with computational tools and the computational thinking processes needed when creating such tools. \nAs a result, the research to education outcomes focused on identifying learning methods and pedagogical supports to promote student learning.  Specifically, this project developed, tested, and implemented (5) learning strategies and pedagogical methods in the form of worked-out examples, in-code commenting strategies, and the implementation of the use-modify-create pedagogy as scaffolding methods. These teaching and learning practices have effectively prepared the next generation of scientists and engineers capable of addressing complex interdisciplinary problems.\nBroader impacts: The curricular materials and findings of the research associated with this project have had a direct impact on mechanical, electrical, materials, civil, and biomedical engineering disciplines. The outcomes of this research also include a curricular framework (i.e., content, assessment, and pedagogy) for designing learning interventions for integrating computational modeling and simulation practices and design principles for promoting model-based reasoning.\nContent: The proposed learning progression can directly inform learning objectives related to computational, modeling, and simulation practices. This learning progression represents a logical roadmap that can guide the coherent development of curriculum, assessment, and instruction.  The proposed learning progression has three levels of achievement, each of them organized in modeling and simulation practices consisting of constructing models, using models, evaluating models, and revising models. \nAssessment: Paired with this learning progression, we have also identified assessment guidelines of these practices by applying guidance from the Pellegrino assessment triangle focused on cognition, observation, and interpretation corners.  Regarding cognition, we focused on model-based reasoning as the primary intended learning outcome. We connected the cognition and the observation corner through the proposed learning progression.  That is, the observations need to elicit modeling and simulation practices from students, such as constructing computational models, using computational models, evaluating computational models, and revising computational models.  The overt processes students followed, and the artifacts created throughout the modeling and simulation process become overt processes that make explicit the observations we want to capture.  For interpretation of the observations, we proposed the common practice of using rubrics evaluating criteria based on specified levels of performance. \nPedagogy: To deliver and facilitate the instructional process, we proposed a computational cognitive apprenticeship consisting of four design principles, each of them grounded in evidence-based practices:\n\nContent design principle: Combine disciplinary domain knowledge with modeling and simulation practices, techniques, and tools\nMethod design principle: Provide scaffolding to students in the form of code snippets, test cases, and worked-out examples. Consider providing students agency to select the scaffolding they need or fade the scaffolding progressively.\nSequencing design principle: Enact the problem-solving process as steps for guiding the modeling and simulation process.\nSociology design principle: Implement pedagogical approaches that promote collaboration within a context or culture of disciplinary practices.\n\nActive dissemination occurred via design-based research studies that involved more than 1,500 undergraduate science and engineering students exposed to modeling and simulation practices as part of the research and research to practice components of this project.
