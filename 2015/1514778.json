 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coral reefs are diverse and valuable ecosystems; however, coral reefs are experiencing degradation due to many stressors, including ocean warming. As a result of ocean warming, corals become stressed and can bleach. Coral bleaching occurs when the symbiotic algae living in the coral tissues are expelled, causing the coral to appear white and lose its major source of food. Previous studies show that bleaching negatively impacts coral reproduction. However, it remains unknown if different timings of bleaching events equally affect coral reproduction. Additionally, the transgenerational impacts of coral bleaching have never been quantified. This project will assess the impact of bleaching at different times of the reproductive cycle on reproduction, larval survival, larval dispersal, and juvenile survival and growth. This research will be conducted at Sesoko Marine Station in Okinawa, Japan in collaboration with Dr. Saki Harii at University of the Ryukyus. Dr. Harii is an expert is coral ecology and will provide field access and facilities for the research. The research outputs will contribute to transform existing predictions of the persistence of coral populations.\r\n\r\nCoral populations recover from disturbances through asexual and sexual reproduction; however, as increased temperature affects coral reproduction, larval survival and dispersal potential the transgenerational effects of bleaching will dictate the future rates of recovery. This project will assess the transgenerational impacts of coral bleaching in the brooding coral Pocillopora damicornis. Larval survival and competency dynamics data will be used to calibrate dispersal models and project self-recruitment and dispersal potential. It is hypothesized that bleaching will decrease the energy allocated to eggs, leading to reduced larval survival and potentially alter rates of acquisition of competency. These changes in survival and competency dynamics would have significant impacts on dispersal potential and recruitment success, thus influencing population dynamics and recovery rates. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",
