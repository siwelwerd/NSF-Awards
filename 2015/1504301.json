 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate the physical properties of living tissue that are important in determining the tissue curvature. The PI will quantitatively determining the number and location of defects in ordered tissues and will develop a mechanical theory of the defect distribution that can be compared with experiment. This constitutes the first quantitative study of tissue curvature as a determining factor of structural organization. Understanding of the morphology and morphogenesis of organisms has grown tremendously based on recent advances in biological and genetic research. Yet, few attempts have been undertaken to describe the development and structure of organs or tissues through quantitative mechanics. The results of this work will be equally applicable to all curved tissue layers that show a degree of order, including cancer cell acini, whose morphology is important for the development of cancer, as well as developing embryos in the morula and blastula stages. As curvature induces constraints on the degree of order, it may play a role in symmetry breaking and polarization, and thus in the earliest patterning of the embryo. Describing a direct influence of mechanical forces on cell development will be a fundamental advance towards a better understanding of morphogenesis and tissue formation in the context of both diagnostics and therapy, e.g. tissue regeneration or cancer. Data acquisition will employ the help of undergraduate students as well as outreach to high school students through the existing Bugscope project at Illinois, thus connecting with the broader public through a visually fascinating and interdisciplinary project.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on insect eyes as a concrete example of an ordered tissue structure, because of the extreme regularity of the compound eye, the large number of individual eyes (ommatidia) in the compound eye, and the relative ease with which the structure can be quantitatively analyzed. Using both SEM imaging and confocal microscopy, the goals are to (i) determine the complete microstructure of the ommatidia and (ii) determine the macrostructure (global shape and curvature) of the eye, in order to (iii) compare the number and position of ommatidial defects with those predicted by the mechanical theory of curved patterned surfaces. The existing theory of defect placement on curved surfaces (developed for a limited number of examples from solid state physics) will be adapted to the more general shapes encountered in insect eyes. Both numerical simulations and analytical theory will be developed. While Drosophila wild-type and mutant eyes in mature and pupal stages will be the main focus, the variety of insect eye sizes and shapes in different species is an asset to this study.",

In domain matter, the bulk material consists of space-filling mesoscopic subunits (domains) that could be bubbles (in foams), droplets (in emulsions) or cells (in biological tissues). Focusing on single layers of such subunits (quasi-2D geometry), we ask how much the visual information of a snapshot (capturing the shape and geometry of domains as well as the structure in which they aggregate together) reveals about the physics, mechanics, and function of the material as a whole. The strategy here is to find geometric and/or statistical signatures that correlate reliably with a quantity, usually taken to be the mechanical energy functional of the system, from which material properties such as stiffness or stability follow. Ideally, the correlation allows us to bypass the details of computing the energy functional and classify a particular structure as e.g. marginally stable or ultrastable directly from the structural signatures.</p>\n<p>We worked with simulations of domain systems as well as with experimental data obtained from foams and tissues. In the eye of developing <em>Drosophila</em> fruit flies, the facets make a regular honeycomb pattern, which can be perturbed by individual defects (facets with fewer or more than six neighbors). We developed a theory that relates the occurrence of these defects to flaws in the size regulation of facets, and could extract signatures from the defect distribution that revealed an overall size gradient in the facets previously unknown to biologists, an example of predictive power from quantitative visual analysis.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, simulations of completely disordered foam and tissue systems discovered two ways of assessing the value of the mechanical energy functional directly from limited visual information: The first is geometric in nature, where counting and measuring the length of only the shortest edges between quasi-2D domains can be translated into a quantitative prediction of mechanical energy. The second is statistical in nature, where moments of a statistical distribution of sizes and neighbor numbers are predictive of the energy functional. In either case, we find very good correlation regardless of the size distribution, the adhesion properties of the tissue, or the particular interaction energy between domains. Thus, the theory allows bypassing the detailed computation of mechanical energy and characterizes low-energy and high-energy states universally. This was directly verified in experiments with foam bubbles.</p>\n<p>We investigated a striking example of material properties depending on structural details of defects when analyzing the mechanical energy of a <em>curved</em> surface with domains. We developed a theory that predicts accurately from information of the surface shape when it is energetically favorable to leave all defects at the boundary of the open curved surface, and when it is favorable to move at least one defect into the bulk of the surface, thus disturbing the overall symmetry but favoring a more strongly curved shape over a less strongly curved one. This selection of shape by defect structure is important for the morphogenesis of insect eyes (where a regular structure is needed for the processing of optical information, but curvature is needed for field of view), but also in the formation of virus capsids (made from regular molecular units, but needing defects to close into their proper shape).</p>\n<p>Predictions of preferred global shapes and global properties using shape and structure information from local domains is a very general principle useful in many contexts. Among the vast number of possible equilibrium states in a domain system, the universal principles uncovered during this project establish diagnostic principles to identify rare states of desired mechanical energy and thus function. This is a fundamental advance in intellectual concepts applicable, among other fields, in materials science, mechanical engineering, and bioengineering, potentially establishing an entirely new concept of continuum mechanical energy dependent on statistical variables of structure, rather than strain. As a set of inherently non-invasive methods of diagnostics, the tools developed here may also have significant broader impact on medical diagnostics of pathological changes in tissues that can be correlated with function through the morphological indicators quantified in this work. The long-term vision here is reliable diagnostics from a snapshot of cellular structure only.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/21/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sascha&nbsp;Hilgenfeldt</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1504301/1504301_10395981_1647877902839_out_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1504301/1504301_10395981_1647877902839_out_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Diagnosing Structure\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1504301/1504301_10395981_1647877902839_out_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Diagnosing Structure\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic illustrating the general aim of the project: Diagnosing material properties and function via morphological measures obtained from visual information works through quantitative correlation with mechanical energy, but ideally allows for bypassing the details of that energy functional.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">own copyright</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sascha&nbsp;Hilgenfeldt</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Diagnosing Structure</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1504301/1504301_10395981_1647878870735_out_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1504301/1504301_10395981_1647878870735_out_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Drosophila eye Structure\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1504301/1504301_10395981_1647878870735_out_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Drosophila eye Structure\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pupal retina pattern of facets in Drosophila melanogaster.
