 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. Harris Stowe State College will boost retention of students entering the Biology program by adopting the innovative learning experience idea of using authentic research questions to teach foundational biology laboratory concepts. This project will infuse the Biology program with Biotechnology courses that will help prepare students for continuing education and to become part of the Biotechnology workforce hub in the St. Louis region. The BIO-BOOST project will focus on engagement and retention of early-stage (first and second-year) Biology students by creating interactions among students and faculty.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the BIO-BOOST targeted infusion project is to increase the retention of students entering the Biology program at Harris Stowe State College through engagement in biotechnology focused student-centered curriculum and projects based on authentic research experiences. The objectives of the BIO-BOOST project include: 1) implementation of a research-based Biotechnology curriculum; 2) creation of on-campus Biotechnology research experiences for freshmen; and 3) increased retention and networking of undergraduate students entering the Biology program. The project plans also include updating the Harris-Stowe Biology program with modern Biotechnology lab equipment.",
