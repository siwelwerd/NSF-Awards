The week-long conference is designed to teach young researchers some of the tools they'll need to know to be productive members of their research communities. More information can be found at http://java.ugent.be/yggt4/.\r\n\r\nThis conference will feature four minicourses (on Hyperbolic groups, outer automorphisms of free groups, and buildings) and seven research talks, all aimed at the level of graduate students and other young researchers.",
