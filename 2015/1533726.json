This award includes support for: a) PI Hinzman, the US delegate to IASC, to participate on behalf of the US Arctic science community on the IASC Council; b) travel support for US representatives to each of the five working groups appointed through the US National Academies process; and c) travel support for US representatives of the IASC?s Data Standing Committee. The US representative to the SAON Observations and Networks Committee should also participate in this meeting with funds provided through this award. IASC facilitates international science development through workshop, networks, planning meetings, and early-career science support. It promotes and facilitates international research activities with an emphasis on issues that not only cross national boundaries, but also cross disciplines and even timescales. National support is essential to ensure the US maintains a leadership role in planning and coordinating these research efforts in the international sphere.\r\n\r\nThis is an important part of the US contribution to this international effort and the Arctic Section finds the plan fits well with section goals. Staff recommends an award at the requested amount.",

These changes cascade throughout the entire global climate system, impacting weather and ecosystems as well as commerce and geopolitics at an unprecedented rate. Arctic mid-latitude linkages are poorly understood, yet resulting weather extremes impact millions. How do Arctic change and Arctic Amplification affect atmosphere and ocean circulation and connections to the global climate system?

Coastal erosion and methane leakages from permafrost are increasing. The rates of change today are making the combination of traditional knowledge and predictive research a necessary step to sustainable development in the Arctic. Our predictive skill of local, regional and global processes must be improved by the establishment of a sustained and participatory observing network, which includes community-based monitoring.
