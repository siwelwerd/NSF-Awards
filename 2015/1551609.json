 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large-scale, innovative science and engineering requires collaboration across geographically-distributed, multidisciplinary teams; however, it is very difficult for projects to maintain intellectual cohesion, tight coordination, and integration necessary to manage scalable ?virtual? work that is distributed.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to help teams to succeed - maximizing efficiency, effectiveness, and innovativeness. This proposal is to develop the capacity for leaders of Centers, Institutes, Labs and other collaborations to plan and pursue transformative research agendas in order to truly create breakthroughs in smart and connected health, cyberphysical systems, smart cities, cybersecurity, big data, environmental sustainability, and across the domains of basic research. Training in design and management of such collaborations will be provided and tools and techniques will be developed. This work will draw on lessons learned from organization science to develop a customized curriculum to help large-scale science and engineering teams effectively and efficiently collaborate at this scale. Using the developed materials, the first of a series of workshops targeting potential principle investigators interested in large-scale Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE)-related projects will be conducted in the spring of 2016.",
