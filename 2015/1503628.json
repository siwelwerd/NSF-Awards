 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fossils provide our only direct evidence of past biodiversity and how individual organisms to ecosystems have responded to past and long-term environmental change. This project fills a major gap in the documentation of past environmental change, making available digitized data from the especially rich fossil record of the eastern Pacific marine invertebrate communities of the Cenozoic, the 66 million years that have passed since the extinction of the dinosaurs. Digitization and integration of these data will foster increased accessibility, efficient analysis to understand past change, the identification of factors involved in that change, and enable predictions for how current biodiversity may be impacted by future change. Development of virtual fieldwork experiences will assist stakeholders and educators in understanding how field data and fossil collections are used to infer past ecosystem and environmental conditions.\r\n\r\nThe data currently exist as a vast collection of fossil specimens and printed materials distributed among multiple natural history collections: this project involves 7 primary institutions, one small collection and one federal institution and will integrate this digitized specimen data with the other two ongoing fossil networks through the web portal iDigPaleo, expanding the resource for fossil invertebrate information by spanning over 500 million years. This wealth of data will provide resources not only to researchers, but will be made available to K-16 educators, government, industry, and the general public. Through the national resource (iDigBio) these data will be integrated with information on modern organisms providing the means to understand important questions on niches, environmental change, transitions in sea levels, etc. Additionally, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in the modern uses of natural history collections. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).",

The goal of EPICC was to document our knowledge of the marine invertebrates belonging to ecological communities over the past 66 million years along the Pacific coastlines of the Americas, stretching from Alaska to Chile. To accomplish this we assembled a team of multiple American paleontological institutions that house the largest fossil collections from this region and time period. The California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco was founded in 1853 and through numerous expeditions and donation has been building its EPICC collection since. The invertebrate fossil collections are housed within the Geology section of the Academy, and EPICC presented an enormous opportunity to digitize those collections, making them accessible to the world?s scientific community, and the general public.</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Our specific tasks were, in cooperation with our partner institutions, to develop workflows that would both maximize efficiency and standardize procedures throughout the project participants. The project began with a meeting of all the institutions at the Academy in September, 2015. Since that time we have focused the actual tasks of digitizing information, i.e. converting printed and handwritten information about fossils in the Academy?s collection into electronic form, photographing specimens, and databasing all the information so that it is both easily accessible and comprehensible. The project ended in July, 2021. The following list outlines the major accomplishments.</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">1. <span style=\"font-weight: 600;\">32,944 specimen lots</span> contained material relevant to the EPICC project. A ?lot? is a collection of specimens collected at the same place and time, often by the same collector. Graduate students and technical staff were trained to identify relevant lots, and to verify their spatial and temporal data.</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">2. Those same students and staff were also trained to determine the biological classifications of the fossil specimens in those lots, often to the level of species, and always to at least the level of genus. E.g. modern humans belong to genus <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">Homo</span> and species <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">sapiens</span>. <span style=\"font-weight: 600;\">280,491 fossils</span> were classified in this manner.</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">3. Among those specimens were two categories of particular importance, <span style=\"font-weight: 600;\">type specimens</span> and <span style=\"font-weight: 600;\">voucher specimens</span>. Type specimens are those that the description of a species are based on, and they form the basis for all subsequent identifications of fossil specimens to that species. They are the backbone of biodiversity science. Voucher specimens are those that have been used as data in a scientific project or publication, and are records of the work?s validity. <span style=\"font-weight: 600;\">3,934 type</span> and <span style=\"font-weight: 600;\">7.800 voucher</span> specimens were verified and their data digitized for the EPICC project.</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">4. Another special category of specimens was the fossil echinoid collection. Echinoids include animals such as sea urchins and sand dollars. These animals are important members of marine communities, and the Academy?s collection is one of the largest in the world. <span style=\"font-weight: 600;\">2,237 specimens from 815 lots</span> were digitized.</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">5. In addition to the classification data of specimens, perhaps the most important data about of fossil is the location at which it was discovered. This allows scientists to both determine the geography of the location at the time when the animal was alive, as well as assist in determine the correct geological age of the specimen. A major effort of the project was therefore <span style=\"font-weight: 600;\">georeferencing</span>, the process of using both collection data as well as the identity of the specimen to locate as specifically as possible the site of collection. The task involved a combination of human sleuthing, machine intelligence and databasing. <span style=\"font-weight: 600;\">10,159</span> individual localities were referenced.</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">6. One of the major goals of EPICC was to present, in addition to digitial data, photographic images of specimens to both scientists and the general public. Images often make rapid identification of fossils possible, and this interest is of course not limited to scientists. Early in the project a imaging protocol was developed and shared with other EPICC partners in order to produce standardized types of images. A total of <span style=\"font-weight: 600;\">9,856 specimens</span> were photographed at high resolution for the EPICC project. Making all those images available is still in progress, but many of them may be viewed at the Academy?s Geology Flickr site at https://www.flickr.com/photos/casgeology</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-indent: 0px; margin: 0px;\">All the data described above were carefully entered into a digital database. This database was designed and constructed in-house specifically for the EPICC project, and conforms to the DarwinCore standards, a system for biodiversity databases. The database will be made publicly available in the near, post-pandemic future, but in the meanwhile much of the data have been shared with two other publicly available databases, GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) and NSF?s own iDigBio database.</p>\n<!-- p, li { white-space: pre-wrap; } --><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Peter&nbsp;D&nbsp;Roopnarine</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1503628/1503628_10377495_1640806913402_Cancellaria_sursalta--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1503628/1503628_10377495_1640806913402_Cancellaria_sursalta--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cancellaria sursalta\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1503628/1503628_10377495_1640806913402_Cancellaria_sursalta--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cancellaria sursalta\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cancellaria sursalta, a gastropod from the Miocene of Ecuador, and one of many specimens included in the EPICC project.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">CAS Geology</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Peter&nbsp;D&nbsp;Roopnarine</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cancellaria sursalta</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1503628/1503628_10377495_1640807282111_Roopnarine_collections--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1503628/1503628_10377495_1640807282111_Roopnarine_collections--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"PI Roopnarine\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1503628/1503628_10377495_1640807282111_Roopnarine_collections--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"PI Roopnarine\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Principal investigator and Curator of Geology, Peter Roopnarine, in the fossil collections of the California Academy of Sciences.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kat Whitney</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Peter&nbsp;D&nbsp;Roopnarine</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">PI Roopnarine</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
