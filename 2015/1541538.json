 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants and fungi are interdependently connected in nature, through interactions that are beneficial to both (mutualism, and decomposition of dead plant material by fungi) or detrimental to one partner (parasitism). Therefore, fungal and plant biology cannot be fully understood without studying them within the context of their symbiotic interactions. With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, it is becoming clear that the 100,000 known species of fungi represent only a tiny fraction of the estimated 5.1 million species of fungi present in nature. Amazingly, the largest fraction of this unknown fungal diversity seems to be hidden in healthy leaves of plants and lichens, as endophytic and endolichenic fungi. Endophytes are known to protect plants from pathogens, and enhance their resistance to abiotic stresses such as droughts and high temperatures. Most of these hyperdiverse endophytic and endolichenic fungi are classified within a group of filamentous Ascomycota fungi called the Pezizomycotina. The main aims of this research are to reconstruct a phylogeny (genealogical relationships) for the Pezizomycotina and link this evolutionary framework with a rich and diverse set of organismal data. The research will be complemented by diverse outreach activities, engagement of high school students in research, training of junior scientists in five states, and development of tools with potential applications for studying the evolution of species interactions across the life sciences. Accelerating the discovery of these hidden fungi also promises to provide a rich source of secondary compounds for new pharmaceutical and biocontrol products.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this study are to fill the largest phylogenetic void in the fungal genealogy of life (the Pezizomycotina) and integrate diverse data layers with the emergent tree as a means to understand the evolution, ecology, and physiology of fungal-plant symbioses. Culture-dependent and independent methods will generate the largest sample of endophytic and endolichenic fungi to date, targeting diverse plants, lichens, macroalgae, and co-occurring microalgae and cyanobacteria in terrestrial, aquatic, and marine environments, with a focus on biotically rich but understudied bioclimatic zones. Efficient collecting and analytical pipelines will enable rapid integration of phylogenetic data from these new symbiotic fungi into the fungal genealogy of life, while novel biodiversity informatics tools will integrate existing multi-locus and phylogenomic frameworks with short sequence reads obtained with next-generation sequencing. Resulting evolutionary trees, greatly enriched by systematic sampling of currently unknown biodiversity, will be integrated with host and trophic spectra in three data layers (symbio-phylogenetic, eco-phylogenetic, and physio-phylogenetic), enabling for the first time novel insights from geographic data, abiotic and biotic factors, and the physiological traits that enable mutualistic interactions with plants on which most communities depend.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFungi play crucial roles in the processes of life on our planet, from recycling nutrients in soil to helping plants grow and thrive.  They have also been critically important in the production of foods and medicines for the benefit of humankind.  It is estimated that there are over 2 million different species of fungi on earth, although surprisingly, over 90% of these have yet to be discovered.  Where are all these fungi and why have we not yet discovered them?  The premise of this GoLife project was that we may have not been looking for these fungi in the right places.  We hypothesized that a good proportion of undiscovered fungal biodiversity may be found in association with plants, particularly inside the leaves and tissues of plants as \"endophytes\" (not just on plant roots or in the soil), and in association with other plant-related photosynthetic organisms like algae, cyanobacteria, and mosses.  While fungi are known to form symbioses--persistent physical partnerships--with photosynthetic organisms, we understand surprisingly little about the breadth of these partnerships both in terms of the diversity of species that form them and the different ways in which these partners interact.  For example, lichens--symbioses consisting of a dominant fungal partner and a dominant algal partner--remain poorly understood with regards to the molecular details underlying how fungal and algal partners interact, respond to each other, and function collectively as a symbiotic entity.\n\nWith a collaborative team of researchers from 4 other US universities and research partners at field sites in Panama, Chile, Borneo, South Africa, and Namibia, we helped collect thousands of samples from plants, trees, lichens, and other substrates in diverse habitats to identify and isolate novel species of both fungi and algae.  As a team, over 20,000 new fungal strains were collected and identified, and over 1,000 samples of plants, lichens, algae, and seaweeds were obtained for scientific collections/herbaria as reference specimens for use by the wider scientific community.\n\nAt the University of Mississippi (UM), we cultured, isolated, and cryopreserved over 400 living cultures of algae/cyanobacteria/fungi from our team's field campaigns for ongoing and future study and taxonomic characterization.  We also conducted experiments to study the response of different fungi to different algae that may have never interacted before to better understand overarching responses that might be conserved between these two ancient lineages, and that may provide insights into how fungi evolved with and interact with plants.  Results from this work will be described in future peer-reviewed publications.\n\nThis project supported the training of 1 Ph.D. student, 1 M.S. student (female), 10 undergraduates (3 underrepresented minorities; 8 female), and 7 high school students (6 underrepresented minorities; 2 female).  We supported a high school biology teacher in Marks, MS in the development of hands-on, inquiry-based teaching modules on symbiosis, ecosystems, evolution, and molecular biology in alignment with Common Core Standards and the Mississippi College&#8208; and Career&#8208;Readiness Standards for Science.  In addition, over 100 high school students from the Mississippi Delta were served through outreach workshops, and over 40 undergraduates at UM were trained in field course using experiential learning modules that were an outgrowth of the methods and approaches developed in this project.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/22/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erik Hom"
