 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor Nikolaos Kidonakis at Kennesaw State University.\r\n\r\nThe research project of Professor Kidonakis concerns elementary particle physics that is relevant to the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which is the highest-energy particle collider in the world. By colliding protons against each other at high energies at the LHC, physicists expect to learn about the fundamental particles of matter and their interactions at higher energies and smaller distances than have ever been previously explored. The top quark is the most massive fundamental particle that has been discovered, it has many unique properties, and thus it is a central part of the physics program at the LHC. The Higgs boson is the particle responsible for mass generation, its discovery at the LHC was a major discovery in physics, and the further elucidation of its properties is a high priority.  In his research, Professor Kidonakis aims to develop theoretical methods to make precise predictions for processes at the LHC.  In particular, Professor Kidonakis will improve theoretical predictions for top-quark production as well as for Higgs production by performing state-of-the-art calculations. As a result, the project research will advance the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of elementary particles and new physical laws. This project is also envisioned to have significant broader impacts. Professor Kidonakis will involve students in his research, and thereby provide critical training for junior physicists beginning research in this field. He also intends to give public lectures on his research results, and introduce material into course curricula that emerge from his research.\r\n\r\nMore technically, the objective of the proposed research of Professor Kidonakis is to calculate higher-order perturbative corrections to improve theoretical predictions for top-quark production and Higgs production in the Standard Model and in models of new physics. High-order corrections, including collinear, soft-gluon, and subleading logarithmic corrections, will be calculated for differential and total cross sections.  The inclusion of these corrections is necessary to improve the accuracy of theoretical predictions by reducing uncertainty due to scale variation. Differential distributions are very important because they are sensitive to new physics. These calculations will be performed both for Standard-Model processes and for processes beyond the Standard Model, such as in supersymmetric models or models with flavor-changing neutral currents. The results of the project will be crucial in making state-of-the-art predictions for benchmark processes and for the interpretation of data from the LHC.  The research findings will be widely disseminated through publication in refereed journals and presentations at international conferences and workshops, and through contacts with experimenters at the LHC.",
