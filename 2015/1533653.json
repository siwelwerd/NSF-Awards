 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at North Carolina Central University (NCCU) seeks to develop a concentration in Computational and Engineering Mathematics. The project intends to provide a sound introduction to computational and engineering mathematics to undergraduate students to prepare them for positions in industry or for graduate school. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project.\r\n\r\nThis project has the objectives to: infuse computational engineering and mathematics techniques into relevant already existing mathematics and physics courses; develop new theme-based computational and engineering mathematics courses and laboratories; establish a 3-plus-2 program with North Carolina State University; develop a computational engineering and mathematics capstone design project; and recruit students for the new concentration. The areas of concentration are: robotics engineering, computational science, data science, computer engineering, electrical engineering, and industrial engineering. Demonstrating and evaluating how to integrate computational and engineering applications concentrations into a mathematics major could serve as a model to other liberal arts institutions.",
