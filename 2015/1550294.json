POAWRS monitoring<br />includes simultaneous detection, bearing-time estimation, species<br />classification, and localization of marine mammals vocalizations over<br />continental-shelf scale regions. POAWRS technology presents<br />significant advancement over current marine mammal sensing techniques<br />based on single hydrophone, sparse arrays and visual surveys.<br /><br />(A) In this project, we developed and sea-tested a prototype 8-element<br />towable coherent hydrophone array hardware with real-time data<br />acquisition and 100 m tow cable in house at Northeastern University.<br />Each element consists of a piezoelectric ceramic transducer wired to a<br />preamplifier and connected to the tow cable. The tow cable contains 12<br />twisted pairs of wires providing power and ground to all<br />preamplifiers, and carrying output voltage signals of each of the 8<br />preamplifiers to a 32-channel analog-to-digital convertor (ADC)<br />hardware. The ADC is connected to a notebook computer for real-time<br />access and monitoring of the acoustic signals measured by each of the<br />8 hydrophone elements of the prototype array. We have written software<br />to convert the voltage signals to acoustic pressure signals by<br />correcting for hydrophone sensitivity, gain of the preamplifier and<br />the ADC conversion factor. The time-domain received signals and their<br />frequency-time spectrograms are plotted for each hydrophone and<br />updated periodically based on the data acquisition length. Each<br />hydrophone element is waterproofed using either poly-urethane or<br />silicon rubber. The shape of each element was designed to minimize<br />flow noise on the hydrophone array. Each element was tested in air<br />before and after waterproofing to ensure the element was acoustically<br />functional.&nbsp; The prototype array has been tested underwater at the<br />Northeastern University swimming pool facility. The prototype<br />hydrophone array recorded a variety of sounds including tonal and<br />chirp pulses projected using an underwater loudspeaker from Lubell<br />Labs, as well as broadband clicks generated by clanging two wrenches<br />underwater.&nbsp; The prototype array also recorded Led Zeppelin's<br />&ldquo;Stairway to heaven&rdquo; song that we projected underwater using the<br />Lubell Labs source.&nbsp; The prototype array was tested at sea on a<br />recreational fishing vessel off the Boston harbor in about 30 m water<br />depth. The array was first deployed vertically with the ship's engines<br />shut off and we recorded broadband clicks and sea-surface reflections<br />by clanging 4 weights together underwater with a pole. The array was<br />then towed horizontally at roughly mid-water column at various tow<br />speeds around 3 to 4 knots and we recorded mostly ship sounds in the<br />busy Boston harbor.<br /><br />(B) Under this project we significantly automated the POAWRS analysis<br />and processing software for real-time marine mammal sensing and<br />extending POAWRS for monitoring a large variety of other oceanic sound<br />sources.&nbsp; The stages in POAWRS processing include (1) filtering of<br />hydrophone recorded pressure-time series data (sampled in the 8 kHz to<br />50 kHz range) in several frequency sub-bands of interest, (2)<br />beamforming of data from full or sub-apertures of the array spanning<br />360 degree azimuths about the receiver array to identify bearings<br />(horizontal azimuths) with potential strong sound sources, (3)<br />detection of sound sources via beamformed spectrogram analysis,<br />thresholding and clustering, (4) high-resolution beamforming to<br />determine bearing and time of detected sources more accurately, (5)<br />feature extraction via pitch tracking where features such as mean,<br />maximum and minimum frequency, duration, frequency-time slope (in Hz<br />per second), and 2nd and higher order curvature via polynomial curve<br />fitting for each sound source is determined, (6) detected signal<br />clustering incorporating methods in machine learning such as<br />centroid-based k-means and Bayesian distribution-based Gaussian<br />mixture models, (7) bearing-time association of signals within and<br />between clusters, (8) source bearing ambiguity resolution by<br />temporally correlating bearing-time sequences of classified and<br />associated signals with the array heading employing Kalman-filter and<br />Hough transform based bearing-time tracking approaches, (9)<br />localization of a sequence of associated sounds from their<br />bearing-time trajectories using a variety of techniques including the<br />moving array triangulation, the waveguide-based array invariant, and<br />the Kalman-filter based bearings-only tracking in modified polar<br />coordinates, (10) geographic positioning of localized sound sources in<br />latitude and longitude including bathymetric overlays and localization<br />mean and standard deviation ellipse, and (11) update of extracted<br />features and classification results into a database using a feedback<br />loop within the processing and analysis stages.&nbsp; Currently many stages<br />of the POAWRS software have been connected and the rest will be<br />incorporated in the future. The automatic POAWRS software has been<br />tested and verified by application to coherent hydrophone array data<br />from two major oceanographic experiments: the Nordic Seas 2014<br />Experiment and the US Gulf of Maine 2006 Experiment. The results from<br />POAWRS analysis of marine mammal vocalizations from diverse species<br />and ship radiated noise have been published in four journal articles.<br />Our work has also been featured in various national and international<br />news media.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Purnima&nbsp;R&nbsp;Makris</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1550294/1550294_10377077_1512057867773_prototype_array--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1550294/1550294_10377077_1512057867773_prototype_array--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"prototype 8-element coherent hydrophone array\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1550294/1550294_10377077_1512057867773_prototype_array--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"prototype 8-element coherent hydrophone array\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The prototype 8-element coherent hydrophone array was developed at Northeastern University and sea tested at the Boston harbor.
