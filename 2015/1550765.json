 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding variation in the internal and external drivers of community composition across taxa and systems informs both ecological theory and conservation, particularly regarding the resilience and composition of ecological communities in the face of rapid global change. The proposed research will use National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) data to determine how assembly processes internal to the community (e.g., biotic interactions, microenvironmental heterogeneity) and large-scale assembly processes external to the community (e.g., climate, land use) combine to affect intraspecific trait variation and community structure at a continental scale.  Whether internal or external processes filter how communities respond to their environment will advance the ability to forecast effects of climate change on communities.  The proposed work will also contribute to the public through a general science festival; to broad undergraduate education through modules contributed to the Ecological Society of America; and to specific education through the involvement of undergraduates and a postdoc in the research.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will address the importance of intraspecific variation of functional morphological traits of plants, ground beetles, and small mammals.  Bayesian regression analyses and Bayesian structural equation modeling will be used to uncover the relative importance of intraspecific trait variation in structuring continental-scale biodiversity patterns. Data will be derived from NEON specimens, phylogenies for these taxonomic groups, and NEON environmental and climatic data.  The analyses will separate the direct and indirect effect of species richness, phylogenetic relationships, and abiotic variables on the relative influences of internal and external filters that structure communities. Species and environmental data from NEON will provide an unprecedented opportunity to use standardized data to examine continental-scale intraspecific variation on multiple traits across several taxonomic groups.  The analyses will contribute new public data for other scientists, and outreach will be developed through existing platforms for science dissemination.",

The reasons for this pattern have been debated and likely involve a combination of environmental conditions but also the degree of competition among species over shared resources. We set out to answer this question with a unique dataset from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), consisting of small mammals across the United States and measures of their body sizes. &nbsp;We found that although temperature explained some of the variation in diversity at the continental scale, it was the degree of competition that explained the most variation in diversity, represented by the degree to which species overlapped each other in body sizes. Our findings imply that increased mammal diversity is enabled by species-specific specialization on resources to avoid competition, which tends to be more intense in warmer regions. This insight would not have been possible without explicitly accounting for individual body sizes and leveraging a continent-wide observational network; most classic work on species coexistence used only species mean body size values within a single ecosystem. </span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We also applied this framework to understand the patterns of bird biodiversity across the globe, and implications for climate change.

Yet support for this idea at a global scale was lacking. We tested this idea by comparing body sizes of birds in the tropics with their close relatives in cooler, and less stable conditions in temperate regions.
