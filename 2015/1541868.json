 "awd_abstract_narration": "1541868\r\nRezac\r\n\r\nThe Central Great Plains is an agricultural powerhouse fueled in part by the great tracks of aquifer water that provide irrigation in the otherwise semi-arid region. As the temperature in the region rises, rainfall declines or holds steady, and the aquifer resources are depleted, it will be necessary to develop new crop varietals, water and fertilizer technologies, and policies to ensure the continued production of food in this changing environment. Kansas State University has a strong history of research excellence in questions relating to the food/water and energy/water intersections. The objective of this project is to host a workshop that will develop research priorities related to water- and energy-efficient food production in the Central Great Plains.\r\n\r\nKansas State has partnered with researchers from industry and national laboratories to organize a workshop to examine the food/energy/water trilemma. The workshop will prioritize the research tasks to be completed to ensure food availability in the future and it will create opportunities to strengthen research team development to respond to these challenges. The workshop will address the following topical areas deemed critical for system success: (1) models to predict water availability and how it is utilized in crop growth; (2) technologies and practices that maximize residential, agricultural, and commercial water quality and utilization efficiency; (3) energy-efficient fertilizer production and application techniques; (4) technology for the recovery of nitrogen and phosphorous from swine and beef operations while producing clean water and/or energy; (5) genetic understanding for the development of drought tolerant crops; and, (6) socio-economic factors influencing consumer behavior. The workshop will be attended by researchers, government agencies, producer groups, consumers, and policy makers. Research leaders from other institutions inside and outside the Central Great Plains and other stakeholders will be invited to attend the conference and contribute to the development of the research priority statements. The project seeks funding to support the travel for 20 key researchers and the meeting costs for 70 total participants. The meeting will be held in Manhattan, Kansas and timed to complement the existing Kansas Governor's Conference on the Future of Water.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project supported the development and hosting of a workshop entitled:  Water- and Energy-efficient Food Production:  Solutions for America's Bread Basket.  The goal of the workshop was to identify the critical research needs in achieving the title goal.    This workshop allowed 50 scientists and engineers from around the country to come together to develop ideas relating to the critical challenges that must be overcome to ensure the continued production of food in the Midwestern region of the United States.  Workshop participants identified critical barriers to sustainable food production.  Participants came from the academic disciplines of engineering (chemical, biological, agricultural, and mechanical); agricultural sciences (agronomy, soil science, plant science, biology, biochemistry, geology, and hydrology); and social sciences (economics and sociology).  As such, the workshop discussions included participants from multiple disciplines who were able to craft recommendations that included perspectives from multiple perspectives.   Workshop discussions were separated into the key areas of:  water, soil science, fertilizer availability and production, integration of the food production with non-food uses for agricultural residues, and societal acceptance of proposed, new technologies and practices.    The primary product of the workshop was a technical report that was shared with program participants and published for broader use (available at www.cse.ksu.edu).  Additionally, the workshop provided a forum in which researchers from widely disparate fields could engage others around conversations of common interests.  These informal networking opportunities have resulted in the development of research teams forming around the development of potential solutions to one or more elements of the barriers identified.  These teams have continued to work independently and are advancing research solutions related to these topics. \n\nTen (10) Ph.D. candidates from Kansas State University both participated in the workshop and provided support for the meeting activities.  They served as facilitators and note-takers in the break-out sessions and provided a verbal summary of the conversations in each group to the larger workshop audience. .  The workshop activities provided them with the opportunity to hone their skills in communicating with individuals from different disciplines, enhance their abilities to manage meetings with senior scientists, and expanded their personal network of contacts with the leaders in their scientific fields.  To promote success, the students received training on meeting facilitation prior to the workshop.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/23/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mary E Rezac"
