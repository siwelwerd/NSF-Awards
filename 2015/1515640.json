 "awd_abstract_narration": "The microelectronic revolution has helped diffuse technology throughout the globe, leading to a radical shift in the way we share information, conduct business, and educate ourselves. As applications such as global telecommunications, weather radar, and satellite navigation (GPS) incorporate advanced in-orbit electronics, it is pertinent to understand how these systems operate within a dynamic environment. Wide ambient temperatures and exposure to ionizing radiation can degrade electronics and generate errors, which if unchecked, can lead to a catastrophic system failure. This research will serve as an investigation into the primary reliability issues facing next-generation electronics within radiation-intense environments. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Kazuyuki Hirose, an expert in advanced semiconductor fabrication and radiation effects research at the Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), a division of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in Sagamihara, Japan. Ultimately, this collaborative investigation will help develop new models, which can accurately predict system-level sensitivities, enabling engineers to envision new design strategies for ensuring long-term, error-free operations.\r\n\r\nThis work aims to investigate the effects of semiconductor technology scaling on the radiation tolerance of silicon-germanium heterojunction bipolar transistor (SiGe HBT) platforms. Conventional design methodologies for radiation-hardened electronics rely on multiple system redundancies and metallic shielding, which come at severe weight and cost penalties. The need for flexible, low-cost electronics in orbital and deep space applications has brought SiGe technologies into the spotlight, but the viable long-term capabilities of these modern platforms within radiation-intense environments remains largely unexplored. Accurate device models coupled with radiation event simulation techniques are necessary to provide an effective method to analyze device-level operational sensitivities and predict the circuit-level and system-level response to these random transient processes. By expanding these transient models across multiple SiGe technology nodes and functional biases, a comprehensive, SiGe HBT radiation model would provide unique simulation capabilities for the design and fabrication of next-generation, radiation-hard electronics. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).",
