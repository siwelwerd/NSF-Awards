 "awd_abstract_narration": "More than 90% of cancer-related deaths are caused by cancer metastasis, the spread of a cancer.  In many cases, cancer cells escape from the primary tumor and enter vasculature to form circulating tumor cells (CTCs). CTCs inside blood vessels are able to adhere to vessel walls, and then migrate into tissues, eventually forming micro-metastases. Recently, it was found that when nano-particles coated with certain types of ligands and receptors on their surfaces were injected into the blood, these particles can bind to CTCs and subsequently trigger death of CTCs in the blood. The project concerns using integrated mathematical/computational modeling and experiments to understand quantitatively how this binding process occurs and to identify the roles that ligand-receptor binding and cell-cell interactions play during this process. Results from the project will shed light on designing new nano-particle medical processes for the treatment of cancer metastasis and broadly extend the knowledge of blood cell dynamics. The results are of practical importance in many applications in both bio-engineering and medical communities. The  research will also provide interdisciplinary training for students.\r\n\r\nBy combining modeling, simulation and experiments, this project addresses a key biological question of importance to understanding cancer metastasis. What are the key factors that contribute to improving the efficiency of coated nano particles for triggering the death of circulating cancer cells within the vascular system?  New three-dimensional multi-scale models will be developed for this study. In this context, a novel sub-model representing cell membrane mechanics, a fluid-structure interaction simulation method and a stochastic ligand-receptor bond bind/unbinding sub-model will be developed and coupled. Atomic force microscopy and micro-fluidic experiments at three spatial scales will be designed for model validation and verifying simulation predictions. The transformative strategy of coupling calibrated multi-scale simulations with experiments will enable testing of novel hypothesized mechanisms by which certain coatings of liposomes kill flowing tumor cells. These goals will be achieved by using an iterative procedure involving development of sub-models, running experiments to validate the sub-models, and then running predictive simulations and designing new experiments for verification of these predictions.",

A strategy which using protein-decorated liposome for CTCs killing has been developed recently. This novel strategy using E-selectin and TNF-related apoptosis ligand (TRAIL) protein to decorate the liposome. Then the liposome is injected into the blood of subjects where they help leukocytes to catch and kill the CTCs. The aim of this project is to provide better understanding of the role of liposome and its interaction with the blood cells so that the liposome can be optimized in the future for the better medical outcome.</p>\n<p>First, we measured the rupture force between the extracellular domain of E-selectin and recombined P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1). Although E-selectin binds to different type of the ligands, PSGL-1 was selected due to its existence on the prostate cancer (PC3) cytoplasmatic membrane and availability. The rupture force was measured with an atomic force microscope (AFM). Figure 1 shows the schematic of the AFM system. To allow the rupture force measurement, the E-selectin was conjugated to the AFM tips with PEG-linker while the PSGL-1 was fixed to a glass slide with the same conjugation method. The rupture force has been measured with 4 different approaching speeds which provided different loading rates. The result shows that rupture force between E-selectin and PSGL-1 ranges from 50 to 136 pN, depending on the loading rate. The loading rate describes how fast one surface approaches the other. In addition, the loading rate also associates to&nbsp; energy provided to the interface for bond formation. This result is similar to the rupture force between PSGL-1 and P-selectin as being reported before.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Next, we measured the rupture force between E-selectin decorated liposome and PSGL-1. Two different methods have been attemped. We first fabricated the negatively charged E-selectin-liposome by mixing E-selectin, phosphatidylcholine (PC), cholesterol, and phosphatidylglycerol (PG). The E-selectin-liposome was then adhered to the AFM tips with poly-lysine for the force measurement. The result shown that the rupture force between this E-selectin-liposome and PSGL-1 was 18 pN in average, which was too small to trust compared to the force measured above. Thus, we employed another method to prepare the liposome and conjugate it to the AFM tips. In the new method, the liposome was first fabricated with PC, cholesterol, and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-[(N-(5-amino-1-carboxypentyl) iminodiacetic acid) succinyl] (nickel salt) (Ni-NTA-DOS). Then the E-selectin was conjugated to the liposome by chelating between Ni<sup>2+</sup> ion and his-tag on E-selectin. Finally, the E-selectin-liposome fabricated with the new method was conjugated to AFM tips with PEG-linker. During the conjugation process, some of the E-selectin on liposome surface was sacrificed. The measured rupture force is between 75 to 178 pN, which covered the same range compared to the rupture force between E-selectin and PSGL-1.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, we measured the rupture force between E-selectin-liposome and PC3 cells. The E-selectin-liposome was conjugated to the AFM tips and the PC3 cells were attached and cultured on the 35 mm discs. The measured force was between 35 to 83 pN, which was smaller than the rupture force measured above. This force reduction was mainly resulted by the cell elasticity which significantly lowers the loading rate.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To further interpret the measurement results, we calculated the energy barrier and dissociation rate constant from the correlation of rupture force and loading rate in each case. The calculation results implied the interactions in protein-protein and protein-liposome-protein cases were the same, but the one in protein-liposome-cell system might be differed due to the presence of the other membrane proteins. In addition, the difference between the dissociation rate constants of the first two scenarios suggested the liposome can stabilize the bond of E-selectin and PSGL-1.</p>\n<p>Table 1.
