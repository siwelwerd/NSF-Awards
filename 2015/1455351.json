 "awd_abstract_narration": "Multiple astronomical observations have established that about 85% of the matter in the universe is not made of known particles. Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter (DM) is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. Our knowledge about DM existence has grown significantly over the past decade, mainly through observation of its gravitational influence. However, fundamental questions still remain unsolved: Is DM a particle? Is there more than one type of DM? Does it interact via non-gravitational force? We are systematically searching for DM and scrutinizing the claims of its detection, but to date, no one has reported a conclusive DM signal. This forces us to broaden our search, as well as to develop technologies capable of making measurements orders of magnitude more sensitive than what is currently available. Direct DM detection experiments aim to measure the energy deposited by DM as it scatters off the atoms in a detector. Among them, noble-liquid-based experiments are presently leading the field and are expected to improve the sensitivity of DM searches by two orders of magnitude by the end of this decade. To achieve this, the experiments rely heavily on increasing target mass and achieving a very low background environment. The current generation of noble-liquid DM detectors is limited by the radioactivity in the detector materials, the photomultipliers (PMTs), and the target itself. \r\n\r\nThis award will support the development of radio-pure hybrid photosensors with a simpler internal structure, much lower intrinsic sensor radioactivity, and significantly better charge resolution than a PMT. The UC Davis team will also design and construct a noble liquid test cell that will precisely tailor the effects of detector design parameters on the charge-to-light ratio background rejection. This effort will be combined with a related analysis in the liquid-argon-based DarkSide-50 DM search program. Employing the charge-to-light ratio rejection can extend the sensitivity of the DarkSide-50 detector in the energy region of importance for low mass DM searches.\r\n\r\nThe main focus of the broader impacts is hands-on experience for students, ranging from high school to graduate school, combined with providing mentorship on how to successfully develop a STEM career. The PI will coordinate these efforts with two summer school programs: Nuclear Analytical Techniques (NAT) and the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS). This award also aims to increase participation in the NAT School of students of underrepresented groups who will be selected through the application process of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Physics program at UC Davis.",

With a telescope we may be able to see clusters of distant galaxies, or light reflecting from interstellar gases! But is anything out there that we do not see? Astronomers have found many different points of evidence indicating that there is unknown matter in the universe that does not emit any light, thus making it invisible or \"dark\" to our eyes and our telescopes. We observe this \"dark\" matter through its gravitational force, which shapes the galaxies and determines the motion of the stars within them. Through studies of the gravitational force of dark matter, scientists have determined that 85% of the matter in the universe is dark! But if it?s not the matter that we know, what is it?

The favored candidate for dark matter with a mass larger than the mass of neutron is called a \"Weakly Interacting Massive Particle\" or WIMP for short.

The backgrounds can come from the target material, detector components, and even from the sun, solar system, and beyond. In order to expand the reach of the future dark matter search, we initiated the development of a radio-pure hybrid photosensor called SiGHT which, instead of the classical dynodic chain of a photomultiplier (PMT), uses a SiPM (Silicon Photomultiplier) embedded in a fused silica envelope as an electron multiplier. We demonstrated the cryogenic indium film-based seal to ensure an ultra-high vacuum inside SiGHT. We tested several UV sensitive SiPM at a cryogenic temperature and measured the response to electron bombardment. This will provide information if SiPMs have sufficiently thin passivation layer (SiO2) to let low energy electrons go through. We published the SiGHT feasibility study and the first characterization results with the flat CsI photocathode. All the individual components and procedure were tested to enable SiGHT prototype production.</p>\n<p>Particles interacting in the liquid argon produce both scintillation light and free electrons. Argon is a very bright scintillator, and the time development of each scintillation light signal carries important information, a so-called \"pulse shape\", indicating what type of particle produced the event. The incoming WIMPs and neutrons collide with argon nuclei forcing them to recoil, while gamma radiation or electrons collide with atomic electrons surrounding the argon nuclei. Based on the pulse shape of the event, the most frequent backgrounds from electrons can be easily separated from the WIMP signal. In order to provide full understanding of the liquid argon detector response, we initiated the Argon Recoil Ionization and Scintillation (ARIS) project and performed a precision measurement of liquid argon discrimination parameters by subjecting a dual-phase argon time projection chamber to a beam of neutrons with known energy. We were able to provide and publish a precision measurement of scintillation yield as a function of the recoil energy at the lower energy, evidence for the scintillation yield linearity at null field for incoming gamma radiation, a comprehensive model for the scintillation response and scintillation time response of liquid argon in the range of interest for the dark matter searches. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>This award supported participation of five students from backgrounds that have been traditionally underrepresented in particle physics in the annual nuclear analytic techniques summer school from 2015-2019.
