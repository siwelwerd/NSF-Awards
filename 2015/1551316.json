Understanding these principles will enable design and development of safer, more secure, more reliable future systems ranging from smart resilient electric power grids to future intelligent transportation systems with driverless cars.\r\n \r\nThis workshop grant will enable students from many diverse fields to participate in discussions at this workshop with leading international researchers and to advance a shared community vision of the potential of self-adapting and self-organized engineered systems.",
