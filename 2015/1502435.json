  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEven in a relatively short term, this project was successful both in developing the academic career of the postdoctoral fellow Justin Solomon as well as in furthering research for mathematical sciences.\n\nThe grant is being ended early because J. Solomon was offered a position as a tenure-track assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) beginning July 1, 2016.  This position will allow him to lead a research group of PhD students, postdocs, masters students, and undergraduates in the study of geometric data, including continuation of projects started during the MSPRF.  This particular grant is being terminated early as MIT\u00c6s faculty policies do not align with the terms of this funding; the PI plans on continuing the proposed research regardless, with additional support of students at MIT.\n\nMuch of the research carried out during the term of this grant focused on the application and extension of mathematical ideas from the scientific applications considered in Prof. Amit Singer\u00c6s group to processing and understanding shapes.  This  led to the publication (and/or acceptance for publication) of several peer-reviewed articles:\n\n\"Nontrivial Boundary Element Octahedral Fields in Volumes\" (ACM Transactions on Graphics, to appear):  Inspired by the \"non-unique games\" (NUG) framework for expressing synchronization problems developed by Prof. Singer\u00c6s group, this paper studies a geometric problem appearing in meshing volumetric domains, of critical importance to pipelines for numerical partial differential equations (PDE).  The idea is to compute a smoothly-varying field of orthogonal frames, which can guide a meshing tool filling a volume with cube-shaped elements.  The proposed algorithm leverages ideas from representation theory to lift frame computation to an optimization problem in the spherical harmonic basis.  It achieves superior performance to competing tools in terms of efficiency and quality of the output.\n\"Entropic Metric Alignment for Correspondence Problems\" (SIGGRAPH 2016):  This paper applies optimization techniques for large-scale optimal transportation to an instance of the quadratic assignment problem used to find correspondences between shapes such as point clouds, medical images, and animation data.\n \n \n\"Gromov-Wasserstein Averaging of Kernel and Distance Matrices\" (International Conference on Machine Learning 2016):  Whereas the previous paper studies alignment problems for smooth shapes, this machine learning paper deals with more abstract data such as molecular configurations in quantum chemistry.  The proposed algorithm provides a technique for averaging kernel/distance matrices of varying sizes and structures, essentially summarizing a collection of geometric domains.  This machinery can be used to cluster sets of shapes even if they are not in point-to-point alignment.\n \n \n\"Near-Isometric Level Set Tracking\" (Symposium on Geometry Processing 2016):  This paper, written with industry and academic collaborators, studies the problem of tracking a shape as it deforms over time, when the shape is expressed as a level set function.  Level set representations are common in fluid simulation, certain modalities of biological imaging, and three-dimensional modeling at the cost of losing information about the motion of individual points.  The algorithm tracks moving surfaces under the assumption that their motion is close to rigid.  It achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of challenging tasks including tracking points on shapes undergoing interpolation and recovering the motion of hinged and articulated deformation.\n \n \n\"Functional Characterization of Intrinsic and Extrinsic Geometry\" (ACM Transactions on Graphics, conditionally accepted):  This work proves how the recently-developed frameworks of functional maps and shape differences encode the intrinsic geometry of a triangulated surface.  It additionally provides extensions showing how to use functional language to express a s..."
