 "awd_abstract_narration": "Blocking refers to a large-scale quasi-stationary high pressure that can persist for up to weeks at a time, leading to sudden long-lasting cold snaps and precipitation extremes during winter.  Understanding weather extremes in a changing climate requires understanding blocking in a changing climate.  This is done using General Circulation Models (GCMs), which allow scientists to alter greenhouse gases to understand the possible consequences to atmospheric phenomena.  Studies have shown that blocking is poorly simulated in GCMs, resulting in blocking biases with consequences for extreme events.  This award supports research to understand if blocking biases in GCMs can be reduced by improving the model Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO).  The MJO is characterized by eastward propagating convective anomalies emitting large-scale atmospheric waves that impact blocking at higher latitudes.  The research will investigate how model blocking is influenced by the model MJO in collaboration with Dr. Seok-Woo Son, a specialist in extratropical dynamics, at Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea.\r\n\r\nThe research hypothesizes that in order to improve model blocking, the model MJO must be improved in addition to the model basic state, which determines the pathway of the MJO-induced Rossby waves that impact blocking.  The hypothesis will be tested by analyzing\r\nand comparing between six GCMs within the Fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison\r\nProject (CMIP5), where three simulate a fairly realistic MJO and three a poor MJO as determined by diagnostics of the MJO Task Force.  MJO phases will be derived by projecting model data onto the leading patterns of reanalysis-derived fields, and the Rossby wave pathway will be analyzed using wave activity flux analysis.  Model blocking frequencies will be calculated per MJO phase, and results will be compared to reanalysis.  Results will then be used to understand how the model MJO may contribute to blocking biases. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding atmospheric blocking variability is crucial for the predictability of extreme weather events in much of the northern hemisphere, including North America, Asia, and Europe.  In the presence of a block, the upper-level winds can become \"blocked\", affecting precipitation and temperature for up to several weeks.  Studies have demonstrated that the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), the leading mode of intraseasonal variability in the tropics, significantly influences the frequency of atmospheric blocking in the northern hemisphere during winter through large-scale atmospheric waves known as Rossby waves.  The relationship implies that in order to understand changes in the occurrence of weather extremes in a future climate, the MJO and the MJO-induced large-scale Rossby waves which influence blocking must be properly simulated in general circulation models (GCMs).  However, the MJO has proven to be one of the most difficult forms of variability for GCMs to simulate accurately.  In addition, blocking contains large biases in GCMs, leading to uncertainties in weather extremes in model forecasts and future climate projections.\n\nData from five models from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) was used to quantify a model\u00c6s ability to simulate the MJO-induced wave patterns and examine the accuracy of blocking frequency changes associated with the MJO.  The study found that a model\u00c6s ability to simulate the MJO influence on blocking is largely dictated by the model\u00c6s ability to simulate the MJO-induced Rossby wave patterns.  The Rossby wave patterns are primarily dependent on two equally important characteristics: the model MJO and the model mean global circulation, or basic state.  Results show that a model with a relatively good MJO but a poor basic state can have as equally poor skill in simulating the MJO Rossby waves as a model with a bad MJO.\n\nIn addition, results demonstrate that the differences in Rossby wave patterns between the models and reanalysis data translate to large errors in the blocking frequency associated with MJO activity. Out of the five models analyzed, CNRM-CM5, the GCM from the Centre National de Recerches Meteorologiques in France, is found to have the best skill in simulating the Rossby wave pattern associated with phase 7 of the MJO, where phase 7 is characterized by enhanced convection in the tropical East Indian Ocean and suppressed convection in the tropical West Pacific.  CNRM-CM5 is able to capture the increase in Atlantic blocking known to follow MJO phase 7, although the increase is shifted north relative to reanalysis.  The GCM from the Meteorological Research Institute in Japan (MRI-CGCM3), however, shows a decrease in Atlantic blocking following phase 7, even though MRI-CGCM3 has a relatively good MJO.  This large bias in blocking frequency occurs because MRI-CGCM3 cannot properly simulate the Rossby wave pattern associated with MJO phase 7, likely due to errors in the model basic state.\n\nThe project outcomes of this study further the understanding of the causes of erroneous estimation of blocking in GCMs and blocking biases associated with the MJO. The results can be used to understand and reduce model blocking biases, impacting GCMs as well as numerical weather prediction models that have similar model physics. Improvements in GCM blocking variability and representation would reduce long-term biases in blocking and therefore errors in the prediction of extreme weather events associated with blocking in present and future climates.  This ultimately benefits decision makers and the populations living in regions heavily impacted by blocking, including the United States, Canada, Europe, and Asia.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/15/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephanie A Henderson"
