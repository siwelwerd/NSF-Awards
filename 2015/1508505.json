 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Description:  \r\n\tDislocations are linear, mobile defects in crystals that control the strength and ductility of metals.  Despite tremendous advances to model the structure and movement of dislocations at the atomic scale, the ability to validate these model predictions is significantly lagging.  For instance, multiple microscopy methods have not been applied in concert to characterize dislocations.  This research will develop innovative analysis techniques that help shape the future of defect analysis and are transportable to other metallic materials, ceramics, and semiconductors.  Historically, top-down approaches have been employed whereby macroscopic measurements are used to deduce forces on defects and their mobility. This research enables a bottoms-up approach to determine these fundamental quantities, by leveraging revolutionary advances in electron microscopy with advanced atomic-scale modeling and multi-scale probes.  These advances are applied to the high entropy alloys -a new class of materials with attractive and unusual properties, including increased strength and fracture toughness at lower temperatures.  This research advances experimental and computational approaches to understand the origin of these remarkable properties at a fundamental defect level. This project synergizes new educational approaches that cross-cut microscopy and computational content. It also provides opportunities for undergraduate students to participate in interdisciplinary senior capstone projects. This research impacts pre-college education, through participation in the Ohio Department of Education Math and Science Program. It also offers professional development for high school science teachers, through an annual 'Materials Camp for Teachers' and an on-line repository of instructional materials targeted for grades 8-12.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description:  \r\n\tAtomistic and first principles calculations of dislocation structure and behavior have become an essential part of 'bottoms-up' modeling of the mechanical behavior of metals and alloys, and they are a key component of computational materials design in the Materials Genome Initiative.  However, an inherent problem exists: atomic-scale calculations often lack validation at an appropriate length scale.  The aim of this project is to transform bottoms-up modeling, by developing a coordinated approach for quantitative, experimentally-informed measurements of dislocation core structures and mobility.  This is achieved by coupling recent advances in atomic resolution scanning electron microscopy with atomic-scale computations and multi-scale modeling. The experimental data are analyzed with computational techniques that quantify errors and extract local deformation, local strain energy, and thermodynamic forces on dislocations and other defects.  Thermo-mechanical studies are conducted using in-situ heating and nano-drilling of holes in specimens to create non-equilibrium dislocation configurations. This opens up exciting, new possibilities for both static and dynamic study of fundamental dislocation behavior. This innovative approach is applied to a material system of keen, current interest, for which dislocation-level structure and behavior is important but presently unknown - namely the 'high entropy' alloys.  Exciting preliminary results for a five-component fcc solid solution alloy have been obtained and are extended during initial studies. The applications are expanded during the program and as new alloy behavior is discovered. Experimental and computational procedures for the proposed dynamic measurements are developed initially using low-angle Al bicrystal structures that offer a simple 'model' system with well-defined dislocation structures.  This transformative research establishes robust protocols to guide the emerging aspects for both static and dynamic dislocation analysis.  For instance, the proposed microscopy methods are applied in concert to characterize the same type of defect structures. This research, when combined with the proposed innovative analysis techniques, helps to shape the future of defect analysis and is transportable to other metallic materials, ceramics, and semiconductors.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMetallic alloys are an extremely important class of materials for a wide range of applications for which the ability to sustain loads without failure (i.e. ?structural materials?) is a critical characteristic.  For instance, metallic alloys are used in automotive, aerospace, and power generation applications.  Most metallic alloys have a ?base? element (e.g. Fe for steels or Ni for superalloys) to which alloying elements are added to create the alloy.  Recently, there has been an explosion of activity on alloys for which there is no ?base? element; rather, these compositionally-complex alloys (also known as ?high entropy alloys?) have multiple elements in large concentration.  This emerging field has produced certain alloys, such as equiatomic CrCoNi, having remarkable combinations of strength, ductility and toughness (the resistance to crack propagation and material fracture).  This program has studied several of these concentrated solid solution alloys in order to develop important new insight into the deformation mechanisms and behavior of these alloys has been obtained.  These insights have emerged from exciting new characterization activities by which we have determined the fundamental nature of deformation in these alloys all the way down to atomic scale using advanced electron microscopy techniques.  These insights have allowed us to postulate why equiatomic CrCoNi is remarkable in its behavior through a synergistic operation of three deformation modes (dislocation motion, twinning, and phase transformations) all occurring in concert.

Finally, we have also used innovative materials processing techniques, combining both deformation and high temperature annealing, to produce novel microstructures with highly heterogeneous grain structure and stored energy content.  These ?heterogeneous? microstructure alloys can have even more extreme mechanical behavior in terms of attractive combinations of strength and ductility. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/11/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael J Mills"
