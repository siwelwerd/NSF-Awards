 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program is supporting fundamental research of Professor Shengping Zheng at Hunter College of the City University of New York. Professor Zheng will develop new methodologies for the synthesis of indoles and carbazoles beginning with commercially available building blocks, such as phenols and anilides, in one to three steps. The proposed research is expected to impact the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, as demonstrated by the synthesis of biologically active and pharmaceutically promising natural products such as lycoranine A and B, carbazomycin B and G. Professor Zheng will use research and teaching in organic synthesis as a framework for developing scientific skills and promoting retention and recruitment of groups of undergraduate students who are underrepresented in science. The Hunter College setting, with its diverse student body and partnerships with local high schools, will provide an excellent opportunity for directing Professor Zheng's educational initiative towards women and other underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nIn this research, new strategies and methods for the synthesis of indoles/oxindoles and hydrocarbazoles/carbazoles will be developed using inexpensive anilides/phenols as starting materials. Specifically, the synthesis of indoles/oxindoles from quinone imine ketals will be developed. An efficient synthesis of hydrocarbazoles from bicyclic oxazolidinones via a photo-rearrangement will also be investigated. Application of this method in the B\u00fcchi ketone synthesis will be explored. Furthermore, two syntheses of carbazoles from quinone monoketal and quinols will be studied. One is through anilide dianion addition to quinone monoketals and the other is through a palladium catalyzed enolate aryl coupling via an oxazolidinone intermediate. Methods developed in this research will make an important contribution to heterocyclic synthesis.",

Our group is interested in developing new methodologies for the synthesis of different heterocycles from quinoids, such as quinone monoketals, quinone imine ketals, and quinols. These quinoids can be easily prepared in one step from commercially available phenols or anilides by hypervalent iodine oxidation. The new methods developed by our group during the funding period include (1) a one-pot synthesis of indoles from quinone imine ketals and vinyl alkyl ethers. Indoles could be obtained through reaction between quinone imine ketals and butyl vinyl ether. Quinone imine ketals can be synthesized in one step from the corresponding anilides. We have achieved a total synthesis of lycoranine A using this method; (2) a rapid one-pot synthesis of pseudoindoxyls from quinols and methyl isocyanatoesters via a Lewis acid-mediated carbamation/Michael addition/mixed Claisen condensation-decarboxylative aromatization cascade. Our collaborator Professor Tavis at Saint Louis University showed that some of our synthetic pseudoindoxyl analogues were active against Hepatitis B; (3) a palladium-catalyzed carbazole synthesis through enolate-aryl coupling-aromatization. We utilized our method in a short total synthesis of antibiotic carbazomycin B; (4) a highly efficient synthetic pathway to acridones from a wide range of quinols in moderate to excellent yields. This one-pot process represents a direct and practical method to 1-hydoxyl-acridones from commercially available phenols in two steps. During this process, quinols act as a traceless benzyne equivalent. Furthermore, our collaborator Professor Geraghty at University of Minnesota tested our acridones. The preliminary results indicated that the acridones showed activity against the human cytomegalovirus.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/13/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Shengping&nbsp;Zheng</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1464543/1464543_10361526_1602619232284_indole-sz--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1464543/1464543_10361526_1602619232284_indole-sz--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Indole\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1464543/1464543_10361526_1602619232284_indole-sz--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Indole\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A new synthesis of indoles</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shengping&nbsp;Zheng</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Indole</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1464543/1464543_10361526_1602619300426_carbazole-sz--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1464543/1464543_10361526_1602619300426_carbazole-sz--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Carbazole\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1464543/1464543_10361526_1602619300426_carbazole-sz--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Carbazole\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A new synthesis of carbazoles</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Wu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shengping&nbsp;Zheng</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Carbazole</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1464543/1464543_10361526_1602619399512_acridone-sz--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1464543/1464543_10361526_1602619399512_acridone-sz--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Acridone\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1464543/1464543_10361526_1602619399512_acridone-sz--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Acridone\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A new synthesis of acridones</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Wu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Shengping&nbsp;Zheng</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Acridone</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
