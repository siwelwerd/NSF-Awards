 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanism (CSDM-B) and Computational and Data-Enabled Science and Engineering (CDS&E) programs are supporting computer-based fundamental research of Dr. Charles Doubleday at Columbia University. This research seeks a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of chemical reactions by computing the sequence of atomic motions as starting materials are transformed into products. Dr. Doubleday uses a combination of quantum mechanics and classical mechanics to understand how energy flows from starting materials into products. This type of calculation allows important questions to be addressed;  for example, why one product may be favored over another. The understanding achieved in these calculations will enable better experimental control over the products of chemical reactions. An important component of this project is the training of undergraduate students in scientific research. Since research is collaborative and students learn from each other, the work fosters group skills as well as individual achievement. In collaborations with colleagues at Columbia and other institutions, Dr. Doubleday helps train students in the use of computational methods. In one project, the focus is on the active center of a class of powerful antibiotics, with the goal of understanding and control. As the principles uncovered by this research become incorporated into applied areas, potential benefits could include greater understanding and control over chemical processes important in atmospheric and life processes.\r\n\r\nThe computational procedure involves quasiclassical ab initio molecular dynamics, in which nuclear forces are computed at each step by an electronic structure method, usually density functional theory. In applying this method to several enediyne cyclizations, the Doubleday group has recently found a dynamic isotope effect in which isotopic selectivity occurs in the product, as a result of competition between recrossing to reactant on a vibrational timescale and isotope-dependent intramolecular vibrational redistribution.  An important part of the proposal is to carry out quasiclassical simulations of reactions in condensed phase using QM/MM (Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics) techniques. The proposal describes a statistically converged procedure for quasiclassical sampling of transition states in condensed phase.",

In July, 2018 my wife was diagnosed with an aggressive cancer, and my research goals for the period 8/1/18 to 3/31/19 have not been reached.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have discovered two unusual hot-molecule effects, in cyclobutane and in Bergman cyclization.</p>\n<p>The 700 fs lifetime of the tetramethylene&nbsp;diradical (butane-1,4-diyl) has been a puzzle since Zewail measured it in 1994. Both statistical and trajectory-based predictions of the lifetime have been much shorter than 700 fs. To study tetramethylene stereodynamics and product formation, we fitted a DFT to match 8,8-MR-AQCC/CBS energy data, then computed trajectories initialized at the variational transition state for thermolysis of cyclobutane-1,2-d2. As a result of this work, we now realize that recrossing of vibrationally hot cyclobutane back to tetramethylene plays a major role in lengthening the observable diradical lifetime in a pump-probe experiment. Figure 1 shows the free energy surface obtained from the dynamics.&nbsp;Dark blue regions are local minima: cyclobutane (left) and tetramethylene (right),&nbsp;a purely entropic intermediate in a flat region of the potential energy surface.</p>\n<p>In studying the gas phase dynamics of the Bergman cyclization (Figure 2), we found an unusual H/D kinetic isotope effect, in which isotopic selectivity arises from nonstatistical dynamics in the product <strong>2</strong>.&nbsp;Para-benzyne is formed with ca. 20 kcal/mol of vibrational excitation, and it has two choices: (a) undergo intramolecular vibrational redistribution (IVR) to form statistical (trapable) p-benzyne, or (b) recross back to <strong>1</strong> (or <strong>1'</strong>, a minor path at short times) on a vibrational time scale, before IVR of <strong>2</strong> is complete. In trajectory calculations, we found that potential energy release from the TS goes mainly into the new CC bond of <strong>2</strong>, which cannot dissipate its energy fast enough to prevent recrossing. Deuteration increases the rate of IVR in <strong>2</strong>, which reduces the amount of recrossing. The result is a substantial predicted H/D isotope effect on the trapable yield of <strong>2</strong>, and a corresponding kinetic isotope effect on the thermal cyclization rate.</p>\n<p>In 1973, Baldwin and Fleming studied isomerizations of racemic <strong>1</strong> to <strong>2</strong>, <strong>3</strong>, and <strong>4&nbsp;</strong>(Figure 3)&nbsp;by a formal [1,3]-shift, and they deduced a large fraction of thermally forbidden processes. This was among the earliest studies to suggest mechanistic complexity in [1,3]-shifts. We have studied this reaction by quasiclassical trajectories with&nbsp;MN12SX/6-31G*, and we find that products are formed by both&nbsp;statistical and nonstatistical dynamics. Cleavage of <strong>1</strong> via two transition states, <strong>TS5</strong> and <strong>TS6</strong>, lead to diradicals <strong>Int5</strong> and <strong>Int6</strong>. In agreement with experiment, <strong>2</strong> is formed most efficiently, and it does so by a direct [1,3]-shift that bypasses&nbsp;<strong>Int5</strong> and <strong>Int6</strong>. At this stage the calculations are incomplete and ongoing.</p>\n<p>In collaboration with Ken Houk at UCLA, I proposed a method for carrying out short-time quassiclassical dynamics in condensed phase with explicit solvation, a procedure called environment-perturbed transition state (EPTS) sampling. We have applied EPTS to Diels-Alder reactions in water and to a Diels-Alderase enzyme, SpnF. Figure 4 shows the reaction scheme for SpnF catalysis.&nbsp;In solution, <strong>1</strong> forms both <strong>2</strong> and <strong>3</strong> via an ambimodal TS that leads to a post-TS bifurcation in the reaction path. The product ratio is dynamically determined as trajectories pass through the bifurcation region, a time scale &lt; 100 fs. With SpnF catalysis, the reactive carbons of the substrate exchange kinetic energy with nearby side chains of SpnF <em>on this time scale</em>, such that <strong>2</strong> is favored at the expense of <strong>3</strong>. The mechanism is unusual in that the enzyme-induced product selection occurs within a 100 fs window.</p>\n<p>We computed the effect of quantum tunneling on the rates of a variety of reactions (Figure 5). Tunneling is a process in which a molecule can undergo a chemical reaction even though the reactant energy is less than the barrier for the reaction. Our goal was to find out whether heavy-atom tunneling, involving mainly carbon atomic motions, is important in common organic reactions under typical reaction conditions. We carried out calculations for the 13 reactions in Figure 5 using Truhlar's Polyrate code with small curvature tunneling (SCT), an extensively tested tunneling method. Polyrate, though accurate, is labor-intensive, so we compared the results with the simple tunneling models of Wigner and Bell, which require only a transition state frequency calculation. We found two significant results: (1) most of the 13 reactions exhibit a substantial amount of tunneling (25-95% tunneling for 7 of the reactions) at temperatures at which they are typically carried out, and (2) the Bell formula mimicks Polyrate SCT prediction closely. Therefore the Bell formula is recommended for a quick estimate of heavy-atom tunneling contribution to the rate.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/29/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Charles&nbsp;Doubleday</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1465040/1465040_10360066_1561855802802_Figure1Tetfreeenergy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1465040/1465040_10360066_1561855802802_Figure1Tetfreeenergy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1465040/1465040_10360066_1561855802802_Figure1Tetfreeenergy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Free energy surface obtained from tetramethylene trajectories including recrossing.
