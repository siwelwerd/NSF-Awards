 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) Research Initiation Awards (RIAs) provide support to STEM faculty at HBCUs including junior faculty who are starting to build a research program and mid-career faculty returning to the faculty ranks after holding an administrative post or who need to redirect and rebuild a research program. Faculty members may pursue research at their home institution, at an NSF-funded Center, at a research intensive institution or at a national laboratory. The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, the University of The Virgin Islands (UVI) will conduct research and enhance its Physical Chemistry curriculum, which will aid in enhancing UVI's research capabilities and the educational experiences of undergraduates. The goal of the project is to increase the retention and graduation rates of undergraduate students in STEM at UVI by involving them in world-class, pioneering scientific research. The combined research and educational efforts are expected to expand the participation of groups underrepresented in STEM and support the nation's efforts in building a robust STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to study transition metal-ethylene cations of the form TM(C2H4)n+ using infrared photo-dissociation spectroscopy and computational chemistry. Findings from this project will provide insight into the bonding, structure, coordination and reactivity of TM(C2H4)n+ complexes. These species are key intermediates and products in reactions that are important to both the chemical industry and fundamental science. This knowledge can facilitate the exposition of reaction mechanisms and provide the first spectroscopic evidence for cyclization and oligomerization reactions of these species in the gas phase. This project will offer early immersion in innovative scientific research for undergraduate students. Research will be conducted at the University of Georgia during the summer and continue at UVI during the school year.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe intellectual merit of the project outcomes are centered on obtaining insight into the bonding, structure, coordination and reactivity of transition metal cation-ligand complexes.  These species are key products and intermediates in reactions that are important to both the chemical industry and fundamental science.  Furthermore, some of these species are themselves catalysts and others are model systems which can be used to calibrate electronic structure methods.  Infrared laser photodissociation spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and Density Functional Theory, were used to investigate these complexes.  Two journal articles were published, and another is in preparation, detailing the interactions of transition metal cations with small catalytically-relevant ligands.  One paper provides information on the distinctive coordination of the isoelectronic N2 and CO ligands to rhodium cation.  These experiments revealed a unique axial binding site above the square-planar structure of the Rh(CO)4+ complex that is likely the substrate binding position when this species acts as a catalyst in the condensed phase.  The other published paper describes the structure and bonding of gold-acetylene cations.  Sequential acetylene coordination to a gold cation results in the formation of exotic cation &ndash; pi and CH &ndash; pi structures and the 6-ligand complex has an appealing core-shell structure with D3h symmetry.  This project also provides an experimental basis to compare the effects of ignoring relativistic corrections in electronic structure calculations.  The unpublished journal article provides evidence for vanadium-catalyzed trimerization of acetylene to form benzene in the gas phase.  Two other journal articles were published that provide benchmark experimental data that facilitate the calibration and validation of computational chemistry methods.  One article, catalogues appropriate scaling factors for metal carbonyls calculated using various density functional theory methods.  The other article, provides the first experimental evidence for the theoretically predicted OH stretches in the hydrated hydroxide anion.\n\nAs the only accredited higher learning institution in the U.S. Virgin Islands, UVI is uniquely tasked with providing advanced education for the entire territory.  This includes recruiting STEM students, developing their talents, and preparing them for graduate school and the workplace.  The activities undertaken in this project were consistent with these objectives by providing an opportunity early immersion in innovative scientific research.  Overall, five underrepresented minority undergraduate students at the University of the Virgin Islands participated in the project.  Two of which are coauthors on journal articles.  Four students conducted research at the University of Georgia for one summer and each received travel awards to attend and present their work at a minimum of one national conference.  Although rooted in physical chemistry, this project was multidisciplinary and accommodated students from various STEM fields.  All students were able to leverage this research opportunity to gain other experiences that were better aligned with their career aspirations.  One student has graduated and is currently enrolled in medical school, while the other four all maintain GPA?s above 3.5 and are progressing toward graduation.\n\nThis project supported the efforts of the University of the Virgin Islands to retain and graduate underrepresented minority undergraduate STEM students, by providing early opportunities for involvement in authentic research to five students.  The chemical interactions of small ligands with transition metal cations were investigated in a perturbation-free gas phase environment.  The combination of these experimental studies with computational chemistry methods formed a powerful tool via which the identity of reaction products and intermediates were elucidated.  Furthermore, this project produced experimental data which is used to validate new and existing computational methods.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Antonio D Brathwaite"
