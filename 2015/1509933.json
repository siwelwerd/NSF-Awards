 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI Name:  Bruce E. Rittmann\r\nProposal Number:  1509933\r\n\r\nMicroalgae are single-celled photosynthetic organisms that grow on atmospheric carbon dioxide, sunlight, and dissolved mineral nutrients.  Under the proper conditions, microalgae also produce fatty acids stored as lipids, which can be readily converted to biofuel such as biodiesel.  This proposed research will explore a new process called selective fermentation to address two major roadblocks facing the continued commercial development algal biofuel production processes:  safe and efficient extraction of the lipids, and beneficial use of the non-lipid biomass.  Selective fermentation involves the conversion of carbohydrate and protein fractions of microalgae biomass to short-chain fatty acids while leaving the lipid fraction intact and more easily available for extraction by non-toxic solvents.  This research has the potential to improve biofuel yield from algal biomass and reduce waste, thereby increasing efficiency and promoting sustainability of algal biofuel production processes.    \r\n\r\nThe production of liquid transportation fuels from microalgae faces many challenges, including the safe and efficient extraction of lipids, and in the beneficial use of the non-lipid components in the biomass. This project will study the potential of selective fermentation to simultaneously address these two challenges.  In the proposed selective fermentation process, the carbohydrate and protein fractions of the microalgal biomass are fermented to short-chain fatty acids, while the existing lipid fraction is conserved in a form that is more readily extracted from the non-fermented biomass. To increase the rate and extent of carbohydrate and protein fermentation, the selective fermentation process will be carried out in the anode chamber of a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC), which produces hydrogen gas at the cathode, consumes the fermentation products, and promotes bio-hydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids with higher fuel quality.  Mathematical models will be developed to link the key biochemical, microecological, and electrochemical mechanisms to improve fundamental understanding of the interactions of these processes in the overall system, and will enable future techno-economic and life-cycle analysis of the process.  The education aspects of this project will advance the development of a green workforce by involving students from under-represented groups at a local community college in year-round research experiences, and by supporting a high school teacher and student in paired summer internships.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur society?s dependence on fossil fuels and the increasing risks of global warming from carbon dioxide emissions are primary drivers in the search for renewable energy.  Biofuels derived from lipids produced by photosynthetic microorganisms -- algae and cyanobacteria -- have promise for being carbon-neutral replacements for petroleum.  Today, extraction of the lipids from microalgae normally is energy intensive and requires strong and toxic solvents, such as chloroform and methanol, and pretreatment techniques, such as acid/alkali catalysis, thermal, ultrasonication, and pulsed electric fields, to disrupt the cell walls and membranes. \n\nAn ideal biodiesel formula has a high content of saturated fatty acids (no double bonds) and low content of unsaturated fatty acids (with double bonds).  Well-known microalgae species generally produce a significant fraction of unsaturated fatty acids (C16:1, C18:1, C18:2 and C18:3, where the first number is the length of the carbon chain and the second number is the number of double bonds). Hence, significant refining is needed to make a good microalgal fuel feedstock.  \n\nHydrogenation converts unsaturated fatty acids to saturated forms, and an appealing alternative to catalytic hydrogenation is microbial biohydrogenation.  The bacterial family Porphyromonodaceae, found in the ruminal microbial ecosystems of animals, is associated with biohydrogenation.  One goal of our project was to enhance biohydrogenation by using a novel form of fermentation, called selective fermentation (SF). \n\nFermentation is a mature biotechnology for capturing electrons from a variety of organic wastes in the form of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) and hydrogen gas (H2).  In SF, bacteria responsible for hydrolysis and fermentation of lipids, being slow growers, are washed out of mixed-culture fermentation systems at solid retention times (SRTs) that allow transformation of carbohydrates and proteins to volatile acids.  This differences in washout SRT makes it feasible to selectively ferment the carbohydrates and proteins, while leaving most of the lipids intact.  SF also yields to other benefits.  First, the lipids became readily extractable, because microalgal cells have been disrupted.  Second, the intact lipids become biohydrogenated.\n\nIn particular, SF enhanced cell disruption and solvent permeability, leading to increased lipid wet-extraction -- by at least 6900-fold (vs raw biomass) -- using a low-toxicity mixed solvent (hexane: isopropanol = 1:1, v/v, HEX/IPA).   SF also shifted the fatty acids toward more desirable saturated fatty acids (C16:0 and C18:0) through biohydrogenation.   Biohydrogenation was promoted by a solid retention time (SRT) greater than 2 days and an optimal pH around 7.  \nThe microbial communities capable of biohydrogenation were enriche for Prevotella and Porphyromonodaceae families. \n\nWe also introduced and evaluated electro-selective fermentation (ESF), in which anode respiration in a microbial electrolysis cell (MEC) improved the overall fermentation performance.  Compared to SF, ESF increased protein degradation by 3-fold, even though anode respiration represented &lt;1% of the total electron input.  Although ESF led to greater loss of total lipids, it improved lipid wet-extraction efficiency using a non-toxic solvent by 3-fold. Lipid loss was due to &beta;-oxidation linked to biohydrogenation, and the long-chain fatty acid profile shifted from C18:1 to C16:0 and C14:0. \n\nThe results described above have led to 3 peer-review articles, published in Algal Researchand Bioengineering and Biotechnology.  An additional 4 manuscripts are submitted or are in preparation.  In addition, this NSF-funded project offered an opportunity to promote STEM education.  One Ph. D and two undergraduate students have been involved and benefited from this education and research capacities in Environmental Engineering.  Also, we engaged one high school teacher working as a summer intern and disseminated the microalga biofuel to K-12 education system via this teacher.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/13/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bruce E Rittmann"
