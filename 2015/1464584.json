 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Sension of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor to investigate molecular-based components of optically controlled nanomachines. These devices aim to provide a means for nanoscale remote-controlled sensing, transport, synthesis, memory, logic circuits, and information storage. The practical development of these devices faces significant challenges in design, arising from incomplete knowledge of the complicated systems involved. Professor Sension will use ultrafast spectroscopy to study the fundamental chemistry and physics of molecular processes relevant to molecular switches based on photochemical ring-opening reactions, molecular motors, based on isomerization around a central bond, and vitamin B12 analogues capable of photoactivated drug delivery. Methods will also be developed to use the wavelength, energy, phase, beam profile, polarization, and temporal structure of laser pulses intelligently to manipulate molecular constituents of potential devices.  Students engaged in this research will receive training in modern experimental physical chemistry techniques, working on research problems relevant to biological processes, as well as nanotechnology and engineering.\r\n \r\nOne of the most important reactions is the electrocyclic ring-opening reaction of substituted cyclohexadiene active in many molecular switches. Fundamental studies of small cyclohexadiene containing molecules will provide experimental data to inform theoretical efforts in a synergistic relationship. Study of the ring-opening reaction of 7-dehydrocholesterol is important as this is precisely the reaction that occurs in human skin to produce pre-vitamin D. The photoinitiated ring-opening reaction will be studied in liposomes, a physiologically relevant model system. This project also seeks to increase the fundamental understanding of cis-trans isomerization reactions key to molecular motors. The photochemical reactions of cobalamins are finding increased application in the sensors, antivitamins, and molecular drug-delivery devices. Fundamental studies of the ultrafast internal conversion and photodissociation of active cobalamins will be performed to understand the photochemistry and photophysics of these systems as a function of ligand, wavelength, temperature, and environment.",

The fundamental time scale for atomic response to changes in the electronic configuration is in the range of 10?s to 100?s of femtoseconds (1 fs = 10<sup>-15</sup> seconds).&nbsp; A chromophore in the molecule absorbs light and initiates action. In this project, light-activated molecular isomerization was used to study the femtosecond and picosecond (1 ps = 1000 fs) electronic and structural dynamics of a range of molecular systems serving as models for important chromophores central to function in molecular scale devices. Two classes of molecules were investigated: polyenes that undergo electronic rearrangement, isomerization, and a shape change following excitation with a pulse of light and the cobalt containing vitamin B<sub>12</sub> analogs where bond dissociation is the dominant photochemical pathway.</p>\n<p>A prototype molecular motor was studied to identify parameters that optimize the efficient use of light energy to produce a full cycle of rotation. The experiments demonstrated that this motor has a very high yields for forward rotation with &gt;85% of the incident light used for the desired reaction. Our results demonstrate that this molecular motor is designed for unidirectional isomerization and ?primed? for efficient motion with high yields for the desired photoreactions and low yields for the undesired back reactions. These results will inspire additional theoretical simulations to explore the underlying reasons for the efficient use of light in this molecule and help in the design of optimal unidirectional molecular motors.</p>\n<p>Precise spatial and temporal control of acidity (pH) has a variety of applications in science. Light provides an excellent means to control both the timing and the spatial activation of photoacids. A water soluble photoacid was studied and demonstrated to provide a means to control the local pH on time scales as fast as a few 10?s of picoseconds. The molecule loses its proton immediately as it undergoes isomerization and returns to the ground state. Subsequent reactions produce a product that lives for seconds. Quantum simulations demonstrate that the acidity is controlled by interaction with specific water molecules surrounding the chromophore suggesting strategies for the design of optimal water soluble photoacids. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Vitamin D is often referred to as the sunshine vitamin because it is synthesized in the skin through a ring-opening reaction in 7-dehydrocholesterol initiated by UV light. The photochemical reaction in solution has been studied for many decades, but the biologically relevant reaction occurs in the structured environment of the skin cell membrane. We have used small liposomes to model the cell membrane environment and studied the ultrafast ring-opening reaction and the ground state conformational relaxation.&nbsp; The reaction is slowed down in the lipid bilayer from ca. one picosecond in solution to ca. ten picoseconds and the yield for the desired pre-vitamin photoproduct is increased. The similarity of the results for 7-dehydrocholesterol acetate and 7-dehydrocholesterol demonstrate that the efficiency of the reaction is not controlled by a specific hydrogen bonding interaction, rather it is the result of the viscous anisotropic environment provided by the membrane. These results will have implications for the efficient production of vitamin D in artificial environments.</p>\n<p>Cobalamins, vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and analogs, comprise an important class of biological cofactors. Although most biological function involves ground state reactions, the photochemistry of coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> (adenosylcobalamin, abbreviated AdoCbl) is vital to the sensing function of the newly discovered photoreceptor protein, CarH. In addition, cobalamins provide a promising platform as light-activated agents for spatially and temporally controlled delivery of therapeutic agents and as a biocompatible for sensors since the upper axial ligand can be replaced with a wide variety of chemically or biologically active ligands. The photochemistry of cobalamins is determined by the shape of the excited state surface. The pathways for photodissociation or return to the ground state vary with axial ligand and with environment. We have used time-resolved UV-visible absorption spectroscopy to map out changes in the electronic structure and ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy to map out changes in the atomic structure following photoexcitation. A drop delivery system was demonstrated that enables X-ray measurements of very small sample volumes by timing microdrop delivery with the optical and X-ray laser pulses.</p>\n<p>The initial quantum coherent motion of cobalamins involves sequential changes in structure over the first picosecond. On longer time scales snapshots of the structure reveal the complementary roles played by the upper and lower axial bonds in controlling the photoreactivity. We have demonstrated that is possible to use X-ray spectroscopy make molecular movies of the structural changes and to take snapshots of long-lived intermediates and to correlate these with the electronic rearrangements in the molecule.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/20/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Roseanne&nbsp;J&nbsp;Sension</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1464584/1464584_10381302_1574260616785_OutcomeMolecularMotoryields2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1464584/1464584_10381302_1574260616785_OutcomeMolecularMotoryields2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Photocycle of a Molecular Motor\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1464584/1464584_10381302_1574260616785_OutcomeMolecularMotoryields2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Photocycle of a Molecular Motor\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Quantum yields for the forward and backward light-driven reactions of the molecular motor and the room temperature half-life for the dark reactions.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Reprinted with permission from T.
