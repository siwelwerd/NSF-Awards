 "awd_abstract_narration": "Invasive species are major drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide and cost billions of dollars each year to control. Understanding why particular species become invasive is critically important to developing effective methods for their management. In this regard, the interactions between invasive plants and their associated fungi may be particularly important. These interactions are noteworthy because fungi can have both positive and negative effects on plants; some may benefit plants by increasing their competitive ability and others may damage plants by causing disease. This study will determine the diversity and impacts of fungi on a wetland grass, common reed (Phragmites australis), that has both native and invasive forms in North America. Experiments will be conducted to determine whether fungi differently influence how native and invasive forms of common reed respond to changing nutrient conditions. In addition to providing a better understanding of how fungi may help spread some invasive species, results from this study may reveal how fungi can be used in novel ways to control the spread of invasive species. Furthermore, this project will provide important research training for graduate and undergraduate students. Research findings will be shared through scientific meetings, publications in peer-reviewed journals, and a poster on invasive species that is designed for children and displayed at a popular nature park in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\r\n\r\nAlthough native genotypes of P. australis are widely distributed in North America, a European genotype has spread rapidly over the past 150 years. Using field surveys and a greenhouse experiment, the following predictions regarding the invasibility of P. australis will be tested: invasive P. australis genotypes will 1) have lower foliar and soil fungi diversity, 2) have less damage from foliar and soil pathogens, and 3) be superior in competitive and nutrient uptake ability in comparison to native genotypes. In addition, tests will be performed to determine if nutrient availability, soil fungi, and plant competition interact in complex ways to promote invasion success of P. australis genotypes from Europe. Field surveys of foliar and soil fungi will be conducted throughout North America, ensuring adequate replication of native and invasive P. australis genotypes and maximizing the diversity of fungi encountered. Foliar fungi will be cultured in the laboratory from diseased leaf tissue, and DNA sequencing will be used to identify fungi from cultures and soil samples. A plant-soil feedback greenhouse experiment will also be conducted to examine the interactive effects of soil biota, nutrients, and competition on the fitness of native and invasive genotypes of P. australis.",

However, we still know relatively little about how their importance changes over broad geographic scales, the role of above- and below-ground microbes (fungi and bacteria) in promoting or resisting invasive species, and how these plant-microbe interactions interact with other biotic (e.g., competition) and abiotic factors (e.g., pH, salinity). We explored these ideas using <em>Phragmites australis </em>(common reed, hereafter <em>Phragmites</em>), a model system for studying plant invasions. Although a native lineage of <em>Phragmites</em> is widely distributed in North America, an invasive European lineage has spread rapidly over the past 150 years, and exotic Gulf and Delta lineages are also prevalent in the southern United States (Fig. 1). The first objective of this project was to compare the community composition and impact of foliar and soil microbes among <em>Phragmites</em> lineages and along a biogeographic gradient (latitude). The second objective was to measure the individual and interactive effects of soil biota, nutrient availability, and competition on performance of the different <em>Phragmites</em> lineages in the context of their role in plant invasions.</p>\n<p>To address the first objective, we conducted a survey of 35 field sites spanning 17&deg; latitude from South Florida to Maine, with the aim of examining how pathogen damage and the fungal community vary geographically and among <em>Phragmites</em> lineages. Mean pathogen damage varied by up to 45% among <em>Phragmites </em>lineages, but we were unable to detect any significant differences due to high within-lineage variability (Fig. 2). However, we found evidence suggesting that the invasive and native <em>Phragmites </em>lineages suffer lower relative pathogen damage at low and high latitudes, respectively. Thus, if pathogens are important to plant fitness, they may facilitate <em>Phragmites </em>invasion at low latitudes, and resist it at high latitudes.</p>\n<p>To characterise the foliar fungi community, we cultured fungi (1,076 isolates) from healthy and diseased leaves and discovered 168 fungal forms that were morphologically distinct (&ldquo;morphospecies&rdquo;) (Fig. 3). Remarkably, we found that <em>Phragmites</em> lineage, but not geographic location (latitude), was influential in structuring the fungal community (Fig. 4). In other words, <em>Phragmites</em> populations of the same lineage but at opposite ends of their distribution had more similar fungi communities than plants belonging to different lineages but growing together in the same marsh. This result challenges the current paradigm of microbial ecology that abiotic factors are the most important determinants of plant-associated microbial communities. Furthermore, the high lineage specificity raises the potential for future development of beneficial or pathogenic fungi to promote or control the native and invasive lineages, respectively.</p>\n<p>To address our second objective, we conducted a large greenhouse experiment to investigate the effects of soil microbes, interspecific competition, and nutrient availability on the different lineages of <em>Phragmites,</em> as well as a native competitor, smooth cordgrass (<em>Spartina alterniflora</em>) (Fig. 5). The main finding of this experiment was that while soil microbes had a consistent negative impact on all <em>Phragmites</em> lineages, soil microbes from the invasive and Gulf lineages were harmful to <em>Spartina </em>growth<em>, </em>whereas soil microbes from the native lineage were beneficial (Fig. 6). Conversely, competitive ability and the response to nutrients did not differ among <em>Phragmites</em> lineages. Taken together, these results suggest that soil microbes, competition, and nutrient availability appear to have no direct impact on the success of invasive <em>Phragmites</em> lineages in North America. However, indirect interactions mediated by soil microbes may have important implications for co-occurring native species and restoration of invaded areas. In view of these findings, managers should consider soil remediation when restoring sites invaded by <em>Phragmites</em>.</p>\n<p>This project resulted in the training of one PhD and 14 undergraduate students. The PhD student was co-PI of the grant and successfully defended his dissertation in July 2016. One undergraduate student completed an independent research project. Public outreach included a service-learning course at LSU involving undergraduate students in research and restoration at a city park heavily impacted by invasive plants. Students removed invasive species, planted natives, and conducted research projects that were displayed as posters at LSU and the city park.
