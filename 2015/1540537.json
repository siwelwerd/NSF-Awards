 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harb, 1540537\r\n\r\nCarbohydrates from biomass have the potential to generate renewable energy for electric automobiles and other power-consuming needs. Current challenges inhibiting this technology include the low power output and insufficient catalyst durability of biofuel cells, and low carbohydrate conversion in non-biological fuel cells. A transformative breakthrough has come with the discovery of a homogeneous non-biological viologen catalyst that enables almost complete carbohydrate conversion. The overall objective of this project is to explore the feasibility of using this breakthrough to produce sustainable energy through biomass conversion in an electrochemical reactor. This preliminary feasibility study will identify the key fundamental processes and constraints that will determine the design and operation of a reactor system to produce sustainable energy, fuel or biochemical products.\r\n\r\nFour tasks have been defined to accomplish this objective. Task 1 will determine whether the homogenous and heterogeneous reaction rates can be effectively balanced to obtain the current density needed for a sustainable, economically viable process. Experiments under controlled flow conditions will the influence of pH, reactant concentrations, temperature, and potential. Task 2 will explore strategies, informed by the conditions identified in Task 1, for promoting near-complete carbohydrate conversion in a practical reactor system. Task 3 will assess the feasibility of hydrogen production as an alternative to electricity production.  Viologens with more negative redox potentials will be evaluated as possible catalysts. Finally, Task 4 will identify and quantify fundamental properties and limitations of the proposed electricity or hydrogen generating system based on results from the previous tasks. The possibility of using separate reactors for the homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions will also be explored as part of this task to potentially enable greater efficiency and additional, transformative products.  Completion of this preliminary study will 1) determine if the newly discovered viologen catalyst can be used for carbohydrate conversion at high rates (current density) in order to justify further consideration of this system as part of a full proposal, 2) identify a reactor strategy by which it may be possible to produce electricity from near-complete conversion of a carbohydrate, and 3) explore the feasibility of using carbohydrates to generate hydrogen. Fundamentally, this research will examine the interaction of homogeneous biomass reactions, a heterogeneous electrochemical reaction, and the reaction conditions in order to achieve potentially conversion of carbohydrates to produce sustainable energy. Fundamental issues related to carbon removal in the form of carbonate will also be explored in the context\r\nof potential reactor strategies. \r\n\r\nIt is expected that the results of this study could have a far-reaching impact on the development of viable and sustainable biomass conversion strategies, with emphasis on energy and transportation fuels. Inherent is the potential benefit of multiple platforms (electricity, hydrogen, and biologically reactive species) utilizing near-complete conversion of carbohydrates to increase the appeal for development of biomass-based economies. Increased adoption and sustained use of biomass-based processes from dedicated energy crops could (i) reduce dependence on other energy resources such as petroleum, (ii) reduce the impact of fossil fuels on global climate change, and (iii) reduce the use of food crops currently dedicated for biofuel production. Both graduate and undergraduate students, including those from underrepresented groups, will (i) gain experience in the design and implementation process for use of renewable resources (ii) demonstrate an appreciation for working within engineering constraints to develop a sustainable process, (iii) demonstrate effective teamwork and leadership skills as they work together as a team, and (iv) recognize the extent to which renewable resources can be applied to multiple process platforms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Sugar-powered Fuel Cell for Sustainable Energy \n\nIs it possible to run your car on sugar?  After all, carbohydrates, commonly referred to as sugars, power living systems like you and me.  Why not use that same source of energy to power your car?  This project seeks to do just that as it explores ways of using carbohydrates in a fuel cell to produce electric power. The beauty of \"sugar power\" is that it is renewable with no net release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  Instead, we take advantage of a natural cycle that begins with plants that extract energy from the sun and combine that energy with carbon dioxide from the air to form a carbohydrate fuel.  We take that fuel and oxidize it in a fuel cell (kind of like burning, only without the heat) to release the energy stored in the sugar. \n\nWork on this project was performed by an interdisciplinary research group consisting of chemists and chemical engineers at Brigham Young University, with funding from the National Science Foundation (CBET 1540537).  Together, we are working to address some important challenges that, if overcome, will enable this clean source of energy.  First and foremost, we need a way of oxidizing a carbohydrate like glucose that will allow us to extract its energy as electricity.  To do that, we use a fuel cell, which is sort of like a battery.  Unfortunately, without help, glucose will only slowly release a small fraction of its energy, less than 10%, by reacting directly at a fuel cell electrode (similar to a battery electrode).  If we settled for that, it would be like filling your gas tank and then allowing more than 90% of it to drain out unused. To help the glucose react, we use a catalyst. A catalyst is a substance that helps a chemical reaction to take place without being used up in that reaction.  The catalyst we have been investigating is called methyl viologen or MV.  An MV molecule reacts quickly with the glucose by taking an electron from it.  Multiple MV molecules take multiple electrons from the glucose. Once MV takes an electron from glucose, it moves to the electrode where it gives up that electron.  The electrons given up by MV molecules move out of the fuel cell through a wire as electricity. The MV molecules that gave up the electrons are now ready to react with more glucose. The process continues until as much of the glucose as possible is reacted.  From a scientific perspective (nerd language to follow), we measure the kinetics of the glucose/MV reaction (the speed of the reaction). We also measure the conversion, which is the percent of the total glucose that reacts. As we do this, we experiment with ways to make the reaction go faster and farther.  We also measure the products of the glucose reaction or, in other words, what is left over after the glucose reacts with MV.  A glucose molecule has 6 carbon atoms.  From our results it looks like MV breaks down the glucose by removing one carbon at a time to move from 6 carbons to 5 carbons to 4 carbons, and so on.  We have also examined the interaction of the MV with the fuel cell electrode to help MV give up its electron as quickly and easily as possible.  Based on our work, we have derived and validated an equation that allows us to calculate how fast the glucose reacts. We have also been able to increase the percent of the glucose that reacts from less than 10% to more than 30%.  In addition, we have had some surprises.  It turns out that some of the things that make the glucose react faster also attack the MV, which is bad.  We have also observed that glucose can move to places in the electrochemical cell where we don?t want it to go because it gets lost there and can?t be used.  All of this information is used to help us make a better fuel cell.\n\nThis study provided an ideal educational experience for 2 graduate students and 11 undergraduate students that contributed to the project.  All of these students have received training in biofuel cells and are prepared to make future contributions to this important area.  Some of the undergraduate students have decided to go to graduate school as a result of their undergraduate research experience.  Finally, students working on the project developed educational materials and taught high school chemistry students about fuel cells.  As part of their instruction, the high school students were able to apply the principles that they learned through participation in a hands-on activity and competition with miniature fuel cell cars.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/16/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John N Harb"
