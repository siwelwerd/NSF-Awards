 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will be to facilitate the creation of many applications utilizing a low-cost, high definition 3D motion-sensing device in many distinct areas including computing, entertainment, automation, robotics, industrial design, manufacturing, training, and education. For example, high-speed motion sensing without line-of-sight limitations can play an important role in understanding the dynamics of human body motion and ergonomics, allowing applications for sports and industrial training to evolve. The existing &#8232;3D man-machine interaction market is segmented into a few small application areas and it remains small largely because of the limitations in existing technologies. The end users and solution providers still seek a compact, easy-to-use, and intuitive solution. This project will significantly enhance our understanding of wireless 3D motion tracking and its application to man-machine interface technology, resulting in an easy-to-use, fast and accurate 3D user interface device. As the mouse completely changed the way man and computer have connected over the last several decades, an easy-to-use, intuitive, and natural 3D man-computer interaction device will have great impact in the way we relate to computers/machines, resulting in a significant commercial impact in a broad range of application areas.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will develop a wireless magnetic beacon-based 3D position sensor and its application to a 3D man-computer user interface. Existing 3D position tracking solutions for applications requiring 3D man-machine interaction utilize optical video sensors, infrared sensors, inertial sensors, ultrasound sensors or bending sensors. Despite recent progress, various fundamental challenges remain, including a line-of-sight requirement and the lack of haptic-feedback when using optical sensing, and the drift issue for inertial sensing. The proposed technology utilizes a magnetic beacon signal, and the unique characteristics of the proposed 3D user interface device include non-line-of-sight capability, absolute position and orientation tracking without drift, haptic feedback capability, low computational load, high accuracy, and high read speed. Anticipated applications include input devices for CAD design, digital art, 3D medical imaging systems handling 3D MRI, CT, and inner organ images, and educational devices requiring 3D interaction. The developed 3D device will significantly improve the work productivity of end users through its compact size and intuitive way of use. It will also provide a new opportunity for application developers to build cost-effective yet powerful 3D interaction-based design, educational, instructional and training apps.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n[Outcomes Report]\n\nThe Virtual Reality (VR) marketplace has reinforced the broader need for battery-operated, untethered sensors that can accurately track position, within a person?s \"personal space\":\n\n-       With high accuracy\n\n-       With high positional reporting speed\n\n-       Without positional drift\n\n-       Using low-capability microprocessors\n\n-       In the presence of visual blocking\n\n-       Indoors\n\nThe National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded to AccuPS, LLC a Phase I and Phase IB Grant to fund research to achieve these objectives using a magnetic sensing technology.  Magnetic sensing is not new- most notably it is used in medical applications, since it is unaffected by the human body, but what is new is that the technology, enabled by the NSF grant, incorporates this capability into low-cost, low-powered portable devices.  This video demonstrates the technology:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkAxOHZV8o0\n\nA VR system needs to \"know\" where a user?s head and hands are positioned so that the displayed scenes can be properly rendered.  The AccuPS technology senses these positions and conveys that information to the host platform (for instance, a smart phone) to facilitate, in this case, gameplay.  What is novel is that the user?s position is measured and computed locally, within the AccuPS TV remote control-sized device, after which the completed location information is then conveyed to the host platform.  No positional computation is necessary on the host platform or host device.  A small, portable, thin form-factor battery-operated \"beacon antenna\" sets the reference position (datum) for the user space.  Absolute position is measured with respect to this beacon, much as occurs with GPS satellites.  Because absolute positon is measured, positional drift is minimized and positional error does not accumulate with time or use.\n\nAlthough the technology has been initially applied to the VR marketplace, it is equally usable in other applications such as sports / education / medicine / industrial training and robotics, as well as entertainment.\n\nSpecifically, the NSF Grant has enabled AccuPS to reach the following technical milestones:\n\n1: Develop a portable-size transmitting beacon antenna that can be powered by a portable USB battery\n\n2: Develop accurate analytic mathematical models that can precisely predict the magnetic field produced by the beacon antenna, optimized for low computationally-capable systems\n\n3: Develop tracking and digital signal processing algorithms that can be fully implemented into a low cost microprocessor (ARM M4 core) and\n\n4: Develop a tracking test module that consists of a custom-designed magnetic field sensor, analog front-end, power regulator, rechargeable USB battery, input buttons, Bluetooth module and ARM M4 core processor\n\nAccuPS, LLC gratefully acknowledges NSF?s support.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Harry Diamond"
