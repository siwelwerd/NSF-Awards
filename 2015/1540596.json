 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Arizona (UA) is developing a new program to increase the recruitment, retention and professional opportunities of geoscience majors transferring from two-year colleges (2YC).  Transfer students in this science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) field tend to have longer times-to-graduation, lower metrics of academic performance, and more limited job prospects than non-transfer students.  Two-year colleges have a higher proportion of underrepresented minority (URM) students than most four-year institutions. The UA GeoPathways project builds on and contributes to the evidence base for effective student engagement, learning and retention in STEM, particularly among traditionally underrepresented minority students. The program consists of active recruiting by UA undergraduates at Pima Community College (PCC), focused mentoring, professional development, and paid internship with Arizona-based, geoscience companies, agencies or non-governmental organizations.  This program supports STEM education, increasing diversity in this STEM field, engaging students with community businesses and organizations, and advancing the field by improving the academic and practical preparation of its workforce.\r\n\r\nThe UA GeoPathways program is establishing a community-based program of support for geoscience majors transferring from PCC and other 2YCs in Arizona. The UA Department of Geosciences currently enrolls 208 B.S. majors; about 40 are transfers from PCC and other 2YCs. Each year, between 10 and 20 2YC students transfer in to major in Geosciences at UA. PCC has a greater proportion of under-represented minorities, veterans, and older students than UA. This project leverages existing instructional relationships between the two institutions, in that the first two years of courses for the geosciences major are well-articulated between Arizona 2YCs and UA. Additionally, two PCC faculty have taught geoscience courses at UA. Despite course alignment and shared faculty, transfer students are often under-prepared in coursework, unsure of UA degree requirements, uncertain about job prospects, and concerned about financial support. Transfer students are also less likely to have occupational mobility after receiving their undergraduate degree because of their family commitments. These challenges are being addressed by establishing a recruiting, mentoring and internship program for transfer students. UA students are reaching out to prospective transfer students by leading field trips and by participating in PCC classroom activities. New transfer students are participating in two new workshops on professional skills in their first year at UA: \"Success Strategies in STEM\" and \"Research Readiness.\" These workshops and their coursework are preparing students for paid internships with local businesses in the mining industry, hydrologic and environmental consulting, federal, state and local agencies and with environmental NGOs. Participating GeoPathways hosts are matched with student interns after their first year at UA. The 320-hour internships are being implemented either as 8 weeks fulltime during the summer or for part-time over a longer period, depending on the needs of the host and the intern. Between 8 and 10 interns are being selected each year of the project.  Members of the first-year's cohort serve as peer mentors during later years of the program, and make presentations at PCC or other 2YCs on their internship experiences. The new UA strategic plan, \"Never Settle\", calls for the engagement of every undergraduate student with professional or community service during their degree program. This UA-wide effort will help sustain the program beyond its initial NSF support.\r\n\r\nProject effectiveness of the integrated approach involving mentoring, workshops and internships in support of 2-year to 4-year college transitions is being evaluated in order to document its potential as a model for similar partnerships among 2YCs, research universities, and potential employers in the local community.  It is hypothesized that the UA GeoPathways experience will enhance the recruitment, retention, academic performance and graduation rates of students transferring from PCC and other Arizona 2YCs. The project will better serve prospective geoscientists from groups that are under-represented in four-year academic programs and the workforce: economically disadvantaged students, under-represented minorities, older students and military veterans. Providing hands-on experience for transfer students will assist them in selecting coursework for specialization and may prepare them for entering graduate school. UA GeoPathways will strengthen ties between UA Geosciences and local employers, creating more opportunities for all students.",

We recruited through day-long field trips for Pima Community College students, regular faculty and adjunct faculty.  University of Arizona faculty and recent transfer students provided field guides and recent transfer students provided peer-mentoring during the field trips.  Recent transfer students in the University of Arizona Geosciences major developed and presented classroom and field exercises in Pima Community College geology courses.  We presented three six-week workshops on professional and job-seeking skills such as preparation of job letters, resumes, and interview preparation.  Over the course of the program, we placed 28 students with southern Arizona earth-science agencies and businesses.  These eight-week internships were funded by the program.  Intern hosts included the United States Geological Survey, the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park System, the Arizona State Parks, mining and exploration companies, hydrological consulting companies, a science center, and a commercial paleontological company.  Two students secured permanent employment with one of the companies and one company has continued the internship program without our program?s continuing support.  Eight students were supported to present program and internship results at national and local professional meetings. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/04/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karl Flessa"
