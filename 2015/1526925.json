 "awd_abstract_narration": "Domestic violence is a pervasive problem across the globe, producing physical, emotional, and psychological harm. The majority of the time this violence is perpetrated by men upon the women who are their spouses, domestic partners, or girlfriends, although we know from growing research that domestic violence also occurs within same-sex couples and other non-traditional family arrangements. When domestic violence first came to prominence in the United States, the focus was on helping and encouraging women to leave abusive relationships.  However, we now recognize that leaving or staying are not the only two options for dealing with abuse. Family dynamics and social networks are more complex and flexible than this dichotomy suggests. Yet healthcare systems and other systems of social support persist in not finding the best ways to identify abuse and to assist women who do not wish to leave abusive relationships. In the United States, the problem is particularly acute for minority, immigrant, and refugee women whose ideas of family may not fit those of the mainstream. Therefore, research is needed on how cultural and social factors, such as the role of the extended family and expectations of spousal relationships, shape experiences of domestic violence so that the micro-processes involved can be understood theoretically and social support services and healthcare systems can respond effectively. \r\n\r\nStanford University doctoral student Amrapali Maitra, under the supervision of Dr. Tanya Luhrmann, will undertake such research in the Indian city of Kolkata. She has chosen this as a research site because India has both high rates of domestic violence and clear cultural and social differentiations between those who are the receivers of assistance and those who seek to give assistance. In 2004-2005, the National Health and Family Survey found that about 40 percent of women across India experienced some form domestic violence. Domestic violence has been repeatedly shown to cut across lines of caste and class, but the stereotypical picture is that it is a problem of the poor. So the researcher will investigate what domestic violence means to the urban poor and to the middle class employees and social service providers who control the resources to assist them. The project will focus on two slum neighborhoods in Kolkata and the institutions of social support that exist in the surrounding areas.  The investigator will assess three key areas: how men and women in Kolkata define domestic violence; how those definitions differ from how it is defined in the West, including the United States; how the medicalization of domestic violence in urban healthcare clinics and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) affects definitions and perceptions of violence; and how interactions between \"victims\" and institutional employees shape understandings of family, gender, and violence on both sides. She will conduct surveys in both neighborhoods to understand typical domestic arrangements, interactions and expectations between spouses, and the role of extended kin. She will also collect data through participant observation in clinics and other sites where women seek services for domestic violence, to understand where women draw the line between routine forms of violence and instances that require institutional help. Findings from this research will illuminate experiences of domestic violence in a place of both intense poverty and great resilience, and more broadly will illuminate how cultural ideas of family, kinship, and physical intimacy shape how different people think about domestic violence and how they aspire to resolve these moments of conflict and care for one another. These findings will be of use to those charged with creating effective policies and programs for dealing with domestic violence wherever it occurs, and to social scientists seeking to understand the changing but varied nature of the contemporary family in the world today.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project is an anthropological study of domestic violence and women?s health in Kolkata, the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal.  In 2004-2005, the National Health and Family Survey found that about 40% of women across India experienced abuse in marriage, yet we know little about local cultural models of domestic violence in Hindu and Muslim families.  The research explores the social phenomenon of domestic violence within local practices and definitions of marriage, intimacy, and abuse.  Importantly, as Indian couples increasingly choose love marriages in addition to traditional arranged marriages (see Perveez Mody 2008) and nuclear couples increasingly separate from joint family households, the nature of kinship and marriage are changing for working class Bengalis. \n\nParticularly, the research focuses upon low-income communities where women support families through paid domestic work, thereby managing both their employers? domestic spaces and their own.  Within these dual domestic negotiations, women are subject to multiple demands of time, labor, exploitation, emotional intimacy, and care.  As these women pursue their work and support their families, how do they define domestic violence?  As they visit medical clinics or go to NGOs for social support, how do they think and talk about their marriage and family experiences, particularly situations of harm or pain? \n\nThis research was conducted by the Co-PI who resided in Kolkata for fourteen months from October 2015 &ndash; November 2016, using ethnographic methods including participant observation, in-depth interviewing, and clinical ethnography in three urban neighborhoods encompassing &gt;150 women participants.  Access to sites such as urban reproductive clinics, psychiatric hospitals, and women?s shelters was facilitated by the Co-PI?s dual training as an MD and PhD Candidate.\n\nThe project yielded many significant results that contribute to an understanding of domestic violence in India.  For one, it generates a local cultural model of acceptable domestic violence that is centered broadly on three features: 1) Fulfillment (or lack thereof) of traditional domestic roles, eg. the wife cooking dinner for husband, wife caring for in-laws, 2) States of influence such as alcohol or infidelity, and 3) Personality or character of the abusive man, such as a natural tendency toward anger (raagi).  Modes of intimate interaction that do not conform to the model above are often considered to be outside the realm of acceptable spousal behavior and thus warrant seeking intervention from NGOs, clinics, or the Indian state.  Interactions that exceeded the boundaries of appropriate chastisement were often described through a rhetoric of torture (atyachar) or violation (nirjatan) in Bengali. Frequently, women?s tolerance for emotional or physical violence by in-laws (particularly, by the figure of the mother-in-law) was far less than that by their husbands, which they considered to be situational and therefore impermanent.  The importance of delineating models of domestic violence is to understand when women seek institutional support for familial conflict and how they prefer to resolve abusive situations, rather than imposing global humanitarian definitions of gender-based violence that may not be equipped to account for relevant local modes of intimate harm (for example, withholding of contraceptive methods by husbands or deprivation of food and water by mothers-in-law.)\n\nAdditionally, the ongoing analysis contributes to the anthropology of violence, feminist theories of kinship, and the medical anthropology of care in various ways.  For example, interviews revealed that many working women&mdash;even those who were financially independent and socially supported to leave their abusive husbands&mdash;regarded their care towards their spouses as a moral act and chose not to abandon them.  Women?s decisions to see themselves as providers of care rather than victims of violence extends the anthropology of care by noting that the moral experience of caregiving (see Arthur Kleinman 2012) is also a socially and spiritually powerful experience that may promote resilience and negate other types of harm.\n\nThe first product of this research will be a doctoral dissertation in Anthropology at Stanford University submitted by the Co-PI and advised by the PI.  Further outcomes will include local dissemination of the research findings to clinics, NGOs, academic, and policymakers in Kolkata, as well as broader dissemination through peer-reviewed publications in anthropology and global health journals.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amrapali Maitra"
