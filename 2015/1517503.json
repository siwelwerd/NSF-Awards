 "awd_abstract_narration": "The team will perform numerous state-of-the-art simulations of galaxy clusters spanning a large range in\r\nmass. The simulations will incorporate observationally-constrained\r\nmodels for feedback from star formation and supermassive black holes,\r\nalong with a novel treatment of chemical evolution. The\r\naims are twofold: (1) Establish a unified description for the\r\nevolution of the galaxies, the supermassive black holes, and the hot\r\ntenuous gas within the clusters; (2) Determine the key observable\r\nsignatures that constrain the interplay between the processes of\r\ngalaxy feedback and the growth of structure in the Universe. These\r\nefforts constitute a self-consistent, holistic approach to feedback that will be able to account for multifaceted\r\nproperties observed across all mass scales. The team will continue its\r\ninvolvement in an established, successful STEM program. The research\r\nwill increase the physical realism of the simulations, increasing the\r\nappeal of the image products released to the public.",
