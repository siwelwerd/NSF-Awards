 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Union College to acquire a high-resolution micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT) system. \u00b5CT provides a nondestructive method to visualize complex internal structures of a sample ranging from micro to macro scales. Analysis of \u00b5CT images can address fundamental structure-function questions in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The accessibility to structure-function relationships combined with the lack of complicated sample preparation makes \u00b5CT research a clear entry point to engage undergraduates in meaningful STEM research. This project will have broad impacts on STEM fields. First, it will enhance both multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary STEM research at Union College that will influence external researchers and build future collaborations. Second, the project will provide 18 undergraduate research opportunities across STEM fields each year. Access to research training will increase student interest in pursuing graduate STEM study and improve the scientific and technical research infrastructure of our country. Third, each year approximately 260 Union College students will interact with cutting-edge \u00b5CT technology and its capabilities through a wide variety of STEM classes. Finally, Union College has established K-12 outreach programs aimed at encouraging students from traditionally underrepresented groups to enter STEM fields and an undergraduate program (DUE-1356398) that provides scholarships and intensive cohort mentoring with educational enrichment activities to increase undergraduate retention and achievement in STEM disciplines. This project will enhance the work of these groups by leading students through exciting, hands-on \u00b5CT imaging with associated 3D printing modules. The goal of these outreach activities is to help students see themselves as future scientists and engineers. \r\n\r\nUnion College biology, computer science, and engineering faculty have developed collaborative and integrative research across diverse STEM fields to understand how structural properties at one level of organization affect organismal function at another. The \u00b5CT will enable researchers to nondestructively visualize complex internal anatomy and provide insight into how organismal structures: 1) impact developmental physiology, 2) respond to external mechanical stimuli during bone fracture healing, 3) lead to speciation through visual communication, 4) inform development of biomimetic soft robots, 5) support the evolution of morphogenesis, and 6) explain water balance in plants critical to the global carbon cycle. Furthermore, when combined with Union's multi-material 3D printer (CMMI-1337768), researchers can isolate interior regions of a \u00b5CT scan, generate a volumetric model in the \u00b5CT software, and print a corresponding physical model in a matter of hours for further analysis. These diverse projects represent just the beginning of the innovative \u00b5CT STEM research at Union College. Furthermore, since the closest similar \u00b5CT is located over three hours away, Union is poised to be a regional \u00b5CT center that fosters innovative collaborations with investigators at nearby institutions.",
