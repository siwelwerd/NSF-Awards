 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs will partner with the U.S. Department of Energy to hold two workshops focused on illuminating gaps and opportunities for regulatory and planning harmonization across North America.  The initial focus will be on how harmonize regulations and planning for electricity production and transmission across the US borders with Mexico and Canada.  One workshop will focus on US - Canadian issues, and will be held in Boise, Idaho on the campus of Boise State University.  The second workshop will consider US - Mexico issues, and will be held at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.  The PIs will also prepare background materials to summarize the current state of regulation and planning in Canada, Mexico, and the US in electricity production and transmission.  The workshops will provide a forum for developing the broader impacts for policy of economics and environmental science. The overall goal is to reduce cost, environmental damage, and risks to electric reliability.\r\n\r\nThe background papers will cover three to five specific areas where the US may consider harmonizing regulation and planning across borders.  This includes three specific chosen topics: (a) the effects of air pollution and carbon dioxide regulations; (b) technical regulations and planning processes; (c) whether and how data sharing across borders will improve modeling and planning.",
