When executing such workflows with liquid samples, conventional fraction collection tools such as pipettors, test tubes, and trays can be used.  With gases, however, these basic operations are more challenging since gases are not easily contained.  The objective of this proposal is to create a platform technology which can separate gases using gas chromatography (GC), and then and encapsulate them into bubbles so that they can be analyzed or manipulated offline.  If successful, the proposed multiphase system would enable new workflows for gas purification and analysis analogous to their liquid counterparts. \r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of separation science, the encapsulation technique can encapsulate thousands of gas fractions at time resolution of <10ms and fraction volumes <1nL, roughly 1000X better than commercial preparatory-GC systems, which rely on cryogenic traps.  This can can have transformative impact on prep-GC and multidimensional GC, where the resolution and scalability of fraction collection is critical. This platform would also provide a way to screen the reactivity of gas fractions by using chemical reagent assays which operate on samples in the bubble format. The proposed work will explore fundamental issues, including the containment of gases in a carrier fluid, and methods to analyze encapsulated gasses. From a broader perspective, this proposed system may substantially impact multidimensional gas analysis, a common workflow in environmental monitoring, homeland security, and food analysis. The outreach plan will deploy low-cost \"jello\" microfluidic kits at the Michigan Science center (MSC), with the goal of increasing interest in STEM-related disciplines in the Detroit area. Scientific knowledge from the proposed research will be integrated into the PI's graduate level BioMEMS and microfluidics course.",
