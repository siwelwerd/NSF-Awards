 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human rights have been a flashpoint in relations between the U.S. and other nations. Many scholars of human rights have traditionally used the phrase human rights regime to refer to a set of norms and procedures that have been formalized and codified in international law. But the codification of universal human rights has been far more contested in local contexts, where concepts of rights are contingent upon widely ranging historical, cultural, and political economic experiences. This project explores how different notions of human rights have emerged and have been debated, often in ways that might seem paradoxical or counterintuitive. Immigration policy and diplomatic practice could benefit from the improved understanding of these contexts that this project will afford. This project would also broaden the participation of a historically underrepresented group in the sciences. \r\n\r\nDr. Marvin Sterling of Indiana University will explore the factors that influence the discourse and practice of human rights. With focus on the Jamaican case, the investigator frames the study as a first systematic effort to identify specific commonalities in the postcolonial experience, particularly in the Commonwealth of Nations, that shape or have resulted from human rights debates in these societies. The project also aims to understand how locally contextual interpretations of rights have been formed through transnational engagements. Methods of data collection during this six-month project include gathering archival data with the aim of historicizing discourses of human rights, interviewing the members and observing the activities of local human rights groups, and a content analysis of national and international media. The project would contribute to advancing anthropological theories of human rights, particularly within the subfields of legal and political anthropology. Specifically, the project explores the regime of human rights as something constituted by historically, economically, and culturally specific notions of citizenship, freedom, and autonomy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe PI investigated the contested terms in which the international discourse of human rights has come to take root in the Jamaican context.  The PI focused on Jamaica's colonial legacy as a principal factor informing how this discourse has taken shape.  This legacy continues to manifest itself in such forms as the country's political and legal systems, its religious traditions, its racial, ethnic and class relations, its citizens' attitudes towards gender and sexuality, and in the country's continued relationships with the former colonizer of Britain as well as the more proximal political and economic power of the United States.\n\n \n\nBelow are some key findings emerging from this research:\n\nHuman rights as understood in international law manifests itself in the Jamaican context, as is true elsewhere, principally in the activities of the middle class and upper class Jamaicans who make up the ranks of civil society groups, governmental institutions and academia.  These are the individuals with the resources to travel outside Jamaica to participate in meetings and other events in which human rights, and the international legal regimes that undergird and sustain it, are most fully understood in its formal legal aspect.\nThe leadership of the more powerful human rights organizations (i.e. those more successful at fundraising, that receive more media attention, and so on) is also often comprised of \"brown\" or \"white\" Jamaicans of fully or partly European, Chinese, Syrian, Lebanese or East Indian descent.  This is in contrast to the darker complexioned Afro-Jamaican majority from which the smaller, more community-based organizations tend to be drawn.  This is an extension of the overlap between light complexion and socioeconomic privilege in Jamaican society generally, a product of the country's colonial heritage. \nSkeptics or opponents of human rights activism in Jamaica&mdash;notably including some Christian groups who view human rights as privileging man's law over God's, or some government officials who see human rights as a foreign imposition on Jamaica's moral sovereignty&mdash;often argue that this separation validates their view of human rights activists, as one observer put it memorably, as \"the articulate minority.\"\nThe PI, however, gathered evidence that indicated that human rights is a highly contested term whose global appeal a broad range of groups, including Christian organizations, sought to claim for themselves, but on their own ideological terms.  While, again, some Christian groups expressed their opposition to secular human rights, others embraced their rights, viewing them as threatened by British and American progressive activists who seek to unfairly leverage their global political and economic power against a small former colony.\nWorking class Jamaicans invoke the term human rights frequently&mdash;sometimes almost as an incantation&mdash;\"demanding their human rights\" after police shootings, or when the government fails to adequately provide such social services such as water, electricity, useable roads or garbage disposal.  In this way, \"human rights\" are claimed not necessarily by way of petition to a concrete regime of international law or institutional apparatuses, but rather by invoking the term's generally positive resonance in the global popular consciousness.\nWorking class and other Jamaicans have also associated \"human rights\" with specific issues over time.  In the 1970s-1990s, \"human rights\" were strongly associated with Jamaica's death penalty, a source of international contention particularly between the Jamaican state and Britain, its former colonizer, from whom much of Jamaica's legal code derives. In the 1990s-early 2000s, another issue of state violence dominated human rights discourse in Jamaica:  extra-judicial killings by the police.  While the term continues to be significantly understood in terms of state violence, it seems most fully understood today in terms of \"gay rights\". \nThe members of LGBT rights groups consulted believed that Jamaican society remains profoundly opposed to homosexuality.  However, they also argued for a slight thawing of homophobic sentiment in Jamaica, one measure of which is the fact that Jamaicans are now openly and intensely debating the issue of gay rights, rather than being silently and absolutely opposed.
