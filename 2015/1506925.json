 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Solid oxide fuel cells, which are currently in early-stage commercialization, provide an important means for clean efficient conversion of fuels to electricity, and electricity to fuels, as well as for electricity storage. More research and development, particularly for understanding long-term durability, are critically needed to achieve widespread application. This study integrates timely and unique approaches to achieve a deep understanding of fuel cell electrode materials performance and degradation, ultimately allowing design of higher performance, longer-lived fuel cells. A key feature of the project is the use of three-dimensional image data to develop and ultimately validate two types of computational models: (1) performance simulations utilizing measured three-dimensional structure are developed and vetted by comparison with experimentally measured electrode performance, and (2) measured changes in electrode structure before and after fuel cell operation are compared directly with simulated structural evolution. Tools developed for 3D imaging, simulation, and data analysis with large data sets are relevant to many other materials systems. The results are relevant to many communities, ranging from modelers who can utilize three-dimensional data and simulation methods, to industrial developers who can use the results to help improve their fuel cells.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: This project aims to study solid oxide fuel cell performance and long-term stability, utilizing three-dimensional imaging of fuel cell structure using state-of-the-art electron and x-ray microscopy methods, combined with three-dimensional simulations of electrode performance and structural evolution. The present research provides a critical fundamental understanding of degradation processes, complementing more practical studies, e.g., long-term fuel cell stack tests, being carried out in industry. It is incredibly valuable to develop simulation models based on experimentally observed microstructural changes, and then apply them to accurately predict long-term (>5 years) electrode evolution and associated performance changes. Furthermore, this combination of 3D microstructures, validated simulation tools, and computationally intensive data analysis provides a transformational framework for design and discovery of electrode materials that includes not only performance, but also durability. Graduate and undergraduate students receive unique training - while each student focuses mainly on experimental or computational aspects, exchange visits between campuses provide direct experience in both areas. Students also work directly with researchers at Argonne and Brookhaven national laboratories using state-of-the-art three-dimensional imaging facilities. Educational and outreach activities focused on K-12 students and the general public are also being actively carried out.",
