Recently the PI discovered that membrane surface chirality influences filtration with protein solutions. A molecule is considered chiral if there exists another molecule that is of identical composition, but which is arranged in a non-superposable mirror image, i.e. similar to human hands.  Non-specific protein adhesion or protein fouling occurs with synthetic membrane filtration in bioprocessing, with marine structures and with medical devices. This undesired adhesion of proteins is a major technical and economic challenge. Reducing these limitations with chiral surfaces would be significant and have broad impact.\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes that the surface should have the same chirality as a protein (the chiral hypothesis). The goals of the research are to (i) confirm, expand and investigate the role of chirality with respect to protein resistance, and (ii) determine if chiral membranes can fractionate enantiomers for small molecules. This radically different approach to possibly reducing protein fouling is in its early stages and is potentially transformative for bioprocessing.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBroader Impact: An exciting area of industrial separations in which synthetic filtration membranes have not been commercially applied is in the fractionation of enantiomers (i.e. a pair of chemical compounds whose molecular structures have a non-superimposable mirror-image relationship to each other like the D- and L- enantiomers found in nature), especially in the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries.  There are two methods by which enantiomerically pure chiral compounds can be produced.  The first is a selective reaction where the use of special synthetic methods result in the production of only one enantiomer.  These methods generally involve highly specialized catalysts and synthetic methods, which may preclude their use on any large scale industrially.  The second is the resolution of a racemic mixture (i.e. a solution of say 50% of each D- and L-enantiomers) into pure enantiomers through the use of a separating agent.  The prevailing separation method employed is chiral chromatography, in which enantiomers have different binding affinities for the chiral stationary phases (also called chiral resin) contained in these columns and therefore elute at different times.  High performing chiral resins contain three-dimensional chiral structures like those found in naturally occurring or synthetically made stereoregular polymers.  Chiral resins take advantage of a so-called three-point interaction, in which one interaction must be stereochemically dependent. These interactions usually entail combinations of p-p interactions and hydrogen bonding or even metal coordination.  The use of packed-bed chromatography, however, is severely limited by production capacity since the velocity of enantiomers through the column is very slow and it dilutes rather than concentrates the desired enantiomeric product.  A solution to this low production capacity and dilution problem would be to replace packed-bed chiral chromatography with synthetic membrane filtration, where flow rates could be greatly increased and the desired enantiomeric product is concentrated rather than diluted.  The challenge is to develop membranes with chiral selectivity to compete with chromatography.  This project has developed such chiral selective membranes, while educating and training graduate and other students (undergrads in chemical engineering and high school students from the QStar Program in the Capital district, NY).\n\nIntellectual Merit: During this two year EAGER project, two approaches were used.
