 "awd_abstract_narration": "The American Mathematical Society Summer Research Institute in Algebraic Geometry will be held July 13-31, 2015 on the campus of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Since the 1960s, the US algebraic geometry community has organized decennial meetings under the auspices of the American Mathematical Society. These extended summer conferences summarized progress in the field and pointed to future developments. The resulting proceedings volumes have been valuable references for generations of algebraic geometers. As the field has grown, these meetings help different communities within algebraic geometry keep in contact and current on the broader trends in the field. This award supports travel and local expenses for approximately 200 of the anticipated 600 participants in the 2015 summer research institute.\r\n\r\nThe last decade has seen major advances in arithmetic geometry, birational geometry, derived algebraic geometry, derived categories of coherent sheaves, enumerative geometry, geometric representation theory, Hodge theory, Kaehler-Einstein metrics and stability, and p-adic geometry. The institute will offer morning plenary talks by top experts summarizing recent progress, and afternoon parallel seminars with more detailed discussion of relevant techniques. The institute will support participation by many young researchers, as their exposure to the breadth of modern algebraic geometry will set the research agenda for the coming decades. More details about the institute can found at the following two websites:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ams.org/meetings/amsconf/summerinst-2015\r\n\r\nhttps://sites.google.com/site/2015summerinstitute/",
