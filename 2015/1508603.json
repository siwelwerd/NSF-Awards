 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description: Auger recombination is a process that degrades the performance of III-V materials for optoelectronic devices, ranging from lasers and light-emitting diodes, to solar cells and photodetectors. In particular, lasers emitting light in the mid-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum are impacted heavily by Auger recombination. Mid-infrared lasers are important for sensing, free-space communications, and medicine. This collaborative research project between the University of Colorado at Boulder and the University of Texas at Austin seeks to understand and control the Auger recombination process in III-V materials to ultimately enhance the performance of mid-infrared lasers. The research efforts are well integrated with the educational activities. The efforts include providing interdisciplinary research opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students, integrating research findings with college coursework, and K-12 outreach through optics-related modules.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: Strain can greatly reduce the negative effects of Auger recombination in quantum confined active regions in III-V materials. However, the fundamental understanding of the strain effects on the recombination processes has been hindered by the critical thickness limitations imposed by strain, complicating analysis and often necessitating unrealistic approximations. The collaborative project takes an orthogonal approach to the challenges associated with understanding and characterizing recombination processes by examining the active strained regions of the materials. Specifically, semiconductor membranes made of III-V materials are released from their host substrate and bonded to a flexible polymer. The membranes are biaxially strained by stretching the polymer substrate in two dimensions to mimic the effect of biaxial strain from lattice-mismatched growth. This permits strain-dependent studies of Auger recombination using ultrafast spectroscopy on a single sample, isolating the intrinsic effects of strain from those due to compositional change or growth kinetics. This study could shed light on the roles of Auger and other loss processes in III-V material systems, an ongoing 30+ year debate across the device and materials communities, and enable high-efficiency diode lasers and light-emitting diodes in visible regime.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nModern lasers are often built from crystalline semiconductor layers of different chemical compositions, grown layer-by-layer as films on top of one another.  When crystals with different preferred interatomic spacing are grown upon one another, the layers mechanically distort one another, which is a process termed strain.  This strain process is of incredible practical importance as the highest performing lasers, such as those used in commercial fiber optic communications networks, are typically designed such that the thin layer(s) responsible for light emission is/are strained by the remainder of the laser crystal.  It is commonly accepted that it is this mechanical strain that is responsible for improved laser performance; however, strain is introduced in the crystal growth process by changing the chemical composition of the layers, which could itself play an important role.  Because the chemical and mechanical changes occur concomitantly, it has not been possible to determine which change is responsible for improved laser performance. \n\nIn this project, we developed new measurement techniques to independently assess the chemical and mechanical contributions to light emission efficiency, focusing on the strength of Auger recombination, which is a particularly important process that hampers laser efficiency and is widely accepted to be greatly reduced by increasing mechanical strain levels.  Specifically, we developed the bonding of very thin crystalline semiconductor films, termed nanomembranes, to flexible plastic films that were then mechanically distorted with a screw-driven stretching apparatus.  Mechanical strain was induced in two-dimensions to mimic the use case of strain in semiconductor lasers.  Samples were fabricated and then characterized with several optical spectroscopy techniques at varying mechanical strain levels, specifically ultrafast optical-pump/optical-probe and time-resolved photoluminescence.  Results were fitted with accepted theoretical models to extract how the strength of Auger recombination changed with applied mechanical strain.  These results were compared with measurements performed on samples where the mechanical strain was introduced by changing the chemical composition during the growth process, facilitating insights into the independent roles of both chemical composition and mechanical strain for the first time. Within the limits of measurement uncertainty, Auger recombination strength was found to be independent of the applied mechanical strain. \n\nIn terms of broader impact, this project has provided valuable experimental insights towards resolving the ongoing &gt;30 year debate across the device and materials research communities regarding the effects of Auger recombination and related loss processes on photonic device performance.  The project provided valuable research opportunities for one Ph.D. student in Professor Gopinath's group and two Ph.D. students in Professor Bank's group, as well as for a number of high school students, undergraduate students, and high school teachers who were also involved in the research.  The team was also active in outreach, with both the PI's and Co-PI's groups participating in a number of K-12 outreach activities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/28/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Seth Bank"
