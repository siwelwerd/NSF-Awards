 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants and fungi are interdependently connected in nature, through interactions that are beneficial to both (mutualism, and decomposition of dead plant material by fungi) or detrimental to one partner (parasitism). Therefore, fungal and plant biology cannot be fully understood without studying them within the context of their symbiotic interactions. With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, it is becoming clear that the 100,000 known species of fungi represent only a tiny fraction of the estimated 5.1 million species of fungi present in nature. Amazingly, the largest fraction of this unknown fungal diversity seems to be hidden in healthy leaves of plants and lichens, as endophytic and endolichenic fungi. Endophytes are known to protect plants from pathogens, and enhance their resistance to abiotic stresses such as droughts and high temperatures. Most of these hyperdiverse endophytic and endolichenic fungi are classified within a group of filamentous Ascomycota fungi called the Pezizomycotina. The main aims of this research are to reconstruct a phylogeny (genealogical relationships) for the Pezizomycotina and link this evolutionary framework with a rich and diverse set of organismal data. The research will be complemented by diverse outreach activities, engagement of high school students in research, training of junior scientists in five states, and development of tools with potential applications for studying the evolution of species interactions across the life sciences. Accelerating the discovery of these hidden fungi also promises to provide a rich source of secondary compounds for new pharmaceutical and biocontrol products.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this study are to fill the largest phylogenetic void in the fungal genealogy of life (the Pezizomycotina) and integrate diverse data layers with the emergent tree as a means to understand the evolution, ecology, and physiology of fungal-plant symbioses. Culture-dependent and independent methods will generate the largest sample of endophytic and endolichenic fungi to date, targeting diverse plants, lichens, macroalgae, and co-occurring microalgae and cyanobacteria in terrestrial, aquatic, and marine environments, with a focus on biotically rich but understudied bioclimatic zones. Efficient collecting and analytical pipelines will enable rapid integration of phylogenetic data from these new symbiotic fungi into the fungal genealogy of life, while novel biodiversity informatics tools will integrate existing multi-locus and phylogenomic frameworks with short sequence reads obtained with next-generation sequencing. Resulting evolutionary trees, greatly enriched by systematic sampling of currently unknown biodiversity, will be integrated with host and trophic spectra in three data layers (symbio-phylogenetic, eco-phylogenetic, and physio-phylogenetic), enabling for the first time novel insights from geographic data, abiotic and biotic factors, and the physiological traits that enable mutualistic interactions with plants on which most communities depend.",

The GoLife project was designed to capture novel fungal diversity in biodiversity hotspots at a global scale, and to synthesize environmental, physiological, and symbiotic data in to an evolutionary framework to illuminate how fungi work together with hosts in ways that shape the world around us.</p>\n<p>To achieve these aims, a team of specialists in fungi, plants, lichens, algae, cyanobacteria, and soil worked with local partners in Panama, Chile, Borneo, South Africa and Namibia, and understudied areas of the United States to collect fungal symbionts that occur within their hosts (endophytes). The team conducted extensive (up to 40 day) field campaigns with mobile labs in each country, working across elevational gradients from coastal to montane systems and seeking to maximize the diversity of environments present in each area. Thus our sampling encompassed beaches and tidal flats, deserts, temperate and tropical rainforests, grasslands and swamps, and more. In focal countries we supported engagement by local scientists and students, offering workshops and seminars to share our work. We followed best practices of the Nagoya Protocol, depositing vouchers of host material with our host countries. We integrated our project into six US university curricula and graduate training activities and engaged the public, high school students, and our communities in training and scientific outreach. We engaged dozens of students at the University of Arizona and local high schools, in parallel with similar efforts across our team as a whole, which spanned five states. We developed publicly available tools for biodiversity informatics and shared our data publicly for ohers to use.</p>\n<p>Overall the intellectual merit of this project was to discover novel fungi in the most species-rich phylum, filling out the 'fungal tree of life' through the lens of symbioses.&nbsp;The project as a whole resulted in a novel culture collection of more than 24,000 fungal strains, as well as more than 1000 vouchered collections of plants, lichens, and algae. These new collections highlight existing biodiversity in a changing world. The project also supported culture-free work, generating the largest amplicon/metabarcoding data set for endophytes to date. By providing new tools for visualizing layers of metadata on phylogenetic trees, integrating reference trees into biodiversity discovery, and establishing robust reference phylogenies for focal groups, our team supported and advanced the sciences of systematics and taxonomy, linking them with genomics, evolutionary biology, and ecology. The broader impacts of our work include student training, public outreach, enhancement of biodiversity collections in the US and with global partners, data sharing, publications and presentations, integration of project content into courses for hundreds of US students per year, and a promotion of convergent, interdisciplinary science to study the remarkable biodiversity of our changing planet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/24/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Anne&nbsp;E&nbsp;Arnold</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1541496/1541496_10386412_1653400582290_P1000670--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1541496/1541496_10386412_1653400582290_P1000670--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"GoLife team in a montane tropical forest\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1541496/1541496_10386412_1653400582290_P1000670--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"GoLife team in a montane tropical forest\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The GoLife team represented the convergence of expertise in botany, lichenology, mycology, phycology, soil microbiology, and biodiversity informatics.
