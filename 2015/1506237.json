 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe. The rest, whose presence we only infer gravitationally, is unknown in its nature, and is termed dark matter. Particle physics suggests that dark matter comprises relic Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang. Experimental efforts to directly detect WIMPs are extremely challenging due to small interaction probabilities and large backgrounds. The motion of the Earth through the galaxy produces a head-wind of WIMPs. The angular distribution of recoils from WIMP interactions has a ~100% asymmetry, and is modulated at the sidereal rate on account of the Earth's rotation. No known background can mimic this signal. \r\n\r\nThe practical implications of the technology being developed for such searches have promising applications to low background alpha and neutron measurements. This work also includes the training of a diverse set of undergraduates and graduate students in increasingly rare small-scale experiments, giving them exposure to a wide range of research experience.\r\n\r\nThe Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) experiment leads the field of directional dark matter detection. The intellectual merit of this award resides in DRIFT's sensitivity to this modulated signature, which provides a unique window into one of the most important questions in science today. NSF-funded DRIFT-IId work over the last several years has led to enormous experimental progress. The collaboration is in the final stages of commissioning a new DRIFT-IIe detector. The operation of both detectors will test the viability of long-duration background-free exposures. This award will provide funding to continue the operations of DRIFT-II.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit\n\n\nIn this era of precision cosmology, measurements suggest that ordinary matter (protons and neutrons) represents only a fraction of the total matter density in the Universe.  The rest, whose effect we can only see gravitationally, appears to be dark.  Particle physics models suggest that dark matter might be composed of relic weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) left over from the Big Bang.  Efforts to directly detect WIMPs are hampered by small interaction probabilities and large backgrounds that mimic expected dark matter signals.  Fortunately, a number of unique dark matter signatures exist that can be used to discriminate against backgrounds and decisively identify WIMP interactions.  The largest and most robust of these signatures, based on the predicted behavior of the WIMP flux as the Sun-Earth system moves through the galaxy, is a day-night modulation of nuclear recoil directions in the lab frame.  Of current experimental searches for dark matter, the Directional Recoil Identification From Tracks (DRIFT) project has the longest running detectors underground and the best limits on dark matter interaction rates.  The intellectual merit of this proposal resides in DRIFT\u2019s unique and powerful capabilities being brought to bear on one of the most important questions in science today.\nThe DRIFT experiment is a multi-institution US (CSU, Occidental and UNM), UK (Boulby, Edinburgh and Sheffield) collaboration with the experiment housed in the UK at a depth of about 1 km in the Boulby Mine.  During this grant period we made progress in a number of areas.  \nDark matter experiments are plagued by backgrounds and DRIFT is no exception, until recently.  DRIFT was the first to identify radon progeny recoils (RPRs) from the central cathode as the primary background for directional detectors.  A discovery by the PI in 2013 showed a previously unknown way of distinguishing the recoils from the central cathode from dark matter recoils which occur in the bulk of the gas.  By adding a small amount of O2 to the gas mixture it was found that the position of the recoils could be measured to a few mm.  We immediately employed this technique on the DRIFT-IId detector in the Boulby mine.  What we discovered was all of the background events from RPRs clustered around the central cathode leaving nothing in the gas where we expect dark matter recoils.  DRIFT has been collecting background-free data ever since.\nWorried that maybe we threw the \"baby out with the bathwater\" we ran DRIFT-IId for several months without shielding and managed to detect recoils from neutrons coming from the walls of the cavern at a rate of an event every ~4 days in agreement with predictions.  We know of no other dark matter experiment with similar capabilities.\nPutting the shielding up and running for ~150 days of live time we detected no events and were able to set a limit ~10 thousand times better than our directional competition.\n\n\nBroader impacts\n\n\nThe primary impact of this research, outside of the research, is on undergraduates.  Occidental College is solely an undergraduate college; we do not have a graduate program.  Students interested in physics, though, have the opportunity to get involved in cutting-edge research at the forefront of physics.  Over the course of this proposal 8 different undergraduates were hired to work on this project.  Some of them for 3 summers in a row.  One student was entirely responsible for the 150 day analysis.  She is now in graduate school at UC Davis.  The PI has given a number of seminars about dark matter and DRIFT to a wide range of audiences.  Finally, the DRIFT detector technology has promising applications to double-beta decay experiments, KK Axion searches and tracking at the Next Linear Collider.  More recently we have found an exciting application for the DRIFT detector technology in the search for light dark matter at accelerators.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/24/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel P Snowden-Ifft"
