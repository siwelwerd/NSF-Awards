The equipment will foster investigator research focused on global nitrogen cycling in the oceans and aquatic systems with targeted studies of the stable isotopic composition of Nitrogen in Nitrous Oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas and within amino acids recovered from aquatic and marine organism tissues.  The requested equipment will replace an aging SIRMS at Michigan State, the LCOS will allow comparative studies of the value and precision of laser-based isotopic analysis versus traditional SIRMS analysis and the PI will prepare and make available to the broader community a suite of N isotopic standards needed for LCOS measurements.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview:\n\nIn this project we acquired instrumentation to advance two key research areas of the global nitrogen cycle: (1) evaluation of microbial nitrous oxide (N2O) production pathways and (2) understanding the causes of ocean-wide changes in nitrogen cycling, climate and/or trophic structure that has lead to stark centennial scale declines in oceanic d15N records. To meet our research foci we acquired (1) an isotope ratio mass spectrometer with 5 collectors, (2) a spectroscopic instrument capable of N2O stable  isotope analyses, (3) materials for the construction of a compressor system for filling large volume air tanks with a range of N2O concentrations and isotopic compositions, and (4) the acquisition of a gas chromatography nitrogen compound specific isotope analysis system capable of providing accurate amino acid nitrogen isotope values. \n\n Intellectual Merit:\n\nN2O is a potent greenhouse gas with over 200 times the capacity of CO2 to retain infrared radiation and there is increasing awareness of the need to better resolve the global budget of this gas and exercise mitigation strategies. A great deal of biogeochemical information is stored in the N2O molecule as the two elements (N and O) and 5 isotopes (14N, 15N, 16O, 17O and 18O) combine to create 12 different isotopic molecules. We are just beginning to realize how to read this isotopic library. For example, 15N can be found in the center (14N15N16O) or outer position (15N14N16O) of N2O and variation in the abundances of these isotopic molecules has emerged as an effective tracer of microbial production from nitrification and denitrification.\n\nWithin the North Pacific Ocean, long-term nitrogen isotope chronologies are indicating a marked ecosystem state change. But there is a debate as to whether the change is driven by (1) a trophic decline resultant from overfishing by humans that has shifted the entire trophic structure of the oceanic food web and/or (2) an increase in nitrogen fixation toward present linked to climate-coupled changes in the environment. Centennial scale nitrogen isotope chronologies of source amino acids from wide-ranging marine predators will settle this debate and enable us to probe important questions about the timing and extent of changes in nitrogen cycling within oceanic North Pacific.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThis proposal has had a broad impact on the scientific community via two key activities: (1) a short course on Stable Isotope Biogeochemistry that is offered biannually and (2) the development of isotopically characterized N2O in air standards for the research community.  Our short course is a one-week intensive lecture and laboratory course that presents fundamental principles of isotope theory and measurement to 18 students from across the U.S. and several other countries.  Further, we have incorporated presentations within the short course from industry; notably Elementar, Los Gatos (ABB) and Picarro. The emergence of spectroscopic instruments capable of measuring N2O isotopes is markedly increasing applications but such instruments are dependent upon accurately calibrated standards that retailers do not provide. Calibration is particularly challenging for spectroscopic instruments, as they require standards in air with a range of concentration and isotopic compositions within an air matrix.  Such standards are not available but we are in a position now to provide them to the scientific community.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/11/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nathaniel E Ostrom"
