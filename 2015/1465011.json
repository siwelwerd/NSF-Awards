 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for participants in the Midwest Partial Differential Equations Seminars, a series of semi-annual meetings on recent developments in partial differential equations. Partial differential equations (PDE) have numerous connections and applications in fields as diverse as geometry, analysis, mathematical physics, fluid dynamics, and mathematical biology. The Midwest PDE Seminar series bridges these scientific areas and brings together several generations of researchers. The 74th seminar (fall 2014 seminar) will be held at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, during October 18-19, 2014. The spring 2015 (75th) seminar will be held at the University of Minnesota.\r\n\r\nThe Seminars provide rapid communication of problems, methods, and results in partial differential equations, and also enhance interactions among the researchers in the Midwest working in PDE and related fields. Junior researchers and graduate students are given special priority when both speakers and funded participants are selected. Announcements of the upcoming Midwest PDE seminars are routinely widely distributed via a mailing list, and the programs and history of the Seminar are available at the web site http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~jlewis/midwpde/index.html",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe theory and application of partial differential equations is a major topic in the mathematical sciences. The roots of the subject go back to Newton in the 17th century. Newtonian mechanics, which replaced the earlier ideas of Descartes, is written in the language of differential equations.  By the end of the 19th century, most of physics was expressed in terms of differential equations, and this continues today, but broadened to include chemistry, biology, economic theory and finance as well as other areas of mathematics.  As a subject, it is viewed as essential in the pure sciences as well as in engineering practice. \n \nIn North America, the subject began to find its feet in the 1950s. By the middle of the 1960s, it was on its way to becoming a major subdiscipline in the mathematics firmament. In the middle 70s, some 40 years ago, Felix Browder (University of Chicago), Avner Friedman (Northwestern University), Mike Crandall and Paul Rabinowitz (University of Wisconsin, Madison) and Salah Baouendi (Purdue) conceived of a bi-yearly, informal meeting of mathematicians, joined occasionally by physicists, engineers, and later biologists, to discuss some of the latest developments in partial differential equations. This was partly due to their own predilections, but it was also in response to the burgeoning of the subject and its applications, and to the large preponderance of experts working at midwestern universities. Thus came into being the Midwest Partial Differential Equations Seminars. This seminar has been running twice a year for more than forty years now. Its impact has been, and continues to be, enormous. The meetings have been especially helpful for students and young researchers who benefit both from being exposed to what is current in the subject and to being able to present their own work to a group of experts for commentary and suggestions.\n\n \nA typical meeting features six to eight invited speakers and anywhere from four to eight presentations by younger researchers.  Over the years, many of the best senior practitioners have delivered lectures in this meeting.  Attendance at the meeting is usually around 40 or 50, but some have been considerably larger. They always run on the weekend, though some have started on Friday and others have run over to early in the next week.

However, that has broadened considerably by now.  Sixteen universities and one national laboratory have run meetings, including as far South as the University of Kentucky and University of Memphis, as far West as the University of Missouri, East to Ohio State and North to the University of Minnesota and the University of Michigan.  This has allowed a very large group of researchers to participate in these very successful seminars.\n\n\nThe present grant has continued the tradition so ably pioneered by Browder et al.  The grant sponsored Midwest PDE meetings at the University of Minnesota (75th), Michigan State (76th), University of Cincinnati (77th), Loyola University Chicago (78th), University of Illinois at Chicago (79th and 80th; a double meeting celebrating 40 years of the seminar), University of Wisconsin, Madison (81st) and Purdue University (82nd).  Details of these meetings are found in the annual reports.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/17/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Irina Nenciu"
