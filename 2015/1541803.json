For example, cybersecurity researchers fear certain good-faith work could put them in personal legal jeopardy.  At the same time, the risks to the public and the economy associated with security research must be addressed.  This project convenes a set of leading computer scientists, academics, and lawyers to map out the challenges and propose a set of concrete solutions, including articulating reasonable norms, standards, or best practices for the conduct of cybersecurity research that could be used as a guide for defining good-faith research and for applying current statutes and exemptions.",
