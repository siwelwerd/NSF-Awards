Held at the University of Urbino, in Italy, the USSP leverages the expertise of internationally-recognized experts from Europe and the US to provide a two-and-a-half-week intensive, immersive learning experience in paleoclimate research topics and methods for an cohort of ~60 students from around the world. These students present their own research and participate in lecture- and lab-style classes while broadening their research networks in an international setting. Each session of the USSP brings in a new group of students and provides fresh opportunities for international collaboration. The experience of previous students suggests that participation in the USSP lays a foundation for success, including international collaborations both with their peers and with more senior researchers. \r\n\r\nRoughly ten scholarships are awarded each year to outstanding applicants who are selected on a competitive basis.",
