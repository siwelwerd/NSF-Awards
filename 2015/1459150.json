 "awd_abstract_narration": "Technical Description\r\nPeople often rely on projections from multiple experts to make decisions. This includes daily decisions like utilizing multiple weather forecasts as well as life-changing decisions like seeking multiple doctors' opinions about a serious diagnosis. Previous research has differentiated between conflicting and imprecise forecasts. Conflict is observed when multiple advisers offer different, but precise, forecasts (e.g. one expert projects 6 inches of snow and another projects only 1 inch). Imprecision is observed when the advisers agree in their imprecision (e.g. both experts forecast 1 to 6 inches of snow). Previous models treat conflict and imprecision separately, but they are rarely well-differentiated and often correlated (e.g. one expert predicts 1 to 5 inches of snow and another predicts 2 to 6 inches). This proposal examines how various combinations of these two factors (conflict and imprecision) alter people's perceptions and choices based on the theoretical hypothesis that conflict and imprecision are functions of the underlying attributes of the forecast sets. The ultimate goal is to determine optimal modes of aggregating and presenting multiple forecasts to invoke accurate perceptions of the information. \r\n\r\nThe research plan includes a series of online experiments involving nationally-representative samples comparing various combinations of conflict and imprecision varied by the type and degree of two key set factors, similarity and symmetry. Similarity refers to the relationship between the forecasts and has three categories: disjoint sets that do not overlap, intersecting sets that partially overlap, and nested sets where one set is fully embedded in the other. Symmetry refers to the balance of the sets around the center (or mathematically, the relative deviation of the mean of all forecasts from their median). The direction of asymmetry can vary, so positively (negatively) skewed sets have fewer high (low) values. Participants will view several sets of interval forecasts in well-defined domains and will estimate the most likely value, range of possible values, and rate the sets on key attributes (e.g., ambiguity, credibility, informativeness, etc.). We will also manipulate the topic domains (using finance, health, and politics contexts) to test the generalizability of the results. \r\n\r\nBroader Significance and Importance\r\nThe analysis will quantify the effects of the various factors manipulated on the decision makers? decisions.  We will also use various dimensionality reduction and classification techniques (multidimensional scaling paired with cluster analysis) to map the various projection sets based on their \"psychological distances\" to help understand the cognitive processes that drive people's responses. \r\n\r\nThis study is an important step toward improving the communication of risk and uncertainty based on empirically observed psychological principles. Such steps are vital to bridging the gap between experts and laypeople because non-experts are often disproportionally influenced by how information is presented. These results are relevant to many domains such as military intelligence, climate forecasting, etc., which must make careful decisions to invest their scarce time and money to reduce uncertainties between and within experts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPeople often rely on forecasts from multiple experts to make decisions about uncertain quantities in domains as diverse as health, finance, and politics.  Previous research has differentiated between perceptions of conflicting and imprecise forecasts showing greater conflict aversion.  However, conflict and imprecision are rarely well-differentiated and are often correlated.  This series of studies tests the hypothesis that the joint influence of conflict and imprecision on estimates of most likely values and judgmental ratings is a function of two key attributes of the forecast sets, overlap and symmetry.\n\nStudy 1 established the general response pattern in two interval forecast sets by varying the type and degree of these two key set factors.  Study 2 generalized the results by extending the design to include three interval forecast sets.  Results indicate that responses are task-dependent.  Symmetry has a stronger impact on estimates, and overlap has a stronger influence on ratings.  People center their estimates around the mean of the set as expected, but there is also a consistent shift toward lower values (a status quo bias).  Range estimates correspond with the internal endpoints.  Ranges are generally narrow when attention is focused on the center of the forecast set and wider when focus shifts to the extremes.  Disjoint sets lead to greater shifting in and around a forecast set than intersecting sets.  Attempts to model best estimates indicate that people focus on a local subset of the full region to make estimates.\n\nRatings are driven by the structure of the forecast set.  Imprecision is considered the most indeterminate set and all hybrid sets are least indeterminate.  The hybrid sets fall in between imprecision and conflict for compatibility ratings.  Ratings follow a clear pattern of preference.  Overlap drives preferences more than symmetry.  People are more confident when the overlap is small and the set is symmetric, but the impact of symmetry depends on whether the set is centrally- or outwardly-focused when there are three forecasts.  Disjoint sets generally lead to lower ratings, but defining disagreement is difficult since intersecting sets are sometimes rated as conflicting and disjoint sets sometimes are rating as agreeing.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/13/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Benjamin"
