The annual meeting will advance discovery and understanding of theoretical problems in psychology and the social sciences.  It will create an environment in which mathematically oriented social scientists can grow and flourish.  It will promote training and learning of new models and methods for analyzing behavioral data and make possible the broad dissemination of new findings important in all areas of psychology, as well as economics, political science, sociology, and anthropology.  Support for student travel will allow the organizers to involve more individuals from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nMathematical psychology is interdisciplinary by nature, bringing together social scientists, statisticians, mathematicians, and computer scientists to work on problems critical to behavioral and cognitive scientists.  The 2015 annual meeting will include three symposia on new developments that have not been featured at recent meetings: (1) Dynamics of adaptive rationality; (2) Systems factorial technology; and (3) New developments in the analysis and modeling of naturally occurring data sets.  The annual meeting also will include a half-day professional development symposium organized by the Women of Mathematical Psychology and a post-conference networking event with potential industrial partners.",
