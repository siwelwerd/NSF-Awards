The transformative aspect of the project resides in providing new insights into the emerging field of high speed inertial microfluidics and droplet microflows in specific. This understanding will lead to the development of next generation Lab-on-a-Chip (LOC) and micro-Total Analysis Systems (mTAS) with processing speed and throughput capabilities not seen before.\r\n\r\nThe research aims to address (1) the role and interplay between inertial, viscous and surface tension forces in the droplet detachment mechanism, (2) mapping of the different flow regimes and transitions that can lead to droplet generation, and (3) the dynamics of inertial droplet collision mixing in a confined microchannel environment. Towards these goals, research efforts will be put forward that focus on the experimental study of the fast droplet dynamics and interactions through the use of novel optical diagnostics techniques. In specific, a microfluidic droplet generation platform that allows control and monitoring of the liquid and gas flows conditions will be coupled to a high speed microscopy system to study the liquid droplet entrainment dynamics. Similarly, a microfluidic droplet pair collision platform will be coupled to a high speed epi-fluorescence microscopy system, where differential dual fluorescence measurements and mPIV will be used as tools to unravel the fast dynamics associated with inertial collision mixing. The experimental work will be complemented by first order modeling and global force analysis of the different phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of the project includes elucidating the role of inertial effects in the detachment, entrainment and collision mixing of liquid droplets in confined gas carrier microflows. The test structures and experiments to be carried out in this study will provide unique insight into the effects that different flow and boundary conditions have on droplet formation and collision coalescence. The microfluidic test samples to be used are designed and fabricated so that the geometry and flow conditions under which the droplets interact can be carefully controlled, allowing for a clearer understanding of the effects that different microscopic geometrical parameters have on the entrainment and collision coalescence processes.\r\n\r\nThe research endeavors and outcomes from this work will be integrated into educational and outreach activities that will introduce the field of microscale flow and transport to underrepresented undergraduate engineering and high school students early in their career. Innovative multilayer, self-sustainable programs geared towards development of teaching content while providing research training, will be introduced. Research training of individual students will take place through summer internship programs aimed at developing microfluidic and optical diagnostics lab modules and demonstrations.  These will in turn be deployed and introduced in an undergraduate experimental class and several outreach programs, respectively.",

The distinctive feature of gas-liquid droplet systems resides in the high-speed nature of the flows involved in formation and transport of the droplets, and the interaction of the two phases under confined microchannel boundaries. Through this project, the mechanisms by which a liquid thread breaks up into droplets in a high-speed gaseous flow has been studied in common microfluidic geometries (<em>e.g.</em> T-junction and flow-focusing). A key outcome of this work was demonstrating the nontrivial role of inertial forces in the formation and detachment of the droplets, which is usually non-existing in conventional liquid-liquid droplet-based systems. The resultant flow regimes that emerged under different flow conditions inside the microchannel were also investigated and mapped based on the relevant dimensionless numbers, namely Reynolds (<em>Re</em>) and Weber (<em>We</em>) numbers of the two phases (See Figure 1).</p>\n<p>In addition to elucidating the underlying physics and principles of gas-liquid systems, another outcome of this project was the development of a novel Lab-On-a-Chip (LOC or miniaturized portable biochemical laboratory) that benefits from the interaction of gas-liquid microflows. An integrated microfluidic platform was developed for sampling and digitization of airborne targets (aerosols, gases and vapors) using the gas-generated liquid droplets. Through interaction of the gas flow with the liquid droplets, the gas-based targets are absorbed and become tightly confined within each droplet volume, leading to a several orders-of-magnitude increase in volumetric concentration. Application of this airborne target sampling approach was successfully demonstrated for detection and analysis of vaporized ammonia in air samples using the Nessler&rsquo;s coloration reaction inside the droplets (See Figure 2).</p>\n<p>A final outcome was the development of a technique for probing mixing dynamics using dual-fluorescence imaging.&nbsp; Concentration distribution in a flow can be obtained by seeding the fluid with a fluorescent dye. Fluorescent emission is proportional to the concentration of the dye. However, excitation source fluctuations can lead to erroneous correlations between fluorescent intensity and dye concentration. To correct for excitation inconsistencies, a ratiometric approach is employed that divides two images exhibiting the same instantaneous excitation pattern, thus removing excitation information. The degree of mixing is determined by calculating the standard deviation of the ratio values within an image, as ratio values correspond directly to dye concentration. The accuracy of this technique was assessed by comparing the experimental dual-fluorescence signal to numerical simulations of the concentration and fluorescence emissions in a simple diffusion-based micromixer. The technique was then applied to a high-speed droplet micromixer system that uses chaotic advection for enhanced mixing (See Figure 3).</p>\n<p>The experimental work performed during the lifetime of the project lead to six (6) journal publications, seven (7) conference proceedings, several oral and poster presentations at various conferences, and one (1) patent application.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader Impact:</span> </strong>The knowledge gained in terms of flow and transport dynamics of high-speed gas-liquid microflows has significant impact in the general area of microchannel two-phase flows with major implications for areas such as biotechnology (airborne based digital-droplet PCR and genomics), healthcare (biochemical analysis of airborne targets and aerosols generation for drug delivery), aerospace (micro-combustors), and nanomanufacturing (3D printing).<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>In addition, the problems that were tackled in this cross-disciplinary project presented rich engineering, physics, and materials challenges to the graduate and undergraduate students involved.
