 "awd_abstract_narration": "The transition between high school and undergraduate institutions is a particularly important critical juncture for students considering whether to pursue degrees and careers in the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines.  Due to state and local policies that govern high school science curriculum and graduation requirements, most high school students are not exposed formally to the geosciences prior to making choices about future careers in STEM.  As a result, many of the students who do ultimately choose the geosciences have found this field through happenstance, making the geosciences a \"discovery major\" in college.  With the anticipated need of ~135,000 geoscientists in the next several years, due to retirements and higher-than-average job growth rates, as well as the critical role that geoscientists play in the employment sectors related to energy production, natural hazards mitigation, and the infrastructure construction, more intentional approaches to recruiting students into the geosciences are needed. In addition, greater engagement of traditionally underrepresented minorities in STEM is needed to build diversity in the geosciences workforce, which is currently very limited.  \r\n\r\nThe University of Texas at Austin is testing the underlying theory of change for the IUSE: GEOPATHS program that \"using novel ways of engaging a larger population of students and exposing them to authentic, career relevant geoscience experiences that augment the formal curriculum will increase their desire to earn degrees and pursue careers in the field.\" To test this theory, the project is investigating whether a collaboratively developed and implemented geoscience-focused program of career exploration, student mentoring, 6-8 days of field excursions, and evidence-based geoscience-infused classroom instruction will impact a students' sense of belonging in geoscience and help them transition into undergraduate geoscience programs. The summer mentored field program is offered through the award-winning GeoFORCE program; the classroom instruction activities are using tested pedagogical approaches and content developed with prior NSF support for the Diversity and Innovation for Geosciences in Texas (DIG Texas) and EarthLabs projects.  It is expected that a sense of belonging will consequently lead to an increased desire to earn geoscience degrees and pursue geoscience careers. This three year project is establishing a robust collaboration between geoscience educators and researchers in the Jackson School of Geosciences at UT Austin and Michigan State University, educators and administrators at Akins High School in the Austin Independent School District in Texas, and geoscientists at DrillingInfo, an oil and gas firm. Activities are underway to (1) provide Akins administrators and science teachers with educational resources and professional development, allowing them to teach about geoscience, environmental systems, energy, and natural resources in the school's Green Tech Academy; and (2) conduct educational research to investigate the role that classroom and field experiences play in developing students' sense of belonging in geoscience, with anticipated simultaneous effects on (a) geoscience knowledge, (b) attitudes towards geoscience, and (c) engagement in geoscience and geoscience career activities in high school. By focusing on Akins High School, which has large a large minority (84 percent Hispanic and African American) student population, the project has the potential to achieve greater diversity in the geosciences through education, exemplary teacher preparation, and career exploration.",

Students from underserved communities in Texas enter these programs after 8<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;grade and participate every summer for four years in weeklong geology fieldtrips to different parts of the U.S. The project leveraged resources and expertise from four participating institutions, the STEMFORCE program and&nbsp;a private sector company&nbsp;to generate educational and human resources for out-of-school summer experiences that emphasize field learning in the geosciences and investigated the interplay between geoscience field&nbsp;learning, classroom preparation and exposure to geoscience careers.&nbsp;Research focused on STEMFORCE student learning and attitudes by&nbsp;studying&nbsp;a single cohort of 30 STEMFORCE students over three years. Evaluation documented<strong>&nbsp;</strong>changes among all participants, Including STEMFORCE staff, as a consequence of their participation.</p>\n<p>Early findings revealed that the trips sparked interest in geosciences, but revisions to content and content delivery were needed to motivate more students to consider geoscience as a career. In response, the 12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;grade trip was&nbsp;redesigned as a Challenge Base Learning (CBL) capstone experience set in&nbsp;Central Texas where students were housed in UT Austin dormitories and had access to JSG research labs, technology and communication experiences available on the campus of UT Austin, and geology field sites that span more than a billion years of Earth history. Curriculum and instruction follow the STAR Legacy Cycle&nbsp;in which&nbsp;the challenge is an authentic task that drives student-centered learning with specific deliverables, shifting the&nbsp;emphasis away&nbsp;from memorization to active learning.&nbsp;The curriculum resides on the Science Education Resource Center (SERC) website and is freely available to the public.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The single instructor-led direct teaching (via lecture) of previous 12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;grade trips was replaced with learning facilitated by a multi-person instructional team that more closely resembled the racial, ethnic and cultural composition of the STEMFORCE student population. This change created&nbsp;opportunities for undergraduate students&nbsp;to participate as Educational Coaches-in-Training (ECITs). Eighteen ECITs&nbsp;from the UTeach program, Geological Sciences and Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Departments, Austin Community College and Fort Valley State University participated on eight trips. They reported positive and rewarding experiences, especially in their role of near-peer mentors to the high school students. Through their participation in the project, they improved their ability to communicate geoscience knowledge, developed a deeper understanding of fundamental geoscience concepts, and gained experience in geoscience field instruction and teaching inquiry activities that support learning within a CBL framework. ECITs were introduced to geoscience education research through interaction with the geoscience education researchers, the project evaluator, and by reading and discussing scholarly articles. Combining preservice teachers from the UTeach program with STEM/ Geoscience majors led to peer-peer mentoring and knowledge transfer between geoscience, education and communication. The CBL&nbsp;Legacy Cycle curriculum has been implemented in both GeoFORCE and STEMFORCE 12<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;grade experiences and&nbsp;ECITs continue to be involved as instructional team members.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By the end of project, STEMFORCE students&nbsp;were thinking more like geoscientists and emphasizing skills in addition to content.&nbsp;They were better able to interpret landscapes, recognize geologic processes, improved their understanding of time and scale, and reported a greater appreciation for the environment. The&nbsp;Legacy Cycle curriculum&nbsp;propelled students into the role of apprentice geoscientists by asking them to address a challenge that required knowledge acquisition and the development of&nbsp;both hard and soft skills, including&nbsp;being able to make predictions and interpretations, and communicate results. Students expressed that STEMFORCE trips helped to awaken their natural curiosity, promoted self-reflection and personal growth, boosted their confidence, and taught them about health, self-care and how to recognize personal limitations. They reported that being exposed to different cultures encouraged them to become more social, learning to interact with others who may be different from them or come from dissimilar places, and forming friendships that they expect to last. Participation in STEMFORCE potentially contributed to their development as better citizens, good neighbors, students, and productive workers. The life skills of cultural competence, collaboration, self-reflection, and confidence will serve them well no matter what career path they chose or where they live or travel in the future. It may open them up to experiences that they may not have contemplated previously. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project demonstrated how CBL can be used to promote student learning in out-of-school programs, a finding that has application beyond the STEMFORCE and GeoFORCE programs. Outcomes contribute to the growing body of geoscience education research that focuses on diversity and learning in the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>URL:&nbsp;<span>https://serc.carleton.edu/dig_blueprints/blueprints/geoforce_academy/index.html</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Katherine&nbsp;K&nbsp;Ellins</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540608/1540608_10398596_1575170517408_StagesofaLegacyCycle_v3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540608/1540608_10398596_1575170517408_StagesofaLegacyCycle_v3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Stages of  Legacy Cycle Challenge\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540608/1540608_10398596_1575170517408_StagesofaLegacyCycle_v3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Stages of  Legacy Cycle Challenge\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">As learners address  a Legacy Cycle challenge, they progress through stages that engage them in activities that imitate the way scientists approach and solve problems.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel Campos</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Katherine&nbsp;K&nbsp;Ellins</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Stages of  Legacy Cycle Challenge</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540608/1540608_10398596_1575170751435_Instructerhelpsstudentwithhisproject--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540608/1540608_10398596_1575170751435_Instructerhelpsstudentwithhisproject--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Instructor and student\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540608/1540608_10398596_1575170751435_Instructerhelpsstudentwithhisproject--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Instructor and student\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An instructor helps a STEMFORCE student with his project.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel Campos</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Katherine&nbsp;K&nbsp;Ellins</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Instructor and student</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540608/1540608_10398596_1575170993361_StudentsexamininganoutcropatInksLake,TX--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540608/1540608_10398596_1575170993361_StudentsexamininganoutcropatInksLake,TX--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students on an outcrop at Inks Lake, TX\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540608/1540608_10398596_1575170993361_StudentsexamininganoutcropatInksLake,TX--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students on an outcrop at Inks Lake, TX\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students on an outcrop at Inks Lake, TX</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel Campos</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Katherine&nbsp;K&nbsp;Ellins</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students on an outcrop at Inks Lake, TX</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540608/1540608_10398596_1575171212488_Studentstakingnotesinthefield--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540608/1540608_10398596_1575171212488_Studentstakingnotesinthefield--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"STEMFORCE students collecting data\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1540608/1540608_10398596_1575171212488_Studentstakingnotesinthefield--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"STEMFORCE students collecting data\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">STEMFORCE students at Inks Lake make observations and take measurements that they will use for their team projects.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel Campos</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Katherine&nbsp;K&nbsp;Ellins</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">STEMFORCE students collecting data</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
