 "awd_abstract_narration": "To foster innovation and address important questions facing society, interdisciplinary research (IDR), which integrates perspectives from two or more disciplines, is being promoted by federal and state funding agencies.  However there is little evidence about how well universities are engaging with IDR, the types of institutional commitments they provide, or what the consequences are for the conduct of scientific research and the performance of universities.  Previous research examines individual scientists' engagement in IDR, but they miss the larger institutional context, which the current project studies.  The results from this project are of interest to university administrators, funding agencies, and science policy experts as they decide how to invest in research and which aspects of university commitment to IDR are most effective for promoting specific goals (e.g., scholarly research output, commercial output, and prestige), allowing them to make informed decisions about where to focus their investments.  \r\n\r\nThis project constructs a comprehensive dataset, develops multiple measures of university commitment to IDR, and provides the first empirical study of its causes and consequences. The research team is compiling data on all (157) top U.S. research universities from multiple sources to create a unique university-level dataset.  After developing measures of university commitment to IDR, statistical regression techniques are employed in two stages.  In the first stage of analysis, regression models test which factors promote engagement with IDR.  Possible factors include resource reductions (e.g., declines in state funding or university ranking) as well as pressures and incentives to pursue IDR that emanate from funding agencies, university administrators, and faculty (e.g., grants targeted to multidisciplinary teams).  In the second stage of analysis, regression models assess how engagement with IDR affects universities and scientific progress, specifically scholarly research output (e.g. publications and citations), commercial research output (e.g., patents), and/or prestige (e.g., university rankings).\r\n",

But to date, there is little empirical evidence about the effectiveness of IDR, and there?s been a general neglect of another key player: universities, where the bulk of research and development in the U.S. is conducted. &nbsp;The research supported by this grant set out to study the 157 top research universities nationwide, and answer three main questions: 1) Is it possible to measure whether and how much a given university is ?committed? to IDR?; 2) Why are some universities more committed to IDR than others?; and 3) What are the consequences of such commitment for research activity, especially interdisciplinary research activity?&nbsp; Below, we summarize our answers to these questions before discussing the broader impacts of this research.</p>\n<p>First, we developed a valid and reliable way to measure how committed a given university is to IDR (published in S<em>cientometrics</em> in 2019). We focus on durable, structural commitments like those apparent through a university?s sub-units where the bulk of research takes place: departments (e.g., Biology) and research centers (e.g., the Center for Sustainability).&nbsp; We did not assume, as many have, that departments are all disciplinary and centers are all interdisciplinary. Rather, we collected data on all departments and centers housed at the 157 top research universities in the U.S., and used computational methods to classify each center and department as interdisciplinary or not. From this data we calculated, for each university, the number of departments and centers, and the fraction of each that are interdisciplinary. We then combined this information into a score (via a measurement model, depicted in Figure 1) that captures each university?s level of commitment to IDR. We find that indeed, some universities (like Harvard and UC Riverside) are very structurally committed to IDR, whereas others like MIT and Stanford are less committed (see distribution of scores in Figure 2). &nbsp;Our statistical analyses reveal that the universities most structurally committed to IDR tend to have higher status, are affiliated with a medical school, are not located in the South, and do not have ?tech? in their name (e.g., MIT).</p>\n<p>FIGURES 1 &amp; 2</p>\n<p>Second, we wanted to know what leads some universities to be more committed to IDR than others. We specifically focused on the role of (top-down) support from university administrators and of (bottom-up) engagement with IDR by faculty members. Figure 3 depicts our thinking about these relationships, which ? our results show ? differ for universities with and without medical schools. At universities with medical schools, bottom-up engagement is positively associated with structural commitment to IDR, and status moderates the relationship between top-down administrative support and structural commitment to IDR: it is only at high status universities that administrative support for IDR is positively related to structural commitment to IDR. &nbsp;At universities without medical schools, it was only when both top-down support and bottom-up engagement were present that there was a significant positive relationship to commitment to IDR.</p>\n<p>FIGURE 3</p>\n<p>Third, we were curious about what this structural commitment wrought.&nbsp; Did it really spur greater research activity, and especially interdisciplinary research activity?&nbsp; We examined two types of research activity: publication of journal articles, and receipt of external grants from NSF and NIH.&nbsp; Results suggest that structural commitment to IDR indeed produces some of its intended effects. We found that universities? commitment to IDR spurs both scholarly research and NIH grant activity in general, and interdisciplinary research and NIH grant activity in particular.</p>\n<p>FIGURE 4</p>\n<p>Together, these papers may inform the practices of universities and influence research policy, as they seek to find ways to promote IDR that can address grand scientific challenges.&nbsp; We documented that measuring commitment to a certain type of knowledge (like IDR) is possible and informative, as universities vary widely in their levels of commitment. &nbsp;Science policy efforts to boost commitment to IDR may want to focus on universities where commitment is low: those with lower status, lacking a medical school, and with a technical focus.&nbsp; Our results suggest that there is no ?one size fits all? approach to increasing university commitment to IDR. &nbsp;Rather, the best approach depends on the institutional context, like whether a medical school is affiliated with the university. &nbsp;Because universities? commitment to IDR promotes research activity, and especially publications and NIH grants, efforts to develop and fund academic units are not futile; rather, when value commitments are made tangible via foundational research units like departments and centers, they can work as intended.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/03/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Erin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Leahey</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461989/1461989_10355904_1567542539329_Figure1jpeg--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461989/1461989_10355904_1567542539329_Figure1jpeg--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461989/1461989_10355904_1567542539329_Figure1jpeg--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">project team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Leahey</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461989/1461989_10355904_1567542570010_Figure2jpeg--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461989/1461989_10355904_1567542570010_Figure2jpeg--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461989/1461989_10355904_1567542570010_Figure2jpeg--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">project team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Leahey</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461989/1461989_10355904_1567542607921_Figure3jpeg--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461989/1461989_10355904_1567542607921_Figure3jpeg--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461989/1461989_10355904_1567542607921_Figure3jpeg--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 3</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">project team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Leahey</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461989/1461989_10355904_1567542646688_Figure4jpeg--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461989/1461989_10355904_1567542646688_Figure4jpeg--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1461989/1461989_10355904_1567542646688_Figure4jpeg--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 4</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">project team</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Leahey</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
