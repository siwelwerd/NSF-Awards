 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project can lead to a revolution in the consumer\r\nelectronics market (mobile handsets, tablets, game consoles and wearables), wherein high performance,\r\nlow power, small footprint multisensing (not limited to inertial sensing) platforms with timing devices,\r\nare all directly microfabricated on a common ASIC substrate. Sensor fusion can produce unprecedented\r\nuser experiences by using data collected from all sensors and processed using machine learning\r\nalgorithms. This can further boost the sensor and timing markets that are expected to exceed $6 billion\r\ndollars by 2017. Moreover, the emergent Internet of Things (IoTs) and wearable markets are expected to\r\nreach $20 billion dollars by 2025, which can induce a rapid growth of such intelligent sensor fusion\r\nmarket. This can have a tremendous societal impact as wearable devices and IoT systems, interfaced with\r\nmobile platforms, can be used to monitor people?s health, safety and energy consumption. Making these\r\nsolutions affordable will make it amenable to low income households not only in the US but also around\r\nthe world. It will also enable researchers to attain new frontiers of knowledge such as in digital sensory\r\nsystems. The long-term goals are to provide such intelligent sensor fusion solutions.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to demonstrate wafer-scale\r\nmicrofabrication of Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) inertial sensors directly on the\r\napplication specific integrated circuit (ASIC) substrates, by using electroplated copper (e-Cu) as a\r\nstructural material. MEMS inertial sensors, such as gyroscopes and accelerometers, are pervasively used\r\nin consumer electronics and automotive industries. Current trends are, however, requiring higher device\r\nperformance with smaller footprints, wherein multi-degree-of-freedom sensors are integrated on the same\r\npackage, to enable new capabilities and user experiences. These requirements can be met by\r\nmonolithically fabricating inertial sensors on ASIC substrates, which is complex to achieve with silicon\r\nas a structural material. Using e-Cu, which is currently used for ASIC metal interconnects, as the\r\nstructural material, can enable easier routing to implement optimized mechanical structures, smaller\r\ndimensions given the high density of copper, extremely low cost as no wafer bonding is required, smaller\r\nform factors, multiple sensors on a single die, and much smaller parasitics providing low noise and higher\r\nperformance. Phase I tasks will be to wafer-scale fabricate and characterize e-Cu gyroscopes and\r\naccelerometers with optimal performance parameters and address any drift problems that could emanate\r\nfrom structural reliability issues associated with the MEMS elements.",
