 "awd_abstract_narration": "The major goal of this research program is to understand the thermal evolution of the whole Earth, especially its mantle, which helps govern the heat flow driving convection and ultimately generates plate tectonics, earthquakes, and volcanism activity on the Earth's surface. The mineral property of thermal conductivity helps govern the amount of heat that can escape the core and is ultimately transferred to the Earth's surface, where it escapes mostly through volcanism. However, thermal conductivity is not well known for the materials at the high pressures and temperatures inside the Earth. The goal of this research program is to measure the thermal conductivity of important Earth materials at high pressures and temperatures, and then use the measured values to understand how the Earth cools down throughout geological time.\r\n\r\nUsing a diamond anvil cell laser-heating technique, the PI will measure how the thermal conductivity of oxides, silicates, and iron-based alloys vary with temperature, pressure, and composition. These measurements will help determine the thermal conductivity of the inner core and outer core as a function of time, and help constrain dynamo behavior and the role of the inner core in helping to determine the magnetic field. The second outcome is a measure of the effect of chemical change and phase change on the thermal conductivity of oxides, silicates, and iron alloys at deep Earth conditions. This will help assess temporal and spatial variations of thermal conductivity of the deep Earth. The third outcome is a measure of near infrared optical absorption properties of mantle oxides and silicates directly at the relevant high pressures and temperatures. This will constrain place bounds on the radiative contribution to deep Earth thermal conductivity. The outcome of the work proposed here contributes to the broader goal of a three-dimensional time-dependent portrait of the thermal properties of the Earth, both temperature and heat flow, from the surface to the core.",
