 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:  Organic photovoltaic devices (OPV) provide opportunities for a low cost solar energy technology, but improved materials are critical to commercial viability.  Undergraduate participants in the Rochester Institute of Technology REU Site will (i) conduct research to develop materials while (ii) learning the theory of OPV operation and (iii) engineering new device architectures.  Thus, the project will provide a blueprint for substantiating the expansion from laboratory prototypes to mass-produced units and will help build an educated and experienced workforce to tackle ongoing issues in energy and sustainability.  Broader impacts of the program will also be achieved through dissemination of findings on (i) engaging deaf students in undergraduate research,  (ii) outreach, recruitment, and retention of \"2+2\" or \"2+3\" students who choose a community college or small 4-year institution to complete general education requirements and then transfer into a strong science, technology or engineering program to complete a bachelor's degree.  These students often enter a research-focused university underprepared for the rigor of science and engineering and lagging in technology exposure.  Success associated with the broad theme of organic photovoltaics may enable affordable, sustainable OPV energy systems that contribute to US energy independence and a low-cost, portable technology vital for energy in developing countries.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:  This project is centered on the development of improved materials targeted for organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices, which will contribute to a broad portfolio of solar energy technologies.  Within the scope of the proposal, the undergraduates will participate in (i) experimental validation of simple theoretical components that will lead to well-directed and implementable synthesis strategies and (ii) manufacture and testing of prototype photovoltaic devices.  The project will build upon RIT's functional printing strengths to bring OPV technology closer to commercial manufacture through ink development and substrate modification.  Participating students will develop a fundamental understanding of how their chosen field of science contributes to the interdisciplinary nature of OPV materials research.  The students will participate in extramurally funded research projects and as co-authors of resulting peer-reviewed publications and/or national conference presentations.",
