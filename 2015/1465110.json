 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program is supporting Professor James Mack at the University of Cincinnati Department of Chemistry to explore a solvent-free method known as mechanochemistry to discover new synthetic pathways that are not observed in solution. This research seeks to develop mechanochemical methods for many common synthetic reactions,  with a goal of reducing hazardous waste. One major focus is on the development of recyclable catalysts through the use of polymer supported reagents and metal reaction vials, which act as catalysts.  The ability to recycle expensive catalysts will significantly reduce the overall cost to conduct many reactions. Professor Mack will integrate the research and educational components of this project through the introduction of students to principles of environmentally benign chemistry.  His program fosters a research and learning environment with overlapping experiences among high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. In this environment, high school students are mentored by undergraduates, who are in turn mentored by graduate students. These connections introduce younger students to graduate education, as well as providing role models for success.  The mentorship experienced by students is especially beneficial to first generation college students, many of whom have had no prior knowledge about graduate education.  This process is intended to increase the pipeline of STEM students, especially women and underrepresented minorities\r\n\r\nThis research seeks to further develop a solvent-free synthetic method known as ball-milling (a type of mechanochemistry) to improve the efficiency of chemical reactions and to reduce hazardous solvent waste.  Ball-milling is a procedure in which solid chemical reactants are first placed inside a reaction vessel along with a ball bearing.   The vessel is sealed and placed inside a milling apparatus where it is agitated at high speed.  This agitation provides energy through the steel ball to initiate a reaction.  The present research focuses on the development of recyclable catalysts through the use of polymer supported reagents and metal reaction vials.  The planned research will demonstrate new activation pathways for polymer supported reagents as well as new mechanisms for the activation of metal catalysts.  Because mechanochemistry is a relatively new field, many of the rules that govern reactions are not well understood. This research will use metal reaction vials to facilitate metal catalyzed chemical reactions.  This will lead to greater understanding of the reactivity of metal catalysts in a ligand and solvent-free environment.  Additionally, the use of polymer supported reagents under solvent-free conditions will provide new mechanistic insights on the activation of polymer supports.  Typically these types of reactions are limited by the slow rate of diffusion; however, under mechanochemical conditions this limitation is expected to be easily overcome. Mechanochemical reactions will be compared to their solution counterparts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAlthough great strides have been made to reduce the amount of waste generated in the chemical industry, current methods are not sustainable.  Since solvents represent roughly 85% of the total mass used in pharmaceutical manufacturing, many companies have developed guidelines to ensure the utilization of environmentally benign solvents in the synthesis of drugs.  In addition to the amount of waste produced using solvents, solvents themselves are very costly to acquire. According to the Department of Energy, there are over 40,000 distillation facilities in the United States. These distillation facilities consume approximately 40-60% of the overall energy used by the chemical and refining industry.  Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop environmentally benign methods to carry out chemical reactions.\nMechanochemistry (i.e. ball milling) is an underexplored potential solution to the chemical waste problem. Mechanochemistry is a procedure in which, solid reactants are placed inside a vessel, in the absence of solvent, along with a ball bearing. The vessel is sealed and placed inside the milling apparatus whereby it is agitated. The high-speed agitation allows the molecules to interact at the molecular level in order to initiate a reaction. Many of the fundamental principles that govern this technique are still absent from the literature. Over the course of the funding period we were able to elucidate various principles that can be applied to developing more sustainable chemical reactions. \nIntellectual Merit\nOver the funding period we learned:\n\nHow to control the energy of a mechanochemical reaction. We learned that energy can be changed and controlled through a number of different variables, most notably milling speed, temperature and vial material. We are poised in our lab to utilize this knowledge to create more selective chemical reactions than can be afforded in solution  \nHow to generate recycleable catalyst through mechanochemistry. We learned that various metals can be used as a component of a chemical reaction under mechanochemical conditions.  We are poised in our lab to utilize this knowledge to create more selective metal catalyzed chemical reactions than can be afforded in solution\nHow to use polymer bound reagents and liquid assisted grinding to switch product selectivity. We learned that polymer-supported reagents are very compatible with mechanochemical conditions.  These reactions are more versatile and produce higher yields and much faster reaction rates than observed in solution.\nHow to synthesize sterically hindered molecules under mechanochemical conditions.  We learned that mechanochemical reactions can be useful in the synthesis of sterically crowded molecules and in places where the SN1 pathway is problematic in solution. \n\nBroader Impacts\nIn addition to understanding the fundamental rules behind mechanochemical reactions, we also have developed a series of environmentally benign chemical conditions.  We have shown that in many reactions, solvents are not necessary especially in the case of air and moisture sensitive reactions.  We have developed a chromatography?free isolation procedure using polymer-supported reagents, as well as shown the ability to recycle different materials.  We have a better understanding of the energy of a mechanochemical reaction, and designed a mill that has the ability to change speeds and temperature in order to study further the energetics of this unique process.   Our work on metal catalyzed reactions and the ability to control the energy of our systems, demonstrated the ability to develop new chemistry that is not only solvent-free, but allows for additional control that cannot be performed under traditional solution-based conditions. \nOur research program has not only benefitted society through our scientific findings, but we have also benefitted society through the development of human resources in science and engineering.  We have incorporated a significant number of undergraduates, especially women and underrepresented minorities in our research projects and on our publications.  Of the 40 students that contributed to the project during the previous funding period, 43 % were female, 38% were underrepresented minorities.\nDuring the previous funding period we have published various peer-reviewed publications contributed chapters to books, was highlighted on National Public Radio (NPR), in the New York Times, Forbes Magazine, Chemical and Engineering News, Chemistry and Industry, Chemistry World and presented at numerous conferences and institutions.  We have only begun to understand how this process works and how it is different from conventional solution-based methods. Although, we have made some progress along the pathway to understanding the rules of mechanochemical reactions, there are many more rules that need to be uncovered.  What is made very clear by our previous work is that our knowledge of solution-based chemistry cannot simply be transposed to mechanochemical reactions.  These reactions can behave very differently than solution-based reactions and we need to be able to understand it to the same extent if we are to use it in the development of new organic reactions.\n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/20/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James Mack Ii"
