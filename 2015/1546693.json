 "awd_abstract_narration": "Artificial tactile skins play a critical role in 'sense of touch' for upper limb prosthetics. In general, the prostheses in upper limb amputees lack in holding an object correctly due to insufficient sensing information. This dearth of control causes amputees to often drop grasped objects since it is hard to recognize precisely how the object is grasped. Recent surveys show that amputees desire automatic control of grasping objects to assist prevention of slip. However, the control of detection and prevention of grasped objects from slipping is a challenge, which is a major pain point in the prosthetic hands. Most of current commercial upper-limb prosthetics are not smart, that is they lack sensory components, although they are quite expensive. The suggested artificial tactile sensors will have a huge market impact as they will provide more ergonomic and aesthetic hands with higher functionality. This will allow amputees greater physical and psychological satisfaction. The lower cost of the sensors will reduce the price of prosthetic hands and more individuals with upper limb loss will be able overcome the associated trauma, resume gainful employment and lead a more fulfilling social life.\r\n\r\nA stretchable multi-layer tactile sensor is suggested with a new developed pressure/temperature-sensitive polymer composite and hybrid 3D printing process. The suggested sensor can detect not only normal and shear forces, but temperature of objects. This sensor has been developed by 3D printing of a skin-like rubber material, bottom stretchable electrodes, pressure/temperature-sensitive polymer composite, top stretchable electrodes and skin material. Since the suggested sensors can be fully customized in size and shape using 3D printing, they can fit to desired prosthetic hands. This sensor can provide the amputee with enough sensing information for the high-functionality manipulation of the upper limb prosthetics. Intellectual merits include advancement of 3D printing technologies for artificial tactile sensors and application of the suggested sensors to 'smart' upper limb prosthetics.",

Intellectual merits from the project include advancement of scalable manufacturing technologies for artificial tactile sensors and application of the suggested sensors to smart insoles.

Broader Impacts include that this sensor technology can be further used for robotics, prosthetics, and wearable electronics, where the sensor can provide various information such as pressure/force/slip/temperature detection.  For example, most upper-limb prosthetics are not smart, that is they lack sensory components, although they are quite expensive.

This project started with a customer segment of amputees having their prosthetics, which potentially require artificial skin (tactile sensors).  However, we found a couple of limitations for the sensor technology to be used in prosthetics.

Secondly, many of amputees still use a mechanical-type prosthetics (like harness-based prosthetics), which resulted in the target market size shrunk.  We pivoted this customer segment to runners, and finally discovered two customer segments mentioned above.  We developed a tiny circuit to collect sensing data while we had interviewed.  The integrated sensor and circuit has been tested at Malone University with coaches and athletes and it is believed that the sensor prototype can tell runners? form and coaches can effectively train runners based on the collected data.
