TAGS 2015 will take place on April 10 - 12, at Texas A&M University, in College Station, TX. TAGS provides an opportunity for local researchers to meet and interact, as well as to learn the latest advances in Algebraic Geometry, interpreted in its broadest sense. There will be a Special Lecture aimed at graduate students. In addition, young researchers (graduate students and postdoctoral associates) will have the opportunity to present their work in a Poster Session. More information about this meeting is available at: http://www.math.tamu.edu/~laura/TAGS2015/\r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry is the study of solutions to systems of polynomial equations in (usually) many variables.  Such questions are of central importance to mathematics and its applications such as coding theory, cryptography, and the study of various natural phenomena.  This grant will fund a conference in this area, where investigators from Texas and the neighboring states may learn the newest developments in this field from distinguished invited speakers. This conference is also an important opportunity for local researchers, especially graduate students and postdocs, to meet and interact, gaining exposure for their work and potentially establishing new collaborations.",
