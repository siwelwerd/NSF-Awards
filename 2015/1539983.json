 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide Student Travel Fellowships to support U.S. based students traveling to the 14th International Semantic Web Conference (ISWC 2015). The conference, which will be held in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania from October 11-15, 2015, is the premier major international forum for state-of-the-art research on all aspects of the Semantic Web - the next generation World Wide Web. Student Fellowships help cover the travel costs for US students, making it possible for them to attend the conference. This funding will allow students to meet key members of the Semantic Web research community, it will give them the opportunity to disseminate their work, and it will provide a venue for them to interact with future national and international scientific collaborators.\r\n\r\nThe International Semantic Web Conference, which is now in its fourteenth year, is an interdisciplinary conference that includes work on: Data Management, Natural Language Processing, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Ontologies and Ontology Languages, Semantic Web Engineering, Linked Data, User Interfaces and Applications. It regularly has several hundred attendees. In addition to the main technical tracks, the conference includes a variety of events that provide opportunities for deeper interaction amongst researchers at different institutions, at different stages of their research careers, and researchers who are interested in many different aspects of Semantic Web Research. Students may benefit from the Doctoral Consortium - a full day event where students can get critical, but encouraging, feedback on their work from senior members of the community. They can also benefit from the career mentoring lunch, where experienced members of the community from both academia and industry answer questions in an informal setting.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web site at: http://iswc2015.semanticweb.org",
