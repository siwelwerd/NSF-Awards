 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create and study a new model for mentoring of women associate professors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  A diverse network of Patriot League Institutions will be involved: Lehigh University, Georgetown University, Bucknell University, Lafayette College, and the United States Military Academy.  These small to mid-sized universities represent a range of missions, Carnegie classifications, geographies, and organizational structures.  This project will address gaps in mentor structures and practices by establishing Faculty Success Fellowships for two cohorts of eligible associate professor women in STEM across the network.  The program includes a peer-mentoring component that includes faculty from across the network of institutions to expand the faculty peer network.  Expected outcomes include: improved perceptions of mentoring and support; improved measures of career satisfaction and progress; enhanced mentoring skills; and campus leaders with understanding about how to align promotion expectations with requirements.\r\n\r\nThis project is specifically designed to address the many reasons that STEM women faculty remain at associate professor rank longer than men, 1 to 3 years, or 24.2% more, before promotion to full professor (Bilimoira, 2011; MLA 2009; Buch, 2011).  Some of the reasons are tied to inequitable mentoring at the associate faculty level (Buch, 2011).  The intervention is adapted from Lehigh's ADVANCE program, strengthened with information from previous ADVANCE programs, and uniquely refined to each institution's context by local implementation teams.  The Fellowships permit faculty to design and implement a mentored resourced plan of action leading to early success.  The vertical mentoring structure will be reinforced with a peer-to-peer mentoring component to minimize isolation, foster accountability, increase their support networking, provide outside perspectives, and encourage future collaborations.  Administrative leadership (Deans and Department Chairs, as appropriate) is essential to success; the proposal supports their inclusion through ongoing communication.  The iterative evaluation provides insight into existing and evolving attitudes about mentoring, facilitates knowledge about implementation process, and will improve trainings.  The findings will create and advance knowledge about the design and implementation of mentoring programs for mid-career success of women faculty in STEM.  This project will strengthen our understanding of how best to support associate professor faculty to full professor, where most higher education leaders emerge.  \r\n\r\nThe NSF ADVANCE Partnerships for Learning and Adaptation Networks (PLAN) program track supports projects that promote the adaptation and implementation of previously effective ADVANCE programs in new contexts and the testing of innovative strategies to promote the participation, success, and advancement of women in STEM academic careers.  PLAN projects also contribute to the knowledge base on gender equity in STEM academic careers.",
