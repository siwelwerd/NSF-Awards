 "awd_abstract_narration": "During adolescence, individuals begin to make increasingly independent decisions that involve weighing the potential risks and benefits of their actions. Although the decisions adolescents and adults make are similar in many situations, there are certain contexts that lead to more risky decisions by adolescents. This is the case in social contexts: adolescents (but not adults) tend to make riskier choices in the presence of peers. Although peers' influence on adolescent risk-taking is documented in real-world crime statistics, health statistics, and in controlled laboratory experiments, just how peers uniquely influence adolescents remains poorly understood. The overarching goals of this research are threefold: a) to refine understanding of adolescent risky behavior by demonstrating what aspects of decisions are vulnerable to peer influence, b) to identify how the developing brain contributes to peer influence on adolescent risk taking, and c) to evaluate how laboratory measures of peer influence relate to actual risky behavior in daily life.\r\n\r\nTo carry out this work, dyads of adolescents and dyads of young adults will complete a series of decision making-tasks designed to quantify components of risky choices. For instance, mathematical decomposition analyses can isolate how much risk an individual is willing to tolerate in order to obtain a potential reward. Participants complete these tasks in experimental configurations that vary in their degree of social evaluation. Peers are either absent, present and monitoring the participant's level of riskiness, or present but unable to monitor the participant's level of riskiness. These peer configurations build on recent findings by Leah Somerville and others showing that the mere presence of a peer may be sufficient to evoke riskier choices in adolescents. Comparisons of risky choices in these three contexts will disentangle the sources of peer influence that depend on the peer awareness of risky choices, compared to sources of peer influence that are evoked merely by the presence of a peer. In addition, confidential surveys will measure risk-taking in everyday life. They will be used to bridge the laboratory and the real world through analyses that ask what characteristics of the dyads, and what characteristics of individual's riskiness relate to their laboratory-based choices. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to measure how the still-developing brain uniquely processes information about social evaluation, and how these processes interact with decision-making processes. This project stands to build foundational knowledge about how neurodevelopment during adolescence shapes the development of complex social behavior. More broadly, this work can be extended to help predict the particular 'ingredients' of a situation that lead adolescents to take unhealthy risks. Further, this project generates key data to address legal-ethical issues of youth culpability for crimes committed with peers.",

Using approaches including behavioral decision making research, brain imaging, and meta-analytic techniques, we have demonstrated that the peer context does not simply escalate risk taking. Rather, the way peers influence adolescent decision making emerge from multiple sources and underlying motivations. We conducted a series of behavioral experiments that involved testing dyads of same-aged friend pairs ranging in age from late childhood to adolescence and manipulating how an individual's becomes involved in a risky choice as mere observer, as someone whose own gains or losses are part of the choice, and/or as someone offering advice on what choice they would make. These studies revealed that compared to adults, adolescents are more susceptible to peer influence when peers are actively watching the choices being made, whereas merely having a peer in the same room is not sufficient to elevate risky choice behaviors (Somerville et al., 2018). This rules out the most fundamental peer influence mechanisms proposed (e.g., spread of arousal) and points instead to the motivation for adolescents to have their peers actively witness their risky choices. Further, we demonstrated that adolescents were more likely than adults to take a risk that is costly to themselves if it benefited their peers (Powers et al., 2018). Finally, using fMRI brain imaging during a decision making task pointed to the key involvement of the brai's canonical valuation system (ventral striatum) integrating its signal with areas of the brain key to social cognition (MPFC) while weighing whether or not to follow a peer's advice about risk taking (Braams et al., 2018; 2021). These findings, taken together, point to the notion that peer influence is not a monolith. Rather, different ways in which peers intersect with adolescent decisions impose distinct effects, only some of which escalate adolescent risky behavior. We observed a similar pattern of findings in a meta-analysis of all studies undertaken by the field comparing adolescent risky decision making that is and is not under peer observation (Powers, Schaefer, et al., revision under review). We found that the effect of observation was not universal across studies. Rather, it depended chiefly on when peers were actively encouraging risk. Taken together, these findings point to an adolescent desire to express their risk preferences to their peers and their willingness to incorporate their peer's desires into their own choices. Findings from this line of research may have important legal and ethical implications. Most adolescent crime is committed in the active presence of peers or jointly with peers. Through discussions and events hosted by the Center for Law, Brain, and Behavior, judicial education events hosted by AAAS, and the American Psychological Association Juvenile Death Penalty Task Force, the PI has been educating legal experts and working to responsibly translate these findings into public spheres.
