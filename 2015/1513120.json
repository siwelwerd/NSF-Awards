 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project builds a comprehensive research infrastructure to meet the needs of a large research team at the Ohio State University allowing experimental research in a number of computer science areas including high performance computing, data analytics, storage, and virtualization. The project will lead to significant advances in many computer science areas, and its impact will be enhanced through active dissemination of software from the investigators. The project will contribute substantially to human resource development, education in computer science increasing diversity in related areas.  \r\n\r\nMore specifically, researchers will acquire and deploy an infrastructure that includes three types of accelerators, conventional as well as energy-efficient nodes, large main memory including Solid State Drive (SSD) on a subset of nodes, and hardware for fine-grained power measurements. The requested resources will allow experimentation with a number of popular or emerging cluster configurations that address needs of a variety of compute-intensive and/or data-intensive workloads.  Such an internally hosted and reconfigurable cluster will also allow power measurements, voltage margin reduction experiments, and failure detection and recovery studies in the presence of physical failures - none of which is typically feasible at national supercomputing and cloud infrastructures. The infrastructure is motivated by the multiple paradigm shifts that high performance computing is presently undergoing. They include increasing use of accelerators or coprocessors, increased criticality of energy and resilience beyond performance, synergy with data analytic applications, and popularity of massive main memory or SSD technologies. These trends provide opportunities and challenges for a variety of scientific, medical, and enterprise applications to be explored in this project.",
