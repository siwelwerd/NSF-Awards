 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Jon A. Tunge of the University of Kansas to develop strategies to access reactive intermediates from common carbon-carbon bonds and utilize those reactive intermediates to address challenges in synthesis. The broader impacts of the work include developing environmentally friendly catalytic synthesis.  Outreach programs include providing organic chemistry flash cards on Instagram and recruiting underrepresented students through a visitation weekend.  The visitation weekend educates prospective students on ongoing chemistry at the University of Kansas and trains the students on best practices for applying to graduate schools.\r\n\r\nOne research focus is on catalytically accessing reactive nucleophiles and organometallics from inexpensive carboxylic acids via decarboxylation.  Current methods typically access related reactive intermediates through formation of stoichiometric organometallics under highly basic conditions or using high energy reduced metals.  The decarboxylative couplings developed are more environmentally benign than classic methods and are more applicable in synthesis due to the mild reaction conditions.  Professor Tunge is also developing deacylative couplings that directly employ ketones in cross-coupling reactions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe funding of Catalytic Synthesis via C-C Cleavage has first, and foremost, led to the development of new reaction chemistries that allow chemists to make useful molecules without creating hazardous waste.  This outcome is achieved by strategically utilizing the energy that is inherent in all organic molecules to drive chemical transformations.  For example, the release of the small molecule CO2 from carboxylic acids provides a large driving force for the formation of reactive intermediates, without the need for high-energy chemicals and reagents.  Such a strategy obviates the formation of hazardous waste and makes reaction chemistry safer. \n\nThe loss of CO2 from carboxylic acids drives the coupling of stabilized organic anionic intermediates or organometallics; this is termed decarboxylative coupling.  However, unstabilized intermediates cannot be formed becasue CO2 loss does not provide enough energy to compensate for the high energy of the intermediate.  This led to another significant outcome of the research: Coupling solar energy with the loss of CO2 provides enough energy to form very reactive intermediates, and does so without creating more waste.  The key finding is that a photoredox catalyst, such as a dye molecule that can absorb visible light, can be coupled with a transition metal catalyst.  The photoredox catalyst can harness energy from light, then transmit that energy to a metal catalyst, allowing transformations that are impossible otherwise.  The Tunge group used this strategy to transform readily available carboxylic acids such as amino acids into value-added chemicals by allylation.  \n\nCoupling of molecules with the allyl functional group is particularly useful in developing decarboxylative coupling chemistry.  However, use of only that functionality greatly limits the applicability of the methods discovered.  Thus, another significan outcome of the research is the broadening of the reaction scope by incorporating many other functionalities for couplings.  These include aromatics, through challenging benzylation reactions.  Moreover, new strategies were invented to allow the transformation of propargyl alcohols into either dienes or propargylated alkanes.  A properly chosen catalyst then allows one to make myriad products from the strategies developed during the tenure of this funding.  \n\nFinally, significant effort lead to the formation of a University-wide program for the recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups.  While this program is in its infancy, building on this foundation is expected to broadly impact STEM fields, including Chemistry at the University of Kansas.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jon A Tunge"
