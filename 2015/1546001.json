Unlike past discussions within political science, this workshop includes both political scientists engaged in experimental research and experts in the ethics of human-subjects research. Invited speakers and discussants will address in both panel and round table form the following issue areas: (1) special issues in consent and deceptive research; (2) managing incidental findings and collateral and community harms; (3) working with community and industry partners to conduct responsible research; (4) enhancing community capacity for review and consent in internationally sponsored research; (5) identifying descriptive and normative baselines when assessing risk, harm, and exploitation; (6) quantifying psychological harms; and (7) special concerns when using pre-existing data sets.",
