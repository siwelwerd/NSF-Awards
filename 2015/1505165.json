 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this EAGER proposal, the investigator proposes to conduct exploratory research into threshold concepts in graduate student learning of biology.  These are concepts that are hypothesized to be transformative and critical in the progression of a student as primarily a learner to a producer of knowledge.  The investigator and students will attempt to identify the skills and competencies that are needed for students to succeed in their doctoral education and the extent to which these might represent affirmation of the threshold concept hypothesis.  \r\n\r\nThe researchers will interview graduate students and faculty as identified through a number of professional societies in biology.  Focus groups will also be conducted.  The study represents among the first studies of graduate learning and cognition in STEM fields.  The research is therefore exploratory and high risk.  \r\n\r\nIf successful, this research could have longer-term transformative effects on graduate education.  Identifying core competencies of how student learning and skills development succeeds in biology could be used in improving the way in which graduate students are taught and enhancing the productivity of learning.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThe purpose of the NSF-funded project, EAGER: Proposal to Examine Potential Threshold Concepts Specific to the Biological Sciences, was to examine the descriptions that doctoral students in the biological sciences provided regarding their perceptions of critical concepts for research in their discipline that were the most important and the most difficult to learn.  These \"threshold concepts\" represent key transition points in students\u00c6 learning as they progress toward the ability to conduct research independently and earn their Ph.D. degrees.\n\n \nThrough our interviews and focus groups with doctoral students and faculty members, we found four potential threshold concepts: critical but balanced reading of primary literature, the design of experiments with disciplinarily appropriate controls, asking meaningful and accomplishable research questions, and testable hypotheses. These outcomes are consistent with previous findings, but they provide much greater detail related to the structure of these concepts in general and the ways in which they manifest specifically in biology.\n\n \nAlthough there were a variety of paths toward the first threshold concept of balanced critique, students largely began with the approach or misperception that the foundational knowledge base in biology is infallible and is meant to be memorized and added to.

This push for simplicity in design also appears to happen with the need to interpret results. Flaws or excessive complexity in experimental design and/or the use of improper controls leads to results which are difficult to interpret. This need to clearly state what was found and why requires a more in depth understanding of the relationships between design elements in experiments, as opposed to just seeing results as a property of the experiment.\n\n \nThe third potential threshold concept posited in this study focuses on the ability of students to ask research questions. Whereas students begin their work largely learning how to carry out studies within their labs and answer research questions of advisors it is not until later in their program that students begin to ask their own research questions. Asking a research question requires that students coordinate two previously learned threshold concepts: primary literature, and experimental design. A research question must be both meaningful which requires an understanding of where the edge of knowledge is in the field and what questions are therefore meaningful to ask, as well as an understanding of what is achievable, which requires an understanding of the technical aspects of experimental design and the scope of an accomplishable experiment. \n\n \nFinally, the fourth potential threshold concept is the creation of hypotheses. These are the creat..."
