 "awd_abstract_narration": "In engineering design, a popular representation taught in mechanical design curricula is \"functional modeling.\"  Function has been defined as what a device or system is intended to do or the intentional transformation from inputs to outputs.  The function is not what the product is (form), how the product does what it does (behavior), or why the product exists (purpose).  However, it does relate to all of these, and thus allows engineers to transition between the problem space and the solution space.  Many design tools have been developed based on functional modeling but are not yet ubiquitously found throughout industry.  Rather than suggesting new function vocabularies, tools, or methods, this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project seeks to understand how engineers think about function by studying their behaviors in creating models.  To do this, the modeling behaviors of design engineers will be recorded, and models of cognition will be used to explain these behaviors.  With this understanding, new computational design tools can be developed in the future.  In addition, engineering design education can be enhanced by providing students with better strategies for creating the function models.\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand how engineers think, reason, and operate on function modeling elements and how these models bridge problem definition and solution exploration.  Through experimental protocol studies, the specific modeling patterns (forward chaining, backward chaining, nucleation) and pause patterns (pause before or after elemental instantiation) will be analyzed.  The modeling patterns will provide evidence of goal-oriented thinking (backward chaining) or causal reasoning (forward chaining).  The pause patterns and frequencies will be used to understand relative importance of function (action of transformation) and flow (things being transformed).  Two basic research questions will be explored:  Are there modeling behavior patterns to function modeling that are invariant of chosen representation? And can these modeling behavior patterns be used to understand, predict, and explain cognitive models of design activities?",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn engineering design, a popular representation taught in mechanical design curriculum is \"functional modeling\".  Function has been defined as (1) what a device or system is intended to do and (2) the intentional transformation from inputs to outputs.  The function is not what the product is (form), how the product does what it does (behavior), or why the product exists (purpose).  However, it does relate to all of these.  Thus, function representations allows engineers to transition between the problem space and the solution space.  Many design tools have been developed based on functional modeling, but are not yet ubiquitously found throughout industry.  Rather than proposing new function vocabularies, tools, or methods, we seek to understand how engineers think about function by studying their behaviors in creating models.  To do this, the modeling behaviors of design engineers were recorded.  Models of cognition are used to explain these behaviors.  \n\nIt is important to understand (1) how engineers think, reason, and operate on function modeling elements and (2) how these models bridge problem definition and solution exploration.  Through experimental protocol studies, the specific modeling patterns (forward chaining, backward chaining, nucleation) and pause patterns (pause before or after elemental instantiation) are studied.  The modeling patterns provide evidence of goal-oriented thinking (backward chaining) and causal reasoning (forward chaining).  The pause patterns and frequencies are used to understand relative importance of function (action of transformation) and flow (things being transformed).  Two basic research questions have been explored:  Are there modeling behavior patterns to function modeling that are invariant of chosen representation? and Can these modeling behavior patterns be used to understand, predict, explain cognitive models of design activities?\n\n \n\nOver two hundred students participated in various aspects of this research through either modeling activities studied through video recorded sessions or through in class learning activities.  The studies have been reported through conference presentations and are being prepared for journal submissions.  Some key findings include the fact that richer, more detailed models result when students start with goal oriented models (partially completed models starting with the outputs of the system) than those resulting from forward chaining based partially completed models.  We have also observed that students pause more frequently and with greater duration just before adding flows or naming the flows.  This suggests that there is more though associated with the flows rather than the functions.  Finally, we have seen that there appears to be a limit on the number of items that are added to a model between pauses.  This limit suggests that the students think in terms of \"chunks\".  These chunks are seen with individual modelers.  Group modeling activities do not seem to have the same \"chunk\" size limits.  These three observations have helped us to start to answer the questions above and to formulate new research questions.\n\nFinally, the findings of this research are being integrated into the classes on engineering design as part of the mechanical engineering program at Clemson University.  As these intervention strategies mature, we fully expect to share these approaches with others through workshops and through conference/journal dissemination.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joshua D Summers"
