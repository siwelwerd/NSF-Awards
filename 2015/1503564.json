 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microscopic fungi (microfungi) represent a diverse assemblage that is distributed worldwide and includes bread molds, plant pathogens, powdery mildews, rusts, slime molds, and water molds. A large percentage of these organisms are harmless or even beneficial, but some cause disease and death in animals, plants, and other fungi resulting in major economic loss and serious negative implications for human and ecosystem health. Despite their importance, little is known about their distribution, diversity, ecology, or host associations. This project is a collaborative effort involving 38 institutions in 31 states and aims to consolidate data from specimens housed in biodiversity collections for 2.3 million microfungi specimens and make these data available through online resources. The consolidation and increased accessibility of these data is critical to inform and promote new and innovative research, education and community engagement around this little-known but important group of organisms.\r\n\r\nSpecimen data generated by this project will be used to assess natural and human-induced environmental changes on microfungi distributions, and evaluate the impact of these changes on the function and health of ecosystems. This project fills a critical gap in the national digitization effort by contributing images, digitizing specimen label data, and linking associated ancillary data for over 1.2 million North American specimens of microfungi. Additionally, nomenclature and taxonomic information will be updated to reflect the newest practices as dictated by the International Codes for Nomenclature. These data will provide a foundation for making informed decisions by agribusinesses, educators, forest managers, government agencies, horticulturalists, policy makers, researchers, and the general public. The broader education goals of this project will be facilitated through the development and implementation of a teaching module for high school biology on the economic importance of microfungi. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).",

Scientists at academic institutions, government agencies and museums often collaborate to develop and deliver outreach programs in K-12 educational settings with the goal of improving science education and broadening participation in science. Educational outreach activities allow for a link between learners and access to online digital biological collection information and it is important to recognize that both audiences have information to share with each other. Biological collections personnel and scientists also serve as sources of expert knowledge while bringing novel concepts and field-specific insights to K-12 learners. Educators and K-12 learners help outreach professionals recognize the needs of real-world learners and foster communication of science with those outside their field of study. In this project, a five-day workshop for Georgia pre-service, middle and high school biology/environmental science teachers was offered from July 14-18, 2017 at the University of Georgia, Athens Main Campus in conjunction with the Mycological Society of America annual scientific meeting. The workshop provided teachers with an opportunity for informal science inquiry through participating in field and laboratory activities, interacting with fungal biologists and attending scientific sessions. The workshop also provided the teachers with an increased understanding of the 1) relative importance of digital and physical biological collections, 2) function and role of fungi in ecosystems and society, and 2) potential use of fungi to illustrate key scientific concepts central to chemistry, cellular biology, ecology, evolution, and genetics for developing inquiry-based and experiential learning assignments and activities in science curricula. The workshop was based on the idea that teachers have limited time to discuss fungi as isolated taxonomic units in their curriculum and culminated with the teachers developing a fungal-based lesson plan to illustrate key fundamental concepts in core scientific disciplines that aligned with next generation educational standards.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/18/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Marc&nbsp;A&nbsp;Cubeta</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1503564/1503564_10364743_1526910974919_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1503564/1503564_10364743_1526910974919_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Athens Teachers Workshop 2017\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1503564/1503564_10364743_1526910974919_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Athens Teachers Workshop 2017\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Athens Teachers Workshop 2017</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrw Loyd</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marc&nbsp;A&nbsp;Cubeta</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Athens Teachers Workshop 2017</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
