This workshop seeks to engage the community of herbarium curators and learn from the experiences of other collection types to increase the speed and efficiency of digitization. The activities proposed targets curators and managers across a wide spectrum of institutions distributed across eighteen states.\r\n\r\nThis award supports participant costs for a workshop for herbarium managers and curators with the goal to consolidate and standardize best practices across the digitization process. The workshop would bring together experts from across the U.S. in sessions hosted by the digitization HUB (iDigBio) and the Southeast Regional Network of Expertise and Collections (SERNEC) to evaluate and publish community-wide standards for all stages of the digitization process. The proposed activities will standardize best practices across the community, increasing the speed and efficiency of digitization resulting in a reduction in the cost of specimen digitization, a major goal of the NSF's biological collections programs (CSBR and ADBC). These efforts will positively impact the quantity and quality of digitized data made available to the research community, government agencies, students, educators, and the general public.\r\n\r\n",

By providing open access to these products, we made it easy for anyone to use, share, update or modify the documents for their own specific use and then reload them onto the repository for others to use in the future. These outcomes will provide a valuable resource for the scientific community and will, in time, increase the efficiency by which these data become available to researchers and other state holders who need it most. The overall impact will be to speed the process of specimen image capture and label digitization, as well as quality control/quality assurance capabilities, for large numbers of herbarium collections nationally and globally.
