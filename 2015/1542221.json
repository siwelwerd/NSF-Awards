The scientific program of talks and poster sessions, combined with the small size of the meeting, will encourage informal discussion and networking and will catalyze stimulating interactions and sharing of the most exciting research in the field of epigenetics. Concerted efforts to include and broaden participation by early-career scientists will diversify engagement by young researchers, some of whom will become the next generation of leaders in the field.\r\n\r\nThe Epigenetics Gordon Research Seminar, which precedes the Conference, is entitled \"Mechanisms of Mitotic and Meiotic Epigenetic Inheritance\" and has been organized by two graduate students. It will feature a keynote address from a leader in the field, talks selected from the abstracts, and a panel discussion centered on careers in science. The Epigenetics Gordon Research Conference is entitled \"Epigenetic Dynamics: Roles in Development, Inheritance and Responses to the Environment.\" Co-organized by two leading researchers in the field, the program features talks and poster sessions addressing a range of topics, including: RNA-dependent modes of epigenetic regulation, new epigenetic phenomena, epigenetic control of development and dosage, epigenetic control of genome integrity, epigenetics and nuclear organization, dynamics and inheritance of epigenetics states, and targeted epigenetic modifications.",
