 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural animals display awe-inspiring adaptability and robustness (e.g. three-legged dogs that can still run and catch frisbees). One reason neuroscientists believe animals are so capable is because their brains are structurally organized in that they exhibit neural regularity, modularity, and hierarchy. This project will test whether those neural properties also improve the robustness, adaptability, and overall intelligence of evolved computational agents, specifically robots.  Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) evolve, rather than engineer, computational agents to produce qualities seen in nature, such as robustness and adaptability. While EAs often outperform human engineers, the robot bodies and brains they design pale in comparison to those of natural animals. Recent advances by the PI (Professor Clune) and others enable the evolution of neural networks (computational brains) that exhibit regularity, modularity, and hierarchy.\r\n\r\nProfessor Clune and his students will test whether regularity, modularity, and hierarchy, separately and in combination, improve (1) robustness to noise (2) robustness to damage (3) adaptability to new environments (4) learning, and (5) overall intelligence, measured as the ability to solve challenges of varying complexities. Based on his previous work and preliminary results, Clune anticipates that neural regularity, modularity, and hierarchy could increase all of these desirable behavioral qualities. Such knowledge will accelerate humanity's ability to deploy effective, autonomous robots, which will provide tremendous benefits to society (e.g. search and rescue, putting out fires, and elderly care).   The research is woven into a tightly integrated educational plan that generates broader impacts via a robotics club in Laramie, a research-oriented course in evolutionary robotics, public education via videos and the press, and broadening participation in graduate training.",

The science for this project went very well and resulted in numerous publications, including many high-impact, highly cited publications in top scientific journals and conferences. Specifically, we investigated how modularity, regularity, and hierarchy in neural networks improve the intelligence and complexity of reinforcement learning agents (e.g. simulated robots). We have also studied how modularity helps solve a grand-challenge in AI research: solving catastrophic forgetting (CF). We have further invented a new form of data-driven plasticity, called diffusion-based neuromodulation, which completely solves CF in simple networks on simple problems, and have investigated its interaction with neural modularity. That work led directly to A Neuromodulated Meta-Learning Algorithm (ANML), which produced state-of-the-art results for continual learning in deep neural networks (aka deep learning). We have also invented a new algorithm called Curiosity Search, and in two papers show that it encourages exploration in RL agents, including when hybridized with deep reinforcement learning. That work led to the publication of a paper in Nature called First Return, Then Explore (introducing the Go-Explore Algorithm), which dramatically advanced the state of the art in deep reinforcement learning for hard-exploration problems. We have additionally published journal papers on hybridizing indirect and direct encodings (allowing a principled combination of neural regularities and exceptions), how evolution learns to generalize to adapt to new environments, the surprising creativity of evolution, how to generate multi-modal robot controllers, and many more subjects.
