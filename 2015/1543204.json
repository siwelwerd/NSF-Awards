 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Evaluation of a Model Spatial Thinking Curriculum for Building Computational Skills in Elementary Grades K-5 project advances objectives of the STEM+Computing Partnership (STEM+C) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the integration of Computational Thinking and computation into STEM teaching and learning. The project will address a significant challenge in preparing elementary-aged children to enter the STEM workforce in coming decades: developing visuospatial and computational skills that underlie success in gatekeeping high school and college STEM courses. Visuospatial skills, those related to visual perception of the spatial relationships of objects, have been documented to vary by gender and may be influenced by socioeconomic factors. By developing instructional and assessment strategies that are effective across socioeconomic categories and work particularly well for subcategories of students who have been found to lag behind in visuospatial abilities at key grade levels, this project will apply educational justice theory to help children achieve equal access to quality instruction, resources, and other educational opportunities.\r\n \r\nThe goal of the Evaluation of a Model Spatial Thinking Curriculum for Building Computational Skills in Elementary Grades K-5 project is to iteratively develop and evaluate supplemental instructional activities that build early computational skills in elementary-aged children. The project will accomplish this goal by improving childrens' innate capacities for spatial thinking. Iterative development of the curriculum over a two-year period will be complemented with a comparison group study of spatial and Computational Thinking development and achievement. Formative evaluation conclusions from the curriculum development process and research findings from the comparison group study will be used to refine the activities into a format that can be integrated into formal instruction at a partnering school district, disseminated and evaluated nationally, and built into in-service and pre-service teacher education programs beginning with the program at the University of Redlands in California. An e-book containing the curriculum will be made freely available.",

The goals of the project were to (1) document relationships among spatial thinking abilities, computational thinking skills, and mathematical performance in K-5 children; (2) evaluate the effectiveness of hands-on activities designed to build spatial thinking abilities in K-5 students; and (3) evaluate the impact of spatial thinking training on computational thinking ability and mathematical performance. Pilot testing of educational interventions and assessments took place at Lugonia Elementary School in Redlands, California, and Inland Leaders Charter School (ILCS) in Yucaipa, California during Spring, 2016. A comparison-group study was conducted during the 2016-17 school year at ILCS. Two treatment classrooms in each K-5 grade at ILCS implemented spatial thinking activities for approximately 30 minutes each week during a school year. Two control classrooms in each grade did not do the designated activities. The spatial activities included creating designs with manipulatives, mapping classrooms and schoolyards, using a map to find treasures, and providing directions with coordinate systems. At the beginning and end of the school year, all students completed spatial and mathematics assessments. A spatial-computational thinking assessment was also piloted with K-2 students. Several statistical models were calculated to see if time, group (treatment vs. control), grade (centered at the middle grade if applicable), gender, and socioeconomic status predicted students&rsquo; scores on spatial thinking, computational thinking, and mathematics assessments. The project evaluators also acquired qualitative data through focus groups with the teachers. Information sought from teachers included feedback on spatial thinking activities, spatial thinking assessments, and computational thinking assessments, and the teachers&rsquo; perceived outcomes for spatial, computational, and mathematics abilities. The researchers found that (1) the spatial thinking interventions were well received by teachers and students, particularly in the K-2 grades; (2) the activities were very helpful in building academic confidence and problem-solving persistence in lower performing students; (3) spatial abilities were moderately to highly correlated with computational thinking abilities and mathematical performance; (4) girls and students on free and reduced cost lunch programs (a measure of socioeconomic status) performed lower on most assessments than other students; (5) lower socioeconomic status was a consistent predictor of lower performance on spatial, computational, and mathematics assessments; and (6) of all the extra-curricular activities surveyed by the project, use of building toys was the only one highly associated with spatial ability. The project directors concluded that (1) embodied spatial activities with embedded spatial language can build spatial thinking skills; (2) targeting individual students who need help with spatial skills may be more effective that targeting demographic categories of students; (3) assessments are needed that better measure targeted components of spatial thinking skills and computational abilities being developed by K-5 children in their play and academic activities; (4) helping parents, teachers, and other caregivers to engage in supportive, joint spatial problem-solving with children may be effective in building spatial skills in young children; and (5) assessments are needed that better measure targeted components of spatial thinking skills and computational abilities being developed by K-5 children in their play and academic activities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>Spatial skills have been found to underlie success in later gatekeeping science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses and are predictive of entry into STEM careers. These results confirm that spatial thinking ability is an educational justice issue that needs to be addressed in efforts to enhance the diversity of young people who choose to pursue STEM careers. The results also confirm that socioeconomic status remains a thorny issue in child development. Deficits in spatial ability begin early in a child's life and are related to the environment in which they are raised. Thus, spatial training interventions should begin very early in a child's life. Coupled with assessments that measure a young child's spatial abilities, the interventions should include training parents, early childhood education teachers, and other caregivers to (1) teach spatial language to children; (2) gesture to convey spatial knowledge; (3) use spatial language when engaging children in play with building toys and shape toys; and (4) introduce tasks such as mental paper folding, penetrative thinking, object manipulation and rotation, drawing, origami, and 3-D pop-up design into educational and play activities.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
