 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research seeks to identify what faculty in engineering and related STEM fields do that causes students to feel more supported.  The literature tells us that students who feel more supported by faculty and interact more with them engage more, feel better, and do better academically. Yet, we lack an understanding of the impacts of faculty behaviors that is detailed enough to give faculty and other instructors specific strategies for success to apply to diverse students in a range of settings and classes.\r\n\r\nWithout this knowledge, faculty attempts to support students can be diluted or fail altogether. This project's goal is to take the randomness out of the equation so that faculty can effectively help and strongly support students. This project adopts both quantitative and qualitative data collected in both course-level case studies and longitudinal research designs over short (quarter-long) time scales. A wide range of instruments including surveys, interviews, faculty/TA reports, and observations will be used. The overall goal is to capture a rich picture of particular courses with the goal of understanding how students become highly engaged or when they do not engage, what appears to limit or hold back their engagement.",

Instructors in engineering and many related physical science majors in college continue to offer a large portion of their teaching via lecture (as opposed to more student-centered teaching approaches).   While lecture is predisposed to less student engagement, understanding what TAs and faculty can do even while relying heavily on lecture can make a difference in how well and how often students engage and in turn, how well they perform and how long they persist in these challenging fields of study.   \n\nNot surprisingly, our study showed that what TAs do and what regular faculty do in lecture sessions and other learning environments (quiz sections, recitations, office hours, and laboratories) is related to how students engage in different ways.  Students view faculty as the authoritative masters of their engineering courses and expect what the faculty member offers to be very well organized, delivered in a way that connects to the student's experience, transparent, and fair.   In contrast, students are more forgiving of TAs and expect the TA to be more of a companion or peer in the journey toward learning.   Students expect that TAs will come alongside of them and persist with them, asking questions and navigating difficulty until they understand a concept, complete a problem or project successfully, or otherwise achieve a learning outcome for a course.   Particularly in larger classes of more than 40 students, student engagement is more strongly linked to TA behaviors than faculty behaviors.   Given that TAs have far fewer professional development opportunities and experience than regular faculty, this study has highlighted the need to not only train more TAs but to do so in specific techniques that are likely to be successful in the subjects and in the learning environments in which the TA will teach.  Broad, generalized instruction on teaching is unlikely to benefit the TA as much as more discipline specific training that emphasizes both how to speak well and engagingly through lecture but also how to develop relationship, rapport, and trust with students.   \n\nFurther, different students respond to the behaviors and teaching patterns of faculty and TAs in different ways.
