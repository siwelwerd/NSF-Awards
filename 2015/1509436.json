 "awd_abstract_narration": "The detection of thousands of exoplanets over the past two decades has provided a Copernican-like shift in our view of the solar system. We now know that most stars in our galaxy form with planets. We also know that low mass planets are more common than the gas giant planets that were first detected in 1995. However, the measurement of planet masses for true Earth analogs (similar in mass and orbiting in the habitable zone) is not possible with current instruments.  This proposal addresses a key requirement for improving precision by developing a precise, accurate, and stable wavelength calibration system for measurements of radial velocities with a new generation of ultra-stable spectrographs.  This project will provide training opportunities for students and early-career scientists and help maintain US competitiveness in an area of science that captures the public imagination.\r\n\r\nThe tunable Fabry-P\u00e9rot (FP) comb is designed for stability at the level of 1 cm/s, and the narrow lines can be used to calibrate out some of the instrumental uncertainties. The emission comb spectrum is produced by filtering a bright broadband laser-driven light source with the FP interferometer. The location of the comb peaks is determined by the spacing of the FP cavity. To prevent position drifts, the comb will be locked to a hyperfine laser transition with a precision that exceeds 1 part in ten billion. To prevent changes in the free spectral range or dispersion of the comb, the instrument will be placed in a temperature-controlled vacuum enclosure, and the comb line dispersion will be monitored for any required corrections with a second stabilized laser.  The goal is to reach better than 10 cm/s stability in the wavelength calibration of modern stabilized spectrometers.",
