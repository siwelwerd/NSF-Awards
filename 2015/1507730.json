 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical: These awards supported by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Massachusetts Amherst (lead) and University of Maryland College Park (non-lead) of these collaborative proposals are to study the interaction of cells with their physical environment that is a key part of different conditions such as inflammation, wound healing, cancer metastasis, etc.  Study of this interaction will improve our understanding of basic cell biology and potentially lead to new disease interventions or improved implants.  The goal of this project is to examine the interaction between macrophage cells and polymeric materials having tunable mechanical properties.  The investigators will fabricate and characterize the polymeric materials, and subsequently measure cellular respones at the single-cell level.   The investigators are also involved in the educational training and outreach components of the project: (1) graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in cutting-edge materials science and bioengineering techniques and they will be trained in communication skills; (2) the development of educational videos targeting middle school students on the scientific concepts underlying this award, to be called \"Kitchen Sink Science\".  These videos will feature experimental demonstrations and illustrations.  \r\n\r\nTechnical: The objectives of this project are to examine the behavior of macrophage cells in contact with tunable viscoelastic substrates.  Macrophages are a key component of the immune system. An improved understanding of their interaction with materials will ultimately lead to better implants, sensors, and drug delivery devices. At the same time, these investigations will shed light on basic cell processes such as inflammation and the foreign body response. The investigators hypothesize that materials with time-dependent mechanical properties will give new perspectives into the relationship between material properties and cell behavior.  To that end, this research will use self-assembly methods to fabricate a series of polymer films covering a range of viscoelastic properties. The films will be characterized by several techniques such as fluorescence and microrheology. The behavior of macrophages will subsequently be examined at the single-cell level, with attention being focused on structural intracellular proteins (e.g., actin) and secreted cytokines (e.g., IL-4). As part of this proposal, our educational and outreach efforts will include: (1) the training of graduate and undergraduate students in materials science and bioengineering techniques, the design and execution of scientific experiments, and in technical writing and oral communication skills; (2) the creation of videos illustrating many of the concepts underpinning this proposal: hydrophobicity, surface tension, amphiphile spreading, and interfacial films, targeted at middle school students.",
