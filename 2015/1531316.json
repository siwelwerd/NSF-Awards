 "awd_abstract_narration": "1531316\r\nWildenschild\r\n\r\nThis Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) Program grant supports a two year project to develop a customized high resolution X-ray computed tomography (CT) imaging system with capabilities including helical scanning, region-of-interest imaging, and time resolved dynamic (4D) imaging.  The developed instrument would offer the first time in an academic lab, the capability for sub-micron resolution, high fidelity computed X-ray tomographic imaging of the interiors of geologic media, outside of capabilities only now available at National Synchrotron Light Sources where beam time is extremely limited and highly competitive to gain even limited (multi-day) access.  The project will involve collaboration with colleagues in the Applied Math Department at Australian National University in Canberra, Australia. The X-ray CT instrument will be managed as a shared-use laboratory, and housed in the School of Chemical, Biological and Environmental Engineering at Oregon State University.  \r\n\r\nThe instrument will be employed for research and research training in studies requiring non-destructive high resolution (micron to sub-micron scale) imaging of the interiors of natural materials and the flow of fluids through porous media including studies of eruptive mechanisms of volcanoes based on observation of the fine-scale vesicular structure of basaltic lavas, studies of soil mechanics to improve mitigation strategies against landslides, liquefaction, and hydraulic collapse of soils, and studies of the fundamental behavior of fluid (including multi-phase fluids) flow in porous media to support environmental remediation efforts, geologic sequestration of CO2, geothermal energy extraction, and groundwater remediation and management.  The PIs intend to develop X-ray CT image visualization modules for outreach efforts at Oregon State?s Hatfield Marine Science Center in Newport, Oregon.  Studies of the behavior of fluids in the subsurface have important implications of the management of groundwater resources, remediation efforts and in characterizing subsurface hydrocarbon reservoirs.  As such this grant is congruent with NSFs mission of advancing the national welfare.",
