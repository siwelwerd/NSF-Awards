 "awd_abstract_narration": "A research program is to be held at the Centre de Recerca Matematica (CRM) in Barcelona, Spain in the Spring semester of 2015. The focus will be on the intersection between representation theory, algebraic topology, and commutative algebra. There is a long tradition of interaction between commutative algebra and algebraic topology, and commutative algebra and representation theory. Techniques and concepts that arose and were developed in one field have driven developments in the other. Regrettably, opportunities for building and fostering collaborations, especially among graduate students and  younger researchers, from the three subjects (or indeed any two of them) have been all too rare, especially in the U.S. The three subjects have witnessed remarkable changes and developments in the last decade, and the CRM program comes at an opportune moment. This NSF award will fund the travel of younger researchers (graduate students, recent PhDs, and junior faculty) at U.S. institutions to participate in some of the key events of the program. This will provide them with a unique opportunity to learn about current research in these fields and the interactions between fields; discuss ideas with one another, and begin collaborations on future research.\r\n\r\nThe topics to be covered by the CRM program, and in particular the advanced courses and workshops: matrix factorizations, maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules; cluster algebras and cluster categories; cohomological theory of support varieties; and tilting theory, to name a few, are at the intersection of several important and rapidly developing areas of mathematics, each subject benefitting from advances in the others. The CRM program will bring together leading researchers in each of these subjects, and one can be optimistic that this will lead to the new insights and developments in them. The highlights of the program include two, week-long, advanced courses, one in February 2015, titled (Re)emerging methods in Commutative Algebra and Representation Theory, and another in April 2015, titled Building bridges between Algebra and Topology. Each will be followed by a week-long workshop. Additionally, a conference is scheduled for  25--29th May, 2015.",
