Globally, flooding impacts over 96 million people per year, most within developing countries, at a mean cost of over $13.7 billion.  In the United States, floods cause an average of 89 fatalities and $8.2 billion in damages each year. In Taiwan, flooding has led to nearly 1,000 fatalities and over $12.8 billion (NT) in damages since 2000. These numbers are expected to grow due to climate change, population growth, and increased vulnerability and exposure to extreme weather events. Through an internationally integrated and interdisciplinary approach, the US-Taiwan PIRE will investigate and improve \"end-to-end\" weather and climate prediction models, enhance the education of young US and Taiwanese scientists and future leaders, and bolster international and cultural exchange among students, scientists, and practitioners with the overarching goal of strengthening emergency response solutions and society's resiliency to extreme weather phenomena that threaten life and property.\r\n\r\nThe US-Taiwan PIRE- led by the University at Albany, State University of New York (US), National Central University (Taiwan), Howard University (US), National Taiwan University (Taiwan) and Academia Sinica (Taiwan) - will strive to address the following challenges: (1) better quantify trends in weather extremes on a regional scale (particularly in East Asia and the northeastern United States) through in-depth investigations of past extreme events and influences from large-scale global circulation patterns and changes in local environmental conditions; (2) examine new techniques for providing probabilistic numerical weather guidance on a regional scale; and (3) investigate the efficacy of decision-making by emergency managers informed with and without probabilistic weather forecasts and community impact information during extreme weather events. Further the US-Taiwan PIRE will prepare a cadre of US-Taiwanese atmospheric and social scientists and practitioners with disciplinary and interdisciplinary academic and research experiences geared around extreme weather and resiliency. Specifically, the PIRE will: (1) train the next generation of scientists and experts with crosscutting knowledge, skills, and understanding of regional climate and weather prediction, risk decision-making, and response during extreme weather events; (2) foster a culture of interdisciplinary research, training, and education to advance a greater understanding of resiliency and response solutions in addressing extreme weather; (3) institutionalize the US-Taiwan PIRE's internationally integrated academic, research, and experiential learning programs; and (4) advance the globalization of US and Taiwanese undergraduate and graduate students by building cross-cultural literacy into the PIRE's study abroad experience and broadening the participation of underrepresented groups through inter-institutional academic programming involving PIRE universities and practitioner partners.",

The objectives of the US-Taiwan PIRE on Extreme Weather and Decision-Making of the US-Taiwan were to:  1) Better quantify weather extreme trends on a regional scale using climate diagnostics and improved models to complete in-depth studies of synoptic control of the extreme events and relationship with regional environmental conditions; 2) Examine robust ensemble techniques for providing probabilistic numerical weather guidance on a regional scale; 3) Investigate decision-making and emergency manager responses with probabilistic weather and impacts information of extreme weather events.\n\nOutcomes by Research Thrust Area\n\nClimate \n\nThe climate diagnostic group examined extreme precipitation increases that span decades over in the Northeast U.S. fall and Taiwan Mei-Yu season, and classified them by weather type.  In the Northeast U.S., it was demonstrated that increased frequency of precipitation extremes were attributable to increases in tropical cyclone (TC) frequency in the mid-Atlantic region, along with a shift in atmospheric river (AR) positioning associated with storm tracks.  In Taiwan, precipitation increases were associated with four intense Mei-Yu rainfall events over the period.  A climatology was constructed of all 1979-2019 fall precipitation in the Northeast U.S. using TC- and AR-related weather types, station by station and repeated for Taiwan.  The research was conducted with two students and led to 5 publications.\n\nUnderstanding Predictability of Extreme Precipitation Events\n\nThis research had two integrated components focused on understanding and characterizing uncertainty of precipitation forecasts by regional scale weather models. \n\nThe ensemble group applied a stochastic technique to understand the impact of physical processes on the predictability of the forecast including the atmospheric boundary later, cloud microphysics, and radiation.  One study showed that thermodynamic perturbations of boundary layer processes in heavy rainfall scenarios made thermodynamic processes more influential on rainfall than dynamical processes.  \n\nThe predictability research included an in-depth study of the importance of ice microphysical and aerosol processes on precipitation forecasts.  The ice microphysical work primarily focused on precipitation from lake effects but also on heavy rainfall over New York.  Using various techniques (e.g, adaptive ice habit model and ensemble and stochastic approaches) the group elucidated the sensitivity of precipitation to microphysics and the complexities among the processes, showing relative significance of depositional growth on lake-effect cases relative to heavy rain cases.    \n\nThe aerosol group investigated the impacts of dust aerosols on summertime convective clouds and precipitation over the mountainous region in Taiwan, indicating that long-range of even low concentration of mineral dust can affect convection and precipitation.\n\nThe research was conducted by 5 students leading to more than 5 publications.  \n\nEffect of Risk Perception for Decision-making in Conveying Weather Threats to Public Tasks\n\nThe decision research investigated factors that influenced perception and decision-making as it relates hazardous weather information by emergency managers.   Decision theory was used to investigate internal factors on the decision-making of emergency managers during both real and simulated case studies.  The results showed a tolerance for uncertainty by EMs and also that cultural differences were a factor.   The research involved one graduate student and several undergraduates leading to 2 publications.  \n\nEvaluation Research\n\nThe evaluation component of the project integrated project evaluation with evaluation research.   Two social science graduate students were trained, and published this research.\n\nThe evaluation found the following outcomes of the PIRE research: \n\nGraduate students of the PIRE project proved to be important in linking across disciplines and subdisciplines. \nThe team identified the importance of university internationalization strategies incorporating faculty-driven research initiatives that naturally cross borders, demonstrating an alternative model that expanded the international efforts of UAlbany through incorporating education abroad and a joint degree program into a faculty-led research program. \nCross-cultural understanding of research predicated on different academic cultures and norms was a significant feature of PIRE. U.S. and Taiwanese researchers had different motivations and incentives for participating, and it took longer than expected to bring everyone together.\nGoals to institutionalize international and interdisciplinary collaboration saw some success, with interdisciplinary teams building on new and existing relationships to form ongoing partnerships and co-authored publications. \nIdentity development of students in their growth as scholars and global citizens was tracked. PIRE spanned the entire Ph.D. careers of several students and their emerging confidence as peer leaders and colleagues was notable.\n\n\nEducation and Broadening Participation Outcomes\n\nPIRE supported 14 graduate students across two institutions and 4 disciplines. At least seventeen US undergraduate and thirty-three Taiwanese undergraduate students participated in summer emersion and exchange programs.   Almost all students have graduated.   Dual degree graduate and undergraduate agreements were established between UAlbany and NTU and NCU.\n\nMetrics for broadening participation were significant. \n\n~30% of US undergrad participants Black/Hispanic and ~76% were women\n~20% of US grad students Black/Hispanic and ~70% women\n~30.5% of graduate students are social scientists\n\n\nAdditional information can be found in:\n\nhttps://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/103/5/BAMS-D-21-0057.1.xml?tab_body=pdf\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/23/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Everette D Joseph"
