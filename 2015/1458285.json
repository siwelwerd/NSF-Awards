 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to support the insect collections at the Illinois Natural History Survey (INHS). The project will secure type specimens at INHS, the standard bearers for species, and address further needs for accessioning and digitizing nearly 60,000 vials of donated specimens.  Type specimens are expected to be available to scientists in perpetuity, because if they are damaged, identity of species could be lost. Most ethanol preserved insect types at INHS are nearing 100 years old and to mitigate further degradation of these specimens, they will be placed in refrigerated storage with new vials.  The specimens will also be further documented through imaging.  These specimens provide knowledge of past distributions of species, enhancing our ability to predict both past and future distributions environments change.  Expectations for data gathering, description of new species, data analysis, and data sharing are rapidly changing.  This award will provide support for training the next generation of biodiversity scientists and informaticians in specimen curation and management from field data collection to analysis of data in the laboratory. This work will ensure a future of qualified, well trained biologists.\r\n\r\nThe INHS Insect Collection (INHS-IC), one of the oldest entomological collections in North America, houses approximately 7.3 million insect specimens. Over 5,000 primary and secondary wet types exist at the INHS-IC.  The older type specimens are in danger of being damaged by desiccation and degradation due to leaching of biological molecules. These specimens will be secured by upgrading vials, imaging labels and specimens, and storing the types in refrigerated space.  A training component will be implemented during which a Master's student will use these collections to examine repeated distribution patterns of aquatic insects (chorotypes) in eastern North America, and summer interns will be trained in specimen curation and digitization, learn to code basic bioinformatics scripts, and present an exit seminar on a research topic.  A large number of University of Illinois undergraduates will be provided with opportunities to learn museum practice through specimen identification, curation, and digitization of specimens during the project. All label data will be captured using TaxonWorks, a new platform for managing a wide range of biodiversity data tasks, and shared via a local web portal, iDigBio, and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.",

The INHS is committed to accessioning high-quality donations from such institutions to preserve the specimens and associated information. This grant supported the accession of several donations of fluid-preserved insect specimens from the private collections of 5 prominent taxonomists and two small, orphaned institutional collections (Ohio Biological Survey and Southern Illinois University Carbondale). In total, these amounted to near 60,000 vials of insects. These collections consisted of insects of global coverage, those sensitive to water pollution, and spiders collected from isolated islands in the South Pacific.

We developed a workflow that industrialized the process of discarding of the old preservative as chemical waste, staged specimens and labels for imaging, and transferred specimens and labels to new storage consistent with current standards at the INHS. Our workflow used cafeteria trays to organize Petri dishes with specimens and labels, image the specimens and labels using a photographic jig, and transfer the specimens and labels into new vials (Figs. 1 &amp; 2). Transcription of 6000 specimen labels for water quality sensitive stoneflies was done by transcribing data from images to a spreadsheet. Iterative sorting allowed matching and full transcription of similar labels, while serial addition of country, state, and county information allowed for more sorting and further geographic description. Import into our insect collection database led to the addition of taxon names and georeferencing of locations. This process has a general application to work in digitizing wet collections and resulted in the publication of methods, the timing of each phase, and distributional data for thousands of specimens that had not been previously available (</span><a href=\"https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/30256/\"><span>https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/30256/</span></a><span>).</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Our workflow has improved since that publication due to developments in our inhouse TaxonWorks (TW) software that allows for automated transcription of label data from images into editable text windows.

The further development of TW in the realm of museum data digitization from images is one of the most valuable outcomes of our work, having general applicability to the digitization of fluid-preserved arthropod specimens within the context of a robust biodiversity informatic data management system. Using this workflow we have imaged, loaded into TW, and automatically transcribed another 55000 vials of material.
