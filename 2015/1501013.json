This conference is the thirty-ninth in a series that has evolved into one of the major venues internationally for the presentation of research developments in real analysis and related areas. \r\n\r\nThe scientific program for the 2015 Symposium covers a broad array of topics, ranging from regularity issues for partial differential equations to Morse-Sard-type results, from questions in geometric measure theory to topics in combinatorial and set theoretic analysis. The featured speakers are Marianna Csornyei (University of Chicago), Alexander Olevskii (University of Tel Aviv), and Miklos Laczkovich (Eotovos Lorand University). The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.  Proceedings of the Symposium will be made available on-line.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  http://www.stolaf.edu/analysis/",
