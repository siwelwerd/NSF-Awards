 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\nNontechnical:\r\nPhotovoltaic devices have the potential to provide an unlimited source of energy by converting solar light into electricity. Photovoltaic devices made with organic materials offer significant advantages compared to ones made with inorganic materials.  These advantages include low-cost, light-weight, flexibility, and compatibility with reel-to-reel high-volume processing.  However, widespread adoption of organic photovoltaic devices is limited by their relatively low power conversion efficiency, and the poor mechanical properties of the currently used indium-tin-oxide transparent electrode, especially for flexible devices.  The brittleness of indium-tin-oxide thin films may render them incompatible with low cost, reel-to-reel, high volume processing and manufacturing of flexible organic solar cells.  This EAGER project will investigate novel plasmonic nanostructured transparent electrodes as replacement for the currently used indium-tin-oxide transparent electrodes in organic solar cells.  The new plasmonic transparent electrodes will significantly enhance the photon absorption in the organic light-harvesting layer(s) and thus improve the power conversion efficiency of the organic-based solar cells.  The concept of taking advantage of the dual nature of the proposed plasmonic nanostructures is novel and transformative as it will enable the replacement of indium-tin-oxide with a material not only more superior as a transparent electrode but with an additional crucial function, which will boost the device power conversion efficiency and lead to large-scale manufacturing of low cost photovoltaic devices.   This project will contribute to building US competitiveness in the field of renewable energy sources. \r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\nThis project will investigate novel metallic nanostructures in which the decay length of surface plasmon resonances is of the same order of magnitude as the thickness of the organic light-harvesting layer(s).  These novel transparent electrodes have been shown via simulations to yield the highest reported enhancement in total photon absorption of the organic active light-harvesting layer(s) in an organic photovoltaic device.  Two different types (single- and double-sided) of plasmonic nanostructures will be investigated and, various geometries from each type will be studied and compared to prior simulation results.  An integrated experimental set-up will be used to prevent any air/moisture exposure of the silver electrode and of the organic materials during device processing and characterization. Two different lithographic techniques imprint and stencil will be pursued in order to realize the plasmonic nanostructured electrodes in organic photovoltaic devices.  This project will seek to measure experimentally the enhanced photon absorption and demonstrate that it can be translated into an increased short-circuit current density resulting in a significantly enhanced power conversion efficiency. Unravelling the physics and the mechanism(s) that result in such an enhancement, and identifying any bottlenecks that may interfere with them, will advance our knowledge and understanding of the interactions between plasmonic and organic nanostructures. This will enable the proposed plasmonic transparent electrodes to be implemented in other thin film optoelectronic devices, such as organic biosensors, thus opening the door for many other applications and enabling technologies.\r\nThe PI at Lehigh University has the track record in recruiting minorities and will continue to provide opportunities for underrepresented groups in the summer programs. The PI also plans to pursue NSF-REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) to foster undergraduate participation with an emphasis on minority student recruitment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis EAGER program addressed means to implement plasmonic nanostructured transparent electrodes which have been shown via simulations to yield significant enhancement in total photon absorption of the active light-harvesting layer(s) in an optimized organic photovoltaic (OPV) device structure.\n\nA process flow consisting of all fabrication steps performed either in vacuum or in an inert ambient was devised by this project.  A novel variable angle stencil deposition process was conceived to efficiently vary the geometry of the nanostructured transparent electrodes with a single stencil mask without the use of any wet processing steps which typically are used in other lithographic techniques and which may damage the organic or silver thin films.  The fabrication process resulted from this project could be used to form a silver (Ag) based thin film nanograting specifically one formed via the intersection of two district but perpendicular to each other 1D Ag nanograting electrodes.  A distinct advantage of this fabrication process is the minimization or even elimination of any damage to the organic or silver layers which ensures an optimum silver/organic layer interface.  The fabrication of such controlled nanostructured electrodes will enable the realization of organic photovoltaics (PVs) having higher efficiency and lower cost than conventional organic PVs that rely on indium thin oxide (ITO) as the transparent electrode.  Such advantages will be the direct result of the enhanced light trapping from the plasmonic nanostructures causing enhanced light absorption by the organic material and the replacement of indium tin oxide (ITO) with a material not only more superior as a transparent electrode but at a lower manufacturing cost.\n\nThe fabrication methods resulted from this project could be implemented on other thin films optoelectronic devices, such as organic/inorganic hybrid solar devices (e.g. Perovskites-based photovoltaics) as well as biosensors based on organic devices.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/22/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Miltiadis K Hatalis"
