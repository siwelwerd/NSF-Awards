 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical: This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Florida is to support postdoctoral scientists and junior faculty members to attend a conference titled \"20th American Conference on Crystal Growth and Epitaxy (ACCGE-20).\" This conference will be held along with \"17th U.S. Biennial Workshop on Organometallic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (OMVPE-17)\" and \"The Second 2D Electronic Materials Symposium\" at Big Sky, Montana from August 2 to 7, 2015. The aim of the organizers is to secure a multidisciplinary character of the meeting and cover different scholarly directions. Biomimetic and biomaterials research provides an exciting and broad platform for training both undergraduate and graduate students in the materials area. It is both visually appealing to those who are not yet experts, and deals with materials that everyone is familiar with, such as bones, teeth, sea shells, etc. The conference will be open for graduates and undergraduate students including broader participation of women and underrepresented minority groups. The format of the conference will provide various opportunities to students and junior scientists to attend state-of-art lectures of the top scientists and meet with them, present their results, participate in discussions and explore future networking and collaborations.\r\n\r\nTechnical: This five-day symposium has been designed to bring together researchers from a diverse set of fields to discuss crystallization in general, with a focus on biological and biomimetic materials. The planned sessions on biomineralization will include state of the art characterization techniques and computational simulations in advancing fundamental understanding of biocrystallization processes. Specific areas of interest include classical versus non-classical crystallization phenomena in the crystallization of biological materials and bio-inspired/biomimetic materials. Additional areas of interest include interactions at organic - inorganic interfaces, self-organizing systems, novel characterization methodologies, and multiscale modeling of crystallization within both natural and synthetic biomaterials.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant was for conference support to provide financial assistance to three young investigators to attend the ACCGE-20 conference (20th American Conference on Crystal Growth and Epitaxy), and to present invited talks in the symposium on: Biocrystallization Session:  Biological, Biomimetic, and Organic Crystallization.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThe objective of this symposium was to bring together researchers from a  diverse set of fields to discuss crystallization of a wide variety of  biological and biomimetic materials.  It has long been recognized that biologically formed minerals and hard tissues have extraordinary properties, and these result from the high level of control that is attained during the mineralization process.  This usually involves the use of self-assembled matrices and modulatory organic additives which directly the assembly into hierarchical structures spanning many length scales.  In recent years, there has been an explosive growth of knowledge and papers in this area due to the availability of advanced instrumentation and key discoveries which have shown that these systems are far more complex than once realized, and most often seem to follow non-classical crystallization behavior.  This has led to a revolution in the field, which often entails considerable controversy because the various observations and sets of data can often be interpreted in different ways.  For example, the solution phase from which the crystals form have been suggested to contain various precursor species (pre-nucleation clusters, liquid condensed phases, amorphous precursors, polymer-induced liquid-precursors, etc.), and the amorphous-to-crystalline transformation may proceed through a variety of pathways (pseudomorphic transformation, dissolution-recrystallization, oriented attachment, etc.), all of which can lead to unusual textures in the single-crystalline products (colloidal, granular, polymeric occlusions and single-crystalline composites, etc.).  The continuous array of various hypotheses is dizzying.  The best and most efficient approach to making further headway in this rapidly evolving field is through focused conference sessions, where researchers can meet in person to have in depth discussions and debates.  Small focused sessions are also highly valuable for networking, where this interdisciplinary topic benefits greatly from the varied expertise of researchers in this field, ranging from materials and chemical engineering, to biology, chemistry and physics.  This is particularly valuable with respect to some groups having access and/or training on the advanced instrumentation, which has been beneficial to this field thus far, but further advances are needed to better resolve many of the controversial issues.  This is true of the computational issues as well, which has been more limited with respect to bringing new contributions to this field, primarily because such studies have been traditionally based on classical crystallization theory.  This area should be markedly enhanced by increasing their interactions with the experimentalists who are now examining non-classical behavior.  \n\nBroad Impact:\n\nThis grant was valuable in providing financial support for three young investigators who have recently entered into this field, enabling them to attend and present at this conference.  This enhanced their knowledge in this rapidly evolving field, as well as present their own research, which provided new insights for discussion by other experts attending the session. There was also ample opportunity throughout the conference for them to interact on an individual basis with some of the world-renown experts in the field, gaining valuable feedback on their work, and potentially establishing future collaborations.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/14/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laurie B Gower"
