The project at Huston-Tillotson University (HT) seeks to implement inquiry-based courses and undergraduate research to improve and sustain STEM student engagement, training, and transition to STEM careers and graduate study. The curriculum will emphasize real-world research experiences, reconfigure course objectives to emphasize inquiry and problem-based learning, and challenge students to use the critical-thinking skills central to the practice of science. Project activities will advance STEM students' knowledge and understanding, enhancing the number and preparedness of the institution's STEM graduates. Thus, this project will have a societal impact on STEM representation from underserved groups.\r\n\r\nThe goal of Huston-Tillotson's \"Attaining and Sustaining STEM Excellence with Research Training\" (HT-ASSERT) program is to improve and sustain the retention, engagement, and scientific training of Natural Science students at HT by emphasizing undergraduate research.  The project will enhance undergraduate research through two linked project activities: 1) integrate the science curriculum to highlight inquiry and research, beginning with scientific skill building in introductory courses and culminating in a capstone independent student research project for every student; and 2) develop the material and intellectual infrastructure (lab spaces, faculty expertise, and research collaborations) needed to enact deep and lasting transformation of STEM education at HT. Project activities will integrate with existing STEM programs at HT, including HT's STEM education and campus academic enrichment programs. This project will involve collaborating faculty at the University of Texas at Austin.",
