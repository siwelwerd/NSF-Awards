 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1:\r\nDoane College, a small liberal arts college in Crete, Nebraska, will send at least nine undergraduate science students and three postdoctoral fellows to Germany to conduct nanotechnology research at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). Three students and a postdoctoral fellow will go each summer for the duration of three consecutive years. The work involves the development of a versatile nano-scaled detection tool that could provide a high societal impact. In Germany, Doane students will work in the labs of Dr. Michael Hirtz and Dr. Pavel Levkin, both well-known internationally for their expertise on nano-scale phenomena. The undergraduate students will receive extensive research training, as well as culture and language preparation at Doane College before their departure to Germany. While in Germany, the research team will be given an in-depth orientation to the country and the research setting at KIT from the project?s Principle Investigator and the international collaborators. Through the PI, the student team will also be linked with investigators at the Center for Nanohybrid Functional Materials at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln, Nebraska. The students, who are relatively isolated in the US heartland, greatly benefit from the exposure to a culture abroad, providing a new experience for them. The project provides increased student, post-doc fellow, and faculty understanding of the collaborative research process, as well as potentially motivating undergraduates to continue their studies and/or careers in science, technology, engineering and math. \r\n\r\nPart 2:\r\nThe research collaboration with the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) in Germany will advance a technology called DETECHIP (short for detection chip). This is a proven sensor technology based on differential responses of colorimetric and fluorometric sensing elements upon exposure to small molecules of interest, such as drugs of abuse, explosives, and pesticides. \r\n\r\nDETECHIP is evolving from a macroscale, liquid-phase-testing array utilizing a 96-well plate to a micro-scale, solid-phase array through the use of piezoelectric and inkjet printing. Seeking to further miniaturize and optimize DETECHIP, this work will incorporate Dip-Pen Nanolithography (DPN) that is available at KIT for micro-to-nanoscale array fabrication on novel polymeric surfaces. In collaboration with the KIT collaborators, the Doane investigators will incorporate the chemical sensors onto amphiphilic nanoporous (HEMA) polymeric surfaces that are produced at KIT.\r\n\r\nThe goal is the uniform fabrication and analysis of arrays for the detection of small molecules. Expected deliverables include: 1) a small micro-to-nanometer-scaled, polymer-supported DETECHIP array; 2) methodology for bench-top or portable analysis with the best imaging and/or read-out technology to be determined during this project period; and 3) reports documenting the efficacy, ease of use, and cost effectiveness of the resulting DETECHIP technology.\r\n\r\nThis international collaboration sets the stage for US post-docs and undergraduates to apply for German Humboldt, Fulbright, and DAAD-RISE fellowships, while German KIT students can participate in academic exchange programs with Doane College.",

The program advanced knowledge in nanolithography, nano-to micro-sized array fabrication, organic synthesis using click chemistry, and surface modifications for sensing and other biomedical research applications. Some of the major goals of the Doane IRES project included: (1) increasing nanotechnology expertise and collaborations at Doane University for students, post-docs, and faculty; (2) providing extensive training for students and post-docs in chemical and physical surface modification technology for biomedical applications, including new sensing principles using nanostructures combined with chemical or biochemical sensing elements; (3) establishing a solid understanding among all project participants of the collaborative research and mentoring processes; (4) increasing the number of STEM undergraduates that continue their studies and careers in STEM; (5) Increasing the number of underrepresented and underserved students involved in STEM undergraduate research; (6) disseminating collaborative research results at local and national conferences and in peer-reviewed publications; (7) and disseminating nanotechnology concepts to a broader non-scientific audience, such as in outreach publications that present research in an understandable and informative way. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The international collaboration team included three undergraduate researchers per year from Doane; one faculty member and one post-doctoral fellow from Doane; two faculty mentors at KIT; and graduate, post-doctoral, and technical staff at KIT. Before departure to Germany, the students &ndash; IRES Scholars &ndash; received extensive research training and culture and language preparation from mentors at Doane. In Germany, the Scholars received an in-depth orientation to Karlsruhe, Germany, Europe, the research setting at KIT, and the international collaborators. Scholars were expected to write detailed standard operation procedures for all experiments, write daily journal entries summarizing the results of the current workday, and write the objectives for the following workday. At the conclusion of the summer at KIT, Scholars gave full presentations about their entire summer project. When the Scholars returned from Germany, they continued to conduct research at Doane and train other undergraduate students using the expertise acquired from KIT. The IRES Scholars acquired oral and written communication skills through presentations at KIT and Doane including weekly research seminars and at local and national meetings.</p>\n<p>An external evaluation partner evaluated the overall program and the experiences of the Scholars and mentors on an annual basis, both before and after the summer research experiences. This enabled continuous improvement of the project towards the major objectives and assessment of the overall program execution. Evaluation results showed the IRES program at Doane provided a positive and enriching experience for the Scholars in both research and international culture and established a successful base of collaboration for mentors. As a result of the annual evaluation, three major changes were made to improve the experience of Scholars. In year two, a more formal, flexible credit, preparation course was implemented. The course included an extensive study of German culture along with research skill enhancement. The role of the post-doctoral mentor also changed, first in traveling with the students for close guidance in year two and monitoring the students remotely in year three. In year three, the student interview process was improved to include a 30-minute presentation by the applicants demonstrating not only their previous research experience and interest in the KIT projects but also their communication skills. German language competency was initially a major challenge for Scholars and their overall confidence in their ability to live and conduct research at KIT. Sufficient language preparation to improve Scholar confidence is recommended but was not found to be crucial for success in an international research experience in Germany because English is the spoken language in most academic research settings there. Aspects of the program that were crucial to the success of Scholars included weekly meetings that provided frequent opportunities for mentor-scholar communication, one-on-one meetings with a post-doctoral and faculty mentor from Doane to improve research and communication skills, and the flexible credit preparatory course that covered research and cultural/language preparation.</p>\n<p>The NSF IRES program provided a unique experience for a small liberal arts institution in the Midwest and allowed underserved students from rural Nebraska and underrepresented minorities to gain competencies that they might not have had the opportunity to achieve otherwise. Of the nine total Scholars, five were female, four were under-represented minorities, and seven were from geographically underserved areas in Nebraska. In 2017 and 2018, the PI published 17 articles.
