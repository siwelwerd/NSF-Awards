 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) will be supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as a distributed, multi-user national facility that will provide the natural hazards research community with access to research infrastructure that will include earthquake and wind engineering experimental facilities, cyberinfrastructure, computational modeling and simulation tools, and research data, as well as education and community outreach activities.  NHERI will be comprised of separate awards for a Network Coordination Office, Cyberinfrastructure, Computational Modeling and Simulation Center, and Experimental Facilities, including a post-disaster, rapid response research facility. Awards made for NHERI will contribute to NSF's role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program.  NHERI continues NSF's emphasis on earthquake engineering research infrastructure previously supported under the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation as part of NEHRP, but now broadens that support to include wind engineering research infrastructure.  NHERI has the broad goal of supporting research that will improve the resilience and sustainability of civil infrastructure, such as buildings and other structures, underground structures, levees, and critical lifelines, against the natural hazards of earthquakes and windstorms, in order to minimize loss of life, damage, and economic loss. Information about NHERI resources will be available on the DesignSafe-ci.org web portal.         \r\n\r\nNHERI Experimental Facilities will provide access to their experimental resources, user services, and data management infrastructure for NSF-supported research and education awards. This award will support a NHERI Experimental Facility, located at the University of Texas at Austin, with large, mobile dynamic shakers and associated instrumentation for field experimentation. This equipment can be used to study and develop novel, in-situ testing methods that can be used to determine in-situ soil properties, evaluate the vulnerability of existing civil infrastructure, and optimize the design of future infrastructure.  These advances will result in communities that are more resilient to earthquakes and other natural hazards.  While there is a great deal to be learned from small- to large-scale laboratory testing, there remains the need to field test a wide variety of infrastructure, as constructed, in its current state.  The facility equipment will fulfill the need for in-situ testing and allow for transformative tools to be developed in critical areas such as three-dimensional (3D) subsurface imaging (with applications such as rapid levee evaluation and void/cavity detection) and non-destructive testing (with applications such as advanced soil liquefaction evaluation and soil-foundation-structure interaction studies for buildings and bridges).  Progress in these areas will lead the nation to the next frontier of resilient and sustainable infrastructure, which will benefit society at large and support continued economic, intellectual, and scientific growth.\r\n\r\nThis facility will enable researchers to address three main challenges to making in-situ testing advancements that, if accomplished, could transform the ability to rehabilitate and build more resilient and sustainable communities.  These three main challenges are: (1) significantly improving the accuracy and resolution of shallow-to-deep (greater than 1000 meters) two-dimensional (2D) and 3D subsurface imaging; (2) characterizing the nonlinear dynamic response and liquefaction resistance of complex geomaterials in-situ; and (3) developing rapid, in-situ methods for non-destructive structural evaluations and for soil-foundation-structure interaction studies.  While more heavily weighted toward addressing earthquake hazards, the ability to solve these challenges will also affect multi-hazard resiliency.  For example, the challenge of performing rapid 2D and 3D subsurface imaging will apply directly to prioritizing rehabilitation of the nation's existing levee systems, many of which are currently not resilient to traditional flooding, hurricane storm surges, or earthquakes.  The next frontier of natural hazards research ultimately demands that engineers develop practical solutions for complex problems, which will require testing of civil infrastructure systems over a wide range of actual field conditions.  This in-situ testing can be accomplished using the large, mobile dynamic shakers and associated instrumentation of this facility.  Furthermore, to develop more resilient and sustainable communities, it will be essential to engage and cultivate a diverse and talented group of future engineers who can address the challenges that face a rapidly growing population supported by aging infrastructure at risk to natural hazards. This facility will team with K-12 teachers to create age-appropriate, hazard-centered lesson modules that teach engineering concepts related to developing a more resilient and sustainable world.   This facility will conduct three user workshops in year one and annual workshops in subsequent years and will host Research Experiences for Undergraduate students.",

The equipment facility at the University of Texas at Austin, then named NEES@UTexas, was renamed NHERI@UTexas in 2016 under the NHERI program. NHERI@UTexas provides unique large, mobile dynamic shakers and associated instrumentation for in-situ testing of civil infrastructure. Innovative field testing methods employing the mobile shakers are used to evaluate behavior of existing infrastructure and to enhance the design of future infrastructure, which contribute to the development of more resilient communities. The equipment available at the NHERI@UTexas experimental facility includes: (1) five large, hydraulically-controlled shakers mounted on mobile platforms (i.e., trucks) that can provide wide-band dynamic excitation sources for geotechnical and structural systems (Image 1a to 1e), (2) a tractor-trailer necessary to transport the four largest shakers (Image 1f), (3) a field supply truck with resources for mobile shaker maintenance and refueling in the field, (4) an instrumentation van that houses data acquisition systems and power generators, (5) an air-conditioned instrumentation trailer that serves as a work space in the field, and (6) a wide array of field instrumentation, data acquisition systems, and various sensors for measuring vibrational motions and pore water pressures.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A key feature of the NEES program, and now the NHERI program, is the nationally distributed, shared-use facilities to support natural hazards engineering research. Experimental and computational resources provided by these shared use, NSF-supported facilities, as well as data collected from associated research projects, are made available to the broader research community. From 2000 to 2014, NEES@UTexas supported 29 shared-use projects and more than 25 non-shared-used projects. NHERI@UTexas has continued this shared-use practice since 2016. Between 2016 and 2020, NHERI@UTexas supported 11 shared-use projects and 14 non-shared-used projects. &nbsp;Shared-use projects are research projects funded by the NSF. Any NSF supported research projects can request use of the NHERI@UTexas facility.&nbsp; These research projects are typically led by researchers from other universities, and often involve developing new testing techniques for specific goals. Non-shared-use projects have not been supported by NSF and have typically been conducted by researchers at UT. Many of the field experimental studies that use the large-scale mobile shakers and associated field equipment at NHERI@UTexas are located outside of the state of Texas. Image 2 shows the test locations of NHERI@UTexas equipment since 2004.&nbsp; The reasons for these remote locations relative to Austin, TX are that the specific ground conditions in particular areas and/or the permanent structures at given locations are the focus of the investigation.</p>\n<p>The science plan of NHERI@UTexas is focused on three main challenges. These three main challenges are: (1) performing deeper, more accurate, higher resolution, 2D/3D subsurface geotechnical imaging, (2) characterizing the nonlinear dynamic response and liquefaction resistance of complex geomaterials in situ, and (3) developing rapid, in-situ methods for non-destructive structural evaluation and soil-foundation-structure interaction (SFSI) studies. These challenges are significant, yet the unique equipment resources of NHERI@UTexas can be used to help address them.</p>\n<p>As an example, 3D FWI imaging results that were obtained as part of an NSF project titled \"Geotechnical Site Characterization with 3-D Seismic Waveform Tomography\" are presented in Image 3 (Award Number 1850696, PI: K. Tran). Seismic surveys at the site were conducted by Prof. Tran and the NHERI@UTexas team using vertical vibration sensors on the ground surface. The seismic energy was created by the NHERI@UTexas Thumper shaker truck. The final 3D P-wave velocity (V<sub>p</sub>) and shear wave (V<sub>s</sub>) models are shown in Image 3. The velocity models indicate soft soil layers at shallow depths, underlain by a stiffer weathered limestone layer of variable depth. Two potential voids were identified in the images. The standard penetration test (SPT) blow count (N-values) that were collected from a borehole drilled to verify one of the voids are also shown.&nbsp; The N-values are the numbers of hammer blows needed to drive the sampler 0.3 m into the bottom of the borehole over a range in depths.&nbsp; The low N-values, shown in the image, confirmed that a void does exist in the depth range from about 3.5 to 6.5 m, as predicted by the in-situ testing.</p>\n<p>Another example is a project titled \"EAGER: Informing Infrastructure Decisions through Large-Amplitude Forced Vibration Testing\" (Award Number 1650170, PI: N. Gucunski).&nbsp; The researchers in this study showed that conventional approaches for structural identification using ambient vibrations do not provide sufficient excitation to investigate soil-foundation interactions or to overcome unintended composite action and stick-slip mechanisms in the structure. Thus, larger, controlled shaking levels, such as those provided by the NHERI@UTexas shakers, are needed for more robust field investigations of dynamic motions of large-scale structures. T-Rex shaker was employed to dynamically test a soil-foundation-structure system, in this case an overpass bridge in New Jersey (Image 4).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/30/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kenneth&nbsp;H&nbsp;Stokoe</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1520808/1520808_10401506_1619812845633_Photographsofmobileshakers--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1520808/1520808_10401506_1619812845633_Photographsofmobileshakers--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 1 Photographs of mobile shakers\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1520808/1520808_10401506_1619812845633_Photographsofmobileshakers--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 1 Photographs of mobile shakers\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photographs of mobile shakers and tractor-trailer rig: (a) High-force, three-axis shaker called T-Rex, (b) Low-frequency, called Liquidator, (c) Vertical shaker called Raptor, (d) Horizontal shaker called Rattler, (e) Urban shaker called Thumper, and (f) Tractor-trailer rig, called the Big Rig.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NHERI@UTexas</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kenneth&nbsp;H&nbsp;Stokoe</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 1 Photographs of mobile shakers</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1520808/1520808_10401506_1619813127816_Image2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1520808/1520808_10401506_1619813127816_Image2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1520808/1520808_10401506_1619813127816_Image2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Previous test locations of NHERI@UTexas field testing equipment since 2004 (from Google Earth).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NHERI@UTexas</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kenneth&nbsp;H&nbsp;Stokoe</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Image 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1520808/1520808_10401506_1619813298395_Image3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1520808/1520808_10401506_1619813298395_Image3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Image 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1520808/1520808_10401506_1619813298395_Image3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Image 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Identify underground voids with seismic waves.
