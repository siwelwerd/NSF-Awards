It addresses III-V and II-VI compound semiconductors as well as SiGe, SiC, and related alloys and has opened up to novel materials such as oxide semiconductors, organic semiconductors and aspects of heterogeneous integration, e.g. of compound semiconductors with Si-based technology. The ISCS series was started in 1966 under the name of \"International Symposium on GaAs and Related Compounds\" and the current name and co-location with IPRM reflects the broadening of the conference scope due to the wide variety of compound semiconductors vital for modern electronic and optoelectronic devices. This Symposium is expected to have attendance of approximately 300 including attendees from Americas, Europe and Asia. All types of research institutions (academia, government research institutes and industrial laboratories) will be represented. The support funds will be used towards conference proceedings, subsidizing registration fees for students and invited speakers. The timing of this workshop is perfect for this generation of students to learn how the new science and technology of semiconductors is developing. These lessons will be useful beyond semiconductor research, as these students will be able to apply them to any future new materials and technologies that they will encounter during their career.",
