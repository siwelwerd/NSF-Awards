 "awd_abstract_narration": "For the 2013-2014 school year, the U.S. Department of Education identified statewide shortages of Mathematics and Science teachers in Oklahoma, continuing the pattern of shortages in at least one of these disciplines that has recurred annually for the past two decades. This Noyce Scholarship program at Oral Roberts University, Math and Science Scholarships for Teaching (MASST), will produce 26 highly qualified secondary math or science teachers from STEM disciplines who commit to teaching in a secondary high-need school. The project will partner with two of the largest school districts in the state of Oklahoma, Tulsa Public Schools, and Broken Arrow Public Schools, as well as the Tulsa Dream Center (a non-profit community center). \r\n\r\nMASST Scholars will receive research-based, specialized training in high-need pedagogy that will be in practice throughout matriculation as the Scholars participate in multiple early experiences in high-need educational settings. The program will also support internships for 32 STEM students recruited from both ORU and Tulsa Community College (TCC) who will closely work with high-need students at the Tulsa Dream Center. A community of teacher learners will serve as a support system for the Scholars once they graduate from ORU, providing curriculum and pedagogical support for the new teachers during their induction years. The MASST Program proposes to advance knowledge and understanding within STEM education by applying Hollins' research methodology to the secondary areas of science and mathematics to determine if the specialized training in structured dialogue with contextualized practice in high-need schools increases the length of time that graduates teach in high-need schools. Scholars from underrepresented populations will be recruited from current ORU STEM majors and from students at TCC, thereby broadening participation of underrepresented groups.",

This specialized training was proven effective in research done with urban high-need students and used structured dialogue to address common problems within the high-need community focusing on the context of the high-need students around whom the problems arise (Hollins, 2012).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Several project outcomes accomplished the advancement of knowledge and understanding in STEM education. One ORU MASST Program outcome was to recruit Scholars from underrepresented populations, thereby broadening participation of underrepresented groups in STEM education. Among the ORU MASST Scholars, 77% were from underrepresented groups including those who identify as disabled, a minority, and/or female (some Scholars are represented in multiple groups).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A second ORU MASST Program outcome was to measure the participant?s confidence during their preparation and first years in the classroom. At the end of the ORU MASST Program, a final program evaluation including surveys and focus groups of MASST Scholars was conducted by an external evaluator for the purpose of gathering program data and measuring overall goals.&nbsp; From the respondents, 100% felt the ORU MASST Program helped with their confidence in their teaching knowledge, excitement about their careers, and ability to work towards career goals. Over 80% of the respondents reported the ORU MASST Program improved their confidence in teaching abilities and taking the steps necessary to reach career goals. Since a significant purpose of NSF Noyce programs is to increase the teacher base in STEM education, the MASST Program was gratified that 71% of respondents said the ORU MASST Program helped in their decision to pursue a career in teaching mathematics or science. These positive results support the potential for MASST Scholars to demonstrate resolve to remain in STEM education.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A third ORU MASST Program outcome was to measure the participant?s effectiveness in the classroom.&nbsp; Current MASST Scholars teaching in high-need schools were rated as effective or highly effective by their school administrator and/or mentor teacher. Online communities of teacher learners helped encourage, share ideas, and provide solutions for teachers in high need classrooms using structured dialogue.&nbsp; This specialized training enabled the MASST Scholars to be more effective in their teaching of high-need students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A fourth MASST Program outcome was to measure the rate of attrition among the MASST Scholars after the completion of the obligation years.&nbsp; MASST Scholars had opportunities to be mentored throughout program matriculation and beyond.&nbsp; From the focus groups, it appears that the majority of the students involved were already going into some STEM-related field, just not necessarily as a teacher. In the focus groups, one participant said, <em>?I have decided to teach science. I came into this without a goal, but teaching meets all of my professional needs in one job.? </em>Another agreed, <em>?I have never had teaching on my radar before the MASST opportunity came up. Joining the program gave me a whole career shift.&nbsp; </em>An additional survey, administered by the external evaluator, showed that 94% of the respondents felt that the MASST program helped them in overcoming obstacles related to teaching. When digging deeper into this through focus groups, multiple respondents expressed their gratitude for the involvement, care, and knowledge of the mentor teachers. Two Scholar comments were,<em> ?[The MASST Program] taught us how to build relationships in the professional setting so we could set up our support system ? that?s been really helpful.? </em>and, <em>?This program provided me with a lot of intentional adults in my life after graduating, compared to the regular education route.
