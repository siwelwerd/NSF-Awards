 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research to apply organ-on-a-chip technology to create a functioning placenta-on-a-chip to replicate the natural placenta. As a biometric model capable of transferring nutrients and waste between maternal and fetal bloodstreams, a placenta-on-a-chip will enable study of the structure and function of the placenta without the limitations of conventional models. A particular interest of this research is improved understanding of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder through testing for ethanol in the fetal bloodstream. Organ-on-a-chip systems are still a relatively new area of research, but it is important to expand the horizon with these systems. Being able to provide reliable in vitro drug testing and analysis targeted towards pregnant patients is an overwhelmingly important field of study. The research will be conducted under the mentorship of Professor Noo Li Jeon, a noted expert on microfluidics and organ-on-a-chip research, at Seoul National University in Korea. \r\n\r\nThe research involves creating microfluidic channels in PMMA chips, with a porous polymer membrane between them so that nutrient and waste exchange can occur. Syncytiotrophoblast cells will be cultivated on the side of the membrane facing the maternal bloodstream, while vascular endothelial cells will be cultivated on the side of the membrane facing the fetal bloodstream. Long-term sustainability tests will be done to verify that the system is stable when fluid flow is introduced. Additionally, tests will be done using varying levels of ethanol to test the toxicity reaction of the system. The cells representing the placental tissue are predicted to decrease in volume density as the concentration of ethanol increases. The ultimate goal will be a working placenta-on-a-chip capable of representing in vivo situations involving drug reactions occurring in the placenta. The chip will not only be a pioneer for integrating placental functions on a microfluidic chip, but will also prove to be a sophisticated model capable of producing results in non-ideal situations; specifically that of ethanol-induced toxicity within the maternal bloodstream. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.",
