 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds a series of conferences and workshops in game theory and applications of game theory.  The conference, follow-on workshops, and lectures are held each summer as a coordinated program designed to bring together a distinguished group of senior scientists from around the globe with junior faculty and graduate students from across the U.S.  Topics include new developments in game theory, areas in the intersection between game theory and computer science (such as Computation and Privacy), and applications of game theory to business and public policy.  The activities advance science by giving young scholars the opportunity to form new research collaborations and present their work to a distinguished audience.\r\n\r\nThe topics proposed for the next round of workshops include Auctions, Cooperative Game Theory, High Frequency Finance, Complex Systems and Networks, Equilibrium and Complexity, Algorithmic Mechanism Design, Correlated Equilibrium, Adaptive Learning, Stochastic Games, Computation and Privacy, Macroeconomic Applications of Game Theory, and Memory Complexity in Repeated Games.",
