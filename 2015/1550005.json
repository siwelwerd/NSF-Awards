 "awd_abstract_narration": "This team has developed a unique and portable instrument that is capable of studying chemical reactions between solids and gases. This equipment will be useful to a variety of industries that are looking to reduce air pollution from their processes, including: automotive, chemical, oil and stationary power. The portability of the equipment means that one can take the diagnostic to the source; there is no need to approximate conditions in the laboratory (which is what is usually done). This device will allow companies, that otherwise do not have the equipment or staff to make these measurements, to evaluate the efficacy of third party technologies with their proprietary or developmental devices. For example, Fiat Chrysler America (FCA) could test a third party automotive catalyst on exhaust from one of their developmental engines, to see if it will meet emissions requirements in-house, rather than sending both the highly proprietary developmental engine and catalyst out to be tested.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps team has developed a portable and versatile characterization microreactor for the fundamental, scientific study of both catalytic and non-catalytic heterogeneous reactions. It was designed such that fundamental catalytic activity and selectivity may be examined, providing key knowledge required to develop new materials and processes for catalysts. Additionally, due to the larger diameter sample tube and because the system is capable of measuring performance parameters such as surface area, temperature-dependent activity, and adsorption capacity, it can be used for coal and biomass pyrolysis experiments as well. A portable characterization reactor system could provide these types of functions: assessment of exhaust aftertreatment catalysts in the test cell of an automotive OEM; evaluation of new remediation technologies for the flow of processing stream that contains particulates; variations in waste treatment incineration to find the optimum catalyst for their ever changing fuels; and evaluate new technologies at intermediate steps in full-scale molecular epitaxial processes such as solar cell, circuit board production, etc. A two-pronged approach will be utilized to bring this technology into wide usage.",
