 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.  This exploratory research project will examine the relationship between teacher professional development associated with newly developed modules in urban ecology and the achievement and engagement of long-term English learners (LTEL). Participants in the project will include students in grades 4-8 in a large urban school district, elementary school teachers, middle school science teachers, and middle school teachers of English language arts.  Existing Urban Ecology learning modules will be enhanced to accommodate the needs of LTELs, and teachers will participate in professional development aimed at using the new materials to effectively integrate academic science discourse and literacy development for LTELs.\r\n\r\nThe project will develop two enhanced urban ecology modules (47 lessons) for English learners in grades 4-8; science language and literacy assessments for English language learners (ELLs); an ELL STEM career awareness inventory; an urban ecology for ELLs teacher knowledge scale, and an urban ecology for ELLs pedagogy observation protocol. The materials will be tested with a stratified random sample of students identified by achievement level (low, medium, and high) and linguistic background (mainstream, LTEL, and \"at risk\" of becoming LTEL).  A mixed-methods research design will be used to test the hypothesis that the quantity and quality of LTEL science language and literacy achievement will increase as a result of teacher participation in implementing the newly developed transdisciplinary framework for Urban Ecology for English Learners.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTitle: Project QUEST (Quality Urban Ecology Science Teaching) for Long Term English Learners (LTELs)\n\nProject QUEST (Quality Urban Ecology Science Teaching) for Long Term English Learners (LTELs) was implemented through a tripartite collaboration across two centers at Loyola Marymount University -- the Center for Equity for English Learners (CEEL) and the Center for Urban Resilience (CURes), and the Los Angeles Unified School District --Ellen Ochoa Learning Center (K-8).  This transdisciplinary effort resulted in the creation of Resources, Models and Tools to increase the quantity and quality of science instruction.  The primary goal of this project was to increase LTELs' science achievement and engagement in: (1) Urban Ecology, and (2) scientific disciplinary academic language skills to expand awareness of STEM-related careers. \n\nProject QUEST's impact is significant given that little or no research exists on STEM and this specific subpopulation of English Learners (LTELs).  This project focused on interdisciplinary teaching and learning for 4th- 8th grade LTELs to attain greater access and exposure to STEM and college and career readiness.  Additionally, QUEST generated new knowledge about improving LTELs STEM skills and achievement while documenting the development of their teachers' knowledge and skills in delivering high quality STEM education for this population. \n\nDEVELOPMENT OF RESOURCES, MODELS AND TOOLS OUTCOMES\n\nThe outcomes of this project include the development of RMTs (resources, models and tools). Two Urban Ecology for English Learner curriculum resources were developed.  These standards-based, upper elementary/middle school modules are designed to bolster English language and literacy, and science learning by providing access to rigorous STEM content.  They emphasize locally relevant field studies and are aligned with the QUEST Transdisciplinary Framework and multiple sets of standards: Next Generation Science (NGSS), Common Core English Language Arts (ELA), and California English Language Development (ELD).  Modules include 6 instructional units with over 22 lessons that develop inquiry-based integrated English language and science emphasizing expository/informational writing and oral language development.  Accompanying assessment tools for teachers and students include: a) Teacher Assessment Survey; b) Writing Rubric; c) Public Service Announcement (PSA) Rubric; d) EL STEM Career Awareness Inventory; e) QUEST Science Literacy for Urban Ecology Assessment; and f) Land-Use Project Rubric. Tools were piloted and examined for viability of content and use.\n\nTEACHER PROFESSIONAL LEARNING OUTCOMES\n\nQUEST engaged 14 educators and 1 site coordinator representing cross-disciplinary teams of grade 4-8 teachers of English Learners.  Professional learning included annual 3-day summer institutes and 3 to 4, three-hour follow-up sessions throughout the year.  Learning experiences involved simultaneous exploration of research-based science, language, literacy and inquiry-based content for ELs.  The project affirmed the efficacy of this integrated professional development model focused on STEM literacies for LTELs.  By the end of the project, almost all teachers assessed themselves as Intermediate-users, with one person in the Advanced-user Category. Teachers reported high levels of knowledge and skills in developing science content, language and literacy learning for ELs.  On a 5-point scale, their overall mean rating for use of practices was 4.1. In an extension year, six teachers emerged as leaders, developed resources, and led Urban Ecology field experiences at local wetlands.\n\nSTUDENT LANGUAGE AND ACADEMIC GROWTH OUTCOMES\n\nQUEST showed significant learning outcomes for students' career awareness and in English language development, writing and academic achievement.  In Year 1, 426 students in grades 4-7 participated in QUEST Module 1 instruction.  During the subsequent year, 288 students participated in QUEST Module 2. In an extension year, 120 students participated in several urban ecology field-inquiry sessions.\n\nOver the course of the project, a large number of students reclassified from EL status to fluent-English proficient (RFEP). A total of 103 students assessed at the beginning of the project as ELs had language classification records in Years 2 and 3. End-of-project results indicated that 73% (n=75) were reclassified as RFEP; 27% (n=28) remained ELs, with 46% (n=13) of these receiving special education services.\n\nEL students' progress on ELA state-level academic achievement assessments indicates that from pre to post-project, the number of students in the EL/RFEP group who scored at the \"Standard Not Met\" Performance Level decreased by 25%.  Those who scored at the \"Standard Nearly Met\" level increased by 21% and those who scored at the \"Standard Met/Exceeded\" Performance Levels increased by 4%.  Project writing assessments showed statistically significant differences in scores related to development of informational text structure, academic discourse, spelling/grammar, and metacognition/metalinguistic awareness.\n\nProject QUEST also contributed to systemic efforts to model, influence, and study how members of transdisciplinary communities engage in and benefit from the development and implementation of RMTs that have the potential to positively affect educational outcomes for ELs.  Project QUEST places science in the social context where the scientific tools of investigation methodology become a general life pattern for students to learn to see data as an empowering tool as they achieve legitimacy and access within their social milieu. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Magaly C Lavadenz"
