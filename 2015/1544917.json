 "awd_abstract_narration": "Additive Manufacturing holds the promise of revolutionizing manufacturing. One important trend is the emergence of cyber additive manufacturing communities for innovative design and fabrication. However, due to variations in materials and processes, design and computational algorithms currently have limited adaptability and scalability across different additive manufacturing systems. This award will establish the scientific foundation and engineering principles needed to achieve adaptability, extensibility, and system scalability in cyber-physical additive manufacturing systems, resulting in high efficiency and accuracy fabrication. The research will facilitate the evolution of existing isolated and loosely-connected additive manufacturing facilities into fully functioning cyber-physical additive manufacturing systems with increased capabilities. The application-based, smart interfacing infrastructure will complement existing cyber additive communities and enhance partnerships between academia, industry, and the general public. The research will contribute to the technology and engineering of Cyber-physical Systems and the economic competitiveness of US manufacturing. This interdisciplinary research will generate new curricular materials and help educate a new generation of cybermanufacturing workforce. \r\n\r\nThe research will establish smart and dynamic system calibration methods and algorithms through deep learning that will enable high-confidence and interoperable cyber-physical additive manufacturing systems. The dynamic calibration and re-calibration algorithms will provide a smart interfacing layer of infrastructure between design models and physical additive manufacturing systems. Specific research tasks include: (1) Establishing smart and fast calibration algorithms to make physical additive manufacturing machines adaptable to design models; (2) Deriving prescriptive compensation algorithms to achieve extensible design models; (3) Dynamic recalibration through deep learning for improved predictive modeling and compensation; and (4) Developing a smart calibration server and APP prototype test bed for scalable additive cyberinfrastructures.",

The ultimate goal is to enable high-confidence and interoperable cyber-physical additive manufacturing systems (CPAMS). A fundamental challenge in the calibration and recalibration of CPAMS is the specification of geometric quality models for the wide variety of products built in distributed AM systems. Resource constraints and heterogeneous production conditions typically result in limited data for individual products built under specific conditions. Constructing tailor-made quality models for individual products is impractical and cost-prohibitive. It is important to develop flexible and automated learning algorithms that take full advantage of small samples of different products and facilitate the specification of the function forms of deformation features across different build conditions in CPAMS. This research project establishes a set of calibration and recalibration methodologies to control the quality of AM built products in CPAMS. To overcome the model specification challenge for a wide variety of product shapes, geometric quality models along the build direction (out-of-plane deformation models) have been established by extending our modeling methodology developed for in-plane freeform shape deformation. Bayesian learning algorithms have been developed to improve model prediction with a small sample of disparate data. To maximize the utility of learned models and knowledge for individual AM processes, a novel engineering-informed transfer learning methodology has been established for model transfer among different AM processes in CPAMS. This greatly reduces the cost of building test products for machine learning. To calibrate CPAMS based on the predictive models, the project provides analytical algorithms for optimal compensation of three-dimensional shape deformation. The product design can therefore be adjusted or calibrated before production to minimize shape deformation. To reduce human-intervention in model specification for a large CPAMS, an automated machine learning methodology has been established to quickly generate shape deviation models for 2D shapes based on limited training samples without guidance on the model selection. The deviation models can be generated for both in-plane and out-of-plane deviation models. The methodologies have been reported in journal and conference publications. Two US patent has been published on prediction and control shape quality in AM. A prototype of cloud-based smart calibration server has been developed to demonstrate the software demo for the calibration and recalibration of CPAMS in an automated and accessible manner for general practitioners. It is at its first phase to demonstrate the capability and to accept users for initial trials. This project enhances research collaborations involving not only top domestic universities, but also international institutions in Italy, France, and Hong Kong. AM research workshops have been organized regularly to CPAMS research. Interdisciplinary training opportunities in Statistics, Industrial Engineering, and Mechantronics have been provided for PhD students. The research contributes to cyber-physical systems science and engineering by providing methods to integrate physical machines and computational design seamless for improved fabrication accuracy. It will also contribute to cybermanufacturing by providing quality engineering concepts and tools. The complexity of shape data and data disparity poses interesting problems for statistics and machine learning communities.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Qiang&nbsp;Huang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1544917/1544917_10390472_1604084555786_ML4AM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1544917/1544917_10390472_1604084555786_ML4AM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Smart Calibration\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1544917/1544917_10390472_1604084555786_ML4AM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Smart Calibration\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cloud-based Smart Calibration Serve for Accuracy Control in Cyber-Physical Additive Manufacturing Systems</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Q.
