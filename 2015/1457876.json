 "awd_abstract_narration": "Westminster College of Salt Lake City will implement a scholarship and support program for students majoring in Computer Science, Physics, and Mathematics (CSPM).  The program will support 18 students for a period of 4 years.  Applicant recruiting will be broad, but seek to encourage first-generation college students, female students, and students from racial and ethnic backgrounds that are traditionally underrepresented minorities in CSPM majors. The proportion of these students in CSPM is less than that at Westminster College as a whole. One substantial barrier to increasing these numbers is the financial burden of attending college and often a student's financial need is beyond their financial aid package offer. This scholarship program will ease that burden and increase the graduation rate in these majors that are vital for our nation's economic competitiveness.  \r\n\r\nThis project will fund a total of 18 students with two six-student cohorts beginning in their first year, as well as two cohorts of three students each beginning in their sophomore year. Scholars will be selected from the applicants to Westminster College who have indicated an interest in one of the CSPM fields, have financial need, have an ACT score of at least 24, and a high school GPA of at least 3.5. Applicants for awards as sophomores should have at least a 3.0 GPA in their first semester of college. The main support and cohort-building structure consists of a culturally sensitive seminar course taken by students during their first two semesters at Westminster College. The seminar class will be based on best practices for educating first generation, female, and other underrepresented students to be culturally sensitive. The seminar will increase cohesion among cohorts, provide ample opportunities for advising and mentoring, and demonstrate socially relevant applications of CSPM disciplines. It will address college resources, study skills, opportunities such as student research and internships, as well as career and graduate school information and support. Starting in the second year, there will be monthly meetings to support these students through active advising, mentoring, and professional opportunities. All Westminster S-STEM Scholars will be matched with faculty, peer, and alumni mentors who will be invited to the monthly luncheons. Their academic progress will be closely monitored using detailed midterm reports already in place at Westminster. Any potential issues will be addressed with multi-faceted support, including one-on-one private tutoring at no cost to the student. With its 9:1 student to faculty ratio, faculty focused on teaching, an extensive support network for struggling students, research and other opportunities for strong students, Westminster College is well-positioned to provide support to S-STEM scholars. Westminster has had demonstrated success in serving female students, with graduating percentages meeting the national average for computer science and exceeding for physics and mathematics and the student population has been increasing in diversity for the last ten years, The cultural seminar will serve as a model course for other disciplines at Westminster and for other colleges. The lessons learned in this seminar will continue to serve CSPM students beyond the life of this project. The project will also be able to explore the impact of increased monitoring and mentoring of students, and if successful these interventions can be implemented for all STEM students. Project personnel will share the seminar design and results from the project as a whole at national and regional conferences.",
