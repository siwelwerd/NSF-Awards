 "awd_abstract_narration": "Each year approximately 30,000 people are killed in the U.S. in motor vehicle crashes.  Often crashes occur because the driver cannot see the hazard in time, especially when the hazard is obscured (a braking vehicle in front of the lead vehicle, a crossing vehicle running a red light, etc.).  Currently such technology is quite expensive, which has led to lower levels of adoption.  Indeed, the field of augmented reality for cars is looking for an 'application' that will have broad basis of appeal and deep impact.  Crash avoidance could be such an application that gets more users interested in adopting this hardware, which then provides the basis for other applications to be developed and adopted.\r\n\r\nResearch is being conducted to determine how Augmented Reality (AR), implemented as a large field of view head-up display, can be used to present warnings.  Concepts include arrows showing where drivers should look and graphics to highlight at what drivers should look.  Implementation requires a full-windshield Head-Up-Display (HUD) to show the graphics, communications technology to connect vehicles, and validated user interface concepts.  These elements are to be combined in a product, one that could substantially reduce motor vehicle crashes. The team has developed and tested a proof-of-concept prototype of the augmented reality interface in a driving simulator.  That interface consists of some means to highlight a hazard, such as an underline or a surrounding box.  However, when the hazard in not in front of the driver or not visible, an arrow appears in front of them directing them where to look, either to the left or right.",

Crashes often occur because the driver cannot see the hazard in time, especially when the hazard is obscured (a braking vehicle in front of the lead vehicle, a crossing vehicle running a red light, etc.) \n\nIn another NSF project, we determined how much presenting warnings on a windshield, so drivers would not need to look down to see a warning, would help reduce crashes. For this innovation to go into production, automotive suppliers and manufacturers need data on its benefits and cost.\n\nThe benefits were assessed in a driving simulator experiment.  Subjects drove through a simulated urban center.  At some intersections drivers of other vehicles performed actions for which warnings were desired &ndash; ran a yellow light that turned red while they were in the intersection, ran a red light, and so forth.

Accordingly, we attended classes at Georgia Tech on entrepreneurship, interviewed almost 100 potentially interested parties in the Detroit area as part of customer discovery, and then reported back on what we did.  Subsequently, we traveled to Silicon Valley to talk with automotive folks there.\n\nWe did not commercialize this innovation at this time.  Those we interviewed reported the innovation was the technology was not mature enough, and we believe additional research is needed on how information should be presented.  However, we learned a great deal about how to make this innovation part of the future and are following up.  Some key lessons were as follows.\n\nBased on the coursework and interviews, we learned to create a 'business model canvas' to determine if an innovation could be the basis of a viable start-up company.\nAlthough the Detroit area is the hub for automotive engineering, it is not where automotive innovation is well received.  Our innovation received a more positive reception in the Silicon Valley.  Accordingly, we have connected with colleagues in the Silicon Valley and will continue to do so.  We need to find more travel funds to visit the Silicon Valley to visit companies and attend \"meet-ups.\"\nTo get the folks in Detroit interested in our innovation, we need an in-vehicle demo. \nDevelopment of augmented reality displays is a multisided problem.  We need to engage automotive manufacturers and suppliers, glass manufacturers, window interlayer manufacturers, and display device manufacturers.  We have connected with interlayer manufacturers and will be contacting windshield glass manufacturers.\nTo overcome concerns about the technology, follow on research needs to include display technology researchers as partners.  We are doing that for follow-on research proposals. \nWe need to be better listeners, to really appreciate the voice of the customer.  It is all to easy to become enthusiastic about what you are doing and just pitch it.  We now spend much more time asking potential sponsors to tell us what their interests are.\nThe importance of the display design community, namely members of the Society for Information Display, was underestimated.  We will increase our presence and the number of presentations we make at their meetings.\n\n\nThus, although this project did not get this innovation into production now, we now know what to do to make that happen in the future and more generally now have a better idea about how to facilitate getting other ideas into practice.\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul A Green"
