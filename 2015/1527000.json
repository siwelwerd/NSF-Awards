 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund new and replacement instrumentation on the R/V Atlantic Explorer, a 168? general purpose research vessel owned and operated by Bermuda Institute of Ocean Science (BIOS) as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System.  BIOS is a U.S. 501 (c) 3 and 509 (a) not-for profit research and educational institution incorporated in the state of New York, and geographically located on the island of Bermuda. The mission of the ship is to support funded science research throughout the Central Atlantic but specifically work in support of the BATS program. RV Atlantic Explorer had 177 days funded in 2014, all but 10 of which (95%) were for NSF. In 2015, the vessel is scheduled to sail 157 days with 119 (76%) of them funded by NSF. With this proposal, BIOS provides technical descriptions and rationale for the acquisition of the following Oceanographic Instrumentation:\r\n\r\n1)\tNiskin Water Samplers\t$25,000\t\r\n2)\tLab flow-through Sensors\t$29,553\t\r\n3)\tAttitude determination unit for ADCP\t$16,225\t\r\n4)\tPyranometers (2 ea)\t$5,600\t\r\n5)\tSensor suite for forward mast\t$7,000\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$83,378\t\r\nBroader Impacts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

These new water samplers are a core component of the R/V <em>Atlantic Explorer&rsquo;s </em>shared-use CTD system. This CTD system is comprised of ocean measuring instruments and water sampling bottles attached to a frame; together this system is the workhorse of oceanographic research. The CTD instrument package is regularly lowered to the bottom of the ocean, providing real-time physical, chemical, biological, and optical properties of the subsea environment to researchers aboard the vessel. This real-time data provides a comprehensive level of interaction to the researchers aboard the vessel. It allows the researchers to visualize and quantify the dynamics of the ocean and precisely extract sea-water samples from specific features of interest. The water samplers (a.k.a &ldquo;Niskins bottles&rdquo;) are a critical component of the system because they are the components that actually collect the distinct water samples from the deep-ocean, protect them from contamination and transport them to the deck of research vessel where further analysis can be performed by the researchers. The water samplers funded through this award have collected water samples from the the deep Atlantic Ocean during over 300 CTD deployment since they were put into service.

This unit provides measurements of the ship&rsquo;s attitude to the ship&rsquo;s 75kHz ADCP system and is critical in providing quality ocean current data which can be accurately translated into true velocity relative to the Earth.
