 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project considers eigenfunctions, which are objects that give information about, for example, the vibrations of a ringing drum head.  In other contexts, these eigenfunctions can describe, for example, how fluids mix on extremely small length scales, with potential applications to improved efficiency in medical drug delivery and dialysis.  These eigenfunctions are fundamental building blocks to understand problems in mathematics, physics, chemistry, and even biomedical engineering.  It is precisely these important fundamental connections between the proposed research and STEM subjects that makes this research have broader significance within the larger context of the STEM areas. The PI has been developing simple, instructional model problems related to most of his research for students and younger researchers. \r\n\r\nThis project concerns research in the deep relationships between solutions to partial differential equations, differential geometry, dynamical systems, and mathematical physics. These different areas of mathematics are often tied together by problems in spectral theory and microlocal analysis; that is, problems concerned with eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, phase space localization, and the generalizations thereof. The research in this proposal is divided between selfadjoint and non-selfadjoint eigenfunction problems.  The study of the behaviour of solutions to partial differential equations has a rich connection to the underlying geometry and classical phase space dynamics. For example, it is well known that eigenfunctions tend to concentrate along geodesics. If there are isolated periodic geodesics, one might expect a subsequence of eigenfunctions to concentrate along such geodesics. Understanding the rate of concentration is an extremely important question in quantum chaos. On the other hand, if the geodesic flow is sufficiently chaotic, one might expect the eigenfunctions to be equidistributed in phase space. It is important to investigate how robust these phenomena are, through phase space estimates, restriction estimates, and perturbations.  For example, in the chaotic case, the PI and his collaborators are working to understand restrictions of eigenfunctions to hypersurfaces.  With mild geometric assumptions on a hypersurface, they conjecture the mass of such restrictions is bounded above and below, independent of the eigenvalue.  The methods of investigation will introduce new microlocal energy techniques, demonstrating how to generalize a problem, previously only understood on arithmetic surfaces using number theory, to very general geometric situations.  Some properties of eigenfunctions tend to be stable under small complex perturbations, which means one can also understand some non-selfadjoint problems.  For non-selfadjoint problems with larger imaginary component, perturbation techniques are no longer strictly valid. The PI is working to develop a general theory of geometric control adapted to degenerate advection-diffusion type equations of any order. This has straightforward applications to the Fokker-Planck equation and similar equations from statistical mechanics. This theory also has applications to certain models in theoretic micro-fluidics, with potential applications to efficient geometrically localized drug delivery and dialysis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe PI's proposal concerned several problems involving eigenfunctions and related problems.  Eigenfunctions are fundamental objects in analysis and mathematical physics that are used to model vibrations on different shaped drums, evolution of quantum states, approximate scattering states, and many others.\n\nThese lines of research follow the classical-quantum correspondence: a classical Newtonian system gives information about a related quantum system.  For example, the billiard trajectories on a curved billiard table give information about the vibrations of a drum of the same shape.\n\nThe projects outlined in this proposal mostly involve chaotic classical systems.  Then the challenge is to determine what are the quantum chaotic properties for the related quantum system.  Some of the problems outlined in the proposal turned out to be much more difficult than anticipated.  However, the techniques the PI developed to study some of these complex problems turned out to be useful in studying some new simple questions.  In particular, the PI developed techniques to study eigenfunctions on triangles.  It turns out that surprisingly little is known about billiards on triangles or eigenfunctions on triangles.  The novel thing about the PI's work on triangles is that it seems to bypass the classical-quantum correspondence and instead only studies the quantum problem.\n\nAnother series of projects in this proposal involve wave propagation in the presence of trapping.  Trapping occurs, for example, in black hole geometry.  Light rays can be trapped at the photon sphere; they cannot escape to infinity, nor do they fall into the black hole, but orbit around it. \n\nThe intellectual merits of this research are several-fold.  The PI has already published three papers on eigenfunctions on triangles in high impact journals, there is one more submitted, and three more will be submitted in the next few months.  Triangles are singular objects because they have corners.  That means the billiard trajectories are also singular, so not easy to describe.  The PI's work bypasses using the classical system and instead directly studies the quantum system.  The techniques developed actually take advantage of the corners and they become essential to the techniques.  The PI has studied extensively wave propagation in geometry with trapping, and the work carried out during the granting period  expands on an enormous body of previous research.  The PI had on Ph.D. student whose thesis work is relevant to the grant topics and co-authored a paper with a colleague and two graduate students on related topics.\n\nThe broadest impacts of the work carried out during the granting period are in training of new STEM researchers.  The projects involving triangles are unique in that the geometry is clearly easy to understand, as are the statements of the theorems.  The first few results used techniques that are simple to understand, however they are robust and open-ended and serve as a gateway to understanding more advanced and sophisticated techniques.  Of the papers mentioned above, two are with undergraduate students and one is with a masters student.  The PI has one undergraduate student and one masters student currently working on related problems.  The techniques used to study waves in trapping geometry are much more sophisticated, so students must spend much more time learning them.  The techniques and the projects are open-ended so present an excellent training opportunity.  The PI has a Ph.D. currently learning these techniques and working on a project related to some of the work proposed in the grant proposal.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hans Christianson"
