 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will enable a disruptive technology that increases the efficiency and capacity of nuclear pharmacies that supply imaging tracers for Positron Emission Tomography (PET).  PET represents the most powerful medical imaging modality, yet its availability is severely limited by the nuclear pharmacy throughput capacity.  The proposed effort will remove this bottleneck and lead to a radical improvement in the availability of medical imaging with PET to the patients who depend on it for accurate diagnosis in oncology, cardiology and neurology.  The number of PET scans is projected to grow from 7 to 19 million between 2013 and 2018. However, the current state of the nuclear pharmacy industry will not support such growth unless it switches from current manual methods for compliance checking and quality control.  The goal of this project is to develop automated solutions for these cumbersome and expensive tasks.  The demand for this new product is already apparent and the addressable market is estimated at $500 million.  Once the proposed technology is proven in the nuclear pharmacy industry, it is envisioned that the same platform will find applications in other industries that require regular multi-parametric testing (e.g. wastewater or food inspection). \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project is in the development of two innovative analytical methods that can be implemented using a commercial plate reader. The first one is a radioactivity measurement using Liquid Scintillation Counting (LSC).  This project will enable LSC in a plate reader operating in luminescence reading mode.  In this effort, the radioactive sample will be mixed with scintillating material and is expected to produce a quantifiable luminescence signal. The second test is quantification of a cryptand commonly used in the synthesis of PET imaging tracers. The plan is to develop a colorimetric indicator that allows quantification of this cryptand by measuring the absorbance of color resulting from the binding of cryptand with indicator in a plate reader. These tests are the two critical components that need to be proven in order to demonstrate complete, automated quality control (QC) of a short-lived radiopharmaceutical product with a single plate reader, and without any contact between the reader and the sample.  Currently, this same QC process requires 10 to 14 manual tests done using multiple instruments, most of which come in contact with the sample and need to be cleaned and equilibrated.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTrace-Ability, Inc. has successfully completed Phase I/IB of the project entitled \"Development of a simple device that eliminates bottlenecks in radiopharmaceutical production.\"  The latter device, called Tracer-QC presents a paradigm shift in quality control (QC) of radiopharmaceuticals used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET).  Such QC involves measurements of multiple parameters on a rapidly decaying radioactive product and is typically performed by highly skilled staff using a number of instruments and also relying on significant manual handling of the radioactive sample and subjective assessments.  Tracer-QC enables automatic and completely objective assessment of 10 QC parameters from a single sample without any manual handling after sample introduction.  Trace-Ability has designed new QC tests that can produce the same information as traditional ones, but can all be performed on a simple commercial plate reader relying on optical signals produced by the sample when it interacts with reagents and features in an innovative Tracer-QC kit. \n\n \n\nFeasibility of 7 of the new tests has been proven outside of the NSF Phase I/IB project scope and the last 3 tests were enabled within the course of the project.  Two of those tests require measurement of concentration of organic solvent (acetonitrile) and a phase transfer reagent (Kryptofix 2.2.2).  Trace-Ability has developed proprietary reagents that interact with acetonitrile and Kryprofix generating a measurable color change in the range of concentrations relevant to radio-pharmaceutical QC.  Previously, performance of these tests required a gas chromatograph and a manual spot test.  The third test requires measurement of radiation intensity which is typically performed in a dedicated dose calibrator.  The technology developed in the course of the project relies on a microplate with embedded scintillating materials that generate measurable amount of light when exposed to sources of radiation.  This light, just like the color changes of Kryptofix and acetonitrile indicators can be measured by the same plate reader instrument that is used for all other tests.  The last objective of the project was design of a prototype kit that enables multiple tests on a plate reader.  Feasibility of such a kit has been proven and the work continues to make it more robust and practical.\n\n \n\nThe results of this project eliminate the most critical technical risks and prove feasibility of unprecedented processes which are key to Tracer-QC success.  These outcomes justify continued effort focused on the development of Tracer-QC product.  The latter, in turn, is expected to streamline production of PET radio-pharmaceuticals and increase availability of PET imaging to patients.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/25/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Artem Lebedev"
