 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many mathematical models from statistical physics are characterized by the fact that there is a sharp qualitative change when a parameter reaches a certain value.  This is an idealization of phase transitions such as the change of water from solid to liquid to gas as temperature varies. These mathematical models at critical values  of the parameter often produce random fractals.  The proposer will continue investigation of these fractals.  The theory is well developed in two dimensions where the systems are invariant under conformal transformation and the investigation will be on fine properties. The theory in three dimensions is less developed and  the main goal is to construct nontrivial models.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the goal in two dimensions is to study the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) as a measure on curves parametrized with the natural fractal parametrization. Technical questions to study include the Holder continuity of the curves (under natural parametrization) and the stationary of the SLE loop measure. The latter property is needed to construct a conformally covariant measure on SLE loops analogous to the Brownian loop measure.  There are several questions in three dimensions that will be investigated: trying to show that there is a unique chronological loop-erasure of Brownian motion and to describe the limit as a Laplacian random walk; proving analyticity of the intersection exponent for Brownian motion and establishing the multifractal spectrum for harmonic measure; and finding general methods to give nontrivial measures on continuous, non-self-intersecting curves  of fractal dimension greater than one.  The use of infinitesimal  (non-standard) techniques will be considered as an alternative to continuum  models for objects such as exponentials of Gaussian free fields, uniform  spanning trees, and percolation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProgress was made in understanding random fractal structures that arise in probability and the study of critical phenomena in statistical physics.    Many of these results were done with various co-authors including graduate students and post-docs.\n\nMathematical models with non-trivial interactions are often formulated on discrete lattices, and the goal is to understand what happens as the size of the system gets large, or essentially equivalently, when the mesh size of the lattice goes to zero.  One hopes to describe limit models in the continuum and the nature and rate of convergence of the discrete models to the continuous.\n\nMinkowski content is a way to assign a fractal measure to a path.  The proposer completed a program to show how for a particular model, the loop-erased random walk parametrized by the number of discrete steps taken, in the limit approaches the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE) parametrized so that the number of steps becomes the (5/4)-Minkowski content of the paths visited.  The method was designed so that it could be applicable to other models as well provided that sufficiently accurate estimates for the discrete object can be obtained.  The PI showed that certain exceptional sets (cut points) for random walk paths also approach the corresponding set for Brownian motion measured by Minkowski content. \n\nOther results were obtained for the loop-erased random walk.  In the critical dimension four, very careful estimates were given for the critical probability of a loop-erased walk and a regular random walk.  This gave a way to construct a two-sided walk.  The two-sided walk was also constructed in two and three dimensions using a different argument; this gives the distribution of the ?middle? of such a path.  In two-dimensions the transition probabilities were related to determinants of a random path with negative weights.  The analysis of this led to some new results about the usual random walk.\n\nSeveral results were obtained for the Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE).  The relationship between the Brownian loop measure and the intrinsic measure on multiple interacting radial SLE paths was understood and explains why the Dyson Brownian motion, which also arises in random matrix theory, arises naturally.  The loop measure also defines the natural measure for multiple SLE for chordal paths; it was shown that the corresponding partition function is sufficiently smooth to allow the standard techniques of stochastic calculus to be used.\n\nThe random walk loop measure which was introduced by the PI and co-authors has become more important.  New proofs were given of the isomorphism theorem relating the measure to another model, the Gaussian free field, and a long survey paper summarizing some of the new ideas was prepared.   Another survey paper on different loop measures was prepared as part of the International Congress of Mathematicians.\n\nThe PI also participated regularly in the University of Chicago Research Experiences for Undergraduates program in the summer giving specialized lectures.  A volume which should appear in 2022 was prepared which gives advanced undergraduates a chance to sample research topics.\n\nIn a different outreach area, the PI worked with the contract bridge community, and particularly the European Bridge League, to show how statistical analysis can be used to establish cheating by players at the highest level.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory F Lawler"
