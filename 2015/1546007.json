Molina to be held as part of the 96th American Meteorological Society (AMS) Annual Meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana on 10-14 January 2016.  Dr. Molina has made fundamental advances to atmospheric chemistry both in the troposphere and stratosphere. His research was instrumental to the negotiation and the establishment of the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer by prohibiting the release of anthropogenic gases that destroy stratospheric ozone.  Dr. Molina was awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his pioneering research in understanding the stratospheric ozone loss mechanism.\r\n\r\nDr. Molina's pioneering research on the impacts of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on stratospheric ozone demonstrated the vulnerability of the natural environment and promoted the public awareness of the potential harmful consequences of anthropogenic activities. This project supports 5-10 early career scientists (i.e., undergraduate students, graduate students, post docs, and un-tenured professors) and one invited keynote speaker (i.e., Dr. M.J. Molina) to attend the symposium.\r\n\r\nThe 2016 AMS Mario J. Molina Symposium will provide broader impacts by hosting training opportunities for young scientists in the atmospheric chemistry, climate, and policies. Graduate and undergraduate students are encouraged to participate and present their research in this symposium. Best student oral presentations and poster papers will be selected at the meeting and recognized by the AMS Atmospheric Chemistry Committee. The International Commission on Atmospheric Chemistry and Global Pollution (ICACGP) is a co-sponsor of this symposium.",

Molina was held 10&ndash;14 January 2016, as part of the 96th American Meteorological Society (AMS) Annual Meeting in New Orleans, Louisiana. Dr. Molina first demonstrated that industrially produced chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) decompose in the stratosphere and release chlorine atoms, leading to catalytic ozone destruction. His research in stratospheric chemistry was instrumental to the establishment of the 1987 United Nations Montreal Protocol to ban ozone-depleting substances worldwide. Dr. Molina&rsquo;s contributions to preserving the planet Earth not only save the atmospheric ozone layer, but also protect the climate by reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. He was awarded the 1995 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his pioneering research in understanding the stratospheric ozone loss mechanism. In 2013, President Barack Obama announced Dr. Molina as a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The 2016 AMS Molina Symposium honored Dr. Molina&rsquo;s distinguished contributions to research related to atmospheric chemistry. The symposium contained an integrated theme related to atmospheric chemistry, climate, and policy. Dr. Molina delivered a keynote speech at the Symposium. The conference included invited keynote speeches and invited and contributed oral and poster sessions, and a banquet was held on Tuesday January 12, 2016. The symposium covered all aspects of atmospheric chemistry, with possible topics including (1) Stratospheric chemistry, (2) Tropospheric chemistry, (3) Aerosol nucleation, growth, and transformation, (4) Aerosol properties, (5) Megacity air pollution, and (6) Atmospheric chemistry laboratory, field, and modeling studies.
