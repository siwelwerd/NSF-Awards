 "awd_abstract_narration": "The M7.8 earthquake occurred on 25 April 2015 in Nepal is unique among recent Himalayan earthquakes, as it failed to release entirely the pent up stress accumulated since a previous similar earthquake there in 1833.  Instead, stress was transferred from 40 km north of the capital, Kathmandu, to 8 km to the south, shifting the 2 million population of the Kathmandu Valley about 1.3 m to the southwest in the process.  Of major concern is that this stress is now poised, either to diffuse benignly as slow slip, or to be released violently in a future Mw&#8804;7.5 earthquake.  US Embassy officials in Kathmandu are concerned that a major aftershock of this size occurring on the outskirts of the capital would have catastrophic consequences to the already weakened buildings of the city, and would greatly impair the rescue operation to the thousands of villages wiped out by the April 25, 2015 earthquake. In this collaborative rapid project, the PIs will install instruments in the region south of Kathmandu to identify what is exactly happening to this stress. The hope is that processes similar to those occurring on the San Andreas fault in California prevail, namely that stress are being released slowly, in which case it would be possible to infer that a future major earthquake is unlikely.  The PIs also recognize that the 2015 earthquake may provide clues to future earthquakes near Kathmandu, in that it may be possible to gain insights into what may happen next by re-evaluating historical earthquakes occurred near Kathmandu in the period from 1833 to 1866.  We are collaborating with Nepali students and faculty in Tribhuvan University to undertake these studies.  \r\n\r\nThe PIs plan to install two arrays of GPS units on stable monuments between Kathmandu and the frontal thrusts of the Himalaya- a 35 km wide distance with instrument spacing as close as 5 km.  The narrow spacing will permit them to detect slip of the Himalayan d\u00e9collement should it be occurring, and will permit them to distinguish various forms of spatial strain diffusion, or locally locked asperities should these exist. Data from each instrument will be telemetered to Boulder and the data will be processed daily and archived with easy public access.  A number of campaign GPS sites will be also installed that will be measured at six-month intervals (or more frequently) by students from Tribhuvan University.  The PIs envisage that up to eleven additional GPS instruments will be deployed. The PIs plan also to gather time-sensitive intensity data from the epicentral region that may be used to calibrate the attenuation of surface acceleration in the 2015 earthquake. They will use these data to calibrate historical intensity data from the 1833, 1835, 1866,1934 and 1936 Nepal earthquakes, that will used to constrain the rupture areas of these former events, and how they relate to the 2015 earthquake.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF RAPID award 1546633 was awarded to support investigation of the solid earth deformation immediately following the Gorkha Nepal earthquake in April 2015.  The funding contributed to the installation or upgrade of 23 GPS instruments in the earthquake-affected area, along with the processing, analysis, and modeling of data generated by those instruments.\n\n \n\n The scientific results include four publications, including one in Nature Geoscience, that report on measured deformation both during and after the earthquake and its aftershock sequence.  Our most important findings include observations of displacement equivalent to a M7.1 earthquake accommodated aseismically deep beneath southern Tibet, a lack of afterslip south of the Gorkha earthquake termination, leading to added stresses on Himalayan faults in southern Nepal, and an improved understanding of the complexity of the Himalayan earthquake cycle in general.  These three main findings combine to indicate that prior models in which Tibet rides over India in rare but extreme megaquakes is at best oversimplified.  Instead, it appears that the deepest parts of the subduction interface act like those in other areas such as Cascadia, Sumatra, and Japan, accommodating rapid deep slip without seismic shaking.  At the same time, the shallower part of the interface must consist of stronger and weaker patches which fail and slip in both moderate, incomplete ruptures and rarer events that displace the entire interface.  These latter largest quakes may \"mine\" stress from previous incomplete events, leading to very complex distributions of slip and seismic shaking in both space and time.  Because the record of past Himalayan quakes relies heavily on paleosesismic studies (where measurements of quakes are made on trenches dug across surface faults), it is likely to be biased by this complexity in ways that affect our assessment of current seismic hazards in the region and our overall understanding of Himalayan tectonics. \n\n \n\nThe most important broader impacts of this work include at least a dozen print articles and video segments in outlets both in North America and South Asia explaining the earthquake and its aftermath to non-technical audiences, with particular attention to regional preparedness for future large events.  Local media coverage in Montana, in particular, has led to an ongoing discussion of regional earthquake hazards and preparedness.  Media coverage in South Asia emphasizes the possibility of future megaquakes on other segments of the Himalayan fault system.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rebecca O Bendick"
