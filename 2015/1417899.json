 "awd_abstract_narration": "SuperMAG is a project to provide the Geospace community with high quality ground magnetic field observations. It serves an important purpose in space physics research by providing data necessary for solving many space weather and general space physics problems.  SuperMAG is headquartered at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory that has an excellent outreach program to high school and undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThe data available through the SuperMAG system are calibrated magnetic field data from approximately 300 observatories around the world. The data have had noise signatures removed as well as the signatures of current systems other than those in and between the magnetosphere and the ionosphere. The data can be rotated into geomagnetically useful coordinate systems. SuperMAG operates a web site which provides ready access to the data in either digital form or as plots. This grant will continue the operation of SuperMAG.",
