 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biofuel derived from non-food sources, such as fibrous organic wastes and energy crops, play an important role in fostering a sustainable, greener, and more secure energy future.  High economic costs, however, have hindered the widespread utilization of such biomass-based fuels.  This EAPSI project will seek to address the commercialization obstacle by studying the biofuel potential of agave, a drought-tolerant plant species with low recalcitrance, two features conducive to the lowering of biofuel processing costs.  As one of the few countries that are invested in agave as an energy crop, Australia has much expertise to provide in assessing an important aspect of the processing cost: the feedstock value.  Consequently, this project is a collaborative endeavor with Dr. Daniel Tan, Associate Professor in Agronomy at the University of Sydney, who is at the vanguard in developing agave plantations in Australia.  \r\n  \r\nThis project will rely on techno-economic analysis to evaluate the biofuel potential of agave.  The analysis will utilize actual feedstock costs associated with the cultivation of agave as an energy crop.  In addition, a biochemical process without pretreatment would be used to model the conversion step.  An economic evaluation combining actual feedstock costs with a simplified process requiring no pretreatment will furnish important insights into the potential of agave as a biorefinery feedstock.  An analysis that leads to a bioethanol minimum selling price that is competitive with fossil fuel will not only boost the prospect of agave as feedstock candidate, but more importantly, it could potentially result in higher production of biofuel, which would lead to a more promising energy future. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBiofuels are a necessity when it comes to combatting climate changes triggered by the large consumption of fossil fuel.  One potential source of biofuels, especially for ethanol production, is the plant agave, which thrives in the arid and semi-arid regions of the world.  Agave, with its high sugar content, has historically been utilized as a source of alcoholic beverages.  This is particularly true of the species A. tequilana.  However, with a large swath of the global terrain receiving rainfall of less than 18 inches per annum, and with limited water resources in certain areas, agave also holds tremendous promise as a biorefinery feedstock candidate.   \n\nThis project, which took place at the University of Sydney in Australia during the summer of 2015, was intended to analyze the potential of agave as an energy crop for biofuel production.  One of the key objectives is to determine the productivity of the plant, specifically Agave tequilana (A. tequilana).  The first field trial of cultivating agave as an energy crop was pioneered in the Kalamia Estate, Ayr in Queensland, by Mr. Don Chambers, CEO of AusAgave, in collaboration with Dr. Daniel Tan of the University of Sydney, Dr. Joseph Holtum of James Cook University, Mr. Terry Morgan of Wilmar Sugar Refinery, Ms. Kendall Corbin of University of Adelaide, and a host of other Australian researchers.  The result of this field trial cultivation was evaluated in this project. \n\nFor productivity assessment (biomass&bull;ha-1&bull;year-1), annual growth rate of the plant along with compositional analysis of agave anatomical components in terms of structural and free sugar contents, are critical.  Using these data, the project determines that the productivity of agave is indeed promising, given the edaphic and climatic conditions of Kalamia Estate.  For alcoholic beverage production in Mexico, A. tequilana, is typically harvested in the later years, when it is 6-8 years old.  At this stage of the plant\u00c6s life, the stem or pi&ntilde;a, the source of tequila, is rich in sugar.  As an energy crop, the project indicates the possibility of early harvesting of the plant.  In fact, instead of a long wait, harvesting in the third year is possible.   The whole plant productivity, which includes both dry bagasse and juice, was more than 100 dry tonnes&bull;ha-1&bull;year-1.  Excluding juice, the bagasse productivity exceeds 10 dry tonnes&bull;ha-1&bull;year-1.  The latter productivity figure is comparable to that of switchgrass, another potential energy crop, which has productivity in the range of 11-20 dry tonnes&bull;ha-1&bull;year-1.\n\nFor the 5 year old plant, the potential of agave as a biofuel feedstock is equally promising.  The plant\u00c6s bagasse-only productivity is higher than that of the third year, and is close to 20 tonnes&bull;ha-1&bull;year-1.  Including juice, the productivity rises above 90 tonnes&bull;ha-1&bull;year-1.   Ethanol production is more than 10 gallons&bull;tonne-1 of biomass (comprising of juice and dry bagasse) for both the 3 and 5 year old plants. \n\nIn summary, this project highlights the tremendous biofuel potential in agave in the first field trial at Kalamia Estate, Ayr, in Queensland, Australia.  Given the right environmental conditions, the agave plant is capable of producing biomass and yielding ethanol in amounts exceeding or comparable to those of other energy crops.      \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/07/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: May-Ling Lu"
