 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cryptographically formatted digital data that can securely emulate functions provided by traditional forms of currency are known as cryptocurrencies.  Like traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies can be generated, used to conduct transactions, and destroyed. Cryptocurrencies are poised to change commerce over the Internet and beyond.  Following the unprecedented success of well-known cryptocurrencies, there are several hundred variations and some entirely new cryptocurrencies that are, taken together, valued at several billion dollars in 2015.  As the 'second generation' currencies gain traction, the landscape of cryptocurrencies their uses for online payments and their public acceptance is changing quicker than ever before.\r\n\r\nThis proposal covers three broad areas:\r\n\r\nMeasurement: For deployed and emerging crypto-currencies, this proposal will develop techniques to discover network structure and understand how network structure affects other properties of the currency system.  The techniques will also measure how mining power interfaces with the network, how mining algorithms affect the topology, and whether miners are omitting certain classes of transactions.\r\n\r\nAnalysis: The measurements will generate a longitudinal view of multiple cryptocurrencies, enabling comparison between topological structure across time and across currencies.\r\n\r\nDesign: Deployed cryptocurrency networks and computation power structure is susceptible to previously theorized attacks, where attackers gain advantage by being able to propagate information faster than others.  This work will lead to new protocols that mitigate or even eliminate these types of attacks, regardless of how many nodes attackers control, how these nodes are situated in the network, and how the computation power in the network is distributed.\r\n\r\nCryptocurrencies seem inevitable, with some having passed a \"tipping point\" in social mindshare and being used for everyday commerce.  New currencies are being continually introduced, and being traded for U.S. Dollars and other \"hard\" currencies; these networks are increasingly poised to have a financial impact and our designs are meant to eliminate structural protocol faults that have been identified.  The data resulting from this work will generate \"birds-eye\" views of different currency networks across time and will be made publicly available for the research community.  Broader analysis of these datasets will result in deeper and foundational understanding of cryptocurrency networks.",
