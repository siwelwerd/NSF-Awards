 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic marine ecosystem is highly productive and supports a diverse range of ecologically and commercially important species.  A key species in this ecosystem is Antarctic krill, which in addition to being commercially harvested, is the principle prey of a wide range of marine organisms including penguins, seals and whales.  The aim of this study is to use penguins and other krill predators as sensitive indicators of past changes in the Antarctic marine food web resulting from climate variability and the historic harvesting of seals and whales by humans. Specifically this study will recover and analyze modern (<20 year old), historic (20-200 year old) and ancient (200-10,000 year old) penguin and other krill predator tissues to track their past diets and population movements relative to shifts in climate and the availability of Antarctic krill. Understanding how krill predators were affected by these factors in the past will allow us to better understand how these predators, the krill they depend on, and the Antarctic marine ecosystem as a whole will respond to current challenges such as global climate change and an expanding commercial fishery for Antarctic krill.  The project will further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. This project will support the cross-institutional training of undergraduate and graduate students in advanced analytical techniques in the fields of ecology and biogeochemistry.  In addition, this project includes educational outreach aimed encouraging participation in science careers by engaging K-12 students in scientific issues related to Antarctica, penguins, marine ecology, biogeochemistry, and global climate change.\r\n\r\nThis research will help place recent ecological changes in the Southern Ocean into a larger historical context by examining decadal and millennial-scale shifts in the diets and population movements of Antarctic krill predators (penguins, seals, and squid) in concert with climate variability and commercial harvesting.  This will be achieved by coupling advanced stable and radio isotope techniques, particularly compound-specific stable isotope analysis, with unprecedented access to modern, historical, and well-preserved paleo-archives of Antarctic predator tissues dating throughout the Holocene.  This approach will allow the project to empirically test if observed shifts in Antarctic predator bulk tissue stable isotope values over the past millennia were caused by climate-driven shifts at the base of the food web in addition to, or rather than, shifts in predator diets due to a competitive release following the historic harvesting of krill eating whale and seals. In addition, this project will track the large-scale abandonment and reoccupation of penguin colonies around Antarctica in response to changes in climate and sea ice conditions over the past several millennia. These integrated field studies and laboratory analyses will provide new insights into the underlying mechanisms that influenced past shifts in the diets and population movements of charismatic krill predators such as penguins. This will allow for improved projections of the ecosystem consequences of future climate change and anthropogenic harvesting scenarios in the Antarctica that are likely to affect the availability of Antarctic krill.",

The major goal for the UNCW part in this project was to sample abandoned and active penguin colonies in the Antarctic Peninsula and Ross Sea regions to obtain ancient and modern tissues of penguins (feathers, bone, eggshell) and their prey (fish bones, otoliths, squid beaks) for stable isotope and radiocarbon analyses.&nbsp; These analyses allowed us to test hypotheses on past dietary shifts and occupation history of penguins, and to assess these shifts in correlation with known periods of climate change, sea ice extent, and other factors. Understanding how penguins responded to these events in the past helps us predict how they will respond to current and future warming trends and reduction in sea ice.</p>\n<p>Three deploymentsto Antarctica were completed in collaboration with the Italian Antarctic Program at Mario Zucchelli Station in 2015-2016, the Argentine Antarctic Program at Carlini Station in 2017-2018, and with Oceanwide Expeditions tour ship company on board their vessel <em>Ortelius</em> in 2020.&nbsp; One Chinese collaborator (Dr. Xiaodong Liu) participated in the 2015-2016 deployment as a member of the field team. These deployments resulted in the collection of ancient and modern penguin tissue samples from numerous localities in the Antarctic Peninsula and Ross Sea, as well as the discovery of one new locality at Cape Irizar in the Ross Sea (Figs 1-2). Analyses of these data for stable isotopes and radiocarbon dating with graduate and undergraduate student participation resulted in the completion of four undergraduate Honors theses (one still in progress), two Master's theses (one still in progress), and one Ph.D. dissertation. One Master's student, Yanina Ciriani, was recruited from Argentina as part of that international collaboration. This research resulted so far in 12 publications in peer-reviewed journals with other publications completed by collaborating institutions on this award. &nbsp;These papers describe newly discovered past occupations by the Ad?lie penguin (<em>Pygoscelis adeliae</em>) in the mid to late Holocene at King George Island, Antarctic Peninsula, and in the Ross Sea region. In the latter region, a warming period from 2000 ? 4000 years ago known as the penguin 'optimum' was investigated and is now associated with increased primary productivity in the Terra Nova Bay polynya and penguin population expansion into the southern Ross Sea. The active colony at Cape Adare in the northern Ross Sea is now known to have been roughly twice as large as it is today (&gt;338,000 breeding pair) at about 1200-1800 years ago. The remaining active colony today is threatened by sea level rise and may be abandoned within the next 30-50 years if current trends continue.</p>\n<p>Outreach activities included both public and academic presentations, postings of blogs, YouTube videos, and new 9<sup>th</sup>-12<sup>th</sup> grade curriculum on PI Emslie?s project website (<a href=\"https://itsweb02.uncw.edu/penguins/\">https://itsweb02.uncw.edu/penguins/</a>), and visits to elementary and high school classrooms and two UNCW freshman classes (UNI 101 and HON 110). The new curricula includes lesson plans with learning goals, lesson essential questions, activating strategies, key vocabulary terms, and vocabulary strategies. Teacher resources include guided notes, assignments, suggestions for reinforcing student understanding, and lesson instructions.
