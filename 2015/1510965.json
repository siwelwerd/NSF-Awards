Critical and strategic elements are those in which disruptions to the supply are a concern for the manufacturing of consumer products and for materials crucial to national welfare and defense. Collectively coal combustion residues represent one of the largest industrial waste streams in the country, with more than 100 million metric tons generated annually. Less than half of the total is currently used beneficially (mostly for construction, agriculture, and other sectors). This project will provide fundamental information that is necessary for the utilization of coal ash as a resource for these high value metals.\r\n\r\nThe research will result in a comprehensive database of critical metals concentrations in ash from a broad array of U.S. power stations and coal sources. The results should also improve the understanding of the types of coal deposits and ashes that are enriched in these elements and the geochemical speciation of these elements in the ash. This project will systematically explore acid extraction and physical-chemical separation methods that will provide a basis for resource recovery. This project will investigate the potential for coal ash wastes to serve as an alternative resource for critical metals such as rare earth elements. Previous surveys have shown that some coal sources and their respective ash by-products are enriched in rare earth elements to levels that are similar to deposits at mining sites. Despite the intense interest in alternative rare earth elements sources, data is limited for coal and coal ash in the U.S. Specific objectives of the research are to: 1) Perform a survey of coal ash materials collected from a wide variety of coal sources and combustion conditions and develop a database that will include concentrations of rare earth elements, platinum group elements, germanium and other critical metals. The data will also include the origins and geochemical and physical properties of the ash. 2) Characterize the speciation of elements identified for resource recovery, and evaluate how they are bound in the coal ash material. 3) Evaluate how speciation, coal mineralogy and particle physical properties influences acid extraction efficiencies and explore separation methods to extract and purify critical elements from fly ash and bottom ash. Thus, this project will address a great need to diversify the supply market while also utilize a solid waste material (coal ash) for beneficial purposes. Partnerships with industry stakeholders will be leveraged to provide avenues for dissemination and feedback of this work. Educational activities will include mentorship and research opportunities for K-12 students and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups.",

This analysis entailed more than 100 coal fly ash and coal ash samples from 22 power stations in the U.S., and represented coal feedstocks from the major coal producing regions in the U.S. This work demonstrated a regional basis for REE contents and also highlighted the relative enrichment of high value heavy REE relative to light REE.</p>\n<p>2) Characterization of coal ashes for REE recovery</p>\n<p>We used a variety of spectroscopy and microscopy tools to understand the modes of occurrence for the rare earth elements. This work revealed the highly heterogeneous speciation of the REE with coal ash particles. Individual REE were for the most part observed to be encapsulated within glassy aluminosilicate particles. Discrete particles of REE-bearing minerals were observed. However, we believe these observations were not the dominant forms of the REE. Overall, these results are consistent with observed challenges in leaching REE for processing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;3) Technologies to extract and concentrate REE from coal fly ash</p>\n<p>The first step in the recovery of REE from coal fly ash is a leaching step. We tested a wide variety of methods including acid leaching and combined alkaline/acid approaches. This work demonstrated that with leaching in diluted acid (e.g. 1M HCl), we could obtain high recoveries of REE (&gt;80%) for fly ashes generated from Powder River Basin coals (King et al., 2018; Middleton et al., 2020). For other fly ashes produced from other major coals (i.e. bituminous coals of eastern U.S. basins), the REE were not as easily extracted. Improved extraction efficiency could be obtained with alkaline roasting methods (Taggart et al. 2018). However such methods have large reagent requirements that may not lend towards economically feasible REE production processes. Further optimization of the leaching process could be achieved by controlling the solid:acid ratio during the extraction as well as pH.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;We also studied separation methods for the production of mixed REE concentrates from the coal ash leachates. These methods included selective precipitation, nanofiltration, micelle enhanced ultrafiltration, supported liquid membranes, and liquid emulsion membranes (Mutlu et al. 2018, 2020; Smith et al., 2019). The supported liquid membrane approach yielded the highest selectivity for REE relative to major competing ions such as Al, Fe, Si and Ca in the coal ash leachates.</p>\n<p><em>Broader Impacts</em></p>\n<p>4) Training and educational opportunities for student researchers, and high school teachers and students</p>\n<p>This project supported 4 graduate, 3 undergraduate and 2 postdoctoral researchers.
