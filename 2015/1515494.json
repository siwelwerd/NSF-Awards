 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wound healing is critical for survival in all living things, including humans. It is also the key feature that distinguishes living from non-living matter. Due to the small size of a cell, a key challenge is the lack of a tool that can wound cells in a systematic and scalable manner. The goal of this project is to employ a new micro-engineering platform and to establish a standardized procedure for wounding cells and for measuring the healing efficiency. This platform enables the study of the molecular and mechanical mechanisms that underlie wound healing. The broader significance and importance of this project is the understanding of the way cell repairs wounds and restores its normal function for survival. It will provide insights into how a cell knows that it has been injured, what mechanisms it uses to start the healing process, and how it knows when healing is complete.  The Broader Impacts of this work include a graduate summer course, outreach activities for K-12 students, and outreach activities for the general public at the Bay Area Science Festival.\r\n\r\nWound healing is essential for maintaining homeostasis and, ultimately, for survival. Cells, such as skeletal muscles, are wounded regularly under physiological conditions. Understanding wound response at the single-cell level is critical for determining fundamental cellular functions needed for cell repair and survival. Key barriers to answering these questions are the lack of a tool that can introduce wounds reproducibly to a large number of cells and a quantitative assay to measure healing efficiency. The goal of this project is to investigate the mechanisms underlying single-cell wound healing, by employing a microfluidic platform and using Stentor coeruleus as a model organism. Stentor coeruleus, a single cell capable of recovering from drastic wounds within 24 hours, is selected as a model because of its robust wound healing capacity, and the ability to perform gene knockdown experiments in a high throughput manner. The project objectives are to: 1) establish standard assays to wound cells in a reproducible manner using a continuous-flow microfluidic splitter, and to quantify the healing efficiency of cells, 2) investigate the molecular pathway of wound healing by examining gene expression during the healing process, and 3) profile the changes in the mechanical properties of the cell during the healing process. The significance and intellectual merit of this project lies in the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying single-cell wound healing and the corresponding changes in the physical and mechanical properties of the cell. The transformative potential of this project is the novel application of microfluidics to generate controllable wounds at the single-cell level in a reproducible manner. The collaboration between Marshall Lab with expertise in cell biology and Tang Lab with expertise in microfluidics creates unique opportunities to solve high-impact problems at the interface of engineering and life sciences not possible in a traditional single-discipline project. The broader impact of this research is development of a powerful experimental model for understanding how single cells repair and maintain homeostasis. The project will identify factors that trigger the initiation of the healing response, and the cascade of molecular and physical processes a single cell employs to heal and restore normal cell function. Furthermore, the work will enable the elucidation of how healing relates to other important cell functions such as morphogenesis, as well as how single cell-level and tissue-level healing are related and coordinated.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\n \n\nCells are soft, squishy, and easily damaged, yet they can repair themselves after being punctured, torn, or even ripped in half.   A cell is like a spacecraft: when it is punctured, cytoplasm spills out like oxygen escaping from a damaged space module.  Like Apollo 13, a damaged cell cannot rely on anyone to fix it. It must repair itself, first by stopping the loss of cytoplasm, and then by rebuilding structures that were damaged or lost.  Cells get damaged all the time in the course of normal physiology as well as pathology.  Understanding how they repair themselves has the potential to guide and improve treatments for conditions involving cellular damage. \n\n \n\nIn order to understand how cells heal wounds, we have taken advantage of Stentor coeruleus, a free-living single celled organism that can grow to be more than 1 millimeter long.  Stentor cells can be cut in half or even into dozens of pieces, and each piece can regenerate an intact cell.  This dramatic ability to heal wounds provides an opportunity to study wound healing because the wounding can be created using simple methods, and is so dramatic that it is easy to see if something has gone wrong.   The challenge is that the traditional way to wound Stentor is to cut it with a glass needle.  This is time consuming and difficult.   A major outcome of this grant is that we developed a device for cutting Stentor in a fully automated way.  This device uses a tiny knife.  Stentor cells flow through a small tube and are pushed across the knife blade, which cuts the cell into two pieces.   This device, which we call the \"cellular guillotine\", now lets us do hundreds of cutting experiments in just a few minutes.  Along with the device for cutting cells, we also have found a fluorescent chemical that, when it binds to a site of wounding, make the wound glow under the microscope.  This lets us see the wound and measure how fast it heals.  This combination of automated wounding and measurement is an important step forward because it will allow us to do hundreds of experiments in the time that would normally be needed to do just one or two.  \n\n \n\nUsing our new automated wound healing analysis device, we asked how the cell knows when it has been wounded.   Because we can now do many experiments in a short time, we were able to test the chemicals present in the pond water that the cells normally grow in.  We found that if we remove calcium from the water, the cells aren?t able to heal wounds any more.   It is known that cells try to keep calcium out, which means that if they get wounded, calcium will flow in from outside.   The cell appears to be able to detect this calcium and then trigger its wound response.  This result, which is a second major outcome of this funded work, points the way to future experiments that will focus on learning which proteins inside the cell are used to detect calcium and trigger the rest of the response. \n\n \n\nA broader impact of our work is that we have been able to use Stentor as the basis for a number of outreach demonstrations and public lecture activities, such as Maker Faire Bay Area, which takes place each spring in San Mateo.  The huge size of the Stentor cell, and its remarkable ability to regenerate and heal wounds, captures the imagination of anyone interested in nature or science, and gives us a way to start a conversation about cells and cell biology.\n\n \n\nAs a result of the work funded by this grant, we have taken a major step forward in understanding how cells heal wounds, and have developed methods that can now be used for drug screening efforts as well as to understand the molecular basis of a fundamental property of life itself.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/20/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wallace Marshall"
