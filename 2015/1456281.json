 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the $1 billion life science research market that is served mainly by multiplex protein tests.  The research proposed here has tremendous potential as a tool for highly accurate and robust detection of proteins that have been linked to cardiovascular disease.  Additionally, the development of this core technology can be used for research of numerous other diseases.  The product developed during this project has potential applications in the pharmaceutical and contract research organization markets for drug discovery, monitoring therapeutic efficacy, and assisting with clinical studies.  While this Phase II proposal includes the development and commercialization of a DVT panel, the commercial product offering will cover a wider variety of disease-related proteins for research applications (e.g. protein combinations in which academic researchers, contract research organizations, or pharmaceutical companies have interest).\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will result in a better, more robust tool for detection of disease-related proteins in patient blood.  The product will be able to measure the amounts of multiple proteins at one time without a problem known as ?antibody crosstalk?, which hinders the quality of results when using other technologies.  Work on this project will involve developing a kit that includes equipment and reagents for an end-user to work with and analyze blood samples for proteins of interest, in this case those involved with cardiovascular disease.  A working prototype device was developed as part of Phase I funding, and Phase II will improve upon the device (increased analysis time and multiplexing) until useful for the analysis of clinical samples.  Patient samples, already collected, banked, and de-identified under IRB approval, will be analyzed in a collaborative effort with researchers at the University of Michigan. Results from Phase II support will include a useful multiplexed protein biomarker immunoassay platform that has been validated using patient blood samples.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Phase II SBIR grant provided funds to PHASIQ, Inc., a company that using proprietary microdroplet technology to develop improved plasma and serum tests for multiplexed disease marker detection.  In the Phase I portion of this project, PHASIQ prototyped and tested a novel platform for simultaneous quantitation of multiple proteins involved in cardiovascular disease diagnosis.  PHASIQ?s core technology uses microdroplet arrays that are capable of preventing unwanted molecular interactions that otherwise hinder simultaneous detection of disease-related proteins in blood.  These unwanted molecular interactions, known as antibody crosstalk, can skew data and produce false signals, preventing tests for multiple proteins from being used as efficient diagnostic tools.  The overall goals of the Phase II portion of this project were to further develop and increase the throughput of the prototype developed in Phase I, and to use the product to identify potential new biomarkers of cardiovascular disease through testing of actual deep vein thrombosis model blood samples.\n\n \n\nA primary objective of this project was to increase the throughput and usability of the prototype developed in Phase I.  This required increasing the number of proteins simultaneously detected from four to nine.  Work towards this goal involved reformulation of microdroplets to accommodate the increased multiplexing.  Additionally, PHASIQ?s initial product offering was improved to allow handling of up to 96 samples (compared to the prototype which could handle only 32).  This involved testing several geometric plate designs and materials though injection molding of polystyrene.  Additionally, a software program was developed to facilitate data analysis by users.  With this program, users are able to input plate images (taken during assay readout) and have a software routine automatically analyze the image, extract numerical values, and then export them into Microsoft Excel.  This greatly reduced the time needed by users to complete a typical experiment.  Work on these objectives yielded a 96-well plate kit for detection of multiple proteins in serum and plasma with an automated data analysis routine.\n\n \n\nFinal goals for this project were to use the developed protein test kit to identify protein biomarkers with relevance to cardiovascular disease.  Prior to use in this study, it was imperative that the protein analysis kits were tested for use with plasma and serum.  Typically, plasma and serum contain molecules that are known to interfere with protein analysis.  After several reformulation steps, PHASIQ kits were made to be compatible with these sample types.  In a collaborative effort with laboratories at the University of Michigan, PHASIQ kits were used to test actual disease plasma for proteins potentially involved in deep vein thrombosis.  This project culminated with the collection of data the suggested use of certain protein markers for deep vein thrombosis involvement.  Additional work will need to be performed to validate these results and conclude the use of these proteins for diagnostic use.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/05/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Dishinger"
