 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the S-STEM project, Supporting Undergraduates for Careers in Computing and Engineering with Scholarships and Supervision (SUCCESS), will be to expand the STEM pool by providing scholarships to academically talented and financially needy entering freshmen or transferring regional community college students into Engineering and Computer Science (ECS) at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi (TAMU-CC). Project objectives will be to recruit at least 21 students as SUCCESS Scholars with majors in engineering and computer science at TAMU-CC and retain 100% of these students through graduation. In terms of the broader impacts, many of the students will likely be from underrepresented groups (reflecting regional population demographics), thereby increasing the diversity of the nation's professional workforce in these critical fields. Some may also pursue doctoral degrees and serve as role models for future STEM students.  Texas ranks second nationally for Hispanics, who are 37% of its population, 60% in the region served by TAMU-CC; SUCCESS will be well-placed to bring Hispanics into ECS fields, where they are underrepresented. SUCCESS will recruit from regional high schools and community colleges with large Hispanic student populations.\r\n\r\nThe five-year project will be designed as a recruitment tool providing each SUCCESS Scholar up to four years of funding, which may be augmented by other scholarships and financial aid. The project will retain scholars through a learning-community cohort experience within an existing infrastructure of student services (mentoring, academic advising, research opportunities, career counseling, professional development)augmented by support services tailored for freshmen and transfer students. Retention strategies will incorporate experiences of other TAMU-CC S-STEM projects.  SUCCESS Scholars will be integrated into established student communities through participation in research, internships, mentoring, support activities, and campus professional organizations. SUCCESS evaluation strategies include both internal and external evaluations to determine programmatic adjustments (formative) to project strategies and summative information to determine the project's impact.",

There were 17 community college transfer students and 22 high school seniors recruited in the program. Among the 39 students. there were 13 women and 11 Hispanic students.&nbsp; Of the 39 students in the program, there were 23 students (59% of the total number of participants) from underrepresented groups including women. Each student was supported financially with a scholarship of $7,000 per year and was mentored, guided, and supported with curricular and co-curricular activities. Support services and activities included faculty-student mentoring, academic counselling, mid-term mentoring, general counseling, career counselling, participation in undergraduate research, and interacting with professionals. At least five of the 39 S-STEM participants also participated in NSF sponsored REU programs, in which one of them published an article in a journal and two of them published conference papers on their undergraduate research.In all, 29 students who continued in the S-STEM program successfully graduated, including all 17 community college transfer students. Among the ten students who could not or did not continue in the program, seven students could not maintain the required minimum GPA of 3.0, one student switched to a different STEM major, one student transferred to a different institution and continued in a STEM major, and one student dropped out from the institution after adversely affected by a natural disaster.&nbsp; Overall, the attrition rate was 18% (7 out of 39) due to low GPA. However, three of the seven dropout students from the S-STEM program graduated successfully from TAMUCC. Over the period of seven years of the project, 34 students graduated with a BS degree in engineering or computer science and one in some other STEM discipline, i.e., the graduate rate is about 87%, thereby increasing the pool and diversity of the nation&rsquo;s workforce in these critical engineering and computer science fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;Though not statistically significant, an overall improvement in the academic performance of the community college transfer students was observed as their final average GPA increased by 2%. In contrast, the performance of high school seniors recruited in the program showed a decline in overall final average GPA by 2%. Though not statistically significant, a decline of 3% in overall average GPA in academic performance in the Hispanic ethnic group was observed. In terms of gender, almost no change in academic performance was observed. Among the various support services and activities, midterm mentoring was found to be the most effective service for students at risk to keep them in the S-STEM program and the participation in undergraduate research was found to be the most beneficial for some students in securing employment in leading industry.A focus group study was conducted by an external evaluator. The focus group participants agreed that benefits of the S-STEM program fell in two categories, financial and motivational. The focus group participants said that the S-STEM scholarships gave them a sense of accomplishment, indicated to them that they were capable and that they could do more than they might otherwise have thought, and that the awards gave them motivation to attend classes, to stay &ldquo;on top of things; classes and grades,&rdquo; and that the GPA requirement motivated them to invest time and effort in meeting that standard. The most valuable aspect(s) of the S-STEM project, as stated by the focus group participants, are: 1) the ability to continue as an undergraduate student in engineering or computer science major, 2) the ability to work toward a degree without incurring debt or, at least, with a limited amount of debt, 3) the meetings held each semester at which participants were reminded of project commitments and opportunities that were before them, 4) the opportunities presented to meet faculty members, and 5) being encouraged by the S-STEM project leaders.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/26/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dulal&nbsp;Kar</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
