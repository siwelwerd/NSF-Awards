 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Istvan Z. Kiss of Saint Louis University to investigate complex, far-from-equilibrium charge transfer chemical reactions that take place on networks imposed by dynamic environments of electrochemical devices (e.g., sensors and batteries). The identification of organizing principles and experimental characterization of far-from-equilibrium systems have broad applications in physical, chemical, and biological systems. The investigation is relevant to needs of industrial applications of galvanic and electrolytic cells. The oscillatory electrochemical media test theories on synchronization and network dynamics that have importance in circadian rhythms and hypersynchronous neural discharges in epileptic seizures.  The project includes outreach activities aimed at middle school, high school and college students and the general public through the \"Nonlinear Corner,\" and conveys novel scientific notions of nonlinear science and the emergence of complex, intelligent behavior of abiotic systems.\r\n\r\n\tProfessor Istvan Kiss and his research group address three specific aims that are based on fundamental scientific problems in analytical chemistry utilizing multi-electrodes, design specifics of batteries and electrolysis cells, and energy distribution networks: (1) Test the hypothesis that emergent electrochemical networks in multi-electrode microfluidic flow cells can describe the complex dynamical phenomena, (2) explore self-organized spatio-temporal behavior in cathode-anode multi-electrodes, and (3) explore the pattern formation of electrochemical reactions that take place on a designed network facilitated by a resistance interface. The construction of versatile emergent and engineered networks provides a new geometrical space for the chemical reactions to take place. The extraction of network topology contributes to the establishment of Chemical Connectomics, the science of connected reactions in dynamic environments.",

To avoid catastrophic failure of battery operation (e.g., explosion), it is essential for the process to complete in a rather stable, uniform manner. However, electrochemical reactions in such operating environments tend to develop critical phenomena leading widely oscillating behavior in time and nonuniform discharges in space. The project explored the organizing principles of such so-called self-organized, emergent reactive properties of electrochemical reaction systems.</p>\n<p>Present approaches to solve these problems largely rely on construction of very complicated mathematical (partial differential) equations, and solving them with computers. However, even with the use of supercomputers, one cannot simulate every possible operation condition. Instead, we use nonlinear dynamics (a branch of mathematics and physics) to construct simplified models for the chemical system, and characterize the stability of the generated patterns. In this simplified model, the battery is composed of compartments (chemical reactions) with rather uniform properties, and the patterns occur by coupling between the compartments. Then, one can use the powerful graph theory of dynamical systems to predict the generic behavior of the system (e.g., explosion or stabilization of a given pattern).</p>\n<p>The approach was based on three complementary approaches. First, we constructed networks of electrochemical reactions, where the existence of fundamentally novel types of chemical pattern formation was confirmed. We have shown that the strict conditions for formation of stationary patterns formulated by Allen Turing for regular chemical systems (e.g, in Petri dish) are much more relaxed in tree networks; such tree networks can easily form domains of localized chemical reactivity. Similarly, with chemical reactions that generate oscillations, a pattern called 'chimera' state was observed. In this case, in a network composed of two modules of densely connected components, one module can show completely uniform, while the other rather desynchronized pattern. Formation of such structures in a simple chemical system attracts attention from other fields of physics and biology, for example, could provide a framework for understanding hemispheric sleep in marine animals and birds.</p>\n<p>Now that we have seen that networks play important role in chemical pattern formation, we posed the question of what type of network can occur in electrochemical devices? For this, we needed a mathematical technique, which after a test run, can analyse causality between units even if the presence of hundreds of compartment. We developed a new technique, ICON, with which the interactions among reacting sites can be precisely decoded, even for highly nonlinear chemical reactions with large heterogeneities. Such high fidelity prediction of the spatiotemporal pattern was not previously possible, e.g., with methods based on kinetic models, because of the inability to extract theoretical and experimental information on the origin of heterogeneities and the timing of the interactions between the regulated chemical reactions. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, we applied the experimental and modeling techniques in two practical examples. We built a lab-on-a-chip device, where complex chemical reactions can be investigated. Such devices with simple reactions are often used in sensors. Integration of complex reaction is a major challenge because the interaction of many different types of processes (e.g., chemical reactions, mass transfer, and potential drops in the electrolyte) can produce a plethora of unexpected behaviors. We managed to decrypt the interaction through the electrolyte, which showed a range of coupling (uni- or bi-directional, positive or negative), depending on the cell design. In a second example, we created a multi-electrode anode (electron generator) and a single-electrode cathode (electron consumer) system. By careful analysis, we showed that the system behaves similarly to the quorum sensing mechanism of bacteria colonies, which can sense its own cell density and generate a synchronize response of synchronized chemical activity above a critical value. The research projects trained 7 graduate and 3 undergraduate students. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project also involved a community engagement through the development of a 'Nonlinear Corner' at Saint Louis University. We hosted 5 high school students, who participated in developing demonstration experiments of chemical chaos. The experiments show that electrochemical cells can exhibit complex behavior, but we can use physics and mathematics to decrypt this complexity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Istvan&nbsp;Z&nbsp;Kiss</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1465013/1465013_10394554_1577649809720_fig_rot--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1465013/1465013_10394554_1577649809720_fig_rot--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Rotating wave patterns with a ring network.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1465013/1465013_10394554_1577649809720_fig_rot--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Rotating wave patterns with a ring network.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">All possible patterns recorded in experiments with a ring network.
