 "awd_abstract_narration": "To provide effective traffic congestion mitigation strategies, transportation agencies need to effectively design sensor networks to reliably estimate and predict traffic conditions across large transportation networks. The next generation traffic sensor network will offer large, diverse data streams not only from fixed traffic detectors, but also from many emerging active mobile traffic sensors such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, self-driving cars, and crowdsourced data sources from social sensors and transportation network companies. This new generation of agile sensors can provide a much richer but also increasingly complex traffic data environment. Moreover, crowdsourced data is generally uncontrolled, inaccurate and unreliable. This research focuses on new sensor design/control applications to transform the interconnection between travelers, sensors, data and transportation management systems. Methodologies developed in this research will help transportation agencies to efficiently deploy and integrate sensors with limited budgets and resources, identify links/nodes/areas in transportation networks with the weakest sensor coverage, and generate mitigation strategies based on observability measures. Field tests using active mobile sensors will demonstrate the feasibility of the system. Research outcomes will be integrated into teaching through various channels including curriculum development and teaching-oriented software tools that can contribute to the training of future transportation engineers.  The collaboration with a Historically Black College and University will help broaden participation of underrepresented student groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe objective of this research is to develop rigorous mathematical foundations and innovative algorithms to accurately quantify spatial observability of dynamic traffic states, optimize active mobile sensor locations, and mine information from crowdsourced data sources. The research team will first characterize analytical space-time distributions of different traffic states at both macroscopic and microscopic scales, and further develop time-geography-oriented optimization for quantifying spatial observability for dynamic networks. A new class of ubiquitous sensor network design problems is studied for the traffic state estimation stage, and the integration of the well-fused crowdsourced data with optimized fixed and active mobile sensor data is investigated under different levels of activity/penetration rates. Utilizing the structure of underlying dynamic transportation networks, this research aims to develop computationally efficient optimization algorithms to create a distributed and scalable computing framework, which can solve joint scheduling and routing problems of active mobile sensors to increase coverage and accuracy. The research team will develop generic measures of spatial network observability that can provide additional theoretical findings for general civil engineering systems such as earthquake impact detection, ground water pollution source identification, and critical infrastructure monitoring.",

This research will help transportation agencies to efficiently monitor traffic flow dynamics with limited budget and resources by using mobile and crowd sensors. It can also benefit transportation network companies for optimizing the deployment of mobile sensors to monitoring and providing traffic information. This research can also be extended to other civil infrastructure systems such as power grid systems to observe load dynamics using mobile and crowd sensors. The research outcomes have been integrated into teaching through various channels by curriculum development, teaching-oriented software tools, and real-world case studies that can contribute to the training of future transportation engineers.</p>\n<p>For example, daily high-frequency trajectory data (e.g., 0.1-second connected vehicle data) provide a promising foundation to improve the observability of travel demand dynamics. However, the raw trajectories are not always accurate and complete due to technical and privacy issues. This project proposes a data-driven optimization modeling framework to reconstruct the location-duration-path choices for the missing observations from the incomplete trajectories. By processing many-day raw trajectories, this project observes a set of historical choices of location-duration-path and identify missing observations in space and time dimensions. To demonstrate and validate the proposed models, the project uses a real-world connected vehicle dataset containing around 2,800 connected vehicles over two separate months in Southeast Michigan from the Safety Pilot Model Deployment (SPMD) project and a transportation network from OpenStreetMap.</p>\n<p>In addition, this project also explores to improve observability using smartphones. The existing efforts on studying human mobility and activity using location-based crowdsourced data mainly focus on obtaining the activity chain pattern in a region at an aggregate level. To observe individual dynamic choices of activity chains, this project presents a data-driven approach to estimating individual-specific activity chain set and corresponding choice probabilities for a given person over a 24-hour period using crowdsourced data from location-based service apps. This project detects an individual-specific stochastic activity set using a contextual-parcel data analysis. Based on the time geography theory, this project refines a space-time bicone concept to construct an activity-travel space-time-state network from the stochastic activity set. These space-time bicone constraints define a set of potential activity choices to reduce the search space of activity location and duration choices. This project constructs an activity state transition graph from the space-time-state network and calculate a Markov matrix for activity choice probabilities. Furthermore, it also calculates the probabilities of activity chain choices using the Markov matrix. It also visualizes individual-specific activity chain set in a space-time-state network to show the dynamic choices of individual daily mobility and activity. This project demonstrates the proposed approach through conducting numerical analyses using crowdsourced data from location-based service apps - Foursquare and Twitter to construct individual-specific activity choice sets and corresponding choice probabilities.</p>\n<p>Drones (unmanned aerial vehicles) are also mobile sensors that can help improve observability of dynamic traffic systems, especially at locations without fixed sensors during unexpected or short-term events. This project demonstrates the use of drones to monitor traffic flow dynamics via field data collection at rural arterials, freeways, weaving corridors, and signalized intersections. Michigan Department of Transportation shows the interest to explore the potential of using drones for their daily traffic operations. One example is to monitor freeway OD flows from on-ramps to off-ramps to observe travel demand dynamics in Michigan.</p>\n<p>This project also explores interdisciplinary collaboration with other civil infrastructure systems, such as the power systems. We have used human activity and electricity consumption data to establish the load dynamics model at building level in the power grid. Essentially, the consumption of electricity is related to human activities. This interdisciplinary research gives a new research direction of human activity and travel pattern collected by mobile and crowd sensors for interdependent civil infrastructure systems beyond the transportation systems.</p>\n<p>To integrate research into education, this project has developed two smartphone apps ? iPatts and Traffic Counter to use smartphones as mobile sensors in undergraduate and graduate classes. The iPatts app can collect individual person activity-travel data 24-hour over many days to improve observability of travel demand dynamics, which can be used to calibrate activity-travel demand models. The Traffic Counter app can collect intersection turn movement data at flexible time intervals at any intersections for multiple vehicle types, which improve the observability of traffic flow dynamics at intersections. Both two apps have been integrated with the curriculum at Michigan Tech over the past three years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/29/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
