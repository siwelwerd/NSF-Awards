PI: Guillermo Aguilar, University of California, Riverside (UCR)\r\n\r\nNon-Technical Abstract: \r\nThis award grant provides funding for the development of an international partnership for research and education between UCR - one of America's few research-intensive Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) - and three premier institutions in M\u00e9xico: Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y Educaci\u00f3n Superior de Ensenada (CICESE) in Ensenada; Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM) in Mexico City; and Instituto Nacional de Astrof\u00edsica, \u00d3ptica y Electr\u00f3nica (INAOE) in Puebla. SOMBRERO aims at further developing the concept of a transparent cranial implant made of nanocrystalline yttria-stabilized-zirconia (nc-YSZ) - the so called Windows to the Brain (WttB) platform - to replace portions of the skull and thus allow non-invasive optical interrogation of the brain facilitating the diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of brain pathologies and neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury and stroke.  Although a number of materials (e.g., titanium, alumina, acrylic, etc.) have been evaluated for use in cranial reconstruction, none provide the requisite combination of properties required for clinically-viable transparent implants. Our preliminary efforts have already demonstrated that nc-YSZ offers significant promise in this regard. Furthermore, the educational component of this award aims at jointly training students from the US and M\u00e9xico in line with various current education policy initiatives in both countries, including: a) the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) initiative, as well as the \"100,000 strong in the Americas\" initiative to increase study in Latin America and the Caribbean, among others in M\u00e9xico and within the UC system. SOMBRERO's innovations will provide a new neurotechnology platform that will eventually serve as a critical enabler for longitudinal studies of the brain, as well as the development of a host of emerging laser-based diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for neurological disorders. Concurrently, SOMBRERO will provide research opportunities to a diverse cadre of US students, preparing them to innovate as independent, globally engaged engineers. \r\n\r\nTechnical\r\nThis study encompasses international collaborative research between UCR and three premier institutions in M\u00e9xico: Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica y Educaci\u00f3n Superior de Ensenada (CICESE) in Ensenada; Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM) in Mexico City; and Instituto Nacional de Astrof\u00edsica, \u00d3ptica y Electr\u00f3nica (INAOE) in Puebla. So far, these collaborations have produced numerous advances in opto-ceramics. Particularly noteworthy is the recent report of the first transparent nanocrystalline yttria-stabilized-zirconia (nc-YSZ) cranial implants capable of replacing portions of the skull to allow non-invasive optical interrogation of the brain on an ongoing recurring basis, i.e. the Windows to the Brain (WttB) platform, which is the primary integrative technology goal of the project. The significance of SOMBRERO lies in the potential the WttB platform may eventually afford for: a) advancing understanding of the brain, by facilitating the clinical translation of emerging optogenetic neurotechnologies under development in the BRAIN Initiative; and b) facilitating the diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of brain pathologies and neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury and stroke.  Although a number of materials (e.g., titanium, alumina, acrylic, etc.) have been evaluated for use in cranial reconstruction, none provide the requisite combination of properties required for clinically-viable transparent implants. As such, this award proposes to take the next steps towards clinical translation of the WttB concept by advancing both our fundamental understanding and technological capabilities within this context. SOMBRERO's innovations will provide a new neurotechnology platform that will eventually serve as a critical enabler for longitudinal studies of the brain, as well as the development of a host of emerging laser-based diagnostic and therapeutic techniques for neurological disorders. The impact of SOMBRERO will lie in the unique capabilities it will provide to the neuroscience community, which will advance understanding and improve disease management, thus improving quality of life and reducing healthcare costs. Furthermore, the advances made in the science and technology of novel opto-ceramics will have potential to extend to numerous other fields, including medical lasers, defense, energy, etc. Finally, SOMBRERO will recruit UCR STEM students in multiple disciplines for training in both countries, and build upon UCR's strong record of minority undergraduate retention and graduate recruitment by leveraging well-established programs and student organizations, such as the California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP), UC Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degrees (UC LEADS), and the Society for Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE).",
