 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Space Sciences Laboratory at UC Berkeley seeks to increase the number of minority students in STEM careers through the establishment an NSF REU site to serve first-generation students from Minority Serving Institutions, in particular Community Colleges. The Advancing Space Science through Undergraduate Research Experiences (ASSURE) program will provide authentic research opportunities for first-generation students with limited or no access to STEM research opportunities. Students will work in a multi-tiered mentoring environment, with research mentors, coordinator mentors and peer mentors to conduct cutting edge research in the areas of space science and engineering. Topics students will explore research on include solar physics, planetary science, cosmochemistry, astronomy, space-instrument design and manufacturing, instrument calibration and orbital dynamics. \r\n\r\nThe National Research Council?s decadal survey of solar and space physics raised concerns about the number of scientists in this field of research.  Declining enrollments in relevant departments have led to a reduction in the availability of courses in solar and space physics which threatens the pipeline of future researchers in this field.  This REU Site will serve as a mechanism to encourage careers in solar and space physics, particularly among minority students.  Student participants will spend 10 weeks at SSL at UC-Berkeley where they will be provided research, leadership and role-modelling opportunities.  The students will gain professional role-models at SSL, and they themselves will become role models for the next generation of students by conducting outreach after their summer experiences.  SSL is suited to provide a unique REU experience, as SSL has the capacity to design, build, test, communicate with, and analyze data from satellites.  Participants will have continued mentoring after the summer program, and will be able to present their research results at the American Geophysical Union meeting.  The PI leading this program has been trained in, and has experience in the area of culturally sensitive science education and outreach.",
