 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Professor George Makhatadze of Rensselaer Polytechnic Instiute to investigate the role of various physical-chemical interactions in determining the pressure dependence of protein stability.  Pressure is an important environmental variable that plays an essential role in biological adaptation for many extremophilic organisms, called barophiles.  This research  project will rely upon the synergy between computer simulations and experiments.  Computer simulations will provide solid theoretical framework for the analysis of the volume changes upon protein unfolding.  Experiments will be performed to validate the computer simulations.  In particular, these workers will be testing a hypothesis that proteins from barophilic organisms have volumetric properties that allow them to remain folded, even at elevated hydrostatic pressure.  This project engages high school, undergraduate and graduate students in both computational and experimental aspects of the research in the laboratory.  In recruiting trainees, there will be a particular effort to engage women and/or members of underrepresented minorities.  The PI is also actively involved in curriculum development and serves as an undergraduate curriculum adviser for Biochemistry and Biophysics majors at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed work will provide a significant refinement of a protein stability model to incorporate temperature dependencies of volume changes by combining concepts of evolutionary biology with biochemical and biophysical tools such as nuclear magnetic resonance, differential scanning calorimetry as well as computational tools.  It is expected that the knowledge accumulated as a result of these experiments will lay the foundation to understand the factors that affect protein folding and stability under extreme conditions. In the longer term, it is hoped that the lessons learned here will provide biophysical chemists with new insights as they seek to design enzymes with that are both active and robust.  Broader scientific impacts in industrial biotechnology and in process chemsitry are anticipated, particularly as these scientists seek to develop robust biomaterials and replace current processes with next generation, environmentally friendly catalytic processes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHydrostatic pressure has a vital role in the biological adaptation of piezophiles, organisms that live under high hydrostatic pressure.  However, the mechanisms by which piezophiles are able to adapt their proteins to high hydrostatic pressure is not well understood.  This research project is aimed at understanding how proteins and enzymes from these organisms can withstand high hydrostatic pressure, and thus provides foundational insights into the molecular limits of life.  \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nIn this research we have performed in-depth multifaceted experimental and computational characterization of volume changes upon protein unfolding.  Using over 30 different proteins and many sequence variants for several of them, we characterized volumetric properties as a function temperature and protein sequence.  We also performed computational modeling of over 1,000 different proteins as part of comparative analysis of structural proteomes from piezophilic and non-piezophilic organisms.\n\nWe have characterized experimentally volumetric properties of proteins from piezophilic and non-piezophilic organisms for two protein families: acylphosphatase and thioredoxin.  Each group included examples from both thermophilic and psychrophilic organism.  Comparison showed that there is no difference in volume changes upon unfolding between piezophilic and non-piezophilic proteins independently whether they are from heat or cold adapted organisms.  In addition, we have performed computational analysis of volume changes of structural proteome that included at least 60 structures from each of the five classes of proteins (piezo-psychrophiles, psychrophiles, mesophiles, thermophiles and piezo-thermophiles). These data is also in agreement with experimental findings , i.e. modulation of volume changes upon unfolding is not part adaptation of proteins to high hydrostatic pressure.\n\nWe have characterized the molecular details of temperature dependence of volume changes (i.e. expansivity) upon protein unfolding using both experimental data and computational modeling.  To this end, we developed a thermodynamic model that describes the individual contributions to expansivity in the native and unfolded states, leading up to the calculation of the change in expansivity upon unfolding, i.e. the dependence of volume changes upon unfolding on temperature.  Comparison of the computed change in expansivity upon unfolding with experimentally measured values shows an excellent agreement supporting the validity of the model.  A comprehensive analysis of the temperature dependence of the volumetric components of proteins shows that the hydration volume is the primary component that defines expansivities of the native and unfolded states and void volume only contributes slightly to the folded state expansivity.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nWe developed a comprehensive thermodynamic formalism that provides in-depth analysis of the contribution of various molecular determinants to the volume changes upon protein unfolding.  General applicability of the formalism was tested using experimental data.  The underlying computational tool was incorporated into a web server for calculating volume of proteins from user-supplied three-dimensional coordinates.  The server is maintained by the PI?s institution and as of to date this webserver was well used by the scientific community (over 5,600 calculation were performed for the users all over the world).\n\nAn integral part of this research program is the enhancement of educational activities and an outreach to the community.  The research has been integrated into teaching curriculum at both undergraduate and graduate levels.  It also provided summer research opportunities to high school students most of which went on to college majoring in STEM disciplines.  The PI and his lab have also been actively involved in outreach to local urban community.  The PI developed a new undergraduate major \"Biotechnology and Health Economics\".  This unique major will provide students the combination of skills in complementary areas of biotechnology, sciences and economics that is increasingly in demand in industry and consulting.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/09/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: George I Makhatadze"
