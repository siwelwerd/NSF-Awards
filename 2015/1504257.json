 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project at the College of Engineering at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor will help to ensure that engineers continue to drive economic development and innovation by developing ways to measure and assess entrepreneurial ability in undergraduate engineering students. Continued innovation is central to national security and economic growth.  Simultaneously the professional context for the future engineer is changing. Graduates must be not only technically proficient, but also able to identify unmet needs, solve unfamiliar problems under time constraints, and adapt to an increasing rate of technological change.  Engineering graduates must be capable of serving as technological leaders in diverse circumstances ranging from small start-up companies to globally-dispersed corporations. In response to changing career needs, higher education institutions are reforming how they train engineers, and training in entrepreneurship is becoming more widespread in engineering education. This work will develop assessment materials that can be used to help define and assess entrepreneurial ability in engineering students as that ability is developed within engineering-based entrepreneurship programs. \r\n\r\nThis project will fill an important need in promoting increased entrepreneurial ability among engineering graduates. Traditional indicators of entrepreneurial ability are based on large-scale business outcomes such as success of start-up companies or ability to attract capital investment.  Engineering programs seeking to increase and develop the entrepreneurial ability of engineering students need methods to identify and assess entrepreneurial ability in the developmental stages in the context of technological innovation.  To help engineering entrepreneurship education bridge the gap between traditional business entrepreneurship education and the career needs of the 21st century engineer, this study will establish the fundamental concepts engineering students can gain from entrepreneurship education; generate outcome measures aligned with the goals of entrepreneurship education for engineers; conduct a pilot evaluation; and develop teaching assessment materials that can be used by engineering faculty. Work will be conducted through a collaboration between engineering faculty with entrepreneurial experience and education researchers. The results of this work will offer faculty and students a better understanding of the core skills and learning outcomes that can be expected from an engineering entrepreneurship curriculum.",

Our work examined the impact of the Lean LaunchPad curriculum and pedagogy on undergraduate students with regard to entrepreneurial self-efficacy (ESE), behavior, and knowledge such that faculty have the tools to measure student learning enrolled in such programs.      \n\nWe determined that students participating in Lean Launch curriculum demonstrate improvement in ESE pertaining to searching, planning, marshaling, and implementing finance constructs after completing the course.  We also found that there are significant gender differences for planning, marshaling and implementing-finance in the student pre-survey responses, with female students reporting lower entrepreneurial self-efficacy.  No significant gender differences were noted in students? post survey responses.  This indicated that while men and women show differences in entrepreneurial self-efficacy before enrolling in a Lean Launch class, both groups show increased entrepreneurial self-efficacy upon completion of the course.\n\nPrevious measures for assessing entrepreneurial knowledge in the context of the Lean LaunchPad curriculum are not available in the literature.  In exploring entrepreneurial knowledge outcomes, we found that while students adopt the language of the Lean Launch curriculum, ways in which they approach early state entrepreneurial problems does not significantly change after one class.  In addition, student responses are different from expert responses.  This suggests that while exposure to entrepreneurship education does impact student self-efficacy and students may understand the concepts, there is still room for knowledge development following a Lean Launch class.  This suggests that students may need more exposure to putting the Lean Launch curriculum into practice to impact student outcomes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Aileen Huang-Saad"
