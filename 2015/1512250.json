 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI:  Annaliese Franz\r\nProposal Number:  1512250\r\n\r\nMicroalgae are single-celled photosynthetic organisms that grow on atmospheric carbon dioxide, sunlight, and dissolved mineral nutrients.  Under the proper conditions, microalgae also produce fatty acids stored as lipids, which can be readily converted to biofuel such as biodiesel.  To reduce the costs of algal biofuel production processes and at the same time improve sustainable reuse of water, algae can be grown on dissolved mineral nutrients in various types of waste water.  However, the use of waste water as nutrient source may put stress on the growth and metabolism of the organism.  This project will study the possible link between oxidative stress and lipid production in industrially-relevant strains of microalgae using techniques of molecular biology.  The outcomes of the research may suggest ways to minimally treat waste water to make it more amenable for use in algal biofuel production.  The educational aspects of this project focus on mentoring middle school girls to stimulate their interest in science and engineering using bioenergy modules developed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this research is to characterize oxidative stress response and regulation of gene expression in industrially-relevant microalgae strains in order to identify improved conditions for coupling biofuel production with wastewater remediation.  The overall approach is to correlate relevant phenotypes with metabolomic and transcriptomic studies for lipid producing strains of microalgae to understand global metabolism and lipid pathway changes under conditions that promote oxidative stress response, including kinetic and concentration effects of treated cultures with a primary focus on algae cultivation in wastewater.  High lipid producing strains (P. tricornutum, C. sorokiniana and N. salina) will be selected for study based on their industrial and scientific relevance as well as availability of genomic information. The research plan has three objectives.  The first objective is to characterize oxidative stress response and regulation of gene expression in lipid producing microalgae, including kinetic and concentration effects for two scenarios - peroxide-induced lipid accumulation and cultivation on dairy wastewater.  The second objective is to evaluate application of antioxidants to improve oxidative stress tolerance in high-oil-producing microalgae.  Finally, the third objective is to evaluate effect of peroxide- and antioxidant treatment as variables to improve biomass and lipid production of microalgae cultured in wastewater. The education and outreach activities of this project focus on bioenergy topics, and are designed to broaden participation of women and under-represented students in STEM through existing programs at the University of California at Davis, particularly for middle school girls.  A bioenergy module focusing on renewable energy and environmental sustainability will be developed to help deliver these education and outreach programs.",

While algae biofuels may not be the \u2018silver bullet\u2019 to fix our energy problems, work like this has improved the commercial viability in the patchwork of a renewable energy future and help to address our current climate emergency.   Our results show that a simple and cost-effective treatment of microalgae can be employed to boost lipid production using industrially relevant diatoms as a model system. Our results also demonstrate the feasibility of growing microalgae on a flushed dairy manure source and increase our knowledge of how microalgae respond to cultivation on alternative nutrient sources. Demonstrating the value of microalgae culture on dairy wastewater sources may provide economic benefit to dairy farmers nation-wide.  Instead of being considered a waste product, diary wastewater could be utilized as a nutrient source for the algae biofuel industry.  The high throughput microplate algae culturing method we developed allows for a streamlined strain selection process that may be applicable to industry. We also discovered a novel method for the production and increased accumulation of valuable fatty acid products in microalgae that could have significant impact on the algae field by providing a valuable co-product to biofuel production. Results from proteomic analysis of P. tricornutum following treatment with harsh growth conditions similar can contribute to a better understanding of how microalgae respond to stress treatments that cause enhanced lipid accumulation.\n\nThis project has also contributed to the training, mentoring, and development of high school, undergraduate and graduate students as future scientists, educators, and policy makers, including women and under-represented minority groups.
