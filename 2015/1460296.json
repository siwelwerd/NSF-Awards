This workshop explores the expanding relationship between theoretical physics and pure mathematics, which now extends from quantum field theory in physics to number theory in mathematics, two fields which were traditionally considered to be far removed from each other.  The funds will allow researchers from U.S. institutions to participate in this cutting edge workshop.\r\n\r\nOver the past two decades, the newly discovered relations between Feynman integrals in quantum field theory and Grothendieck's theory of motives of algebraic varieties has become a topic of growing importance in theoretical and mathematical physics. The mathematical and physical theories have been developing along parallel tracks, and there is a pressing need to create more interaction between researchers from mathematics and physics working on these topics. This workshop will bring together researchers in both fields, and will focus on the following research directions:  1) Motives and periods in perturbative quantum field theory; 2) Amplitudes and super-Yang-Mills theory; 3) Algebraic structures in renormalization; and 4) Quantum field theory on noncommutative spacetimes.",
