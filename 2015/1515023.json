 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 57th Maize Genetics Conference (MGC) will be held at the Pheasant Run Resort, St. Charles, IL on March 12-15, 2015. This conference is not only an exciting scientific meeting but provides outstanding opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scientists to interact with outstanding scientists within and outside the maize community. The meeting actively emphasizes and supports the training of students and postdocs in developing their communication and interpersonal skills. The conference is unique in that it attempts to support the hotel and meal costs of all student attendees. Detailed efforts are planned to broaden the participation of women and members of groups under-represented in the sciences. The funding provided by NSF will broaden participation and help defray the costs of participation of students from the U.S. scientific community.\r\n\r\nThe Maize Genetics Conference assembles scientists from industry and academia to discuss the latest research developments on many areas encompassing maize genetics. The 2015 conference will feature four plenary speakers: Drs. Xuemei Chen (University of California-Riverside), Dirk Inze (Ghent University, Belgium), Shawn Kaeppler (University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Paula McSteen (University of Missouri). The core program will include approximately 35 18-minute talks by speakers selected from submitted abstracts, and two poster sessions.  In addition, there will be a plenary session to award the 2nd Barbara McClintock Prize for Plant Genetics and Genome Studies to recognize one of the most outstanding plant geneticists of the present era. In response to rapid developments in targeted endonuclease technologies, there will also be a special session on genome editing in maize using CRISPR/Cas-9 technologies.",

A special session was held to discuss genome editing technologies using the CRISPR/Cas-9 endonuclease and the significance of this approach for biotechnology applications in maize breeding and genetics. This conference grant supported minority and first-time undergraduate and graduate student participants. These participants received science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) professional development training by presenting their research as well as interacting with invited speakers and scientist-mentors during the conference. A total of sixty-six participants were supported at varying levels. These awards encouraged new collaborations between faculty and students at minority serving institutions with scientists at research universities classified as having very high research activity. Significant outcomes include new collaborations that resulted in a Department of Education grant proposal for increasing minority participation in maize genetics research as well as enabling minority students to identify graduate programs for STEM education.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/03/2015<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Andrew&nbsp;M&nbsp;Settles</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
