 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Earth's climate system has gone through major changes over time that serve as natural experiments to test our understanding of linkages and feedbacks that may come into play if the Earth continues to warm.  This project investigates patterns of climate change between the northern and southern hemispheres during the mid-Pliocene epoch (~3 to 4 million years ago) when the overall climate state was warmer than today. Critically, evidence suggests that the amount of ice on Antarctica was similar to today, but that there was little or no permanent ice on land in the northern hemisphere.  Most climate scientists have therefore supposed that climate change would focus on the region around the Antarctic.  Recent results by this research team suggest that instead, change initiated in the northern hemisphere propagated all the way southward, and actually determined the timing and amount of temperature change globally.  This project will use marine sediment cores widely distributed in the ocean to generate reconstructions of mid-Pliocene climate. A major emphasis is to link data and concepts of orbital-scale variability into international efforts to synthesize Pliocene data and modeling through the international PRISM (Pliocene Research, Interpretation and Synoptic Mapping ) program. Funding also supports research and mentoring of a postdoctoral researcher from a demographic underrepresented in geosciences.  \r\n\r\nThe chief intellectual merit of this research is to assemble for the first time an array of data sampled at adequate resolution and geographic range to test a new model of northern hemispheric pacing for dynamics of the period, and to cover the transition from this regime to the later \"41 kyr world\" of cyclic large-scale glaciation of the northern hemisphere. The research team will constrain the phasing of isotopic and temperature changes recorded in marine sediment cores by synchronizing paleoclimate proxy records to African and Asian monsoonal climate signals with a unique northern hemisphere precessional dependence, following the approach used successfully by Hilgen and colleagues to improve the Neogene time scale.  The results are expected lead to advances in the geochronology of late Pliocene time period, a fundamental aspect of paleoclimatic and paleobiological studies of the period. Proxy data that constrain past ocean surface temperatures and global ice volume will be analyzed at roughly 3,000-year resolution in laboratories at Brown University. The hypotheses to be tested in this proposal, especially a revised correlation of orbital forcing to Pliocene climatic features, are central to the PlioMIP (Pliocene Model Intercomparison Project) community, now focused on a time slice at 3.205 Ma and transient simulations between 3.3 and 2.8 Ma.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project tested a new hypothesis to explain patterns of climate change in the Pliocene Epoch (5.35-2.7 Myr ago) as seen in deep sea sediments.  This period of time makes for an interesting contrast to what we know about the more recent Pleistocene Epoch, when great ice sheets developed in the northern hemisphere periodically.  Most theories of these ice ages posit the central role of northern hemisphere ice sheets in dictating global climate change.  By venturing into the Pliocene, we investigated patterns of ocean temperature change that would have occurred without the influence of northern ice.  We carried out investigations at numerous deep sea locations drilled by international drilling expeditions. We estimated sea surface temperature changes using chemical measurements on compounds originally made by marine algae that encode temperature at the time the algae lived.  We aligned these records to time using stable isotopic measurements in the same sediments. \n\n \n\nOur work produced a number of surprises. We found that to first order, ocean temperatures oscillated synchronously in the Pliocene.  This finding was contrary to a previous supposition that without the coordinating role of northern hemisphere ice sheets, temperatures in the northern and southern hemispheres would vary in opposite directions in response to certain changes in the earth?s orbit (?precession?).  Furthermore, we found that the timing of Pliocene temperature changes was determined by summer heating in the northern hemisphere.  This was surprising, because all the polar ice was located in the summer hemisphere in the Pliocene. \n\n \n\nOur results therefore lead to the search for climatic mechanisms in the northern hemisphere separate from ice that can trigger global climate change.
