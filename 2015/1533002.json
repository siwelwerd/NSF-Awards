The first three International Conferences on Algorithmic Decision Theory (ADT 2009, 2011, 2013) brought together researchers and practitioners from diverse areas of computer science, economics, and operations research from around the globe. LPNMR is a forum for exchanging ideas on declarative logic programming, non-monotonic reasoning, and knowledge representation. The aim of the conference is to facilitate interactions between researchers and practitioners interested in the design, implementation and application of logic-based programming languages and database systems, and those who work in the area of knowledge representation and non-monotonic reasoning.  The Joint Doctoral Consortium will include presentations to and by students, and personal and small-group interactions with mentors.",
