 "awd_abstract_narration": "For decades the burning of fossil fuels created large amounts of acid rain that threatened the productivity, fertility, water quality, and biodiversity of Appalachian forests. More recently, government regulations have reduced the levels of acid rain and created an opportunity to assess the ability of these forests to recover from past damage. Assessing the impact of changes in acid deposition requires long-term measurements and experiments in order to detect trends and better understand how forests function under changing conditions.  Such long-term records and experiments are extremely rare.  This project focuses on a unique, long-term dataset and manipulative experiments at the Fernow Experimental Forest (FEF) in West Virginia.  The research will continue long-term measurements, some of which have been made continuously at FEF since 1951. It will also continue two complementary experimental manipulations: a whole-watershed acidification experiment that began in 1989, and a Long Term Soil Productivity experiment that began in 1996.  The unique data resulting from these experiments will significantly improve our understanding of the link between changes in air pollution and forest health in ways that inform public policy, enhance ecological theory, and improve forest management practices.\r\n\r\nData from this project will be used along with the Multiple Element Limitation (MEL) model and supplemental measurements to examine four questions about the impacts of acid and nitrogen deposition on forested watersheds: (1) Has a diminished biological demand for nitrate (a source of water pollution) contributed to enhanced nitrate losses?; (2) Are greater nitrate losses following nitrogen additions to a young forest due to something other than increased rates of nitrate production?; (3) Will chronic nitrogen addition and acidification diminish carbon storage in young forests?; and (4) Does enhanced nitrogen availability reduce the diversity of forest herbs and trees?  In addition, a significant amount of damage caused by Superstorm Sandy at the FEF created a unique opportunity to examine whether greater nitrogen availability causes forests to be more susceptible to damage by severe storm events.  This project will continue an internship program that trained 20 students during the last 5 years and a creative writing course designed to inspire a new generation of non-fiction writers by challenging them to learn about (and reflect on) the long-term studies at the FEF.  The writing course trained 18 students in the last 3 years and is part of the National Ecological Reflections Network.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the entire 5-year life of this award, this research advanced our understanding of how ?acid rain? affects soil fertility, water quality, and the diversity, growth and composition of vegetation in a forest in central Appalachia.\n\nCritical questions were examined using a unique combination of long-term measurements and long-term experimental manipulations at the Fernow Experimental Forest near Parsons, WV.\n\nMeasurements of rainfall and stream water collected over several decades clearly show that amendments to the Clean Air Act reduced rainfall acidity to a 50-year low. However, we have yet to clearly detect a corresponding recovery in the quality of stream water.  To better understand this delay, we used long-term measurements to exam how changes in the soil and vegetation might be related to stream water chemistry. Our findings suggest that changes in the composition of forest tree species ? especially an increase in sugar maple trees ? may have enhanced soil fertility in ways that will delay, or prevent, the complete return of stream water quality to ?baseline? levels.\nWhen we experimentally enhanced the acidification of forest soils - even as rainfall acidity declined ? we found that the nitrogen added mostly accumulated in the upper mineral soil (57%), with the remainder being stored in vegetation (14%) and leached into stream water (29%).  We also found that nitrogen fertilization altered plant carbon (C) allocation in ways that resulted in greater overall C storage in both vegetation and soil.  However, the greater extent of soil acidification may be reducing the growth and competitiveness of some individually important hardwood species at this location ? especially tulip poplar trees.\nThe continuation of existing acidification experiments also allowed us to determine whether chronic acidification can make a forest more, or less, susceptible to damage by severe storm events.  The answer we found is that it depends on the type of storm. More specifically, we found that experimental acidification increased the susceptibility of trees to damage by a strong windstorm in 2009 but reduced their susceptibility to damage by the heavy snowfall associated with Superstorm Sandy in 2012. \n\nBy helping other scientists continue their long-term measurements in experimentally acidified forests, our work has documented how changes in forest soils can alter the diversity of forest plants.  This is especially true for herb-layer plants which account for most of the plant diversity in forest ecosystems.  After 25 years of plant measurements, we have documented a 25% reduction in the number of herb-layer plant species that was accompanied by a 900% (9x) increase in the cover of blackberry plants.\n\nIn conducting this research, we have trained 10 undergraduates (7 women &amp; 3 men) during summer internships, and 3 doctoral students (1 women &amp; 2 men).  Two of the doctoral students have completed their degrees.  A third doctoral student will complete her degree in 2022.  In cooperation with the Department of English at WVU, this award supported the final year of a creative writing course entitled \"Writing Appalachian Ecology: Long-Term Reflections on Environmental Biology\" that, during its five years, has trained 42 students (21 women) - three of whom were military veterans - by challenging them to learn about (and reflect on) the long-term studies at the Fernow Experimental Forest. \n\nResults from research supported by this grant have been reported in 40 published scientific articles (http://www.as.wvu.edu/fernow/publications.html), 2 PhD dissertations, 2 MS theses, and have been presented at numerous scientific meetings. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William T Peterjohn"
