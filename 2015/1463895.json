Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts from June 7-12, 2015, and a preceding Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) from June 6-7. The GRS is a relatively new venue for this community, and provides a unique environment for early-career individuals including students, post-docs, and early career faculty to present and exchange state of the art ideas and results. NSF funds are requested in part to attract early career individuals to the GRS and GRC. \r\n\r\nThis year will focus on new research that explores the influence of interior processes on surface processes ranging from tectonics to volcanism to climate. Specific session topics include the dynamics of passive margins, connections between mantle processes and volcanism, deep earth volatile cycles, subduction dynamics, the origin of plate tectonics, the origin of shallow mantle seismic discontinuities, microscopic to macroscopic connections between rock rheology and large-scale tectonics, and the structure and evolution of the continental lithosphere.",
