Although the research has yielded significant advances in both understanding the underlying issues associated with cyber security and describing increasingly effective measures for securing information systems, only a small fraction of this insight has been transferred to fielded systems, government or commercial. Deficiency in the area of transferring technology to practice is a pressing issue in the U.S. today. \r\n\r\nThis Cyber Security Transition to Practice workshop seeks to identify means by which NSF can facilitate technology transfer at multiple points in the process: for the researcher, institution, funding agency, and investor.",

Access to a PI with TTP experience is vital to the success of a TTP project\n7. Offer strong incentives to PIs with previous TTP experience \n8. Build a PI TTP Pipeline for motivated young PIs to gain TTP experience\n9. PIs need access to significant datasets to be able to generate TTP-worthy products.\n10. PI training and familiarization is needed to create a culture of TTP among NSF funded projects\n11. Consider differences between NSF and TTP pipelines\n12. Some topics are naturally better suited to TTP than others and often depend on market demands.\n13. TTP  involves assuming risk\n14.
