 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award, from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) with additional support from the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) Programs, funds the acquisition of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) by Wake Forest University. The instrument is a powerful analytical tool to determine trace elements in samples from various sources. The instrumentation enables collaborative interdisciplinary research to elucidate the effects and roles of trace elements in diverse chemical, biological and environmental processes.  Because of its high sensitivity and multi-element capabilities, ICP-MS with microwave assisted digestion (MAD) is essential in fields from environmental science and policy to semiconductor and material sciences, food production, and biomedical industries. Use of the instrument is shared with Winthrop University and Winston-Salem State University for teaching and research.  It is employed in several outreach projects involving middle and high school students.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research especially in areas such as: (a) studying the availability of forage nutrients in grazing ecosystems; (b) using platinum complexes as therapeutics and cellular probes; (c) monitoring metals and phytoremediation across the Catawba watershed in the Charlotte, NC, region; (d) applying ICP-MS to the early diagnosis of osteoporosis; (e) studying the biogenesis and function of metalloenzymes in Gram-positive bacteria; and (f) carrying out standard dilution analysis for trace element determination in medicine formulations.",
