 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Northwest Nanotechnology Infrastructure (NWNI) as a NNCI site serves as the prime resource for nanotechnology researchers and engineers for a large geographical area from the Pacific Coast to Montana and from southern Oregon to the Canadian border and beyond. NWNI offers world-class facilities at the University of Washington (UW) in Seattle and Oregon State University (OSU) in Corvallis, complemented with unique capabilities at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a Department of Energy site, and the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. Anchored at the UW, this site provides critical workhorse tools, unique instruments and key educational support to a large and distributed user base with particular attention to the clean energy and biotechnology fields. The mission of NWNI consists of four core services that can be described by four M's: Make - Measure - Model - Mentor. The first three M's form the physical foundation and the fourth serves to coordinate educational efforts with broad impact beyond the scientific community. The physical infrastructure consists of the Washington Nanofabrication Facility (WNF, Seattle) and the Microproducts Breakthrough Institute (MBI, Corvallis) for making, the Molecular Analysis Facility (MAF, Seattle) and the Materials Synthesis & Characterization Facility (MaSC, Oregon) for measuring, and distributed computational resources for modeling in design and analysis. Mentoring is essential to NWNI. The site's integration with the region's vibrant biotech and startup community implies immense diversity in users. NWNI offers flexible access to its facilities, from comprehensive training of local users to operator-assisted tool access to remote execution of assignments. Whether novice or seasoned engineer or scientist, whether undergraduate, graduate, postdoc or community college student or teacher, all users are offered support for their entire nanotechnology project from initial design to final analysis.\r\n\r\nThe NWNI serves as a broad-based nanotechnology resource, though three principal research focus areas are highlighted in which the site will provide leadership: (i) Integrated Photonics, which aims at enabling large-scale photonic networks, which are expected to overcome current limits in speed and bandwidth of electronic circuits. Beyond information processing, the miniaturization and integration of photonics in medical devices is facilitating the development of new, minimally invasive health diagnostics; (ii) Advanced Energy Materials and Devices, which aims at providing the scientific and engineering basis for clean energy solutions, including the creation of better batteries or scalable and environmentally benign materials for solar power; and (iii) Bio-Nano Interfaces and Systems, which provides the infrastructure and expertise for inventing and demonstrating new devices for biomedical applications, enabling advances in protein modeling, drug delivery, sensors, bio-scaffolds and bioelectronics. NWNI features capabilities in materials and devices including quantum dots, super absorbers for solar cells and oxide-base transistors for flexible electronics for sensors and displays, resulting in comprehensive infrastructure and expertise in nanotechnology that is considered unique within the field. The site provides an array of educational activities geared towards a broad audience and designed to have a multiplier effect. Three signature residence programs are offered: (i) Educators-in-residence gain hands-on laboratory skills for use in teaching their K-12 classes; (ii) Entrepreneurs-in-residence, in coordination with UW Technology Transfer (CoMotion), work with nanotechnology inventors to explore start-up opportunities; and (iii) OSU Advantage connect businesses with faculty expertise, student talent and world-class NWNI facilities to assist in bringing ideas to market. In a collaboration with the University of British Columbia, online edX courses are supported that allow students across the country and around the world to build and test their own nanoscale photonic devices on multi-project wafers built with electron beam lithography at UW. Worldwide, UW participates in a network of 15 institutions in America, Asia and Europe that offer joint summer schools on nanotechnology for future global engineers.",

The mission of NNI, summarized as MAKE-MEASURE-MENTOR, emphasizes micro and nanofabrication, advanced characterization and workforce development. NNI builds upon a 30-year record of operating shared user facilities in microfabrication, nanotechnology, surface analysis, biomaterials and energy materials. Anchored at UW, NNI is a critical resource for nanotechnology researchers and engineers in the Pacific Northwest and beyond.</p>\n<p>NNI capabilities are complemented by the unique materials characterization capabilities available at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), a Department of Energy site located in eastern Washington State. NNI has helped support increasingly active collaborations between UW and PNNL, including recently-funded joint efforts in the science of making materials (Northwest Institute for Materials Physics, Chemistry and Technology, or NW-IMPACT); bio-inspired design and assembly for energy technology (Center for the Science of Synthesis Across Scales, or CSSAS); and nanomaterials (Molecular Engineering Materials Center, or MEM?C, an NSF ERC). NNI has also helped support collaborations between OSU and PNNL such as the Rapid Advancement in Process Intensification Deployment (RAPID) Manufacturing Institute, which seeks to improve energy efficiency in chemical processing. By leveraging collaborations with academic, government and industry partners, NNI streamlines and expands the breadth of equipment and expertise available to scientists with diverse research interests and needs.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit:</p>\n<p>The NNI site emphasizes three principal focus areas, which are aligned with major research efforts at UW and OSU: integrated photonics and quantum devices, advanced energy materials and devices, and bio-nano interfaces and systems.</p>\n<p>Principal Focus Area: Integrated Photonics and Quantum Devices</p>\n<p>This principal focus area is geared towards scalable photonic devices for cutting-edge optical communication, quantum hardware and quantum computing. Integrated photonics and quantum photonics have been core strengths at both the UW and OSU. The NNCI?s support of state-of-the-art nanofabrication facilities and staff expertise has been critical to sustaining current capabilities in photonics, and adding new tools to enable fabrication, integration of new materials, testing and modeling of next-generation devices and systems, from light-emitting devices to integrated photonics to quantum photonics.</p>\n<p>Principal Focus Area: Advanced Energy Materials and Devices</p>\n<p>This principal focus area is geared towards the development of better batteries and the integration of scalable, environmentally benign materials for solar power. NNI facilities have proven invaluable to enabling advanced research in next-generation energy materials, both in terms of publication output and in enabling further research funding to support advances in energy science. Areas of active research at NNI institutions include radiative efficiency limits of new solar cell materials, mixed ionic-electronic conductors for capacitors and batteries, and new quantum-cutting perovskite nanocrystals that enable more efficient spectral response of photovoltaics.</p>\n<p>Principal Focus Area: Bio-nano Interfaces and Systems</p>\n<p>This principal focus area spans a wide range of topics from drug delivery to diagnostic sensors and bio-scaffolds. One of the goals of the NNI site is to support transformative research with an emphasis on nanotechnology applications in the biomedical and life sciences. Leveraging NNCI-enabled resources, NNI investigators are pioneering cutting-edge advances in biosensors, drug delivery, bio-scaffolds, protein modeling, 3D systems and bioelectronics, among other areas.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts:</p>\n<p>Since NNI was formed in 2015, both UW and OSU have made significant investments in nanotechnology infrastructure including expansion and renovation of NNI facilities. The impacts of COVID-19 temporarily interrupted the considerable growth that NNI facilities have been experiencing under NNCI, however, activity has recovered to an all-time high in Year 6, with user hours 11% above the previous record set in Year 4. The UW user population of nearly 400 users as of March 2022 was not far below 2019's historic midterm maximum of 449 and well above the fewer than 200 users for the comparable period before NNCI began. The growth in users is also encouraging: across NNI, 95 new users were trained in the past 6 months, as compared to only 27 in the same time frame of Year 6.</p>\n<p>Since 2015, overall user activity as measured by revenue increased by roughly 65%, more than 1200 archival publications relied on NNI facilities, and education and outreach activities reached over 40,000 participants. NNI continues to play a key role in affirming the Pacific Northwest as a leader in nanotechnology research and innovation.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/07/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Karl&nbsp;F&nbsp;Bohringer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1542101/1542101_10397876_1665190175396_Han_SpringtimeinaFlexure-ZheyiHan-50--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1542101/1542101_10397876_1665190175396_Han_SpringtimeinaFlexure-ZheyiHan-50--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"MEMS flexure\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1542101/1542101_10397876_1665190175396_Han_SpringtimeinaFlexure-ZheyiHan-50--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"MEMS flexure\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The flexure backbones of an electrostatic micro-actuator for a miniature tunable lens consist of \"flower\"-patterned release holes.

By leveraging collaborations with academic, government and industry partners, NNI streamlines and expands the breadth of equipment and expertise available to scientists with diverse research interests and needs.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThe NNI site emphasizes three principal focus areas, which are aligned with major research efforts at UW and OSU: integrated photonics and quantum devices, advanced energy materials and devices, and bio-nano interfaces and systems.\n\nPrincipal Focus Area: Integrated Photonics and Quantum Devices\n\nThis principal focus area is geared towards scalable photonic devices for cutting-edge optical communication, quantum hardware and quantum computing. Integrated photonics and quantum photonics have been core strengths at both the UW and OSU. The NNCI?s support of state-of-the-art nanofabrication facilities and staff expertise has been critical to sustaining current capabilities in photonics, and adding new tools to enable fabrication, integration of new materials, testing and modeling of next-generation devices and systems, from light-emitting devices to integrated photonics to quantum photonics.\n\nPrincipal Focus Area: Advanced Energy Materials and Devices\n\nThis principal focus area is geared towards the development of better batteries and the integration of scalable, environmentally benign materials for solar power. NNI facilities have proven invaluable to enabling advanced research in next-generation energy materials, both in terms of publication output and in enabling further research funding to support advances in energy science. Areas of active research at NNI institutions include radiative efficiency limits of new solar cell materials, mixed ionic-electronic conductors for capacitors and batteries, and new quantum-cutting perovskite nanocrystals that enable more efficient spectral response of photovoltaics.\n\nPrincipal Focus Area: Bio-nano Interfaces and Systems\n\nThis principal focus area spans a wide range of topics from drug delivery to diagnostic sensors and bio-scaffolds. One of the goals of the NNI site is to support transformative research with an emphasis on nanotechnology applications in the biomedical and life sciences. Leveraging NNCI-enabled resources, NNI investigators are pioneering cutting-edge advances in biosensors, drug delivery, bio-scaffolds, protein modeling, 3D systems and bioelectronics, among other areas.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nSince NNI was formed in 2015, both UW and OSU have made significant investments in nanotechnology infrastructure including expansion and renovation of NNI facilities. The impacts of COVID-19 temporarily interrupted the considerable growth that NNI facilities have been experiencing under NNCI, however, activity has recovered to an all-time high in Year 6, with user hours 11% above the previous record set in Year 4. The UW user population of nearly 400 users as of March 2022 was not far below 2019's historic midterm maximum of 449 and well above the fewer than 200 users for the comparable period before NNCI began. The growth in users is also encouraging: across NNI, 95 new users were trained in the past 6 months, as compared to only 27 in the same time frame of Year 6.\n\nSince 2015, overall user activity as measured by revenue increased by roughly 65%, more than 1200 archival publications relied on NNI facilities, and education and outreach activities reached over 40,000 participants. NNI continues to play a key role in affirming the Pacific Northwest as a leader in nanotechnology research and innovation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/07/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karl F Bohringer"
