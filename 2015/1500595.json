 "awd_abstract_narration": "Linguists have increased efforts to collect authentic speech materials from endangered and little-studied languages to discover linguistic diversity. However, the challenge of transcribing these speech into written form to facilitate analysis is daunting. This is because of both the sheer quantity of digitally collected speech that needs to be transcribed and the difficulty of unpacking the sounds of spoken speech. \r\n\r\nLinguist Andreas Kathol and computer scientist Vikramjit Mitra of SRI international and linguist Jonathan D. Amith of Gettysburg College will team up to create software that can substantially reduce the language transcription bottleneck. Using as a test case Yoloxochitl Mixtec, an endangered language from the state of Guerrero, Mexico, the team will develop a software tool that will use previously transcribed Yoloxochitl Mixtec speech data to both train a new generation of native speakers in practical orthography and to develop automatic speech recognition software. The output of the recognition software will be used as preliminary transcription that native speakers will correct, as necessary, to create additional high-quality training data. This recursive method will create corpus of transcribed speech large enough so that software will be able to complete automatic transcription of newly collected speech materials. \r\n\r\nThe project will include the training of undergraduate and graduate students in software development and the analysis of the Yoloxochitl Mixtec sound system. The project will also train native speakers as documenters in an interactive fashion that systematically introduces them to the transcription conventions of their language. This software tool will help in establishing literacy in Yoloxochitl Mixtec among a broader base of speakers. \r\n\r\nThe results of this project will be available at the Archive of Indigenous Languages of Latin America (University of Texas, Austin), Kaipuleohone (University of Hawai'i Digital Language Archive), and at the Linguistic Data Consortium (University of Pennsylvania).",

Estimates vary of the number of extant languages, the rate of language disappearance and cultural loss, and even the meaning of cultural loss and language death (versus change and shift, as when an Indigenous language is increasingly impacted by colonial languages and cultures). Yet despite any nuances it appears certain that the majority of approximately 6,000-7,000 languages presently spoken will effectively disappear within this century. With this, the diversity of linguistic expression is diminished and the vast reservoir of human knowledge is impoverished.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Yet our ability to document endangered languages and cultures is inhibited by a \"transcription bottleneck\": hundreds of hours of high quality recordings can be produced in a short amount of time but take months to process. For example, in one week in Yoloxochitl, state of Guerrero, Mexico, Jonathan Amith, a project co-PI recorded 30 hours of conversation between a dozen native speakers. An excellent native speaker linguist, Rey Castillo Garc?a, would require close to a year to produce an archival quality transcription and translation of this material (Image 1: ELAN transcription, analysis, and translation). To address this issue researchers have looked to automatic speech recognition (ASR), the computer-generated production of a written transcription of an audio recording. This project has explored the possibility of achieving, with ASR, a high level of accuracy in the transcription of an endangered tonal language from west-central Mexico: Yoloxochitl Mixtec. This language was chosen because of its complex and challenging tonal system: It has 4 level tones (from low, marked by \"1\", to high, marked by \"4\"). As an example, ku1mi4 (low-high) is the word for the number '4'. One sequence of segments, , is associated with 30 distinct words represented by 25 distinct tonal patterns (e.g., na1ma4 'soap', na1ma42 'my soap', na1ma3 'to get changed', ,na1ma32 'I will get changed', 'na14ma32 'I will not get changed').</p>\n<p>The project's primary goal has been to address the \"transcription bottleneck\". This was accomplished in part by training, under the direction of co-PI Andreas Kathol, an HMM&nbsp;Kaldi&nbsp;chain model for YM speech recognition. The first attempts to automate the transcription process resulted in a word error rate (WER) of 30.1%. Sometimes a single character in a word would be mistaken, at other times an entire word not in the gold-standard reference was introduced by the computer. In still other cases, the computer failed to transcribe a word that was in the reference. All three scenarios (Substitution, Insertion, Deletion) count as a word error. By project end the WER had been reduced to 19%.</p>\n<p>A secondary goal has been to (1) TRAIN native speakers to write their language through a progression of increasingly challenging transcription tasks; (2) TEST native speakers on their success in learning as they progressed through increasingly difficult lessons; and (3) Allow users to ANNOTATE, or correct, a transcription proposed by the ASR algorithm. To accomplish all these tasks a TTA (Training, Testing, Annotation) tool was created at SRI and installed on a Chromebook (see attached images 2 to 5). The Training and Testing was evaluated with the participation of a native speaker, Esteban Guadalupe Sierra, who finished all lessons and then began to transcribe directly from audio. He has reached a level that is 97% in accord with the transcription of Rey Castillo Garcia, the expert native speaker linguist.</p>\n<p>A final goal was to implement ASR (along with the TTA tool) on Chromebook computers to be used in Yoloxochitl.

The speech signal would then be processed locally through the ASR system on the Chromebook and the transcription would be loaded into the TAA tool to be used in the Annotation mode. Then the original speaker would correct the computer generated transcription as best as possible. While there is little possibility that the speaker would properly mark tone, nasalization, and glottal stops, it is hoped that s/he would eliminate words that the ASR program mistakenly inserted or add words that the ASR program failed to transcribe.
