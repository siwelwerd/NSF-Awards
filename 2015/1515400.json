 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many mathematical models of physical reality, coherent structures are formed and maintained by a balance of competing influences.  On the one hand, focusing, concentration, or aggregation effects are typically produced by nonlinear mechanisms.  These effects are often counterbalanced by other processes that disperse, defocus, fragment, or spread things out in some way.  This proposal aims to develop several novel and useful mathematical tools for analyzing how such competing effects achieve dynamic balance.  The particular models of aggregation and dispersion to be studied arise specifically in studies of: animal ecology, crowd dynamics, shape matching, hydrodynamics, and mass transportation.  The mathematical lessons learned are expected to be fundamental, and contribute to a body of understanding that promises to be useful to researchers across a range of disciplines.  Further, the investigators plan to be substantially engaged in training and interacting with students and young researchers, at summer schools, lecture series, and disseminating results at conferences, workshops, and seminars.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research focuses on the study of dynamic behavior in four areas strongly motivated by applications and the theory of partial differential equations. The first area considers a fundamental coagulation-fragmentation model without detailed balance, coming from Niwa's scaling analysis of a large body of empirical data on fish school size in the mid-ocean. The second area will develop metrics and geodesics for crowd-configuration paths and related hydrodynamic problems for shape distances proposed by image analysts. The third area focuses on the long-time dynamics and gradient structure in a new model of nonlocal dispersion and nonlinear concentration, related to fixed-point equations for solitary wave profiles. The final area considers random sticky particle dynamics, seeking to build on recent advances in PDE theory that tie sticky particle dynamics to singular solutions of conservation laws, and on related progress for random shock clustering. Real-world applications include the fields of animal ecology, image analysis, fluid dynamics, and stochastic interacting particle systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe theme of research supported by this grant is to investigate mathematical models involving the competing effects of spreading and focusing.  Spreading behavior is typically linear---doubling input doubles output---while focusing is nonlinear. \n\nIn terms of intellectual merit, one of the principal results of this work concerns a method of comparing images using continuous deformations that mimic incompressible fluid flows.  Here, spreading corresponds to prohibiting compression of shapes, while focusing produces the fluid pressure arising during the motion.  We found that measuring the squared distance between images by minimizing path length leads mathematically to atomization of the fluid.  Our analysis thus identifies a close (and strange) relation between `least action' principles for fluid motion and so-called Wasserstein distance for image comparison.\n\nAnother part of this work relates to resource estimation issues in fisheries science.  The distribution of fish school sizes is observed to be highly unlike the (bell-shaped) normal distribution in statistics.  We studied a fundamental model of merging and splitting for animal group sizes, and (a) found its steady state distribution semi-explicitly, characterizing its shape as like a power law cut off by an exponential; and (b) showed that solutions converge dynamically in time to steady state.  This work provides a coherent mathematical explanation for the observed non-normal statistics.\n\nSome other topics that yielded interesting results concern: the mathematical formation of `Bose-Einstein condensates' in astrophysical models of photon scattering from distant parts of the universe; anomalous diffusive behavior of random walks in high-contrast media; and unexpected singularity formation in certain recently proposed models of shallow water wave dynamics.\n\nIn terms of broader impact, we expect that the results on animal group size will be of interest to workers in population ecology, fisheries science and allied fields, as well as workers in other areas of science that relate to merging-splitting phenomena in general.  The work on minimization principles for shape comparison may influence work in the theory of image processing and related fields possibly including machine learning.  The photon scattering model of Bose-Einstein condensation is used extensively in cosmology and astrophysics as an ingredient to understand the photon energy distribution from distant sources, and the insights gained by our analysis could be interesting to workers in those fields.  Shallow-water models are used to predict the dynamics of tsunamis and ocean waves, and our results promise to be relevant to investigators engaged with computational models of these phenomena. The project has facilitated PhD research completed by 3 graduate students (co-)supervised by the PI, collaboration with four postdoctoral researchers, and PhD research initiated by two further graduate students under the PI's supervision.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert L Pego"
