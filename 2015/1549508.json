 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the degree to which businesses at a local level are dependent on computers and the Internet for daily operations. Of those that are, the project investigates the degree to which they implement good or bad cybersecurity practices with an particular emphasis on very small businesses. Understanding their needs helps fill a knowledge gap within the cybersecurity industry and has local as well as national security and economic implications. In particular, knowledge gained will help identify cybersecurity gaps and needs, raise awareness of these gaps and needs, and make progress toward solving problems faced by existing and emerging threats. This in turn will help improve the national situation \"from the ground up\" by helping to make such establishments more secure in an era where they are increasingly being targeted by malicious actors who see this business demographic as a prime target for exploitation.\r\n\r\nThe project conducts interviews with key stakeholders and implements a survey of local businesses in El Paso County (Texas) to collect a mix of quantitative and qualitative data on relevant cybersecurity issues. Both technical and human factors related to cybersecurity are be addressed. The methodology for this project is designed to be applicable in other geographical areas (i.e. cities and counties) within the U.S. which allows for a comparison of results providing a perspective on the state of cybersecurity at different levels. Because the small business community is particularly difficult to contact, best practices are also identified for eliciting participation of business owners. To ensure adequate representation of this demographic, the survey is implemented using a mixed mode data collection methodology utilizing paper, telephone, web, and tablet computer based surveys (tablets are utilized for on-site contact of business owners). While cybersecurity is typically regarded as a national or state level issue, this project seeks to demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case. Establishing a secure and trustworthy cyberspace nationally will benefit by focusing on issues faced by local businesses and finding ways to address their needs.",

The final instrument consisted of 45 questions across 8 sections: Business Demographics; Technology; Cybersecurity Awareness; Basic Cybersecurity Practices &ndash; Technology and Information Security; Cybersecurity Incidents; Advanced Cybersecurity Practices - Malware Prevention; Advanced Cybersecurity Practices - User Education and Awareness; and Cybersecurity Budget.

Data was collected in real-time using Internet enabled mobile tablets interfacing with a web-based survey tool developed by the PI. The project has collected approximately 310 surveys where respondents answered at least one question. Of these, approximately 210 were fully or mostly completed. Of the 310, 196 respondents report having fewer than 10 employees and of these, 35 have reported having 0 employees, e.g. self-employed (see Image 1).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to survey responses, the project also collected over 6,600 survey technician comments that documented ther experiences with the data collection effort.

Cybersecurity research opportunities were provided for two students in both analysis (text mining and natural language processing) and general cybersecurity research. Both assistants (a psychology student and a computer science student) conducted analysis using the R programming language and SPSS. The computer science student improved his coding skills through hands on coding and through an application security training session. Overall, the project provided opportunities for seven students (one student assistant and 6 survey technicians) of underrepresented groups to increase their cybersecurity knowledge and skills as well as heighten their awareness of cybersecurity.
