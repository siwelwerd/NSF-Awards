 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) program, the Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) and EPSCoR programs, Northern Kentucky University (NKU) will acquire a scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy capability (SEM/EDX). A scanning electron microscope probes the surfaces of materials with a beam of electrons impinging on a sample. The resultant micrograph (picture) produced from the electrons scattering from the surface provides information on the structure and morphology of the material. The EDX accessory provides information on the elemental composition of the material. This provides insight on the microscopic and macroscopic properties and characteristics of a substance. This acquisition will provide training to students in the use of this important analytical tool. It will be used by students in the chemistry and biological sciences undergraduate research programs at NKU and by women and underrepresented high school students at Nanoscience Summer Camps. It will be employed in several laboratory courses providing training to large numbers of undergraduate students. \r\n\r\nThe award will be employed in research in areas including: a) development of a biocompatible drug delivery device; b) investigation of in-vivo local detection platforms to understand the metabolic pathway of thyroid hormones in relation to ancillary endocrine disorders; (c) investigation of fullerene-TM polymeric systems and their optical and physical properties; and (d) investigation of digestive physiology of embryonic anurans with the aim of carrying out microelectrode fabrication.",
