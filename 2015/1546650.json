 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our modern world relies more and more on mobile technologies capable of providing information access anywhere, anytime and to everyone. In the process of generation, transfer, retrieval and storage of information, one relies on materials that can sense the action of various stimuli which can then be converted into electric or magnetic signals. Furthermore, the mobility of the devices demands an increased miniaturization and multifunctionality where one device component can do more than one task. Such technological advancements are possible only with novel combinations of individual material properties so that is able to respond to a large variety of stimuli, such as electric, magnetic, thermal and photonic excitation and provides a no of degrees of freedom in the design of sensors, actuators and transducers. The proposed research is to prove the concept of a novel functional composite material that can respond to thermal, optical, electrical and magnetic stimuli. The findings gained from this project will contribute to the basic understanding of nanoscale physical phenomena, providing insights into the multifunctional composite materials, and would lead to a new generation of novel devices. The success of this project will impact nanotechnology education by exposing graduate students, especially minorities, to novel composites for multifunctional device applications. Overall this research plan will impact basic and applied nanoscience, contribute to the training of new scientists, and promote science education among underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nNew composite material comprising spin crossover and ferroic phases is a highly transformative approach that has not been previously considered by any research group. The proposed research is a high-risk and high payoff involving an interdisciplinary perspective covering novel materials and device engineering, molecular magnetism, and materials chemistry. The proposed novel composite material will provide an enhancement of direct or converse magnetoelectric coupling, and more importantly will respond to thermal and photonic stimuli. Thus, in view of the large volume change associated with the spin transition in a spin crossover coupled with magnetostrictive or piezoelectric materials, one can achieve a significant magnetoelectric coefficient. To achieve a maximum coupling between the spin crossover and ferroic phase, the core-shell will be piezoelectric or magnetostrictive phase on a core of spin crossover phase.  A combination of liquid deposition and template based methods will be used to fabricate ferroic nanoshells. The spin crossover phase will then be synthesized and integrated into the ferroic shells.  This 1-1 type geometry provides a maximum interfacial coupling between the two phases while having access to the large ferroelastic constituent of spin crossover. This opens a new efficient path for multifunctionality where, magnetization, polarization and strain can be changed simultaneously by light, temperature and applied magnetic and electric fields.",
