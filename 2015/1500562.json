 "awd_abstract_narration": "Automorphic forms are a basic yet intricate structure in modern mathematics.  Though historically they have been studied primarily by number theorists and representation theorists, they have connections to other branches of science.  This research explores a number of questions connecting different areas of mathematics and physics.  The project includes collaborative work with mathematical physicists that uses automorphic forms to describe corrections to general relativity that arise in string theory. \r\n\r\nOther projects include a detailed investigation of the square-integrability of certain Eisenstein residues (which has applications to the unitary dual problem), as well as a study of Eisenstein series on infinite-dimensional Kac-Moody group (in particular, the meromorphic continuation of their constant terms).  Another project concerns applications of Voronoi-style summation formulas to number theory, such as to subconvexity problems for automorphic L-functions. Finally, the Miatello-Wallach conjecture (that the moderate growth condition in the theory of automorphic forms is in fact redundant on higher rank groups) will also be a focus of the research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research project was in the area of automorphic forms, a mathematical topic of central interest in modern number theory as well as in applications to other areas of mathematics and beyond. \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nA main focus of the project was L-functions, which are infinite sums of the terms a(n)/ns, where a(1),a(2),a(3),... is a sequence of quantities of importance in number theory.  A fundamental question is when and where L-functions vanish, particularly at the point s=1/2 (where the value of the L-function is often related to other interesting mathematical quantities).  The project introduced new machinery to relate various L-functions at the point s=1/2 to each other.  In particular, the nonvanishing of some of these L-functions was established as a consequence by the PI together with Valentin Blomer and Xiaoqing Li. \n\nAnother question studied in the funded project concerns the Unitary Dual Problem, the major unsolved problem in the representation theory of real groups.  This question asks, loosely speaking, in what ways can the symmetries of an object be understood as acting by rotations.  The PI and Joseph Hundley proved certain representations of the lie group E8 are unitary.\n\nBroader Impact\n\nThe PI supervised the thesis research of 5 doctoral students at Rutgers University and mentored 3 others, as well as a postdoctoral researcher.  He also served as a the faculty advisor for the Rutgers' American Mathematical Society student chapter.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen D Miller"
