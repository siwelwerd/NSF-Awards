Many kinds of cells are capable of generating their own propulsion in liquids. In their natural habitats and in engineered systems, swimming cells have to navigate through complex microstructures in response to various chemical signals from food sources and other organisms. The investigators will use a combination of theory, numerical simulation, and experiments to examine the relative importance of fluid flows, boundary structures and chemical stimuli on the locomotion of individual cells and collections of cells. The results will be applicable to ecological processes and diverse technologies, including bioreactors, bioremediation, and preservation of clean water.  Local high-school students will be recruited to participate in the project.\r\n\r\nSwimming cells and synthetic self-propelled particles comprise an emerging class of active suspensions, whose transport properties can differ significantly from those of passive scalars and particulate flows.  The effects of suspension microstructure and flow on cell transport in porous media will be investigated for dilute and dense suspensions of various cells that span canonical swimming styles and body shapes.  Microfluidic devices will be designed to create well-controlled environments that simulate natural flow conditions and chemical gradients in a porous medium.  High-speed video microscopy of microbial suspensions will provide a statistical characterization of large cell ensembles as well as a mechanistic cell-scale view of the flagellar and hydrodynamic interactions mediating large-scale behaviors. The effects of porous media structure on the transport coefficients of chemotaxing cells in chemical gradients will also be examined. Continuum and particle-based models will be implemented numerically and results will be systematically validated against experiments to establish a quantitative, predictive framework for active cell transport in porous media flows.",

Swimming cells, including bacteria, sperm, and plankton, play essential roles in process ranging from biogeochemical cycles and the food web &nbsp;in the marine sediment and soil to engineering applications in enhanced oil recovery and bioreactors. Pathogenic bacteria spread disease through groundwater flows, and flow near confined surfaces can guide sperm motility for reproduction. Determining how swimming cells are transported porous media flows is paramount to understanding and controlling these important microbial processes. This collaborative research project aimed to elucidate the physical mechanisms that regulate the dispersal of &nbsp;swimming microorganisms through precise experiments leveraging microfluidic device technologies combined with numerical simulations and mathematical theory.</p>\n<p>Through video microscopy, direct observations of swimming bacteria in model microfluidic porous media flows revealed that cells become highly concentrated into complex, filamentous patterns. Theory and numerical simulations confirm that the observed cell density patterns are a results of the alignment of the elongated bacterial body shape to the fluid flow. In particular, regions of the flow that experience strong stretching incur high cell accumulation. In addition to driving the formation filamentous cell concentration patterns, the flow also strongly enhances the dispersal properties of the cells in direction of the flow. The coupling between fluid flow, cell shape, and self propulsion illustrates a stark difference between the well-established transport of passive particles versus actively swimming cells. These results may also be extended to unsteady turbulent flows, such as those found in the ocean, where predicting cell transport is both challenging and important to large-scale bio-oceanography modeling. The observed filamentous cell distributions may inform our understanding of microbial function in the human microbiome and in biofilm formation. Harnessing the novel properties of these microbial flows could also inspire new applications in water filtration and bioremediation.</p>\n<p>In contrast to the random swimming of microbes to explore their environment, directed motility enables swimming cells to navigate toward resources and favorable conditions using chemical, optical, and in some cases, magnetic field cues. However, self-propulsion competes with fluid flow in porous microbial habitats, which reduces the efficiency of cell navigation. Despite it&rsquo;s broad importance, how directed motility affects the self-transport and dispersion of microswimmers in flow through constricted pores remained unknown. Focusing on magnetotactic bacteria &ndash; which navigate porous sediments via alignment with Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field - in a model microfluidic porous medium, we showed that upstream swimming cells, directed by a magnetic field, are localized and strongly trapped at constrictions. Fluid flow and geometry conspire to cause three regimes of bacterial transport through a pore &ndash; in an analogy with electrical diodes - whereby cells swim upstream, become trapped at a pore, or are swept downstream. Trapping of directed swimmers is robust and persists in three-dimensional flow through a packed microfluidic bed, further demonstrating the relevance to realistic cell habitats. This dynamic phenomenon may provide an evolutionary advantage to cells through niche exploitation or augmented cell dispersal, and could also inspire novel control strategies for engineered, swimming micro-robots for targeted drug delivery applications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;Guasto</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1511340/1511340_10386633_1543572953071_2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1511340/1511340_10386633_1543572953071_2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Swimming bacteria concentrate into filamentous patter in porous media flow\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1511340/1511340_10386633_1543572953071_2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Swimming bacteria concentrate into filamentous patter in porous media flow\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Measured concentration of swimming bacteria in microfluidic porous media flows reveal complex filamentous patters that depend upon flow strength and topology.
