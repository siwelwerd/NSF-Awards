 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to understand the science of dynamic collaborative load manipulation using dynamically stable mobile robots (ballbots). The research conducted under this NSF grant is enhancing the ability of multiple ballbots to cooperatively perform dynamic manipulation and transportation of heavy loads through spatially constrained, unstructured environments, while providing critical safety through redundancy. This project will enable automation of strenuous load transportation/manipulation tasks, having the potential to reduce accidents and repetitive stress injuries.\r\n\r\nThe specific research aims are (a) dynamically feasible motion plans that transition hybrid dynamical modes, (b) feedback control for hybrid dynamic manipulation. The transformative nature of this research stems from its ability to generate theoretical advances in feedback control and dynamically feasible motion planning on multiple levels.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project has studied the problem of using a team of dynamically stable mobile robots, such as Ballbots, to cooperatively manipulate a payload.  This is an important and challenging problem and is representative of tasks workers do on factory floors, such as the task of aircraft assembly that requires workers to collaboratively manipulate and transport large panels, often requiring them to change their contact locations with the load for fine manipulation in constrained spaces.\n\nTowards this problem, we have created geometric dynamical models of the 3D Ballbot robotic system, a dynamical system that evolves on complex manifolds and has velocity constraints.  Our geometric models captures are singularity-free, valid globally, and are compact.  We have also constructed custom tools to automate the symbolic computation of equations of motion for dynamical systems that evolve on these complex manifolds.  We have shown that the ballbot is a partially differentially flat system enabling the planning of dynamically feasible motions in a computationally efficient manner.  We have created geometric controllers for the ballbot systems to track the orientation of the ballbot even in the presence of uncertainty.  We have formulated methods to achieve geometric linearization of the nonlinear dynamical models.  We have created geometric controllers that respect safety-critical constraints.  Some of these methods have been preliminary evaluated on aerial and legged robotic systems, wherein we have determined the minimum (and maximum) number of robotic agents needed to achieve a dynamic load carrying task.\n\nThis project has also enabled the training of multiple students at the PhD, MS, and undergraduate levels.  Several MS students and one undergraduate student have published papers as part of this project and are have gone on to pursue PhDs at various institutions.  The PI has provided lab tours for K-12 students and has presented guest lectures on spatial rotations to help visualize related mathematical concepts.  The research finding of our work has been disseminated through archival publications and conference presentations.  We have released open source code that automates the symbolic computation of dynamics on manifolds.  Our papers and associated videos of results are released online to further aid rapid dissemination.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Koushil Sreenath"
