These topics will be covered by twenty-two experts including representatives of underrepresented minorities. The conference offers a comprehensive opportunity for the exchange and cross-fertilization of ideas among both academic and industrial polymer scientists and engineers. The main program will be preceded the weekend before by a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) organized and run by post-docs and graduate students, at which they will present and discuss their work with their peers and benefit from a Panel discussion with experts. The postdocs and graduate students will subsequently attend the main conference.",
