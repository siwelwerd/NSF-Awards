The proposed research seeks to develop and understand novel sulfur-tolerant catalysts for the conversion of natural gas to gases used to synthesize liquid fuels and chemicals.  To this end, the work has potential to develop a simplified, efficient process for natural gas conversion without the need for expensive \"upstream\" desulfurization.  The researchers will also advance education and scientific awareness by involving undergraduate students in their research with an emphasis on minority, women, and first-generation students.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of natural gas are being produced from shale resources, providing opportunities to convert the gas to liquid fuels via reforming reactions.  This study reforms methane by reacting it with carbon dioxide, thus generating feedstocks for liquid fuels while reducing the atmospheric loading of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas).  A combination of experimental and theoretical tools will be used to design mixed metal oxide catalysts (combining transition metals and rare earth oxides) that are both sulfur tolerant and less prone to poisoning by coking than current catalysts.  Specifically, the work addresses the hypothesis that the mixed transition metal and rare earth oxide catalysts form stable and active oxysulfides under reaction conditions, with the benefit that the oxysulfides destabilize coke precursors.  Computational methods will be used to predict candidate oxysulfided catalyst materials that will then be synthesized, tested, and characterized, with results used to refine the theoretical predictions.  Beyond the direct research, the two PIs on this project have a strong track record of educational outreach at their respective institutions including involvement of undergraduates in their research programs and Dooley's work with the \"You be the Chemist Challenge\" of the Louisiana Chemical Education Foundation (focused on middle- and high-school students).",

It is a good indicator of catalyst behavior at higher conversions and partial pressures.  Following rapid screening, select catalysts were examined at longer times on stream.

Measured activation energies for the dry reforming reaction support the hypothesis that CO2 activation takes place at the oxide interface and is a kinetically significant step.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThe Ph.D. student (Changyi Jiang) on this project participated in writing two papers as first author.  He also participated in the Capitol Region \"You Be the Chemist Competition\"  for 3 years, preparing and coordinating demos related to emission and visible spectroscopy.  He coordinated the efforts of three other graduate students here.  The competition, organized through the Chemical Education Foundation, is designed to spark the interest of middle school students in the chemical sciences.  The regional and state (Louisiana) competitions are sponsored by LSU and the PI is the faculty coordinator for both.  Over 20 middle schoolers participate in the regional competition, and another 20 in the state competition, every year.\n\nReserves of natural gas continue to increase.  The catalytic reaction technology of CO2 reforming:\n\n CO2 + CH4 &rarr; 2 H2 + 2 CO\n\nwhich was investigated here provides a potential future pathway to both utilize the greenhouse gas CO2 and to further valorize methane.  The products can then be employed in well-known processes such as methanol synthesis and Fisher-Tropsch to upgrade CO and H2 to fuels.  There are reported pilot-scale plants testing this process with an eye toward commercialization.\n\nIn summary, the project advanced knowledge in the areas of: (a) high temperature hydrocarbon and CO2 reforming catalysis; (b) sulfur tolerance of reforming catalysts at high temperature reforming conditions; (c) understanding the surface and bulk structures of transition metal-doped rare earth oxide catalysts.  Results from this project have opened up avenues to design of superior catalysts of this type, including catalysts with better sulfur tolerance in CO2 reforming.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/12/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kerry M Dooley"
