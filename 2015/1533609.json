 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in STEM and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at Mississippi Valley State University seeks to build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-American students in STEM disciplines.  This project seeks to increase the number of undergraduate STEM majors being prepared to enter graduate school in a STEM field by focusing on mathematics preparation and to provide professional development to pre-service and in-service mathematics teachers. It is noteworthy that most students who enter the university come from secondary school systems where they have been taught mathematics by teachers who did not hold a mathematics or mathematics education degree. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the project are to: increase the number of STEM majors going to graduate school;  increase the mathematics content knowledge related to Common Core State Standards for Mississippi Delta area teachers using a collaborative team approach; and to prepare military veteran students to major in STEM disciplines.  The project strategies supporting these objectives are evidence-based. They include a support structure for students, undergraduate student research, curriculum development, teachers clinics, and a veterans' initiative. Seventy pre-service and in-service mathematics teachers are involved in professional development activities in the Teachers Teaching Teachers Clinics. The project is guided by an on-going evaluation, as well as internal and external advisory boards.  This project is co-funded by the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project aimed to increase the number of students who pursue graduate studies in STEM disciplines by infusing into the STEM undergraduate programs resources that aid in undergraduate students becoming graduate school ready.  Additionally, a focal point of the project was to provide support to active military students and military veterans who were pursuing an undergraduate degree that improved their chances of degree completion.  The final activity of the project provided support to schools and school districts in the Mississippi Delta by providing clinical experiences for teachers within those schools to improve their pedagogical skillset to teach mathematics with respect to the Mississippi College- and Career- Readiness Standards and strengthen their overall content knowledge of mathematics.\n\nThe results of this project reveal that more students pursuing undergraduate STEM degrees at MVSU applied to STEM graduate programs.  Also, different offices within the University maintained program components and expanded those components to include majors outside of STEM.  MVSU was recognized by the Department of Defense's Employer Support of Guard and Reserve (ESGR) as a veteran-friendly campus and for contributing to the national security, protecting liberty and freedom by supporting employee participation in America's National Guard and Reserve Force.  Additionally, results show that providing in-depth workshops for middle and high school teachers that focuses on not only the content knowledge but teaching strategies that work best for specific topic delivery enhance the teaching and learning environment for students and their teachers.  Teachers become more comfortable with the topics they teach and students become more confident in their abilities.  All teachers who completed the program showed growth in both content delivery and subject material. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/24/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lee Redmond"
