 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical description of the project that explains the significance and importance.\r\n\r\nThe concept of connectivity - how matter, energy, and organisms themselves are transferred among different parts of the Earth-surface system- is an emerging topic in the field of geomorphology.  Yet the means by which these different processes occur over the landscape has not been well documented.  This award supports the 47th annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium, entitled \"Connectivity in Geomorphology.\"  The symposium will bring together a strong and diverse group of leading experts and emerging scientists actively engaged in a variety of research into processes at the Earth's surface.  Six themes have been selected to explore how different aspects of the Earth are connected, such as rivers, hillslopes, and landscapes, and the contributors have been asked to discuss the importance of connectivity to the study of the critical zone, the area where most life on Earth exists. The broader implications of the symposium include the promotion and enhancement of the education of future science professionals, the fostering of diversity within the discipline, and the discussion of topics having relevance to society, such as landslides and river restoration.  The symposium will involve the participation of numerous students whose education will be correspondingly advanced.\r\n  \r\nTechnical description of the project\r\n\r\nThe 47th annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium, entitled \"Connectivity in Geomorphology\" will bring together a strong and diverse group of leading experts and emerging scientists actively engaged in connectivity within the critical zone. Six themes have been selected to represent different approaches to studying connectivity. The invited presenters have been asked to coordinate their presentations and papers so that the symposium and collection of papers will provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of connectivity by natural scientists. Connectivity themes to be emphasized during the meeting are: sediment; hydrologic; geochemical; riverine; landscape; and modeling of connectivity.The symposium provides a prominent forum for scientists to present, exchange, and disseminate methods, techniques, and results from geomorphic research to the global community. Because of its size and focus, the symposium offers an unrivalled opportunity to engage actively in discussion with a broad range of scientists linked not necessarily by a research focus but by a conceptual framework that emphasizes the importance of connectivity among different components of the critical zone. All invited oral and poster presentations will be published in the internationally-recognized journal Geomorphology, which ensures the effective transfer of technology to the global community.",
