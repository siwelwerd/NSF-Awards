 "awd_abstract_narration": "We often need to make collective decisions: who will represent us as president, where will we all go out for dinner tonight, who will receive the award, and so on. Similar problems are faced in multiagent systems in artificial intelligence. What are the best procedures for reaching such decisions? The agents could vote over the outcome, but what should the exact procedure be? This is studied in the theories of social choice and mechanism design, with the latter focusing particularly on agents that act strategically in their own self-interest. However, an ever-increasing amount of activity is moving online, and collective decision making is no exception. For example, we rate or vote on content, products, and people online. Key aspects of these novel applications are not present in the traditional models of social choice and mechanism design. For example, in an Internet-based mechanism, who gets to and who will participate? How can we know that a single agent is not participating multiple times? How can we allow agents to meaningfully participate when the number of voting events is potentially overwhelming? The proposed research aims to extend the traditional models to incorporate these aspects and to develop new algorithmic and other techniques to ensure outcomes are meaningful and increase economic efficiency and human welfare.\r\n\r\nIn many domains, multiple self-interested agents need to make a collective decision. The theory of social choice concerns how such collective decisions should be made. Closely related, the theory of mechanism design concerns how to design mechanisms for such problems that result in good outcomes even when agents behave strategically. In recent years, major progress has been made on understanding the computational aspects of both social choice and mechanism design. In the proposed research, the PI and his team set out to adapt these techniques to novel domains such as those enabled by the Internet or the availability of new data. For example, one key issue is the identity of the participating agents. In an Internet-based mechanism, who gets to and who will participate? How can we know that a single agent is not participating multiple times? The PI and his team aim to address such issues with techniques based on social network structure, as well as on the effort that agents expend participating. Another key issue is the possibility of agents strategically providing inaccurate data. Again, explicit modeling of the agents' effort costs in doing so will play a key role.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe theories of social choice and mechanism design concern how to make\ndecisions based on the preferences of multiple individuals (or agents), and\nprovide a useful framework for designing auctions, voting rules, matching\nmechanisms, etc., that are to be used by strategic agents.  Much progress\nhas been made on understanding the computational aspects of these theories\nin recent years.  The goal of this project has been to make further\nprogress along these lines, in particular where it concerns extending these\ntechniques to our modern world, where many mechanisms are run over the\nInternet and we may not have a good sense of each agent's identity, but on\nthe other hand there are many types of data available about the agents.\n\nThe techniques developed in this line of research have the potential to\nsignificantly improve existing, and introduce entirely new, online voting,\nrating, and auction mechanisms.  The resulting mechanisms could be more\nrobust to undesirable behavior such as participating under multiple\nidentities, make better use of existing data, and give users the right\nincentives to report relevant data.\n\nThe project has produced several major research outcomes.\n\nFirst, within computational social choice, we made significant progress on\nalgorithms for aggregating judgments about how entities or activities\ncompare quantitatively (\"Doing A is x times as bad as doing B\" where the\nvalue of x is the judgment).  We provided theoretical justification for a\nspecific rule and showed how to compute its outcomes efficiently.  Because\nit is not always reasonable to expect individuals to specify such judgments\ndirectly and completely, we also studied and showed how to aggregate\nresponses to simpler queries.\n\nSecond, we made fundamental contributions to the theory of algorithmic fair\nallocation and decision making.  Most of the existing literature focused on\nthe fair division of private goods.  We generalized many of these\ntechniques to settings with arbitrary decisions affecting many agents; to\nsettings where new decisions appear over time; and to settings where we\nneed to consider not only the fair treatment of individuals but also of\ngroups.\n\nThird, we made fundamental contributions to mechanism design approaches in\nmachine learning, specifically focusing on settings where we aim to\nclassify something, but the only access we have to data about it is from an\nentity that has an interest in the result of the classification, and\ntherefore will send us data only strategically.  We studied and\ncharacterized when we should ensure that that entity is incentivized to\nreport truthfully, how many samples are required, as well as computational\naspects.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/09/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Vincent Conitzer"
