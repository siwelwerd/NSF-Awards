The workshop is important in the education of such young scientists not only because of the lectures they listen to, but also because they can directly communicate with the more experienced scientists who are the lecturers.\r\n\r\nThe LRT Workshop is focused on methods and techniques to enhance and extend radiometric measurement techniques and rare event searches that could be limited in sensitivity due to the presence of interfering background radioactivity that is ubiquitous and/or naturally occurring. The workshop science topics include dark matter, solar neutrinos, double-beta decay, and long half-life phenomena.",
