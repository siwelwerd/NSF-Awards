It is expected that the award will further the faculty member's research capability, improve research and teaching at the institution, and involve undergraduate students in research experiences.  This project at Lincoln University in Missouri will investigate aspects and applications of computational audio signal processing, drawing from disciplines such as computer science, engineering, mathematics, and music, and will include undergraduate students in the research activities. Results from this work could have potential applications in areas such as improving hearing aids in noisy environments or automatic transcription of musical recordings.\r\n\r\nThe project at Lincoln University proposes to create an interdisciplinary research group in computational research on music and audio that will involve undergraduate students. Specific research aims are the detection of onsets and offsets in musical audio; sound source separation based on binary masking of time-frequency elements; and development of mathematical methods to quantify and decompose sound mixtures and components of sounds mixtures. An advisory committee has been established to guide the project, as well as facilitate the establishment of research collaborations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nComputational Research on Music &amp; Audio (CRoMA) was launched in 2015 with the support of the National Science Foundation through a Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) award.  The purpose of this project is to establish a research program at Lincoln University to study aspects and applications of computational audio signal processing.  The research program is modeled in-part on the Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Music, Media &amp; Technology (CIRMMT), housed at McGill University in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.  This effort has facilitated collaborations between students and faculty researchers across a wide array of disciplines (including computer science, engineering, mathematics, psychology, biology, and music) from over a dozen universities.\n\nUndergraduates have been intentionally involved in research activities.  Nineteen undergraduate students have participated in the project in through one-on-one mentoring with the PI, participation in a research seminar, and presentation at regional, national, and international conferences.  Additionally, one graduate student completed her master's thesis in this area under the PI's supervision.\n\nAn active area of research has been on acoustic monitoring of pollinators.  Bumble bees provide enormous benefit to the global ecology and economy, but relatively little is known about their behavior or how anthropogenically-driven events may be affecting their observed population declines.  The PI has developed methods to automatically detect the buzzing of bees from field recordings, including flight buzzes (the prevalence of which has been shown indicate pollination activity) and arrival and departure buzzes to/from a nest (providing information on foraging patterns).  This research has led to the publication of a journal manuscript and multiple conference papers, and it has also garnered additional funding (e.g., from the National Geographic Society).\n\nAn important innovation leading to the aforementioned success in acoustic monitoring systems is the concept of \"focal templates\".  An unsolved problem in computational auditory scene analysis (CASA) is how to implement attention to focus on sound sources of interest while ignoring other noise.  This approach has been used in the current work, and these focal templates hold promise for improved event detection and source source separation in other domains.\n\nAnother intriguing, related area of exploration is on automated detection of sound mass.  A \"sound mass\" may be defined as a perceptual grouping of sound that retains some element of multiplicity.  Sound mass has been intentionally used in musical composition, providing insight and a starting point for research into whether algorithms may be developed to \"perceive\", or group associated sound elements, in a manner similar to humans.  Work to model perception of sound mass in CASA is at an early stage, but further progress may yield additional benefits with respect to developing systems that can \"listen\" in a meaningful and useful way.\n\nThe project has succeeded in promoting CRoMA, providing enriching opportunities for students, and advancing the capacity of the PI to continue this and related research through established collaborations and partnerships.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/28/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Heise"
