 "awd_abstract_narration": "From January fifth through January ninth of 2015, ``A Conference on Algebraic, Topological and Enumerative Combinatorics\" will be held at the University of Miami in Coral Gables, Florida.  This conference will provide an opportunity for established experts and early career mathematicians to share ideas and results in the field of algebraic, enumerative and topological combinatorics.  Combinatorics is the study of discrete, usually finite, mathematical structures.  Examples of such structures are networks, such as the internet, phone systems and transportation systems.  While finite structures are in principle easy to understand through exhaustive examination, this becomes practically impossible once the structures become too large.  Thus more theoretical approaches are necessary.  Practitioners in the field bring to bear techniques from various areas of mathematics that involve abstraction beyond what one might expect given the nature of the problems at hand.\r\n\r\nThe conference will feature talks on topics at the forefront of current research in the field.  Among the likely topics of discussion both in talks and informal discussions are connections between combinatorics and various other areas, including algebraic geometry, topology, commutative algebra, representation theory and probability.  Further information on the conference can be found at the conference website\r\n\r\nhttp://www.math.miami.edu/~galloway/wachsfest.html",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGrant 1500820 supported a conference, held at the University of Miami in Corak Gables, Florida.  The conference ran from January 5 through January 9 of 2015. Funds were used to defray the travel and lodging expenses of conference speakers and young participants (graduate students and postdoctoral scholars).\n\nThe topic of the conference was algebraic, enumerative and topological combinatorics.  \n\nCombinatorics is the study of discrete, finite structures.  One example of such a structure is a graph, which consists of a set of \"vertices\" (which can be thought of as points) and a set of \"edges\" (which are pairs of vertices chosen arbitrarily from the set of vertices, and which can be thought of as segments connecting pairs of points).  While the definition of a graph is abstract but simple, graphs are of considerable interest in both pure and applied mathematics.  Indeed, any network occurring in the real world (such as the internet, or a system of flight paths and airports) cna be modeled with a graph.  Thus abstract theorems about graphs can be brought to bear on real world problems.\n\nMany problems of techniques from combinatorics are of interest to pure mathematicians due to their connections with other areas of mathematics. Mathematicians use discrete objects to model geometric figures.  Topological combinatorics is, roughly, the study of such models.  \n\nOne common problem in combinatorics is to \"enumerate\" (i.e., count) all discrete structures of a certain type and size.  For example, a combinatorialist might want to know how many ways one can list the integers from 1 to n so that each number in an odd position is larger than its successor and each number in an even position is smaller than its successor.  For example, when n=4, the only such lists are (2,1,4,3), (3,1,4,2), (4,1,3,2), (3,2,4,1) and (4,2,3,1).  Thus of the 24 possible lists, five have the desired property.  Of course, one can get the answer in this case by examining all 24 lists.  What happens when n=1,000?  There are so many possible lists that even the fastest computers cannot examine all of them in any reasonable amount of time.  However, combinatorialists have developed techniques to attack problems such as this one for arbitrary n.  These techniques often involve the use of abstract algebra, another area of pure mathematics.  Let me mention that, although the problem just presented might seem to be of little interest to nonmathematicians, the study of orderings of lists in general is of great interest in computer science, as \"sorting\" problems are ubiquitous.\n\nHaving introduced the subject in a manner that I hope is accessible to the reader, I will discuss the conference.  As is the case for most mathematics conferences, the purpose of this one was to allow specialists in the topic to gather, report on their work in invited lectures and, if they wish, meet in small groups to discuss interesting recent developments and future directions.\n\nThe conference was a success.  There were 48 registered participants and some additional nonregistered attendees, mostly local faculty members and students. The conference featured 22 invited lectures by experts in the field, including several of the most prominent practioners in the world.  These talks were well presented and well received.  There was sufficient time for participants to meet in small groups to discuss problems posed in the talks and other interesting material.\n\nAmong the 48 registered participants were 11 graduate students, four postdoctoral scholars and two additional early-career mathematicians currently holding temporary positions.  Thus the conference provided young mathematicians the opportunity to hear leading experts present their work, and to meet these experts in informal settings to discuss topics of common interest. This is important for the continued success of the field.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Shareshian"
