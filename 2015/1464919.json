 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2015 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and Seminar (GRS) on Plant Lipids: Structure, Metabolism, and Function play critical roles in communicating novel concepts and approaches in plant lipids, as well as fostering the development of younger scientists. The goal of this project is to support U.S. postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and early career scientists to attend these meetings. Interactions throughout both conferences will stimulate new research directions and collaborations to advance fundamental research on plant lipids. As such, this project enhances U.S. competitiveness in basic science research that is relevant to major issues such as energy independence and maintenance of food production.\r\nThe meetings, to be held January 31 through February 6, 2015 at the Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Texas, will advance the field by introducing new emerging paradigms not present two years ago, including advances in understanding animal cholesterol and phosphoinositide signaling, genome-wide association approaches in maize, and engineering of algal lipid composition. New approaches to stimulate critical discussion will also be deployed, including a focus on integration of knowledge and approaches between metabolism and lipid signaling. Fifteen talks have been selected from submitted abstracts which will enhance discussion on novel technologies like metabolic flux modeling, and exposure for early career scientists. In addition, the GRS will offer a concentrated opportunity for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to network and present their work. The GRS will include four dedicated meeting mentors that will allow participants opportunities for formal and informal conversations. In addition, two other scientists will provide stimulating presentations on both scientific and writing issues. Lunch table mentoring sessions also seek to actively engage students with established investigators to ask questions. The broader impacts of this project include increasing diversity in science by providing speaking and leadership opportunities to women and under-represented groups. As well, this project will ensure participation of students and postdoctoral trainees who present their research at the GRC and GRS. This opportunity for young researchers should aid in their retention and success in scientific endeavors, providing long-term benefit to society.",
