  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA fundamental and hard problem in the Elliott classification program is the classification of (nuclear) C*-algebras with finitely many ideals.   Within this class, the class of graph C*-algebras with finitely many ideals is a key case.  This large class has historically deep connections with symbolic dynamics, and utilizes deep tools from K-theory, homology, dynamical systems, combinatorics, ring theory and other places.    \n\nThis conference consisted of 5 lectures by the principal speaker Soren Eilers, an internationally reknown leading researcher in the subject.  The lectures were accessible to a wide audience, starting from the fundamentals and leading to cutting edge research problems.  A number of other speakers gave talks which supplemented the lectures of the principal speaker and explored the wide scope of this large, multidisciplinary subject.   Ample time was provided for the participants and speakers to meet and interact with each other.  A permanent conference website contains the lecture notes and slides of the speakers. \n\nThe conference was a great success.  There were a large number of participants.  There was a good mixture of  experts and nonexperts. A significant number of participants and speakers were young people and members of underrepresented groups.  Many participants commented that they learned a lot from the lectures and meeting new people, and benefitted from the resources available including those from the conference website.\n\nMany new collaborations and research projects were initiated.  In fact, major research breakthroughs were stimulated by this conference, including the classification of all Cuntz--Krieger algebras and the solution of a fundamental question in Leavitt path algebras.\n\nThis conference is also supposed to be the first  of what is hoped to be a series of collaborations among researchers in the region.  Our partners at the University of Houston are now setting things up for a similar conference to be held at the University of Houston in the near future.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/23/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ping Wong Ng"
