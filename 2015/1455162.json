 "awd_abstract_narration": "CAREER: Control of Surface Reactivity for Catalyzing Hydrocarbon Formation from CO2 \r\n\r\nScientific studies have predicted that converting carbon dioxide to fuels and chemical feedstocks, or using them directly as solvents, has the potential to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emission by 4,000,000,000 tons per year.  Electrochemical synthesis is amongst the most promising chemical process for CO2 conversion, since the technology can be readily added to our existing industrial infrastructure without major disruptions.  An economically-relevant electrocatalyst has certain requirements to be effective.  It must possess high current densities, low specific electricity consumption, high selectivity, and a sustained electrode lifetime.  Currently no electrocatalyst for carbon dioxide conversion meets all of these requirements.  The carefully designed surface structures under investigation in this the project can help understand these catalyst limitations through a systematic investigation of the relationship between the surface structure and the electrocatalytic reactivity.  Integrated with the research activities are a series of educational and outreach efforts that build upon existing infrastructure at The Ohio State University (OSU).  A research-intensive undergraduate laboratory module in electrocatalysis is being developed as part of the OSU Research Experience to Enhance Learning (REEL) program.  Professor Co and members of her group also participate in outreach activities to increase interest of underrepresented groups in science and to engage the public through OSU's STEAM Factory.\r\n\r\nWith this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Anne Co of The Ohio State University in the systematic investigation of the electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide to hydrocarbons.  A series of highly-controlled surfaces, designed to promote adsorption of specific intermediates, are being produced by underpotential deposition of strained copper monolayers and by porous copper-based bimetallic films, in designs chosen to facilitate the selective formation of C-H and C-C bonds.  A combination of electrochemical and in situ spectroscopic measurements, complemented by theoretical modelling, are used to elucidate the mechanistic pathways and the chemical environments around the active center under electrochemical reaction conditions.  The knowledge gained from the investigation of surface structure and reactivity relationships in this project has direct impact on the general understanding of surface electrocatalytic processes, and in the specific reaction of CO2 electroreduction.",
