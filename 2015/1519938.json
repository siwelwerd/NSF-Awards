 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to enable the creation of new consumer products that incorporate tactile fingertip sensing and tactile fingertip display, thereby bridging the digital divide and having a positive impact on society. One application is touch-enabled content sharing, which will let users download and feel objects that are beyond the reach of most people, such as a stone from the moon or a newborn lion cub. The envisioned technology will also have immediate relevance for consumers by enabling a richer e-commerce experience, where buyers not only see but also can touch what they plan to purchase. Other likely commercial impacts are to improve gaming and virtual reality systems, to add interpersonal touch communication to video chat applications, and to capture and analyze surface properties for industrial applications such as remote materials characterization and product inspection.  This project will also provide insights on how currently available consumer electronic components can be used to enable next-generation computer interfaces and wearable tactile devices that enable unhindered use of the human finger.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project aims to enable high quality tactile communication between two human beings across time and distance, essentially to make it possible to feel what another person is touching across the digital divide. The research team will address the essential questions of (1) how to record what the fingertip feels when touching a broad range of surfaces and (2) how to convincingly replicate these diverse tactile sensations for another individual to feel. The intellectual merit of this project lies with the strong research team and the focus on next generation haptic technologies that combine several different tactile input data types and output modalities, rather than just a single sensation type.  Specific contributions of this work will include the design of a wearable sending unit that accurately captures the broad-bandwidth experience of natural touch-based interactions with real object surfaces and the design of a stationary receiving unit that re-creates these sensations at the fingertip of another person. Determining the efficacy of this approach will improve society?s understanding of the way in which humans process certain types of tactile signals and will advance scientific knowledge of human tactile interactions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTactai Inc., (www.tactai.com),  NSF SBIR Phase I project research successfully proves that our Touch device can enable users to touch and feel virtual objects with life-like realism.  We have demonstrated that it is possible to introduce the missing sense of natural touch to the digital world with a compact wearable device, rendering realistic tactile sensations in Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality to provide a compelling and immersive user experience.\n\nWe have created a promising fingertip-wearable system that allows an AR/VR user to\n\n&middot;         See three-dimensional virtual objects\n&middot;         Move his or her hand freely in a large volume\n&middot;         Touch virtual objects with one fingertip\n&middot;         Feel realistic touch responses at the fingertip\n\n\nCreating this prototype has given us experience in the types of actuator technologies and mechanisms that we need to pursue, as well as the software algorithms that are required, so that we can develop a commercial product that would prove useful and is highly desired by our customers.\n\nThe  intellectual  merit  of  this  project  lies  in  applying  recent  cutting-edge  research results to enhance  virtual reality, a goal that the U.S. National Academy of Engineering (NAE) identified as  a  Grand  Challenge  of  Engineering  in  2008. Compared  to  most  other  systems,  designing  tactile feedback for AR/VR is particularly challenging because the mechanical device, electrical circuitry, signal processing, and software computations all interact and strongly affect the quality of the user's experience. \n\nFinding  a  solution  with  low  complexity  but  high  functionality  is  challenging.    Our  approach  leverages scientific knowledge about the sense of touch and incorporates careful design choices to create low-cost hardware and software that can deliver high-quality tactile experiences for the consumer AR/VR market.\n\nThe broader impacts of this project stem from the widespread impact VR and AR are expected  to  have  on  human-computer  interaction.    As  evidenced  by  the  proliferation  of  low-cost  head-mounted  displays  and  motion  tracking  systems,  three-dimensional  interaction  technologies  will  likely revolutionize  the  way  in  which  people  interact  with  computers, media,  and  each  other.\n\nEndowing  such interfaces with high-fidelity tactile feedback will vastly raise the realism such systems can achieve, making games   more   fun, online   interactions   more   effective, and tools   more   efficient.   Inventing   and commercializing novel interactive technology that you can feel with your own hands also has the potential to  help  inspire  a  diverse  array  of young  people  to  pursue a  career  in  science,  technology,  engineering, and math (STEM), areas that are critical to our country's future.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/14/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven D Domenikos"
