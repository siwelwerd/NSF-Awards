 "awd_abstract_narration": "On April 25, 2015, a devastating M=7.8 earthquake occurred approximately 80 km to the northwest of the Nepalese capital of Kathmandu.  At the location of this earthquake the India plate is converging with Eurasia driving the uplift of the Himalayan mountain range.  This  RAPID award will enable the expansion and updating of a planned television documentary  (The Himalaya Connection) about earth science research in Nepal, Bangladesh, India, and Mongolia from a half-hour to a one-hour show, in order to incorporate the Nepal earthquake and the lessons learned for making the region safer from natural hazards.\r\n\r\nThe earthquake?s occurrence provides a rare educational opportunity to increase the impact of new scientific information about earth processes while the disaster remains fresh in the global public consciousness. Using footage of scientists doing field research and related landscape, cultural scenes, and interviews filmed over the past several years under several NSF-funded projects, the producers will build on the opening created by the earthquake and its aftermath to incorporate lessons learned from this event into a deeper understanding of the forces at work and their wider impact on the region, and the scientific research behind this knowledge. Because The Himalaya Connection was already in post production, the film can be revised and completed fairly quickly and distributed soon enough to take advantage of the recent information about Nepal that has been so widespread in the global media. The documentary?s primary audience is television viewers watching PBS in North America; the film will also be distributed for international broadcast. The filmmakers are Doug Prose and Diane LaMacchia of Earth Images Foundation, award-winning producers of earth science television documentaries. Activities under this RAPID project will involve post-production, mastering, and distribution of the documentary.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:  This project was an NSF-funded effort to enhance the impact of a television documentary, The Himalaya Connection, by increasing its planned length to one hour and incorporating new footage shot in Nepal, Bhutan, and Tibet.  The Himalaya Connection tells the story of the extremely active geologic processes that built the Himalaya Mountains and surrounding lands in the countries of Nepal, Bhutan, India, Bangladesh, China (Tibet), Pakistan, and India.  It features new scientific research that enables scientists to better predict when and where future big earthquakes will strike the region, and it also looks at preparations to make people safer in this densely-populated part of the world.  The deadly magnitude 7.8 Gorkha earthquake that struck Nepal in 2015 confirmed key scientific concepts and predictions about seismic activity in the Himalayas and inspired greater research efforts; ultimately those efforts uncovered a previously-unknown and major seismic threat to some 140 million people in the wider region.  There was an urgent need to relay this information to the public rapidly, via the documentary and companion educational products, such as short videos, classroom materials, and magazine articles, which were produced simultaneously under a separate NSF award, so that people could better understand and prepare for potential hazards.\n\nBroader impacts: The Himalaya Connection is an outreach and education product that is widely accessible as a television program.  It explores the latest scientific insights into the potent geologic hazards in a highly-populated region.  The documentary reached a large audience in the United States in its first month of broadcast in 2018, when it was broadcast on nearly 1,000 PBS stations, and it will continue to be broadcast for several years in the USA on PBS, and abroad on international stations, significantly raising awareness of the hazards and the importance of scientific research in areas that are highly susceptible to them.  Millions of people remain at risk from the tectonically-induced hazards of earthquakes, landslides, and flooding in the region featured in The Himalaya Connection.  Scientists and safety experts in that region report to us that this documentary and companion educational products are of great value to the public there, because few sources of accurate, accessible information on this critical topic exist.  These educational products are also being used by experts to educate lawmakers and safety officials, and in at least one metropolitan area in the region, their use, combined with other outreach and educational activities, have led to the creation of building codes that require new buildings to be strengthened to resist earth movements caused by earthquakes and landslides.  This important impact may extend to other places around the globe where similar geologic hazards exist and where this project's products are put to similar use.  Another impact has been to inspire young users, including those who live in the region at risk, to take a greater interest in pursuing careers in the earth science and science communication fields.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Doug Prose"
