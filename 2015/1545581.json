 "awd_abstract_narration": "This INSPIRE project is jointly funded by the Astronomy & Astrophysics Grants program of the Astronomical Sciences Division in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate, by the Aeronomy program of the Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences Division in the Geosciences Directorate, and by the Office of Integrative Activities.   The aim of this project is to bridge the gaps that separate scientific communities studying the complex atmospheres of Earth, other solar system planets, and planets around other stars (\"exoplanets\").  These different systems are united by the same physics and chemistry used by geo-scientists at Earth and by astronomers investigating other planets in our solar system and throughout the Milky Way galaxy.  Common themes need common approaches, and results at one location can validate less certain findings elsewhere.  This program will create pathways of communication that utilize resources more effectively, promote common modes of data analysis, create all-purpose ionospheric models, and foster student training that removes discipline barriers.  The impact of ionospheric disturbances due to Space Weather experienced at Earth (e.g., GPS degradations) will enable parallel studies for Mars, where multiple satellites need reliable communication and navigation for land-based rovers and, ultimately, human exploration. \r\n\r\nWhile the Sun's ultraviolet and x-ray light is the same for all of our planets, the gases present at each location are different, and this leads to a vast set of ions and electrons that comprise the ionosphere at each planet in our Solar System. Even more compartmentalized are studies of ionospheres at planets around other stars. The scientific communities that study them (geophysicists and astronomers) are isolated from each other - programmatically at funding agencies and at professional meetings and societies. This lack of cross-fertilization impedes progress. This award focuses upon the treatment of fundamental atmospheric and space plasma processes as universal - rather than as unique, planet-by-planet, phenomena.   The team will develop the first comprehensive archive to host all of the parameters necessary to conduct comparative studies of ionospheres throughout the solar system and beyond, and provide a versatile user-friendly model to do so. The research tools developed will offer many opportunities to resolve important issues in one discipline by applying knowledge and expertise found in other disciplines.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis INSPIRE grant to Boston University investigated the basic patterns and processes of that  region in a planet?s upper atmosphere called an Ionosphere.  For example, Earth?s ionosphere starts at about 70 km above the surface and extends to about 2000 km.  Within this region, sunlight in the extreme-ultra-violate(EUV) and x-ray portions of the solar spectrum can separate electrons from an atom or molecule---e.g., atomic oxygen (O) --- resulting in an ion (O+) and electron (e-).  Given that the neutral atmospheres of planets in the inner and outer solar system are different (e.g., at Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn), there is an opportunity for studies called Comparative Ionospheres.  Moreover, we added to such a study the possible signatures of life on other planets (called ?bio-markers) as revealed by their type of ionosphere, specifically if O+ is the dominant ion, as on Earth.\n\n \n\nTo conduct this research, we searched for data sets from each of the planets that yielded the electron density (#e-/cm3) versus altitude, called an electron density profile, Ne(h). With just a few at Uranus and Neptune, we decided to study the more abundant data sources from the five planets mentioned above.   For each planet, we carried out ?data cleansing? so that only reliable observation sets were used (i.e., each profile had to show the two ionospheric layers produced by EUV and X-rays).  We applied the theory of photo-chemical-equilibrium to these layers to determine the dependence of the maximum electron density in each layer upon solar flux (long-term effects) and the elevation angle of the Sun (daily effects).  We found an impressive set of correlations for each of the planets studies.  These were made available to the science community via publications in the leading refereed journals.\n\n \n\nOur INSPIRE grant supported students at the undergraduate level, giving them introductions to how planetary ionospheric research is done.  Graduate student research was also supported, providing additional exposure to in-depth research.  Finally, a junior staff member (a woman of Hispanic background) worked over the full, multi-year duration of the grant.  Ms. Clara Narvaez is now an expert on large data-sets, flowing from multiple diagnostic methods (ground-based/space-based) instruments. \n\n \n\nWe thank the INSPIRE Program for providing support for these studies that advanced basic science in an inter-disciplinary fashion, producing new science results and training for students and staff.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/16/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Mendillo"
