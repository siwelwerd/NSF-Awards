 "awd_abstract_narration": "From national security to environmental stewardship, a countless number of personal and societal issues require citizens to make informed decisions based on their understanding of science, technology, and culture of place. Such increased understanding of global change requires GeoSTEM knowledge and broad participation, inclusive of minority populations. With the new Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), more rigorous geoscience curricula requirements are forthcoming and better qualified and more effective Earth Science teachers are needed. This is especially essential for rural Alaska, where unemployment is high and where indigenous student populations have traditionally been underserved.  \r\n\r\nThis three-year project implements mentored teaching experiences in remote rural villages to increase the number of Earth Science teachers in Alaska and targets the overall interest in geoscience careers of undergraduate and pre-college students (K-12). The project's interdisciplinary team from the University of Alaska School of Education (UAF-SOE), the UAF College of Natural Science & Mathematics (CNSM), the University of Alaska Museum of the North (UAM), and the International Arctic Research Center (IARC) in collaboration with Alaska's rural school districts will create and evaluate a multilayered recruitment and training program to increase the number of qualified and effective GeoSTEM teachers who understand and embrace the powerful local contexts of Alaska's Arctic Native villages. Participants will increase their understandings about: (a) the interdisciplinary nature of GeoSTEM contents; (b) place-relevant and hands on geoscience teaching practices; and (c) careers in geosciences and teaching. \r\nThe project objectives are:\r\n(1) Development of a multilayered, sustainable recruitment program with focus on diversity participation in geosciences.\r\n(2) Development and implementation of a university-based, 3 credit GeoSTEM course that count towards both, UAF undergraduate geoscience and education degrees.\r\n(3) Implementation of mentored Earth/geoscience teaching experiences for GeoSTEM participants in indigenous rural schools that includes pre-college career education for geosciences. \r\n(4) Research and evaluation of the effectiveness of the (a) multilayered recruitment approach, (b) the university-based GeoSTEM course, and (c) the mentored geoscience field teaching experiences in indigenous and remote villages. \r\n\r\nWhile the focus of this project is on increasing the number of Earth Science teachers, pre-college K-12 students will also benefit. During the geoscience-teaching experiences in indigenous and remote Alaska villages, participants will engage pre-college high school students in geoscience projects, hands on data collection and geoscience career education. This project serves initially 20 pre-service teachers and creates mentored field experiences in 10 schools serving 95% Native students and impacting immediately more than 400 indigenous students. This approach helps to create a pipeline into geoscience careers for indigenous students.  The proposed project supports Earth science teacher recruitment, effectiveness, retention, and equity in access to education for indigenous and rural students.",
