A better understanding of the aggregation process will not only help to prevent unwanted protein aggregation, but may also be used to design small-scale manufacturing processes where molecules are able to assemble in an ordered and repeatable fashion, such as in the production of nanowires for electronics. The goal of this project is to discover the primary mechanism involved in the initiation of protein aggregation by examining proteins involved in diseases and biofouling. In order to understand this mechanism, key properties of the proteins will be altered in a controlled manner and their effect on protein aggregation will be explored using methods that analyze aggregate size and structure. In addition, changes in amyloid behavior in the presence of inhibitor molecules will be examined. By advancing our understanding of these early stages of protein aggregation, we will be able to design better drugs for treating debilitating diseases, reduce unwanted biofouling, and facilitate industrial applications.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work employs a custom Microchannel Electrophoresis (ME) system that utilizes a blended polymer matrix to facilitate separation of individual oligomer populations that span a wide range of molecular weights. Three model proteins will be studied: amyloid-beta, involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, amylin, a pathogenic protein in type 2 diabetes, and chaplin H, a protein critical for biofouling. ME will be employed to elucidate the effect of protein amino acid sequence, including the length of hydrophobic stretches and protein flexibility, on the evolution of oligomeric aggregates. In addition, ME will be employed to investigate the ability of eight known small molecule inhibitors of aggregation to modulate oligomer formation. Oligomer size determination as well as binding of florescent dyes that recognize hydrophobic domains and amyloid structure will be coupled with time-dependent studies to define the conformation, size, time to appearance, and relative quantity of oligomers formed. The custom ME's dual optical detection capabilities will be exploited to simultaneously detect oligomers via UV and bound fluorescent dyes. The advancement in understanding the influences of protein amino acid sequence and small molecule inhibitors on amyloid protein oligomerization will define new directions for the inhibition and manipulation of protein aggregation with applications in drug development, pharmaceutical production, biofouling, and nanotechnology. The experimental work will be integrated with biomedical engineering education.  Specifically, the proposed work will establish a collaborative undergraduate research exchange for six undergraduate students and will develop a design based module to be distribution to high school and middle school teachers that familiarizes precollege students with the concepts of protein aggregation and separation of protein aggregates. \r\n\r\nThis award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Biomaterials Program of the Division of Materials Research and by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThrough study of the influence of changes in the amyloid-beta protein chain flexibility, trends have been identified to provide the first evidence of the influence that chain flexibility can have upon aggregation propensity.  In particular, increased chain flexibility was found to decrease the lag time to aggregate formation and lead to the formation of smaller aggregates, while decreased chain flexibility can lead to decreased aggregate quantity and stability.  These results parallel observation of the effect upon oligomerization, studied by our University of Arkansas collaborators using capillary electrophoresis.  These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of protein aggregation and the manner in which early oligomer formation influences aggregation kinetics and aggregate morphology.  Ultimately these findings may help in the development of future therapeutics for diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s or for the bottom up assembly of nanomaterials.  The results of this project have been conveyed through multiple research presentations made by graduate students from both the University of Arkansas and the University of South Carolina and will soon be disseminated through a manuscript.  This work has supported at least 6 undergraduate and 3 graduate students including those from underrepresented groups.  Through this work, these students have developed laboratory skills, analytical reasoning, and real-world problem solving.  In addition, a K-12 hands-on activity was developed and implemented with students that taught them about protein aggregation and the different separation techniques that can be employed to study these aggregates.  Students built and tested their own prototypes and discussed the mechanisms being used to increase their scientific reasoning.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/19/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Melissa A Moss"
