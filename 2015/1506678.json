 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:\r\nThis proposal is aimed at controlling the properties of thin superconductor films in the range of only a few atomic monolayers and studying the superconducting properties in this new regime.  The superconducting films in such a thin regime are likely to exhibit properties that are not found in the bulk form.   For example, such a thin film may be able to carry supercurrent in the presence of very high magnetic fields making the film much more useful for device applications.  The research activities involve state-of-the-art synthesis techniques that can lay down the thin film atomic layer by atomic layer thus enabling us to achieve the ultimate material control at the microscopic scale.  In addition, we will use characterization tools to study the superconducting properties from nanometer to macroscopic (millimeter) length scales.  The proposal focuses on the integration of research and education to train internationally competitive students in materials research.  We are also committed to educational outreach to broader audiences at all levels.  At UT-Austin the PI will take advantage of the Summer Academy of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology for state-wide high school teachers and students, previously established under the IGERT program.  Moreover, we will offer summer internship opportunities for female high school students through the Alice in the Wonderland program;  the PI has already hosted four of these students as summer interns and will continue to do so in future years.  Finally, this program is fully committed to broadening participation of under-represented groups in graduate research with specific goals of increasing the percentage of graduate students that are women or/and of Hispanic background. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL ABSTRACT:\r\nElegantly fabricated functional materials with reduced dimensions occupy a central stage of modern materials research. Supported by an NSF-FRG program in the past, the PI has been focusing on the novel physical properties of precisely tailored metallic thin films and related nanostructures in the quantum regime. These past efforts have substantially advanced the field in terms of growth and characterization of such structures. In the proposed program, we will take another leap forward by creating new heterostructures based on these quantum films to explore and harness their emergent exotic superconducting properties for potential applications.   Specifically, we will focus on the interplay of superconductivity with three different quantum degrees of freedom, including electronic, lattice, and spin, and we will implement the following four major task areas: (a) Correlating microscopic and macroscopic measurements - manipulating structural defects and investigating their roles on phase fluctuations; (b) Revisiting quantum size effect on superconductivity ultra-thin films and unraveling the quantum confinement of phonons; (c) Tuning superconductivity of atomic-layer superconducting films with interfacial engineering; and (d) Exploring superconducting - spin-paramagnetic (SC-SP) transition in ultra-thin epitaxial films.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn a superconductor electron (Cooper) pairs condense into a single state and in so doing support dissipation free charge flow and perfect diamagnetism. In a magnetic field the minimum kinetic energy of the Cooper pairs increases, producing an orbital pair breaking effect.   There are two length scales defines the superconductivity: the coherent length defines the minimum length scale for the condensed states to exist; and the magnetic penetration depth defines the minimum length scale for the supercurrent to shield out the magnetic field.   The rapid advances in nanoscale materials engineering, nanoscale superconductivity has emerged in recent years as an exciting frontier in which nanostructure length scales can be comparable to the two intrinsic superconductor length scales, the penetration depth and the coherence length.  This proposal, entitled \"Manipulating 2D Superconductivity through atomic scale control of boundary conditions\" was set out to use these advance materials synthesis techniques to create superconducting nanostructure such that at least one of the three dimensions would be smaller than both the coherent length and the penetration depth.  One very special feature in our approach is that within the individual superconducting nanostructures, the atomic arrangement is well order (single crystalline).  This special characteristic has allowed us to study low dimensional superconductivity in a totally new frontier that was not accessible previously.  \n\nThe main outcome of our research activities is primarily reflected in the number of publications and the number of presentations in major conferences.  Here we specifically mention two papers.  The first paper entitled \"Ultrathin two-dimensional superconductivity with strong spin-orbit coupling\" was published in the Proceeding of National Science Academy in 2016.  In ultra-thin films the usual orbital pair breaking effect of an in-plane magnetic field (namely when the magnetic field is parallel to the surface) can be nearly completely suppressed, allowing the Zeeman pair breaking effect to determine the critical field, i.e. the field threshold at which superconductivity is lost. In this PNAS paper, we show that because the superconducting materials is made of Pb, a heavy element with strong spin-orbit coupling, even the Zeeman pair breaking term is also suppressed such that the in-plane critical magnetic field far exceeding the Zeeman limit by nearly one order of magnitude.   \n\nThe second paper, entitled \"Geometric Quenching of Orbital Pair Breaking in a Single Crystalline Superconducting Nanomesh Network,\" was published in Nature Communications in 2018.  The afro-mentioned suppression of orbital pair breaking effect for an in-plane magnetic field, unfortunately does not apply when the magnetic field is perpendicular to the surface of the film.  Consequently, perpendicular critical field is usually much weaker.  In this second publication, we reported a novel approach to create an ultra-thin (2 nm thick) single crystalline Pb nanowire network.  In this way we are able to establish nm scale lateral structure without introducing weak links. Our network suppresses orbital pair breaking for both perpendicular and in-plane fields with a negligible reduction in zero-field resistive critical temperatures.  Our study opens a new frontier in nanoscale superconductivity by providing a strategy for maintaining pairing in strong field environments in all directions with important technological implications.\n\nThese two publications exemplify what we were set out to accomplish in this project &ndash; Manipulating 2D Superconductivity through atomic scale control of boundary conditions.  Although we could not have anticipated exactly what to expect in the first place, the end results are quite impressive.  In addition to scientific research, this project has trained a large number of graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdoctoral researchers. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/26/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Chih-Kang Shih"
