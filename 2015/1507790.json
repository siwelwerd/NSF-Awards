 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Teri Odom at Northwestern University to study a specific type of nanoparticle -gold nanostars-that can be efficiently synthesized.  Nanoparticles made from noble metals such as gold and silver are promising in a range of applications, from chemical sensors to optical imaging probes to anti-bacterial agents. However, preparing and controlling specific features (tips, edges, curves) on metal nanoparticles with non-spherical shapes are still challenging. These nanoscopic features are expected to be important as their sizes approach that of molecules.  The project aims to obtain nanostars with desired features by tuning the chemistry at the nanoparticle surface. Broader impacts of these unique nanomaterials include integrating the one-pot gold nanostar synthesis with an existing lab on colloidal gold nanoparticles in freshmen general chemistry. In addition, freshman seminars focusing on nanoscience are developing projects similar to 'Ted Ed'-like videos explaining nano-concepts.\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks to determine how anisotropic nanomaterials that support unique curvature regions of positive, negative, and neutral curvature simultaneously exhibit properties distinct from symmetric (spherical) or elongated (rod-like) nanoparticles. Gold nanostars can serve as a unique model system since they can be synthesized through a seedless method resulting in distinct numbers of branches with tunable thicknesses and lengths. This work aims to resolve the mechanism of seedless growth at the single-particle level as well as determine how gold nanostar sample purity can be optimized by physical post-processing. Other goals include determining the structure-activity relationships of gold nanostars related to ligand attachment. Major outcomes of this work on nanoscale curvature include: (1) identifying functional groups in Good's buffers responsible for the formation gold nanostars with different branch numbers, branch lengths, and negative curvature degrees; (2) resolving the growth mechanism of gold nanostars at the single-particle level using in situ transmission electron microscopy; and (3) determining where biological ligands having secondary structure (double-stranded, looped, quadruplex) preferentially adsorb on the gold nanostars.",

For the NPs to form, the gold salt is reduced from an ion (Au<sup>3+</sup>) to solid gold (Au<sup>0</sup>). During this reaction, cationic radicals of the Good?s buffer are produced whose concentration is related to the growth of the nanoparticle. The overall size, number of branches, and optical properties can be controlled with the type and concentration of Good?s buffer (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>).

We used density gradient centrifugation to obtain homogeneous populations of AuNS and separated AuNS into bands of self-similar particles (<strong>Fig. 3</strong>). To test how curvature affected nanoparticle properties, we attached biomolecules, such as DNA or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, to the surface of AuNS. Our studies showed that highly branched particles with large amounts of negative curvature increased the MRI contrast agent response (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>). MRI images are produced by exciting protons in water molecules and measuring how quickly they relax back to their non-excited state. Contrast agents, such as gadolinium chelates, interact with a single water molecule at a time, shortening the time the proton takes to relax, and increasing the signal the MRI detects. However, when the gadolinium chelate is attached to the surface of an AuNS, the negative curvature regions provide an environment for the gadolinium to interact with more than one water molecule at a time, which increases the signal to almost 25 times higher than signals produced by clinical agents. We found that nanoparticle surface curvature influenced how surface-bound molecules interact with environment immediately surrounding them.</p>\n<p>Broader impacts for the project included Odom lab members carrying out nanoscience-related educational outreach.
