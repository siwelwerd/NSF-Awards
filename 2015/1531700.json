 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, acquiring a shared state-of-the-art JACO-2 robot arm for collaborative research in assistive and rehabilitation robotics, aims to improve the quality of life of individuals with disabilities and the elderly by increasing their independence and community reintegration. It supports research in three areas: \r\n-\tAssistive technology and vocational rehabilitation systems; \r\n-\tRobotics and control systems; and \r\n-\tHealth monitoring systems. \r\nIn these areas, the participating researchers will use the equipment collaboratively on diverse research projects. In addition, the award should facilitate development of assistive robotics research and training across multiple departments. \r\n\r\nThis novel instrument enables access by the research community to an instrument that will accelerate research in assistive robotics, vocational rehabilitation, health-care and monitoring, and home care. The proposed projects introduce a simple robot arm manipulation scheme for enabling the incorporation of robotic systems into home environment, thus enhancing the independence and autonomy of individuals with disabilities, and minimizing the necessity for a caregiver. The research projects will also contribute to assisting the elderly and persons with disability to manipulate and communicate with the robot in complex unstructured environments, thereby enhancing safety and reliability of the robotic system, especially for people with lower or upper limb limitations or both lower and upper limb limitations to perform tasks in a more complicated workplace.",
