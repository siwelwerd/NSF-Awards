 "awd_abstract_narration": "Without high-performance networking big data and high performance computing have very limited value.   It has long been recognized that the highest performance data transfers should directly run the on top of optical circuits without Ethernet switching or IP routing.  This direct layering avoids switching-related packet loss and provides a cost effective service.   Optical equipment now exists that will permit the dynamic establishment of single application light paths.   However, the time required to set up optical circuits is too long for short or small transfers ? taking a second to set up a 100 Gigabit/sec link in order to transfer a small file does not make sense.  This project is building an integrated campus network where small data transfers (megabytes or gigabytes) ride conventional networks and big data transfers (terabytes or petabytes) ride directly on optical circuits.\r\n \r\nThe project is building PROnet, a campus network at the University of Texas, Dallas, which provides the lowest possible network latency (signal propagation only), scalability to 100Gbps and beyond, and equipment having low power consumption and complexity. A user-friendly interface will be developed and deployed for the network inexperienced researcher to request the provisioning of as needed optical. A PROnet controller will be developed for the scheduling and automatic provisioning of optical circuits, which will shorten the circuit reservation procedure time significantly by removing human intervention from the entire process. For inter-domain operation, the open platform OSCARS will be extended to work with PROnet. With this OSCARS extension, provisioning of hybrid (optical and virtual) circuits spanning across multiple (optical and non-optical) domains will be a reality.   The software will support secure use of the network via InCommon identities.",

UTD has received an InstaGENI rack, hosted at the Flexential (<a href=\"http://www.flexential.com/\">www.flexential.com</a>) site in Richardson, off our main campus. UT-Dallas has also received a number of HPC racks, formerly part of the TACC Stampede supercomputing center in Austin. Three of these racks are operational and hosted at the Flexential site. Two half-racks are in the electrical engineering building research lab on campus, and have been used for testing with the PROnet high data rate connections.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The following significant technical milestones were accomplished during the PROnet project.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A number of Software Defined Networking (SDN) modules was designed, implemented, integrated, and tested by the UTD research team. These software modules now provide the software programmability that was envisioned at the beginning of this project, which enables network administrators and application software modules to easily reconfigure both the network and compute resources to achieve a desired goal. The software modules developed or integrated in PROnet include an <em>optical DWDM network controller specifically designed to work with Cisco equipment</em>, a <em>second controller (TransportpCPE) designed to work with any optical network equipment vendor that is open ROADM compliant (currently Ciena and Fujitsu), </em>the <em>PROnet two-layer resource orchestrator</em>, and a <em>multi-layer optimization engine for joint optimization of resource provisioning in PROnet.</em></li>\n<li>In the final year of the project, the PROnet orchestrator was interfaced with OpenStack, thus providing controllability of compute resources that may be connected to PROnet (like the Stampede racks).

The experiments included advanced manufacturing systems, Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN) technologies, live migration of VMs over the optical network in support of special applications (like providing real-time services to Autonomous Driving Vehicles (SDV) from the Edge) or disaster recovery operations (like massive migration of VMs from the primary datacenter being affected by an outage to a backup datacenter).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The PIs have closely worked with the Office of Information Technology (OIT) of UTD. The resulting impact on the physical resources that form infrastructure at UTD includes:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>We have deployed one ROADM node of PROnet at the Flexential datacenter, which is a commercial site outside our campus. Two fiber pairs have been installed and commissioned to provide double connectivity between the Flexential site and the Electrical and Computer Science North (ECSN) building, where our research lab and other ROADM nodes are located. With this fiber connectivity, the engineering building can be directly connected to our HPC and storage facility in the Flexential datacenter. Optical circuits can be created on demand, offering an increased capacity between the engineering building and the Flexential datacenter of hundreds of Gbps.</li>\n<li>As of spring 2019, UT-Dallas has decided to upgrade the campus production backbone network to operate at 100Gbps. The selection of the equipment has been affected by the PROnet project, inducing OIT to opt for equipment that offers SDN capabilities. OIT is welcoming proposals to use the new high data rate university network backbone to foster research missions beyond production services.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/15/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Marco&nbsp;Tacca</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947717356_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947717356_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947717356_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrea Fumagalli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marco&nbsp;Tacca</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947751704_figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947751704_figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947751704_figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrea Fumagalli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marco&nbsp;Tacca</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947807879_figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947807879_figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947807879_figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 23</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrea Fumagalli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marco&nbsp;Tacca</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947850831_figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947850831_figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947850831_figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 4</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrea Fumagalli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marco&nbsp;Tacca</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947893417_figure5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947893417_figure5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947893417_figure5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 5</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrea Fumagalli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marco&nbsp;Tacca</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 5</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947936288_figure6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947936288_figure6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 6\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541461/1541461_10387895_1557947936288_figure6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 6\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 6</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andrea Fumagalli</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Marco&nbsp;Tacca</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 6</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
