 "awd_abstract_narration": "A conference titled \"D-modules in Commutative Algebra\" will be held 10-14 August 2015 at the Centro de Investigacion en Matematicas (CIMAT) in Guanajuato, Mexico. The main goals of the conference are to bring together experts in D-modules and in Commutative Algebra to share ideas and develop collaborations, to expose commutative algebraists to techniques and new developments in the world of D-modules and to increase awareness of these techniques among young mathematicians. Holding the conference at the CIMAT should boost the emerging interest in this topic among Mexican mathematicians and among Hispanic mathematicians in the US and should increase the potential for collaboration between US and Mexican mathematicians.  The award will fund travel expenses for 20 US-based participants, mainly junior researchers and graduate students. This award is co-funded by the NSF Office of International and Integrative Activities. \r\n\r\nD-modules and Commutative Algebra are two different branches of algebra. A connection between them was established in a 1993 paper where D-modules were used to solve problems from Commutative Algebra. It is always exciting when two different fields converge. This enriches both fields by making available new tools to attack old problems. By now the range of applications of D-modules to commutative algebra has expanded well beyond that 1993 paper. On the other hand, these applications have motivated important developments in the theory of D-modules itself. Yet despite these developments many questions remain open. There have been many exciting developments in the world of D-modules whose implications for commutative algebra have not been fully explored; for instance, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence and Berthelot's theory of arithmetic D-modules, just to name two. During the conference there will be three short lecture series on the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, on arithmetic D-modules, and on applications of D-modules in commutative algebra. The conference will include a number of research talks as well as a moderated open problem session.\r\n\r\nConference web site: https://sites.google.com/site/dmodulesincommutativealgebra/home",
