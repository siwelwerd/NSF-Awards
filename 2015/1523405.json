 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this project is to determine a detailed history of atmospheric elemental carbon (EC) concentrations for a site in the Northeastern US over the last century and compare it to model predictions. EC aerosols play a key role in regional and global climate forcing because of absorption of solar radiation and possible cloud formation. EC also impacts the environment and human health as a major component of fine particulate matter. In the northeastern United States, sources of EC aerosols have changed dramatically during the last century, and these changes are reflected in atmospheric concentrations of EC. However, past data on atmospheric EC is sparse. It is hypothesized that atmospheric EC can be determined from the EC concentrations in lake sediments. \r\n\r\nDaily aerosol samples will be collected at Whiteface Mt., NY between 2011 and 2014. These filters along with archived filters for 2006-2010 will be analyzed for EC concentration to provide continuous data from 1978 to 2014. The EC concentration in sediment cores from three lakes around Whiteface Mt. will also be determined using freeze-coring techniques. Efforts will also be made to locate a laminated lake where direct varve (layer) counting can be used to obtain a highly accurate chronology and fine time resolution, about 5-10 yrs. These data will allow the quantitative relationship between concentrations in lake sediments and the atmosphere to be determined. EC concentrations in deeper sediments are to be used to estimate the pre-industrial age background. The archived lake cores can also be used for studies of toxic metals such as mercury, and many other chemical species, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).\r\n\r\nThis project will provide educational opportunities for undergraduate students and post-doctoral researchers. The results of this work will incorporated in courses in environmental chemistry as well as interdisciplinary research. Public outreach activities are also planned.",

BC particulate matter is released directly into the atmosphere, can stay suspended for a week or more, unlike most other aerosols strongly absorbs sun light, and is known to alter the radiation budget of Earth by direct and indirect interactions.   Studies have shown that ice cores (glaciers) and sediment cores (from remote lakes) can be used to reconstruct the past BC emission pattern.  In this NSF funded project we have collected 11 sediment cores from six remote lakes in the Adirondack Mountains of NY (WPP, West Pine Pond; CP, Clear Pond; DP, Deer Pond; EPP, East Pine Pond; HSP, Horseshoe Pond; and BTP, Boot Tree Pond), freeze dried thin slices, dated the slices, and chemically processed the material to minimize organic interference for BC determinations.  Although the results vary somewhat from lake to lake, over all, BC was very low in the early 1800s (pre-industrial), began to rise in the late 1800s, peaked between 1920 to 1960,  and decreased recently to near pre-industrial levels (see Image 1).\n\nTo convert the BC deposition into atmospheric concentrations long-term BC measurements at Whiteface Mountain summit (image 2) were used to calibrate the sediment profiles ([BC]sed = K*[BC]atm ). A composite profile is shown in Image 3.  Peak levels were approximately 10 times higher than observed in background levels of pre-1850. BC levels are observed to be on a declining trend towards the end of the 20th century. The present time BC levels are around 20 ng m-3 higher than those of pre-1850 levels. Image 3 also shows BC emissions [Bond et al., Global Biogeochem. Cycles, 21, GB2018, doi:10.1029/2006GB002840, 2007] and model calculations of historic atmospheric BC [Skeie et al., Atmos. Chem.

Relative change in the measured [BC] between 1850 and present day is in fair agreement with the change depicted in the US BC emission estimate.  However, the emission profile and models seriously under estimate BC in the mid-20th century.\n\nTo expand the application of the approach to lakes were long-term BC is not available a model was introduced to directly calculate K from lake specific and regional meteorological parameters.  The model was tested by comparing K directly determined for 6 lakes to the model predictions.  Results were considered very encouraging, however, results from more lakes are needed to better define the one variable that is not explicitly known (catchment contribution of BC).  Results suggest that ratios of catchment area to lake area (Ac/As) that are less than around 8 may not represented by the model.  More results are still needed to better refine the model.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/19/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Liaquat Husain"
