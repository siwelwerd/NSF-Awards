 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cold Regions Bibliography Project has served a critical need in preserving the international polar science research record across all scientific disciplines by ensuring access to and dissemination of the information on the regions to students, researchers, and others interested in polar research.\r\n\r\nFor the last decade, the American Geological Institute has supported and maintained the Antarctic Bibliography as part of the Cold Regions Bibliography Project. Technological advances in Internet search engines have made it easier for researchers to find peer-reviewed literature on Antarctica without pre-selection by bibliographers. This fact combined with the fact that researchers are encouraged to publish their results in peer-reviewed journals and the emergence of web-based scientific publication databases have made research results much more accessible to a broader community. \r\n\r\nConsidering these factors and the advances in Internet search engines, it was decided to develop a plan to facilitate the transition of the bibliography to mainstream publication resources. This plan will maintain access to existing materials, the searchable bibliographic database, the Antarctic Journal, and the Journal's predecessor publications.\r\n\r\nThe web site for the Antarctic Bibliography, designed in the early 2000s, is now in a format that is outdated. The current search software for the Antarctic Bibliography requires annual license fees and is no longer the norm for searchable bibliographic databases. The web site will be re-designed, and the searchable database will be moved to an open-source search software now in current use throughout the U.S. in many libraries. The bibliographic data exists in two formats. These two formats will be merged for search purposes to provide a unified interface. Once the website is revised and the search platform is operational, it will be possible to maintain the site as an archive.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Antarctic Bibliography and the Bibliography on Cold Regions Science and Technology have been the primary bibliographic tools for the polar scientific literature for many years.  The Antarctic Bibliography covers the global scientfic literature on the Antarctic region from 1961 through 2011.  The Bibliography on Cold Regions Science and Technology covers scientific and engineering research in all cold regions from 1951 through 2011.  Both bibliographies had been sponsored by the National Science Foundation and/or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. \n\nThese two bibliographies had been openly available on the internet on a discovery platform that had been designed in 2000.  Improvements in database design over the intervening fifteen years meant that discoverability of the resources in the database could be immensely improved and the documentation of the scientific literature for these important regions could be preserved for the future. \n\nThe American Geosciences Institute migrated the two databases to a new interface that provided new flexibility for users.  The new interface allows users to do simple searches as well as more complex requests for specific authors, titles, journals and subjects. In addition, the option to seek information by drawing a box on a map was introduced.  Given the limited number of named geographic locations in the polar regions, this geographic search option is an important new feature.\n\nWhile the primary user of the database is the scientist involved in research in the polar regions, the databases are freely open to the public.  The bibliographies contain a variety of references to publications on climate change, tourism, policy and education that can be of interest to the general public. \n\nIn conjunction with the migration of the bibliographies, the digitized copies of the Antarctic Journal of the United States and its predecessors was moved to a repository and linked from both the bibliographies and the website.  These publications highlighted activities in the Antarctic region from 1956 through 1996.  Information on weather, schedules, logistics and research are available for review by both researchers and historians. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/26/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sharon N Tahirkheli"
