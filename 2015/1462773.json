 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human Activity Recognition is the process of inferring human activity from motion sensors such as accelerometer and gyroscopes worn on the human body.  These motion sensors are embedded in physical activity tracking devices and SmartWatches.  Accurate inference of human activity offers many benefits for health monitoring and for promoting overall wellness of an individual.  There are many machine learning-based approaches to human activity recognition from sensor data.  However, in practice, the current approaches often suffer from poor accuracy on account of uncertainty due to wide range of human body types, sensor locations on the body and real-time sources of uncertainty such as changes in activity speed and intensity, sensor noise, packet drops, sensor failure etc.  This award supports fundamental research to provide needed knowledge for the development of robust activity recognition methodology and algorithms.  It is projected that there will be a trillion embedded sensors in connected people and devices by 2020. This project's algorithmic and software tools can potentially be directly applied to fitness monitoring, eldercare support, long-term preventive and chronic care, and rehabilitation.  Therefore, results from this research will benefit the US economy and society.  To promote transitions, several educational initiatives are planned that seek to engage undergraduate students in entrepreneurship.\r\n  \r\nA major objective of the research concerns development of methods and algorithms to mitigate uncertainty in machine learning problems, such as the activity recognition problem, involving dynamic data sets.  A control-theoretic framework is planned to not only address the robustness issues due to uncertainty, but also enable certain unified architectures for learning patterns from sensor data.  If successful, the work can lead to novel algorithmic approaches to represent, learn and recognize hidden low order patterns in unstructured dynamic data sets.  Besides methodological developments, this project will engineer other more tangible outcomes such as the development of algorithms and software for feedback particle filter, enunciation of control architectures and algorithms for representation of complex patterns in data, and development of software tools for the human activity recognition system.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe outcomes of this research included control-theoretic methods and algorithms to solve certain problems in machine learning.  The research was organized along two parts - Theory and Application.  Each of these parts had overlapping research outcomes:  The first theoretical outcome was development of a stochastic modeling architecture for learning and recognition of cyclic patterns.  The second outcome was adaptation (learning) schemes to learn the model directly from sensor data. The third outcome was development and analysis of a general class of nonlinear filtering methods and algorithms for pattern recognition, classification and analysis.  The theoretical work was closely integrated with an application involving a wearable sensor-based experimental test-bed for human activity recognition (HAR). \nThe theoretical methodological and algorithmic work resulted in several publications, conference talks, and invited seminars.  These publications included peer-reviewed journal and conference articles and the PhD dissertation of the graduate student Chi Zhang who was supported by this grant.  Based on this research, the PI was granted a US patent: Tilton, A., S. Ghiotto, and P. G. Mehta, ?Methods and Apparatus for Learning Sensor Data Patterns for Gesture-based Inputs,? US Patent 9582080 B1, February 2017.\nThe impact on technology transfer was achieved through the involvement of the PI in a startup Rithmio, which spun out of PI?s lab at the University of Illinois.  Rithmio?s technology portfolio (Intellectual Property, Software and Data) was acquired by Bosch Sensortec in 2017.  Based in part on this research, PI?s former students (Adam Tilton and Shane Ghiotto) launched a new startup (Aktive) which was acquired by Nike in 2019.    \nThe research has important potential implications to neuroscience.  Specifically, the theoretical work provides novel algorithmic paradigms for carrying out Bayesian inference using neuro-biologically plausible coupled oscillator circuits.  This is a basis of some ongoing research by PI and collaborators on sensori-motor control in soft-bodied animals such as octopus.     \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Prashant Mehta"
