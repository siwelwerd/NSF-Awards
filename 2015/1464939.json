The conference is organized jointly by a group of scientists at Bar-Ilan University, Hebrew University, ORT Braude College and the University of South Florida. This international event will be the seventh in the popular series of conferences on Complex Analysis and Dynamical Systems. The participants will be prominent scientists, young researchers, and students from the US, Canada, the European Union, Eastern Europe and Asia. The presentations at the conference will range from plenary lectures describing recent breakthrough results in Complex Analysis, Dynamical Systems, and Mathematical Physics, in a form accessible to advanced graduate students and young researchers, to more specialized talks on focused research topics. Supporting the travel of young researchers and graduate students to such a conference where scientists from North and South America, Europe and Asia, old and young, prominent and just beginning, are spending all their waking hours together in an inspiring and congenial environment will, as it has done in the past, inspire many beginning researchers, including minorities and members from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe topics chosen for Complex Analysis and Dynamical Systems VII are exciting and currently emerging themes on the borderline between mathematics and physics. Areas of research of the plenary speakers include: (1) Study of localization of eigen modes of elliptic operators, which unites deep results in geometric measure theory and harmonic analysis with modern applications to quantum physics, noise abatement walls, LEDs, and optical devices; (2) research in harmonic analysis particularly as connected to applications in medical imaging; (3) research in symplectic geometry that is nowadays the mathematical basis for a great many directions in physics; (4) general relativity; and (5) applications of the tools of complex analysis, which have given a new line of attack on some of the classical problems in physics, such as Hele-Shaw flows, gravitational lensing, Laplacian growth, and investigation of Coulomb gases.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  www.braude.ac.il/conferences/cads7/",
