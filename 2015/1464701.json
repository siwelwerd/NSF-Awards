 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor David H. Waldeck of the Department of Chemistry at the University Pittsburgh will explore how electrons have their magnetic dipoles aligned with respect to the direction of their velocity by very thin films of material (either metal oxides or polypeptides).  The goal of this research is to understand how the helical structure of molecules affects the direction of an electron's magnetic moment and to examine whether those characteristics can be incorporated in thin metal oxide films for creating electron currents that have a preferred direction for the spin magnetic moments.  The alignment of electron magnetic moments and their manipulation in circuits could have important implications for the design and creation of new types of information memory devices.  The project lies at the interface of materials chemistry and physical chemistry, and it is well suited to the education of scientists at all levels.  Outreach activities to Pittsburgh area schools (middle school and high school) through a Science Kit Lending Library will also be part of the funded project.  The collaboration with a German group and an Israeli group will provide a beneficial international experience for the student researchers. \r\n\r\nRecent experiments (and theory) show that as electrons move through a chiral molecule (or structure) they generate an effective magnetic field which acts to align the electrons' magnetic moment to the propagation direction. The proposed experimental studies aim to elucidate how structural features of chiral thin films affect the degree of spin alignment.  In one thrust of the work, monolayer thick films of helical molecules will be examined to see how the spin alignment is affected by the helix structure (pitch, length, etc.). In a second thrust of the work, the focus is on how the spin alignment for electrons transmitted by ultrathin chiral films of metal oxides depends on the metal oxides energy band location and the film's thickness. These latter studies could have important implications for the design of new electronic devices, such as spin-torque memories. These studies are designed to identify the important features that will need to be incorporated to achieve a quantitatively accurate theoretical model of the chiral induced spin selectivity effect.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project we demonstrated a new way to mesure the electron spin polarization properties of chiral molecules; and we demonstrated that chiral inorganic materials can be created and are superior to their achiral analogues as electrocatalysts for water splitting.\n\nBackground: Electrons have charge and a spin (or magnetic dipole).  Our work showed that chiral molecules and chiral materials are sensitive to the spin directiopn of electrons. A chiral molecule or material is one that is not superimposable on its mirror image.\n\nMolecule studies:  We showed that the electron charge displacement in chiral molecules is accompanied by a spin polarization, preference for the movement of one electron spin direction over the other.  We and our collaborators developed a new method, based on the well-known Hall effect which is used in the semiconductor industry, to measure the magnetic moment that is generated by a monolayer film of chiral molecules on a surface.  We used this method to measure alpha-helical peptides that were earlier shown to filter electrons by their spin direction.  We are now using this method to measure quantitatively the magnetization that can appear in amino acids.  In preliminary work, we performed studies of peptides that have the same length but different amounts of helical character (which we quantify by circular dichroism methods) and find that their spin filtering properties correlate with the amount of helicity.\n\nCopper Oxide studies:  We used electrochemical deposition to create chiral copper oxide (CuO) films that are tens of nanometers thick. The stoichiometry and structure of these films was confirmed using spectroscopy methods.  We and our collaborators showed that these chiral CuO films act as filters for electron spins.  Materials of this sort may prove useful in spintronic devices, which are one technology being developed as a way to miniaturize further electronic devices.  In our own work, we used the electrodeposited CuO films as electrocatalysts for the water splitting reaction and we showed that the chiral CuO is superior to achiral CuO films.  This work implies that chiral electrocatalysts should be superior for water splitting's oxygen evolution reaction than the analogous achiral catalysts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/24/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David H Waldeck"
