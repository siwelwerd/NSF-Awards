The study of supernovae in the infrared, as will be done here, is especially promising given the excellent standard candle behavior as compared to visible wavelengths.  The work will provide new insights on Dark Energy, the discovery of which was pioneered by this group.",

Kirshner, PIHarvard University\nAward AST-1516854Award end:  08/31/2018Program Officer:  Hans Krimm\n\nSupernovae are exploding stars that, for a few weeks, shine a billion times more brilliantly than the Sun.  Even in the earliest days of exploring the Universe with modern instruments, Edwin Hubble, pioneer of the expanding universe, recognized that these explosions might be useful as distance markers.  In The Realm of the Nebulae (1936) he wrote,\" \"[Super] novae can be detected at immense distances and, in principle, they are a criterion of distance about as reliable as that of the total luminosities of the nebulae....  Actually, however, the maxima are so seldom observed and the [super] novae are so rare that they contribute very little to the present problem.\"\n\n\nWhat has changed in the past 80 years is our enhanced ability to detect these rare events.  Even though there might be 1 supernova in a galaxy in 100 years, the advent of modern silicon detectors with their exponential growth in capability (tracking Moore?s Law for silicon-based devices used as computer chips), has transformed supernovae from \"contribut[ing] very little to the present problem\" into the most useful and reliable way to trace the history of cosmic expansion.  \nOur research group helped build the foundation of this work by measuring the brightness and spectra for supernova of all types, sifting out the types that are most useful for measuring the history of cosmic expansion, and building up the samples near and far that allowed us to see something truly exceptional and profound.  \n\nAlthough astronomers from the 1960s to the 1990s had been on a quest to see the slowing down of cosmic expansion that gravity should produce, results from earlier versions of this grant demonstrated that the expansion of the universe is not slowing down, it is speeding up.  We attribute this to the effect of a \"dark energy\" that has this repulsive property and that makes up 2/3 of the energy-density in the entire universe.  \n\nThis NSF-sponsored work has been recognized world-wide as being of profound importance. People who were students and postdocs supported by these grants were awarded the Gruber Cosmology Prize in 2007, the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, the Breakthrough Prize in 2014, and P.I. Kirshner was awarded the National Academy?s Watson Medal in 2014 and the Wolf Prize in Physics in 2015.  But it is not finished.  We need carefully calibrated samples of supernovae and more powerful observing techniques to draw a tighter corral around the properties of the dark energy.\n\n\nIn the most recent grant period from 2015 to 2018, we concentrated on improving the precision of the distance measurements.  Our ultimate aim is to learn more about the nature of the dark energy: does it behave exactly like Einstein?s \"cosmological constant\" or is it something else?  Either way, this is a very important question that lies at the heart of our understanding of gravity.  We have helped pioneer a novel approach using infrared light from supernovae&mdash;the infrared is less vulnerable to the pernicious effects of dust and, even better, supernovae are more nearly \"standard candles\" that need fewer corrections to transform them into reliable distance indicators.\n\n\nWe analyzed the infrared data from years of observations by our group at the Center for Astrophysics with the excellent data from the Carnegie Supernova Project to demonstrate the power of infrared observations.  We are using our new understanding to underpin NASA-sponsored work that exploits the Hubble Space Telescope to extend the benefits of infrared observations to higher redshifts, where the effects of cosmic acceleration are larger.  We have worked both with the Pan-STARRS Survey and the Dark Energy Survey to improve constraints on the dark energy.

In the wider world, this has been shared with the public through a popular-level book, public lectures, and participation in conferences like Renaissance Weekedn, Sci-Foo, and Falling Walls.   \n\nEverybody wants to know where we are and where we are going.  Cosmic expansion and cosmic accleration are part of the scientific answer to these profound questions.  Exploding stars help provide the answers.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/05/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert P Kirshner"
