In addition, students will be exposed to new emerging technologies to sample and analyze these extreme weather events.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts \r\nHigh impact weather such as tropical cyclone and flooding events is one of the top research and operational priorities in the US in this rapidly changing climate environment. ICMCS-X will stimulate the intellectual curiosity of junior scientists and create a valuable international network to support their careers. This project will add to the resources to encouraging participation of US graduate students and benefit the educational community.",
