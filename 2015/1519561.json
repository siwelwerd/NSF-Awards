 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the workshop \"Expansion in linear groups\" taking place May 1-3, 2015 at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The theme of the workshop is exploring the connections between random walks on a locally compact space, additive combinatorics, and their applications. Bringing together experts working in the area will create an environment in which to exchange ideas and to start new projects. The workshop is an excellent opportunity for junior researchers and graduate students to interact with experts and be inspired for further work.\r\n\r\nThe organizers of this workshop are Ramin Takloo-Bighash (University of Illinois at Chicago) and Alireza Salehi-Golsefidi. The confirmed speakers are Peter Sarnak, Alex Gamburd, Elena Fuchs, Alex Kontorovich, Harald Helfgott, Igor Rivin, Nicolas de Saxce, and Alireza Salehi Golsefidi.   This is a part of the annual Oliver Atkin Memorial Lecture and Workshop at the University of Illinois at Chicago.  The lectures by invited speakers will take place on May 2 and 3, and some spots are reserved for talks by participating recent PhDs and graduate students. Select lectures will be videotaped, and will be made available on a website to make the lectures available to the mathematical community. The slides of talks will be made available on the conference  website.\r\n\r\nThe website of the workshop is http://homepages.math.uic.edu/~rtakloo/atkin2015.html",
