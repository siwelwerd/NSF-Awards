 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project explores the factors that influence state formation and urbanization. During its apogee in the first half of the first millennium CE, Teotihuacan arose to become the largest city of the pre-Columbian Americas.  The city was highly planned, with a monumental urban epicenter and densely settled neighborhoods that incorporated a multi-ethnic population of immigrants who arrived from other parts of Mexico and Central America.  Among the enigmas that still pertain to the study of this early American metropolis are (1) its tempo and processes of urbanization; (2) the principal factors that fueled its growing population; (3) its political organization; and (4) what architectural complexes served as seats of governance and administration.  These issues are critical for improving current understanding of the deep history of the Americas and the human creation of the earliest cities and states across the globe. The diverse makeup of the research team enhances interdisciplinary, international international scientific collaborations. And the project also trains students in methods of conducting rigorous and empirical scientific research.\r\n\r\nWith funding from the National Science Foundation, Dr. Saburo Sugiyama (Arizona State University), Dr. Nawa Sugiyama (Smithsonian Institution), and Dr. David Carballo (Boston University), will undertake three years of archaeological research in the Plaza of the Columns Complex, a likely palace or administrative center located between the ancient city's two largest monuments: the Pyramids of the Sun and Moon.  The research involves close international collaboration between researchers from the US, Mexico, and Japan.  This multifaceted, interdisciplinary project will examine the economic, political, and ritual activities that sustained the city through its largest, unexcavated administrative complex.  The international team will conduct intensive excavation, geophysical prospection, floor-chemistry analyses, and chronological assessment through a combination of ceramic, C14, and archaeomagnetic analyses. Primary objectives are to define these structures as palatial-administrative complexes, record activity areas associated with their public and private functions, and identify who resided in these complexes and what role they played in governing Teotihuacan.",

This ancient city flourished during the 1<sup>st</sup> ? 6<sup>th</sup> century AD and became one of the largest urban centers of the pre-Columbian New World. Through meticulous excavations and detailed mapping of the site during the last three and half years, this project aimed to define the ritual, political, and economic activities that took place at this central spot of the metropolis in order to understand the long-contested nature of its governance and explain how the core of the urban center functioned and developed. We chose the Plaza of the Columns and Plaza North of the Sun Pyramid which covers around 110 hectors of the epicenter. By excavating in public and private spaces, we focused on understanding who resided in these complexes, and how they were organized. Specific excavation goals included detecting the key architectural features and specific activity areas that help refine the functions of these complexes.</p>\n<p>During the first three years we executed a series of pit and/or trench excavations mainly along the axis of each unit and short tunnel excavations under the central mounds disclosing complicated culture levels and obtained a large amount of varied materials with stratigraphic data to define characteristics of each area. (Figure 1) We learned that valuable rich data can be obtained in functional spaces often behind the main mounds especially the northern area of the north monument (Structure 25C) rather than inside the main plaza that showed shallow stratigraphy. During the 6-month extension fieldwork in 2018 since the completion of the third year of the project, we successfully carried out the fourth field season and obtained unusual material assemblages, some of which began to expose from previous years. They include remains of feasting activities presumably taking place in or around the Plaza of the Columns (Offering D1), a large amount of mural fragments painted in Maya style that indicate the presence of Maya painters and very probably of Maya dignitaries who participated in the state rituals living at Teotihuacan (Figure 2), and a large assemblage of human bones densely distributed in limited area corresponding to one cultural stage (Offering A1) that suggest ritual of human sacrifice or butchering activities at this core ceremonial-administrative compound (Figure 3). We also discovered symbolic deposit (Offering D4) resulted from a termination ritual carried out when one public substructure was covered to build the northern monument (Structure 25D) of the Plaza of the Columns. Offering D4 consists of very rich, highly valued dedicatory offerings of greenstone, shell, and obsidian artifacts alongside animals that were sacrificed. A golden eagle, many rattlesnakes, a complete spider monkey, and a puma skull were among the zooarchaeological remains dedicated to the structure.</p>\n<p>Bulk ceramic analysis is conducted year-round alongside the necessary consolidation, restoration, and documentation of the artifacts. We have project specialists working on the analysis of animal and human bone, paleo-botanical remains, elemental analysis of the pigments in the mural art and of the green stone, alongside iconographic and consolidation efforts on the mural fragments with Maya-style iconography.</p>\n<p>Detailed three-dimensional mapping of each excavation pit and architectural element proceeded standard protocol established by the Moon Pyramid Project, in order to integrate the Project Plaza of the Columns Compound maps with the AutoCAD general map of the entire ceremonial center produced by the Moon Pyramid Project. Establishing infrastructure for long-term collaborations with the National Institute of Anthropology of History in Mexico was also a major goal being accomplished by this project. We also have been carrying out LiDAR mapping to locate the Plaza of the Columns Compound within the city-wide contexts including surrounding areas of the ancient city in the Valley of Teotihuacan. Feature detection and ground truthing team continued collaborations throughout the 2018 year across the 165km<sup>2</sup> LiDAR survey area. We plan to collaborate further intensively with the Mexican institute sharing these maps and research products for academic, educational, administrative and conservational purposes in 2019 and beyond. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>A substantial laboratory analysis alongside the excavations is underway at the same time as we have curated the excavated archaeological materials for specialists to continue material studies including ceramic and lithic analysis, floor-chemistry analysis, chronological assessment (ceramic, C14, and archaeo-magnetic analysis), paleo-botanical analysis, osteological and faunal analysis. We can tentatively conclude that the leading entity living in the Plaza of the Columns complex was apparently composed of multi-ethnic groups including Maya dignitaries sometime during 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> century AD, and that the space behind the monuments (especially Structure 25C) apparently functioned for preparation or disposal of state ceremonies including feasts, sacrificial rituals, or dismemberment of human body. We hope we continue this ambitious international project to respond further to our research goals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/29/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Saburo&nbsp;Sugiyama</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522613/1522613_10379112_1556553430553_Fig1_PPCCmap.jpeg--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522613/1522613_10379112_1556553430553_Fig1_PPCCmap.jpeg--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522613/1522613_10379112_1556553430553_Fig1_PPCCmap.jpeg--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Plan of the Plaza of the Columns and Plaza North of the Sun Pyramid with location data of six fronts and trench/pit excavations,  Teotihuacan.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Project Plaza of the Columns Compound</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Saburo&nbsp;Sugiyama</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522613/1522613_10379112_1556553591796_Fig2_maya.mural.1.--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522613/1522613_10379112_1556553591796_Fig2_maya.mural.1.--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522613/1522613_10379112_1556553591796_Fig2_maya.mural.1.--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">mural fragment painted in maya style, found in the Plaza of the Columns, Teotihuacan</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Project Plaza of the Columns Compound</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Saburo&nbsp;Sugiyama</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522613/1522613_10379112_1556553867657_Fig3_OfferingA1[88749]--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522613/1522613_10379112_1556553867657_Fig3_OfferingA1[88749]--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1522613/1522613_10379112_1556553867657_Fig3_OfferingA1[88749]--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Assemblage of human bones found at Front A in the Plaza of the Columns, Teotihuacan</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Project Plaza of the Columns Compound</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Saburo&nbsp;Sugiyama</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
