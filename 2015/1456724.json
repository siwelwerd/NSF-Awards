 "awd_abstract_narration": "Almost all living organisms (including humans) are now living in a world altered by environmental change including climate change, habitat change, and exposure to exotic species (e.g., novel predators or diseases).  Some species are coping poorly with environmental change and declining in numbers, while others are thriving (e.g., invasive or urbanized pests). The relative ability of organisms to respond well behaviorally to novel conditions associated with environmental change often has critical effects on their success in the modern world. A better understanding of variation in behavioral responses to environmental change will be useful for enhancing the recovery of declining species, for more efficiently controlling pest species, and for anticipating ecological problems before new changes unfold. This project develops new theory to explain observed patterns and generate new predictions on the variation in behavioral response to human-induced rapid environmental change (HIREC).  It thus has potential to substantially advance our scientific understanding of one the most important ecological issues of our time.  \r\n\r\nThe project brings together a team of behavioral/evolutionary ecology modelers to develop theory to better understand variation in behavioral responses to environmental change.  To explain both adaptive and maladaptive responses to novel situations, the modeling team will employ novel extensions of signal detection theory, bet hedging (generalist-specialist) theory, adaptive plasticity theory, and theory on adaptive learning.  The team will also integrate these modeling approaches in fresh ways to generate novel insights for both basic behavioral ecology and for understanding responses to environmental change. Finally, the modelers will collaborate with empiricists to review relevant empirical literature and to write conceptual overview papers on behavioral responses to environmental change.  The project offers abundant opportunities for training a new generation of young scientists on the interface between math and biology.  The project will also include workshops that will involve not just the team and mentees, but also dozens of other empiricists and applied scientists.  The project will create a new website that will feature: 1) summaries of the models, predictions, and implications, with 2) advice to empiricists on which models to apply to specific scenarios, and 3) computer code including user-friendly models suitable for use in undergraduate courses. Finally, the project will seek to collaboratively develop classroom modules for potential implementation as part of Next Generation Science Standards that have been adopted in much of the United States.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHuman activities have exposed virtually all organisms on the earth to novel circumstances that differ from the environments that the organisms originally evolved in.  These include new challenges like: climate change, changes in the organism\u2019s habitat (habitat loss, fragmentation and deterioration), and exposure to exotic \u2018enemies\u2019 (predators, diseases).  It also includes new opportunities; e.g., new valuable resources (new foods, new good habitat).  Many species are not doing well in the modern, human-altered world, but others are doing very well &ndash; indeed, so well that we consider them to be pests &ndash; invasive pests, urbanized pests. \n\nA major question in modern ecology is thus &ndash; what explains why some species (or some individuals within each species) in the modern world are doing so poorly and others so well.  The same question could be asked of different humans when faced with change.  One major factor influencing relative success in the modern world is the relative ability or tendency of different organisms to exhibit adaptive behavioral responses to the novel circumstances.  What explains why some organisms \u2018get it\u2019 and react appropriately to novel predators they have never seen before, while others do not and thus become easy victims of the novel predators?  What explains why some animals have adopted novel high value resources (foods or habitats) while others ignore or even avoid those resources?  How do we explain why some animals consume foods that are unhealthy (even toxic) while others ignore or avoid those \u2018foods\u2019?  Many hundreds of studies have studied differences in behavioral response to various kinds of environmental change, but this scientific field is only beginning to develop a general theory to explain the observed patterns.\n\nOur project developed a general, conceptual framework for explaining the variations in ability to respond to change.  Our framework revolves around the concept of evolutionary mismatch that can result in evolutionary \u2018traps\u2019.  We posit that organisms have evolved adaptive \u2018cue-response\u2019 systems for responding to options in their environment.  For a simple example, imagine that when organisms see/smell A, it means food, but if they see/smell B, it more likely means danger.  If a new food looks/smells similar to A, and new dangers look/smell like B, then even though the organism is seeing these foods or dangers for the first time, the organism should respond well.  A problem arises if after environmental change, some novel things (animals, plants) that look/smell similar to A are now not food, or even dangerous. The organism would approach and attempt eat something that could be toxic (e.g. marine plastics) or dangerous (an exotic predator).  Or, if something that looks/smells like B is now safe.  The organism might waste a lot of time avoiding things that do not need to be avoided.\n\nWe developed a general mathematical approach to address this intuitive idea and then developed a series of specific mathematical models to predict which species should respond better to environmental change &ndash; depending on the species\u2019 evolutionary history and the specific type and pattern of environmental change.  The types of situations we addressed include responses to: exotic predators, novel situations that are safe-but-appear-dangerous (e.g., presence of ecotourists), habitat change, climate change, pollutants, and combinations of these novel stressors (\u2018multiple stressors\u2019).  The responses include immediate behavioral responses, and also longer-term adjustments via learning, and social learning, including from parents to offspring.\n\nThe project included collaboration with theoreticians from around the world, and training of postdoctoral scientists and graduate students.  Results were described in publications, scientific talks, including plenary talks at major conferences, and in classroom lecture materials.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew Sih"
