The glass properties can be changed by manipulating the microscopic forces between the molecules that make up the glass. Learning how to better control the distribution of these microscopic forces and how they evolve under various loading conditions is an important technological challenge.  This projects aims to visualize and determine the forces and construct models for the glass. The understanding gained through these studies will have very broad impact with the potential to change industrial manufacturing practices.  Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research and outreach and conference programs will benefit student and postdoctoral researchers and industries in the up-state New York area.\r\n\r\nThe deformation of disordered dense colloidal suspensions is governed by the nonlinear behavior of inhomogeneous stress networks that develop within the material in response to applied stresses. Determining how evolution of these local stress networks governs bulk rheological behaviors remains an outstanding scientific challenge. A key hurdle for developing this understanding is the lack of methods for experimentally measuring the local stresses within suspensions. In this project, a novel method - Stress Assessment from Local Structural Anisotropy (SALSA)- will enable groundbreaking capabilities for determining stresses associated with sample volumes that extend down to the single particle scale. In combination with a newly developed confocal rheometer device, pioneering experiments including, indentation, compression, shear, and biaxial shear are being conducted to quantifying how inhomogeneous stress networks collude to govern the bulk mechanical behavior of dense disordered colloidal suspensions. The application of SALSA is also being extended to more complicated interparticle potentials arising from depletion interactions. This extended capability is being used to study how crack propagation is altered as the gel that it is traveling through approaches a percolation threshold. In addition to being excellent model systems, colloids are an important technology in and of themselves.  In particular, controlling the jamming of colloidal suspensions is important for processing products ranging from toothpastes to paints. As such, the findings made through this project will have very broad impact with the potential to change practices in both the scientific and industrial communities.",
