 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF Partnerships for Learning and Adaptation Networks:  Institutions of Higher Education (PLAN-IHE) funding track is designed to expand the application of proven-successful gender-equity initiatives for STEM faculty through networked adaptation of a specific program or initiative.  Careful evaluation is expected to expand understanding of such initiatives across institutions and institution types.\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on producing policy changes to support gender equity and create culture change within the South Dakota state university system.  This project will include six institutions: South Dakota State University (SDSU), the University of South Dakota, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology, Northern State University, Dakota State University, and Black Hills State University.  This project has system wide leadership commitment and involves teams of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty in the policy review and development.  The model, if successful, could be adapted to other higher education systems.  It is expected that this project will result in: evidence of effective top-down change mechanisms in higher education; amended or new policies that promote gender equity in STEM; and contributions to the research on processes for systemic change in higher education.\r\n\r\nThis project will test the proposition that the central establishment of equity policy and indicators at the system level is required not only to demonstrate improvement in diversity but to actualize it (Blackmore, 2011; Castilla, 2008; Kalev, Kelly and Dobbin, 2006).  Research from industry indicates the effectiveness of \"top-down\" change for increased gender equity.  By implementing and assessing this process in academia, new evidence and subsequent models for centralized change will be produced for use beyond this state system.  In this project, Scott's model (1987) of change is used to demonstrate that change is most effectively implemented through policy driven by a central authority.  The project will expand and assess understanding of the probability of gender equity improvement in higher education state systems through policy implementation by a centralized authority.  This work will also establish evidence for how centralized policies can change individual faculty assessment practices across a higher education system, linking the system and institutional level in Scott's theory of change.  In addition, this project will contribute to the knowledge base on how centralized policies can change individual norms in career planning and aspirations, linking the system, institutional, and individual level in Scott's theory of change.  This project builds on previous ADVANCE work at the University of Maryland in policy analysis, and work completed at Montana State University to solicit policy innovation. \r\n\r\nThe ADVANCE PLAN program track supports projects that promote the adaptation and implementation of previously effective ADVANCE programs in new contexts and the testing of innovative strategies to promote the participation, success, and advancement of women in STEM academic careers.  PLAN projects also contribute to the knowledge base on gender equity in STEM academic careers.",
