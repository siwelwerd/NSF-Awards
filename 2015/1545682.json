The award will support travel awards to students, post-docs and young investigators from underrepresented groups. To promote networking and professional socialization for these awardees, funds will also support a new mentoring program to ensure a positive and productive conference experience for the young scholars. \r\n\r\nThe mentoring program will match each young scholar with a more experienced scholar in the field, one with similar research interests. Through an organized meeting at the start of the conference with their mentors, mentees will have the opportunity to forge new professional relationships and broaden their academic network. The young scholars will also be promoted at the conference by being acknowledged during an awards ceremony. Mentors will also support their mentees by attending the young scholars' presentations. These activities are intended to ensure that attending the CDS 2015 conference is a positive and productive experience for young scholars from traditionally underrepresented groups, and to increase the likelihood that attending the conference will yield a positive impact that endures beyond the conference itself.",
