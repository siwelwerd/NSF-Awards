 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the transfer a collection of reptiles, amphibians, and fishes from West Texas A&M University (WTAMU) to the Biodiversity Research and Teaching Collections (BRTC) at Texas A&M University (TAMU).  The WTAMU collection consists of more than 15,100 amphibian and reptile specimens and ca. 30,000 fish specimens. It is in danger of being lost, but has great scientific importance. The WTAMU collection contains holdings from West and North Texas that fill gaps in knowledge of species distributions. An outcome of the project will be a properly curated teaching and regional reference collection at WTAMU for use in zoology courses and by natural resource agencies. Graduates from WTAMU are employed as biologists for these agencies, with the expectation of skills at specimen identification.  Linkages created during this project will enhance the usefulness of both WTAMU and BRTC collections.\r\n\r\nThe BRTC is an appropriate repository for the WTAMU collections. The BRTC Division of Amphibians and Reptiles (101,000 specimens) is 12th largest in the USA and fully georeferenced. The Division of Fishes (660,000 individual specimens, catalogued across 44,565 lots) ranks 20th in size, is online and is 80 percent georeferenced.  A unique feature of the WTAMU collection is that sympatric fishes, amphibians and other reptiles were collected during studies of ecology and conservation of turtles. It contains at least 2,060 freshwater turtles representing 34 genera and 14 genera represented by more than 5 specimens each. There are 719 specimens of map turtles in the genus Graptemys, including 312 specimens of the endangered Cagle's map turtle, G. caglei.  The project will support two graduate students and multiple undergraduate workers who will gain extensive curatorial experience and understanding of the importance of collections.  With this project, new material will be incorporated into outreach activities through the Texas Master Naturalist Program, Project Wild, Flying Wild, Science and Civics, and the Leopold Education Project. Data from these collections will be made available on local, national, and international biodiversity data resources, including VertNet, the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, and iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/), ensuring accessibility to researchers and the public.",

Biodiversity collections also form the foundation for research, teaching, and service in the disciplines of organismal biology. Our understanding of how biodiversity is changing across Earth, how organisms evolved and are related, monographic treatises, field guides, environmental assessments all ultimately rely on specimens and associated data that reside in natural history collections. Our project, ?CSBR: Ownership Transfer: Rehabilitation and digitization of a significant collection of amphibians, reptiles, and fishes through institutional networking? was aimed at rehabilitating important collections of amphibians, reptiles, and fishes that formed the natural history collections at West Texas A&amp;M University. Over three years, our team transferred the bulk of these important collections to the Biodiversity Research and Teaching Collections (BRTC, formerly TCWC) at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station. The WTAMU collection consists of &gt;15,100 amphibian and reptile specimens and ~30,000 fish specimens. Before this CSBR grant, the institution lacked capacity to adequately curate their large collection. The collection, which has great scientific importance, was in danger of being lost. It contained at least 2,060 freshwater turtles&nbsp;in 34 genera; 14 genera represented by more than 5 specimens each. There are 719&nbsp;<em>Graptemys</em>&nbsp;specimens, and 312 specimens of the endangered&nbsp;<em>G. caglei.</em>&nbsp;WTAMU also had large series of other geographically restricted turtles that are species of conservation concern. A number of important outcomes emanated from this NSF-CSBR. Here we list 4: 1) BRTC increased its holdings of amphibians and reptiles by 4,031 specimens and holdings of fishes by 3,341 lots (16,571 specimens). Curation is ongoing and about 50% more of the WTAMU material will be recurated and catalogued in the post-project period.; 2)&nbsp;Adding the WTAMU material to the BRTC increased BRTC holdings of turtles by 30%, from 4800 to 6800.; 3) At the BRTC during the three-year project period 9 undergraduate students worked as paid and unpaid interns and student workers on this project learning curatorial techniques. At WTAMU, two graduate students and more than 4 undergraduate students worked in the specimen transfer and rehabilitating the important collection that remained at WTAMU for teaching and research.; 4) At WTAMU and BRTC this CSBR facilitated acquisition of a new system of tanks for specimen storage that will last for decades into the future.; 5) Curators, graduate students and undergraduate students published and presented collections-based research during the project period. By all measures, this NSF-CSBR fulfilled all project objectives and exceeded our goals in rehabilitating the important collections at WTAMU and enhancing their usefulness to a broad community of users.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/17/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lee&nbsp;A&nbsp;Fitzgerald</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1458281/1458281_10384721_1545071820122_IMG_3219--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1458281/1458281_10384721_1545071820122_IMG_3219--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"New tank system\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1458281/1458281_10384721_1545071820122_IMG_3219--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"New tank system\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">New tank system for turtle and other large specimens at Biodiversity Research and Teaching Collections.
