The project at Hinds Community College - Utica seeks to establish the foundation for a \"Cohesive Community College STEM Institutional Transformation Academy\". The goals of the project are: to establish summer bridge programs, to strengthen the 2-year STEM curriculum at the college, and to facilitate entrance of students into 4-year STEM programs.\r\n\r\nActivities that are part of this project are: meetings with the advisory boards and partnering school districts and universities for planning purposes; faculty development and training in redesigning of science, mathematics, and computer science courses; a two- week summer pre-college bridge program for rising 11th graders; a five-week summer pre-college component for entering  STEM freshman; and collaborations with partnering 4-year institutions, such as Jackson State University and Alcorn University. The project will be guided by an on-going evaluation.",

The goals of the one-year planning grant were to establish Summer Bridge programs, to strengthen the 2-year science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) curriculum at the college, and to facilitate entrance of students into 4-year STEM programs. Additionally, HCCUC was awarded supplemental funding to create an Institute for STEM Academic Research. The Institute&rsquo;s overall goal was to strengthen the research capacity of faculty at HCCUC, in order create a campus environment that is conducive to promoting research and scholarly activities.

Part of the camp included visiting NASA Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, Mississippi.

Five STEM faculty participated in training that focused on the Flipped STEM Classroom.
