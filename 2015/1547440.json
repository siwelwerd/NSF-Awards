 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of wireless communication on the quality of our lives and on our economy cannot be overstated.  While network operators and researchers have done a tremendous job to improve the capacity of existing networks, there is a strong need to explore new options to support the exponentially growing wireless Internet traffic.  This research will investigate a completely new spectrum in the mm-wave band that could enable Gigabit links for mobile users, allowing network operators to expand capacity in a graceful manner.  Up to now, mm-wave communication has been mostly limited to either point-to-point links or to short-range communication for fixed terminals. Using mm-wave radios for mobile communication requires a complete rethinking and co-design of the circuits, antennas, packages, and systems and protocols. This research will explore the design of mm-wave circuits and systems at 120 GHz, enabling large arrays of radios to communicate with very high data rates (> 10 Gbps) over relatively long ranges (hundreds of meters). Compared to research below 100 GHz, this area is relatively unexplored, with only about a dozen demonstrations of working transceivers. The research team will investigate system and circuit architectures to support beam forming, beam nulling, multi-user MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output), allowing efficient spectrum re-use through spatial filtering and interference rejection. Novel circuit design concepts will be prototyped in 28 nm CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Silicon) technology along with GaN (Gallium Nitride) transistors for high power transmission. Today's mm-wave transmitters are extremely inefficient when the waveform has a high peak to average ratio (2% average efficiency), whereas the proposed transmitter architectures will increase both the output power and efficiency by an order of magnitude. The range of mm-wave systems realized in CMOS, particularly without the use of lens, will also be increased from a few meters to hundreds of meters. This research will enable the exploitation of completely untapped spectrum for 5G cellular and beyond applications.\r\n\r\nThe technical objective of the proposed collaborative research project is to focus on circuit and system level realization of a hardware platform that can enable the study of optimal beam forming and beam nulling (interference cancellation), while allowing practical measurements to be carried out on the propagation characteristics of indoor and outdoor channels above 100 GHz. Specifically, the PI, co-PI and a team of researchers will design and implement key building blocks for the transceiver to enable measurement and characterization of communication above 100 GHz. This project involves four main thrust areas to be investigated. The first thrust area will focus on transmitter circuit design and integration challenges and explore technology limits for silicon-based power amplifiers for MIMO applications in CMOS, especially above 100 GHz. The second thrust will provide insight regarding the integration of GaN transistors with CMOS to allow for high-density logic for digital signal processing and waveform shaping, and high breakdown voltage GaN devices for power generation. The third thrust will focus on antenna and system architectures to support beam forming with special attention to solving problems regarding LO (local oscillator) generation and distribution and finding the optimal configuration to minimize power consumption in a large array. The final thrust area will focus on investigating system level integration challenges from the sub-modules developed in the other thrust areas to produce a 120GHz transceiver.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Wireless communication is an indispensable aspect of our modern lives, and fast and reliable mobile Internet access has become an important economic driver in our information society.  As the number of smartphones, tablets, laptops and traditional PCs equipped with wireless modems increases, a significant fraction of all Internet traffic data is wireless.  Most wireless networks are already at capacity and the quality of service offered by the wireless infrastructure is far inferior to wired networks. To address the future needs for spectrum, a radically new approach is needed.  This research was focused on the potential benefits of moving to a much higher carrier frequency &gt;100 GHz, about 20X higher than today?s networks, where spectrum is plentiful and interference can be managed through spatial diversity.  Similarly, basestations can be deployed that use the mm-wave band to form point-to-point links to serve as a backhaul, reducing the cost to deploy and maintain these basestations.   Several challenges in enabling this vision will be addressed, namely circuit level innovation to improve the efficiency of mobile transmitters, architectures for the basestation to form smart beam forming with multiple users, and the design and realization of a technology platform for performing channel measurements for carriers &gt; 100 GHz.\n \nThis research project was divided into two interrelated thrusts. In the first thrust, we foused on transmitter design.  The team at UC Berkeley investigated power amplifier and transmitter architectures that are more amenable to high efficiency operation under typical conditions.  A new power amplifier unit operating at 80 GHz was designed and characterized using a novel architecture.  Instead of forming the transmitted waveform in a linear fashion, which results in poor efficiency, the transmitted waveform is constructed from \"digital\" sub-units, power amplifiers that are much simpler and can only output 5 different states, with unit output power varying as (-2, -1, 0, 1, 2), where a negative power corresponds to transmitting a waveform out of phase.  By combining many of these basic elements, both in-phase and in quadrature-phase, many more complex constellations can be formed, including ones that support more spectrally efficiency modulations (such as 16-QAM or 64-QAM).  Moreover, due to the redundancy in the way that constellation points can be formed, we have the liberty of choosing the best combinations to minimize interference.  To prove this, we built an array of transmitters and combined signals in space.  The spatial variation in transmitted power is measured and we show that we can reduce underside leakage into other spatial directions significantly without compromising the output power of the array. This work is highlighted in the Ph.D. dissertation of Nai-Chung Kuo as well as in peer reviewed publications.  \n \nIn a second thrust, we focused on transceiver design at 120 GHz using industrial 28nm CMOS technology.  By operating at a high carrier frequency, and designing very broadband circuit stages, with over 14 GHz of bandwidth, we were able to demonstrate extremely fast modulation, 50 Gb/s per channel.  A complete two channel transceiver was designed to excite two polarizations of space, or two propagating modes of a waveguide, each at over 50 Gbps. The integrated circuit system is complex and includes all of the circuitry needed for a wireless demonstration, including a high-speed digital generator, up-conversion stages, and a transmitter, and a low noise receiver, wideband mixer, a wideband baseband amplifier, and pad drivers.  The chip also includes the generation of a low-noise oscillator for driving the modulator and de-modulators.  Special care ws put into energy efficiency and wideband operation, and we estimate that the entire link can be run with less than 10 pJ/bit of energy.  To put this number into perspective, it is about 100-1000 times lower than today?s wireless LAN systems, although the range is much lower. If an array of transmitters were employed to get the same range, we still estimate about 10X lower energy consumption and much less interference, due to the high directive nature of antennas at this frequency.  This work also helped us to establish a multi-university DARPA / SRC JUMP research center called ComSenTer, in collaboration with UC Santa Barbara.  The center is building on our previous NSF work and under center funding, we have demonstrated that our NSF designed chip can work up to 40 Gbps per channel.  We expect even higher performance in future iterations.\n \n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/18/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ali Niknejad"
