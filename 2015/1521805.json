Craig Taylor\r\nTitle:  International Conference on Exotic Forms of Silicon\r\n\r\nThe International Conference on Exotic Forms of Silicon will be held during July 13-17, 2015 at the Colorado School of Mines in Golden, Colorado.  This conference will discuss new ways to create and produce unique forms of silicon, an element abundant in the earth?s crust, to enable future breakthroughs in the areas of microelectronics and renewable energy production.  Fifteen world leaders in silicon research have agreed to participate in this conference. The conference will also support the participation of 20 graduate students and postdoctoral research associates who are positioned to be future leaders of this field.\r\n\r\nSilicon is an earth-abundant, non-toxic element that the base material for semiconducting devices.  If alternative molecular forms of silicon (Si) can be made with high purity in thin film form, then these new silicon materials may have significant potential to drive the next 50 years of microelectronic, optoelectronic, and energy harvesting device development.  This conference will bring together 15 internationally prominent researchers in silicon materials research, mostly based in the United States, to discuss common problems and potential transformative breakthroughs to enable the next generation of microelectronic, optoelectronic, and energy harvesting materials and devices, and to drive US-led innovation in this area.  Structures to be discussed include: 1) forms of silicon created under high pressure that are metastable at ambient pressure;  2) single layers of Si (silicene);  3) clathrate Si, which has been studied for superconducting and thermoelectric properties but not for semiconductor applications; 4) nanostructured forms of Si (nanodots and nanowires), including those composed of diamond Si; and 5) porous Si.  The conference will also provide support for the participation of 20 graduate students and postdoctoral research associates, including student from under-represented groups at Fisk University, as part of a collaborative relationship with the Renewable Energy Materials Research Science and Engineering Center at the Colorado School of Mines.",
