 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader  impact/commercial  potential  of this Small Business  Technology  Transfer Phase I project will be the development of a new biological route, based on microbial co- cultures,   for   efficient   production   of   an   environmentally friendly (eco-friendly)   mixture   of   biopolymers   for revegetation and erosion control applications, with a $375 million potential market. Tackifying polymers (adhesive-like materials) are widely used to stabilize loose soils/mulches  and  promote  revegetation  via  aggregation  and  water  retention.  This project will focus on producing an eco-friendly biopolymer mixture of microbial polyamino acids and polysaccharides that has improved properties compared to conventional tackifiers, providing superior adhesion and water retention. Despite promising potential and market demand for more effective bio-based tackifiers, these microbial  biopolymers  have  never  been  investigated  for  use  in  this  application,  as current   fermentation   methods   for  producing   them   are  not  economical.   The   key innovation in this project entails engineering microbial co-cultures to produce relatively expensive  biopolymer  precursors  in-situ  from  beet  molasses,  an  inexpensive  and renewable   feedstock,   resulting   in   dramatic   cost   reductions.   Beyond   biopolymer production, the proposed approach of engineering co-cultures for in-situ precursor production  (ISPP)  is potentially  transferrable  to many  other  bioprocesses,  and  could offer  more  efficient,  cost-effective  routes  for  producing  other  bio-based  fuels  and chemicals.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this Phase I research project are to i) implement, experimentally characterize, and model co-culture prototypes to demonstrate technoeconomic feasibility of biopolymer production with this approach, and ii) validate the performance of these biopolymers  in  revegetation  and  erosion  control  applications.  Completion  of  these objectives  will  demonstrate  proof-of-concept,  and  represent  important  technical milestones   towards   commercializing   this   technology.   The   proposed   approach   of engineering synthetic microbial consortia represents a distinct shift from the conventional paradigm   of   utilizing   single-species   monocultures   for   bioprocessing   and   offers substantial potential cost-savings through in-situ precursor production and process consolidation. Despite these potential benefits, synthetic microbial consortia for bioprocessing have not been explored in a commercial context due to the level of high technical risk entailed. Building on prior NSF-funded academic research in engineering consortia  for  cellulosic  biofuel  production,  this  project  will  implement  microbial  co- cultures  capable  of  producing  polyamino  acids  /  polysaccharides  through  ISPP  and perform a preliminary investigation of the interplay between ecological interactions, environmental  conditions,  and  key  performance  metrics  (such  as  titer,  yield,  and biopolymer  composition).  This  project  will  also  investigate  the  novel  application  of polyamino acids / polysaccharides as bio-tackifiers for revegetation and erosion control, enabled by the potential cost-savings of the proposed co-culture.",
