In particular, our existing drinking water treatment systems are poorly equipped to deal with contamination from organic pollutants. This project will develop and optimize a chlorine photolysis advanced oxidation process that could be used to upgrade existing chlorine-based disinfection systems in response to decreased source water quality. The photolysis of chlorine, the most commonly used drinking water disinfectant in the United States, produces a series of reactive oxidants, including hydroxyl radical and ozone, which are capable of simultaneously oxidizing numerous organic compounds and inactivating chlorine-resistant pathogens. The hypothesis underlying this research effort is that the irradiation wavelengths and solution conditions (e.g., pH) in a chlorine photolysis-based advanced oxidation process can be optimized to maximize organic contaminant removal while minimizing disinfection by-product production. The research themes will be integrated into formally assessed educational initiatives that will: (1) foster enthusiasm for the field of environmental engineering by engaging K-12 and undergraduate students in a novel interactive learning environment; (2) increase the number of highly qualified students from diverse backgrounds pursuing careers related to environmental engineering and water quality; and (3) raise public awareness of water quality issues.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the research plan are to: (1) characterize the formation of reactive species during chlorine photolysis using UV light and light in the solar spectrum; (2) assess the formation of conventional disinfection byproducts during chlorine photolysis; and (3) identify changes in dissolved organic matter and the formation of novel disinfection byproducts during chlorine photolysis using two complementary state-of-the-art mass spectrometry techniques. This transformative work will provide the first systematic evaluation of chlorine photolysis for contaminant oxidation and disinfection by-product formation. Unique project outcomes will be: (1) the development of a kinetic model that can be used to predict reactive species production and target contaminant oxidation during chlorine photolysis, and (2) an increased understanding of the formation of disinfection by-products and changes in dissolved organic matter composition on a molecular level during reaction with chlorine in the presence and absence of light.",
