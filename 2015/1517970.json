 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will search for red giant stars along the plane of our Milky Way galaxy, using radio telescopes. These stars have the remarkable characteristic of acting like ultra-bright lasers, emitting radio waves due to the molecule Silicon Monoxide (SiO), which is found in the environment surrounding this type of star. Because of this unique feature, radio telescopes can detect these stars at great distances, even when they are hidden in clouds of dust and gas.   The investigators will use the stars to study the structure of our galaxy and understand how our Galaxy is being pulled by the gravity of other nearby galaxies and clusters of stars in our Galaxy.  By looking for unusual motions of stars in the galaxy, the investigators can detect the past collisions of dwarf galaxies with our Galaxy.  \r\n\r\nThe investigators will test models for a key feature seen in our Galaxy, \"the bar\", a linear structure extending on both sides of the center of our Galaxy.   The bar is thought to partially result from the gravitational pull of clusters of stars and gas. These clusters merged to become part of our Milky Way.   In addition to the bar, our Galaxy also shows a \"bulge\" near the center, where stars reach high orbits.  In our region of the galaxy the stars are concentrated in a disk.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will provide student participation opportunities and education within the science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) disciplines. This includes finding minority students to work on the project and concentrating on strengthening female participation. Through this research award, graduate students will be trained and additional undergraduate students will be have to opportunity for summer research jobs.\r\n\r\nSpecific science goals include the modeling of the dynamics and the structure of the Galactic bulge and the central galactic disk. This data will allow defining the relationship of the bar to the populations of the Galactic plane and Center, and the effect of the strongly boxy potential of the bulge on dynamics, and the presence of a ``long'' bar. In particular, both N-body models and self-consistent models will be compared with direct dynamical measurements from the stellar maser velocities. From near-infrared spectra elemental abundances and properties of the circumstellar envelopes will be determined. \r\n\r\nThe investigator's studies will also be important for understanding the structure of all spiral galaxies.  The Galactic bulge provides a unique laboratory, as it is the only place where detailed studies are possible for the processes taking place in many disk galaxies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Bulge Asymmetries and Dynamic Evolution (BAaDE) project is designed to investigate the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way bulge and bar components.  We are achieveing this by observing spectral line emission from the Silicon monoxide molecule (SiO).  In evolved stars, which are nearing the end of their lifes, SiO maser emission (microwave laser emission) naturally is formed, making the SiO emission act like beacons throughout the galaxy.  The bright emission allows line of sight velocities to be measured to thousands of stars.  Their velocities are determined by the gravitational potential in the first place, and thus gives us information of the structure and potential of the stars in the central regions of the Milky Way.  In addition, by comparing our SiO emission detection statistics with other properties of the stars, we can distinguish between different stellar populations and their chemistries.  This informs us about the history of the star formation in the galaxy, like where and how different types of stars were formed or perhaps incorporated into the galaxy by encounters with other, smaller galaxies.  For example, most of our stars are shown to be oxygen-rich while a small set is carbon-rich.  We find a set of candidate carbon-rich stars not previously known in the bulge region. \n\nFour graduate students have been trained in data analysis and observations thorough this project, two out of which have graduated with their theses based on data from the BAaDE project.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ylva Pihlstrom"
