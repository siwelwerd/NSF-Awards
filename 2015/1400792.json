 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations to successfully complete high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  The LSAMP Bridge to the Baccalaureate (B2B) funding opportunity provides support for historically underrepresented minority STEM students who begin their instruction at a community college with the intent to transfer into 4-year STEM degree programs in addition to other infrastructure support such as STEM faculty professional development. The North Carolina STEM Alliance (NCSA), under the leadership of Central Piedmont Community College (CPCC), is a community college alliance consisting of CPCC, Davidson County Community College (DCCC) and Guilford Technical Community College (GTCC).  The alliance will implement a variety of activities that could potentially increase the participation of underrepresented minorities and veterans in STEM disciplines and ensure that all populations have the opportunity to succeed in STEM careers thereby increase the nation's competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the project are to increase the number of underrepresented minority (URM) students who transfer to university STEM programs.  The NCSA will reach this goal through targeted engagement, career exploration, and dual enrollment.   Activities that will be implemented to mitigate barriers for community college students, particularly URMs, include: contextualized curriculum, targeted academic support, coaching and proactive advising, research and career experiences, professional development, K-16 curriculum alignment and faculty professional development.  Presentations and scholarly publications produced by the project will be shared with national community college and other workforce stakeholder organizations.",

The baseline was calculated using 5 years of accumulated data. According to the 3rd party evaluator, projections using accumulated actuals through a theoretical year 5, projects all partners to meet their targets by the 5th year that URM STEM transfers were accumulated.\n\nSubgoal 1:  Increase the number of URM students enrolled in STEM dual enrollment pathways by 50%.  All partners experienced higher than expected dual-enrollment and exceeded their targets.  State policy changes enabling more high school students to take college courses had a positive impact on this metric.\n\nSubgoal 2:  Increase the percentage of students who attempt developmental math courses at CPCC, DCCC and GTCC to 70%, 70% and 85% respectively.  The NC Multiple Measures for Student Placement Policy led to a significant decrease in the number of students required to satisfy developmental math prerequisites.  As a result, all partners failed to attain the original proposed targets.\n\nSubgoal 3:  Increase the number of URM students successfully completing STEM courses by 50%.  The partners exceeded the target in Science course completion, and all but one exceeded the Math course completion target.  The project baseline was calculated using 5 years of accumulated data.

All partners exceeded their URM STEM degree completion targets.\n\nFive primary activities were implemented to address student success barriers and to increase the number of students entering and completing STEM pathways at the alliance colleges as well as transfers to a STEM program at a four-year institution:\n\nActivity 1. Contextualized developmental courses, dedicated math coaching and support.  The STEM Prep curriculum was implemented for prospective URM STEM students.

Math Coaching provided supplemental instruction to Fellows (stipend receiving participants) in pre-calculus and calculus courses, as well as math intense STEM courses.\n\nActivity 2.  STEM Navigator-Proactive advising and student support.  Weekly workshops were attended by Fellows and aimed at improving readiness for STEM courses, increasing awareness of career opportunities, and gaining familiarity with emerging practices in STEM fields.\n\nActivity 3.  Undergraduate Research Activities and Career Experiences.  Fellows were provided the opportunity to conduct research related to their STEM major by pairing them with a STEM faculty member and via participation in Summer REUs at four-year universities.  Opportunities to present research projects were offered annually during a STEM Symposium and select Fellows presented at local, regional and national STEM conferences.  In additon, Fellows were able to better align their educational pathways with career goals by touring industry sites and speaking with professionals.\n\nActivity 4.  Faculty Professional Development.  NCSA provided  professional development opportunities for faculty research mentors via conferences and workshops.  Mentors attended the SPARC3 conference hosted by Gaston College and the NCSA presented a session on Preparing Students for Engaging in STEM Research.  The NCSA team also presented at a subsequent conference, sharing best practices for STEM Prep.  Mentors participated in an event hosted by CPCC and facilitated by the Director of Virginia Tech University's Multicultural Academic Opportunities program.  Rethinking Community College STEM, hosted by NCSA, was a workshop that provided an opportunity for STEM faculty to discuss strategies to promote student success in STEM courses.\n\nActivity 5.  Academic Pathway Connections:  K-12-Community College-University.  Fellows participated in regional university visits each semester to prepare for transfer to four-year universities. In addition, Fellows participated in community service events throughout the semester.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/05/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael G Horn"
