 "awd_abstract_narration": "Corrosion of reinforcing steel in concrete structures is one of the critical parameters in deterioration of concrete structures. It is hypothesized that reduction in grain size in steel can significantly reduce corrosion in reinforcing bars. Analytical and experimental studies will be pursued to correlate between grain size and level of corrosion. The experiments in this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will include putting the reinforcing steel in the simulated concrete environment. The grain size in steel will be altered using thermal cycles to determine effects of grain size on corrosion and mechanical properties. The reinforcing steel will be subjected to chloride contaminated concrete pore solution and the level of corrosion on the corroded steel bars will be assessed using different microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. Mechanical properties of the steel with different grain sizes will be obtained with standard tests. Cost analysis of the alteration of grain size will be pursued in this exploratory project to determine viability of the process.\r\n\r\nElectron backscatter diffraction technique to obtain quantitative microstructural map will be used for crystallographic nature of the steel specimens. This technique reveals grain size, grain boundary character, grain orientation, texture, and phase identity of the specimens. The microstructural map in an analytical model will allow predicting the pitting corrosion behavior of steel with different grain sizes. Physical and chemical composition of the steel will be obtained using scanning electrochemical microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical profiler. The analytical model will include pitting growth as a variable. Life cycle cost analysis will be pursued as related to grain size necessary to reduce corrosion. A procedure that is in a standard for cost analysis for measuring life cycle costs in buildings will be used for this purpose. The final results of this exploratory project will be to understand corrosion as related to grain size of steel exposed to environment of concrete.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research objective of this project was to test the hypothesis that the microstructure of the reinforcing steel bars has a significant effect on the corrosion of those bars in the concrete environment.  To test this hypothesis, the team used a novel and transformative inter-disciplinary methodology that involved testing the electrochemical behavior of steel with different grain sizes in chloride-free and chloride-contaminated simulated concrete pore solutions. Microscopic and spectroscopic analyses were used on the specimens to complement the electrochemical tests.  Results showed that microstructure alternation through heat-treatment influenced the electrochemical behavior of reinforcing steel in a concrete environment.  Both heat-treated specimens, with approximately twice finer and coarser grains with respect to the as-received specimens, indicated superior corrosion performance compared to the as-received specimens.  This was attributed to the better grain distribution throughout the heat-treated specimens compared to the as-received specimens.  The specimens with coarse grains showed the best corrosion resistance among other specimens.   Their corrosion current densities and potential values remained in the range of passive corrosion after 60 days exposure in chloride-contaminated pore solution.   The better corrosion resistance of the coarse specimens compared to the fine specimens was attributed to the lower free ferrite on the grain boundaries of these specimens which provided more ferrite to the pearlitic structure.  This observation led to an increase of the anode-to-cathode ratio in coarse specimens which significantly impacted the kinetics of corrosion.  Research results of this project provided a powerful example and emphasized the importance of microstructure on the corrosion behavior of metals.\n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/06/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Amir Poursaee"
