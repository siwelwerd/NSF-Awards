 "awd_abstract_narration": "Johns Hopkins University, Clemson University, and the University of Delaware propose to form a new NSF-supported Industrial/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) entitled the Advanced Mammalian Biomanufacturing Innovation Center (AMBIC) to address current and future challenges faced by US bio-pharmaceuticals manufacturing. The Advanced Mammalian Biomanufacturing Innovation Center (AMBIC) will bring together leading academic, industrial, and government biotechnologists with the goal of advancing cell culture manufacturing innovation at a pre-competitive research level.  AMBIC represents a unique opportunity to address technology challenges and bottlenecks in US biopharmaceutical manufacturing by bringing together leading researchers and innovators to implement transformative products and processes that will lead to a stronger, healthier, and more competitive biopharmaceutical industry.  In this way, AMBIC will be a critical catalyst towards maintaining national excellence in biopharmaceutical production by focusing on mammalian cell culture issues.  The three thrusts of AMBIC are as follows:\r\n1. Genome and Cellular Engineering of Mammalian Platform with the goal of developing advanced platforms with improved production capabilities.\r\n2.`Omics and Systems Biology for Mammalian Cells with the task of acquiring ?omics data and implementing standards of performance for the mammalian production platform\r\n3.Optimizing Bioreactor Control for Improved Cellular Performance with the objective of characterizing metabolic states and implementing advanced controls. \r\n\r\nThis project will support the planning meeting to engage partners from the biopharmaceutical industry and government to participate in AMBIC and develop a research and educational program for the center.  A planning meeting will help to identify major research challenges and to design a cutting edge research and educational program in mammalian biomanufacturing.  Furthermore, AMBIC will establish and maintain a pipeline of educated and motivated students at all levels for careers in biopharmaceutical manufacturing and development.  Collaborations with corporate partners will enable the students to work on the most pressing problems that the industry faces.  In addition, AMBIC will serve to engage and excite students from under-represented minority populations to pursue a career in life sciences, engineering, or related STEM fields. Through systems biology analysis, novel cell line development, and bioreactor optimization, AMBIC will provide innovative solutions to improve biomanufacturing efficiencies.  These advances will ultimately serve to lower overall health care costs for consumers and make biopharmaceuticals more affordable and available for a greater number of patients.",

AMBIC will bring together leading academic and industrial biotechnologists focused on mammalian cell culture manufacturing at a pre-competitive research level.  Through systems biology analysis, novel cell line development, and bioreactor optimization, this group will provide transformative solutions that can improve bioprocessing efficiency and lower biomanufacturing costs.
