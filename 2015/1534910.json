 "awd_abstract_narration": "DMREF: Deblurring our View of Atomic Arrangements in Complex Materials for Advanced Technologies\r\n\r\nNon-technical Description: As we try and find new technologies to solve some of mankind's toughest challenges such as abundant sustainable energy, environmental remediation, and health, we are increasingly seeking more and more complex materials.  We already have devices that turn sunlight into electricity and use sunlight to split water into precious hydrogen fuel, but issues such as device efficiency and cost mean that the current technologies cannot be taken to the vast scale needed for our modern needs. This puzzle may be solved by the use of advanced materials that perform their tasks - energy conversion, cancer cell killer, or whatever it may be - with greater efficiency.  This is inevitably leading us towards more complicated materials that consist of many different chemical elements and have engineered structures on multiple different length-scales from the atomic to the nano- and meso-scales all the way to macroscopic scales.  The problem is that, because of their complexity, it becomes very difficult to even characterize these materials when we have made them, let alone design and engineer them at the nanoscale.  Our usual tools based on the scattering of x-rays by crystals stop working for such nanoscale structures.  The problem is not that we lack powerful enough x-ray beams.  The problem is that the x-ray scattering signal from these complicated materials doesn't contain enough information to allow us to find a unique structure solution.  It is as if we are looking at complex patterns of atomic arrangements through blurry, steamed up glasses.  This project will bring greater clarity to this situation by marrying together advances in applied mathematics from diverse areas such as image recognition, information theory and machine learning, which are having transformative impacts in commerce, law enforcement and so on, and applying them to the problem of recognizing atomic arrangements in materials of the highest complexity.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description: The approach will to solve multi-scale structures of materials by marrying together the latest advances in the processing of x-ray scattering data from nanomaterials, such as atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, with other sources of input information such as small angle scattering, EXAFS and other spectroscopies, as well as inputs from first principle theory such as DFT, but place them in a rigorous mathematical framework and a robust computational framework such that the information content in the data may be utilized to the greatest extent possible whilst taking into account uncertainties from statistical and systematic uncertainties.  The mathematical framework will utilize the latest developments in stochastic optimization, uncertainty quantification including function-space Bayesian methods, machine learning and image recognition.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe key outcome of this project is the development of the PDFitc.org website and the data analysis and materials discovery tools that it contains.\n\nThe website represents a major departure for the analysis of nanostructured materials using diffraction and atomic pair distribution function (PDF) methods. \n\nIn the past, data analysis programs would be downloaded to scientists' computers and run locally.  With our latest development, users upload their experimental (or calculated) x-ray/neutron diffraction data in the form of a \"pair distribution function (PDF), to the PDFitc platform.  Cloud-based Apps then carry out useful analysis tasks on the data.  However, the data themselves are stored in a database in the cloud, along with metadata about the data, in such a way that in the future it will be possible to carry out machine learning activities on the uploaded data, which will speed the discovery process, for example by providing users with recommender systems for how others handled similar data.  This is not possible in the old paradigm of users running analysis software on their own computers, as all the resulting analysis is stored on local users' computers.  \n\nThe PDFitc.org website currently contains three applications. \n\ndThe first of them implements the spacegroupMining ML model that was developed jointly between Billinge and Du under this grant that, given a PDF, yields a rank-ordered list of likely space-groups for the material that produced the PDF. \n\nThe second implements structureMining, an analysis approach that was also developed as part of this award.  In this app a user uploads their measured  PDF and their best guess at its chemical composition (which may include wild-card characters) and the app will return a rank ordered list of likely structural candidates from a database, including the structural parameters.  \n\nThe third App is a new statistical approach for comparing a large set of PDFs, for example, a temperature series, and finding changes in the PDFs by using the Pearson cross-correlation measure.  It was also developed as part of this award but is not yet published.\n\nThe research towards the development of the website also motivated further advances in applied mathematics and data science, including new data processing algorithms and optimization methods which may have broad interests.
