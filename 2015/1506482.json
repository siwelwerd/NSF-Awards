 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, various inventions and innovations have made it possible to produce dilute gases of atoms at extremely low temperature, essentially the coldest matter in the known Universe.  By reducing the temperature of these gases, one reduces their disorder, allowing for two exciting scientific prospects.  First, the low disorder implies that measurements made on conditions that effect the atomic gas--such as electric and magnetic field, or acceleration and rotation--will have very little noise, allowing for more precise measurements.  Second, the atomic gas can be manipulated in a way that the interactions between atoms in the gas is similar to the interactions between electrons in a solid material.  Through such mimicry, one can investigate properties that materials have been predicted to exhibit, but that have been obscured due to the excess disorder and temperature of real materials.  This project promotes the progress of science and technology by advancing toward both these prospects.  The principal and co-investigator, along with graduate students and postdocs, will develop techniques that allow for precise measurements with and of atomic gases.  The researchers will also investigate properties of atomic gases that mimic the magnetic properties of complex materials, contributing in general to the understanding of magnetism in materials and devices that underlie so much of today's (and tomorrow's) information technology.  The central involvement of young scientists in this work, including several from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in the physical sciences, directly contributions toward the training of a diverse scientific workforce in the United States.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, this project focuses on the behavior of cold gases of rubidium and potassium atoms that move within the spatially periodic intensity pattern generated at the intersection of several coherent beams of light.  The optical pattern generates a spatially periodic potential that resembles the crystal potential in which electrons move in solid-state materials.  The optical configuration can be rapidly tuned, resulting in various dynamics within the atomic gas.  Such dynamics, which are the subject of the present investigation, allow for coherent control of atomic motion within the optical potential (relevant to precision measurements through matter-wave interferometry) and also reveal properties of materials in which the crystal structure tends to inhibit order and transport (geometric frustration, relevant to materials science).  To improve one's ability to measure such dynamics, this project also investigates how methods of computational imaging (the improvement of imaging through computational methods) may be imported to the study of atomic gases.  Finally, spin dynamics are used as a tool to measure how atoms diffuse within complex optical potentials, through an adaptation of methods used in magnetic resonance imaging, and also to isolate the effects of geometric frustration on atomic motion.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAcross science, it is common to try to understand a very complicated systems by first creating a very simplified representation of the system, one that stripped-down of unnecessary complexity, and studying the simplified system intensely and precisely.  In doing so, we gain insight on the key aspects of the complicated system.  In this project, we followed this methodology.  Our broad objective was to understand the properties of real solid-state materials, in which the combined effects of crystalline structure, electron motion, and electron interactions, combine to result in specific material properties, such as the electrical resistivity.  Rather than study solid-state materials directly, we have chosen to create a simplified version of a solid-state material, one in which cold gases of neutral atoms play the role of electrons, and in which patterns of light intensity (an \"optical lattice\") formed by intersecting several laser beams play the role of a solid-state crystal.  The advantage of this approach is that this artificial cold-atom crystalline material can be created in a way that all of its microscopic properties are simple and understood.  As a result, it is possible and worthwhile to make precise measurements of the macroscopic properties of this material, and then to test theories that connect the microscopic and macroscopic properties of many-body quantum mechanical systems.\nThe project produced several significant results.  A method for characterizing optical lattices by matter-wave diffraction was developed: analogous to x-ray crystallography, in which crystals formed of matter are analyzed by the diffraction of light waves, here, conversely, crystals formed of light are analyzed by the diffraction of matter waves.  A quantitative experimental test of theories of many-body quantum physics was conducted, with a level of precision that improves on all previous studies of such artificial cold-atom materials.  A new form of optical lattice was demonstrated, and the properties of interacting atoms trapped within such a lattice were studied.  Altogether, the project allowed experimental quantum simulation to be extended to more types of solid-state materials, and to achieve more precise, quantitative tests of theoretical understanding.\nThe project also supported interdisciplinary research in which new forms of optical imaging that make use of powerful algorithms for image reconstruction would be applied to the study of ultracold atomic gases.  The project focused on the method of Fourier Ptychography, in which a series of images taken while an objected is illuminated from different directions is combined to obtain a high resolution composite image.  Several improvements to the method were pursued, and protocols for applying the method to quantum gases were developed.\nThe project broadly impacts several areas of science and technology.  Specifically, the work advances the pursuit of quantum information science and the development of quantum information processors.  The work also advances the use of super-resolution imaging in several fields, including biological sciences.  In addition, the project provided scientific training to several students and postdocs, including several female scientists and members of other under-represented groups. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/31/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dan M Stamper-Kurn"
