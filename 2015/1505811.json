 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics.  The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high energy gamma-rays.  VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  This award supports scientists at Barnard College to carry out research with VERITAS.  The group will participate in both technical operations in support of the observatory and scientific investigations with a focus on studying emission from active galaxies, pulsar wind nebula, and gamma-ray bursts.  The Barnard College group is heavily engaged in education and outreach efforts.  They involve undergraduate students in astrophysics research with an emphasis on broadening the participation of women.  They are also involved in outreach efforts to high-school students in the New York City area.  \r\n\r\nVERITAS has embarked upon a broad program of Galactic and extragalactic source observations, as well as studies of signatures for new physics such as dark matter.  With this award the Barnard College group will participate in VERITAS observing and calibration campaigns and work on code development for improvements to VERITAS analysis techniques.  Their scientific program includes searching for high energy emission and variability in blazars, using pulsar wind nebula and multi-messenger approaches to investigate the origin of cosmic rays, and studying gamma-ray bursts.",

To date more than 200 sources have been discovered above 100 GeV, representing ten different classes of astrophysical objects. A major open question in astroparticle physics is what drives these cosmic accelerators and whether the gamma-ray emission results from processes involving acceleration of electrons or protons. VERITAS is an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope sensitive to gamma rays in the 85 GeV to 30 TeV band,&nbsp;and provides a tremendous improvement in sensitivity for TeV observations compared to any previous instrument available to US investigators. The principal objective of this proposal was to carry out particle astrophysics research at Barnard College (Attachment 1).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This grant supported the work of graduate students carrying out research on gamma-ray bursts. A significant outcome of the grant was the study of gamma-ray emission from the GRB 150323A. GRBs are thought to be powered by ultra-relativistic jets associated with the birth of a compact object. The bulk of the radiation from a GRB is typically received over several seconds, peaking at energies of a few 100 keV. VERITAS reported observations of the GRB 150323A at a redshift of 0.593 (3520 Mpc), first detected by Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). The VERITAS observations began only about 2 minutes after the prompt emission peaked at BAT energies. No statistically significant VHE gamma-ray flux was detected by VERITAS above 140 GeV, and a flux upper limit of approximately 1% of the prompt fluence was calculated. The proximity of GRB 150323A limits the attenuation by the extragalactic background light to about 50% in the energy range of 100 to 200 GeV. The non-detection of GRB 150323A at VHE energies allowed us to place interesting constraints on the GRB environment. (Attachment 2. Abeysekara, A. U., et al., \"A Strong Limit on the Very-high-energy Emission from GRB 150323A,\" The Astrophysical Journal (2018). DOI: &nbsp;10.3847/1538-4357/aab371).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This research grant supported the work of the PI and post-doctoral scholars carrying out research on blazars, a class of active galactic nuclei: objects powered by supermassive black holes, with ultra-relativistic jets (outflows of particles) pointed close to our line of sight. One significant outcome of this project was the reporting of the isolated gamma-ray flare in February 2014 from B2_1215+30 that was remarkable because of its extreme luminosity. The gamma-ray flux was sixty times brighter than ever measured before and returned to quiescent state within a day. This implies that the gammas rays were emitted in a region relatively small when compared to the size of the jet emerging from a black hole about hundred million times more massive than the Sun. The short timescale flux variability observed in B2_1215+30 may be explained as particle acceleration in relativistic shocks or through magnetic reconnection. Observations of blazars at TeV energies probe the innermost regions of these powerful accelerators where the bulk of their luminosity is emitted. (Attachment 3. Abeysekara, A. U., et al., \"A luminous and isolated gamma-ray flare from the blazar B2_1215+30,\" The Astrophysical Journal (2017). DOI: 10.3847/1538-4357/836/2/205).</p>\n<p>This research grant supported post-doctoral scientists who carried out multi-messenger studies with VERITAS and IceCube. VERITAS reported observations of a neutrino triplet region identified by a real-time neutrino search by the IceCube observatory on February 17, 2016. This was the first time that three muon-neutrino candidates were detected arriving within 100 s of one another, consistent with coming from the same point in the sky. Such triplet events are expected to be rare and unlikely to be random coincidence of background events. No gamma-ray excess was detected in the field viewed by VERITAS, and no likely electromagnetic counterpart was identified. VERITAS participated in this follow-up study along with six other observatories. (Attachment 4. Aartsen, M. G., et al., \"Multiwavelength follow-up of a rare IceCube neutrino multiplet,\" Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics&nbsp;(2017).
