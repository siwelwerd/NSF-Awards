Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Andrew T. Wilson is \"Algebraic Combinatorics.\" The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Pennsylvania, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. James Haglund.",
