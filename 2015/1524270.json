 "awd_abstract_narration": "The intensity of tropical cyclones is an active area of study due to the obvious implications for residents in coastal locations.  Despite years of research, models have been unable to consistently improve forecasting of intensity changes.  Among the many factors related to tropical cyclone intensity change is the topic of how the spiral rainbands that branch out from the core of a storm interact with the larger system.  In this postdoctoral research fellowship, the researcher will attempt to more realistically represent the multiple types of rainbands in a tropical cyclone and analyze those simulations to answer questions about how the rainbands interact with the overall system and work to strengthen or weaken the storm.\r\n\r\nThis award is for a numerical modeling study of the effect of spiral rainbands on tropical cyclone structure and intensity.  The researcher contends that prior modeling frameworks used to study rainbands do not allow for the simulation of both principal and distant rainbands because they do not consider vertical shear - what is known as a no-mean-flow condition.  In this project, a series of numerical simulations of tropical cyclones using the WRF model and including different environmental vertical wind shear conditions would be performed.  Three main tasks are indicated:  1) Perform a series of high-resolution numerical simulations under vertical wind shear that can simulate both principal and distant rainbands in which vertical wind shear will be allowed to stay unchanged or evolve over time, 2) Analyze the output of the simulations to quantify the dynamic and thermodynamic effects induced by principal and distant rainbands on tropical cyclone intensity and structure, and 3) Construct idealized but realistic diabatic heating structures that are consistent with principal and distant rainbands seen in numerical simulations in order to be used as forcing for a linear 3D model to further understand the effects of spiral rainbands on tropical cyclone intensity and structure.",
