One way to promote intentional career planning is through the use of an Individual Development Plans (IDP), a document that lists short- and long-term career goals and planned actions for achieving those goals.  Graduate departments that embrace IDPs will take a more comprehensive approach to career development, maximizing investments in graduate education. Graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, who use effectively designed discipline-specific IDPs will be better prepared for a wider range of careers and better positioned to address complex societal challenges.\r\n\r\nThe proposed team will use the I-Corps L curriculum to build and test a prototype IDP toolkit for the chemical sciences, including processes, templates, and career information resources, and to develop a roadmap for scaling the prototype.  Designed for iterative use, IDPs will facilitate: goal setting (long- and short-term), self-exploration (values, interests, and skills), career exploration, and identification and acquisition of needed knowledge, skills, and experience.  The effective implementation of IDPs, similar to other educational innovations, requires relevant material that is conveyed using scaffolded and interactive approaches.  Input from graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, and faculty in the chemical sciences, examples from other disciplines and sectors, social science research, and research on how people learn will be used to determine the desired qualities and characteristics, uses, and anticipated benefits of an IDP for the chemical sciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDeveloping Career Planning Resources for Chemical Scientists\n\nThe need for career planning and preparation for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars has been highlighted by numerous reports, surveys, and requirements from funding agencies.  The NSF I-Corps L grant accelerated discussions of whether the American Chemical Society (ACS) should address this need in the chemical sciences by developing resources for creating Individual Development Plans (IDPs). \n\n \n\nParticipation in the NSF I-Corps L program led the ACS team to decide to proceed with the ChemIDP project.  Critical career planning questions and key resources were identified by interviewing over 125 graduate students, postdoctoral scholars, faculty advisors, and others providing career guidance.  Use of entrepreneurial planning tools helped identify initial and long-term strategies, stakeholders, and partners.  The NSF I-Corps L program positioned ACS to rapidly develop workshops and an online career planning tool (see Figure 1. Graduate and Postdoctoral Chemist Ad 2015) that facilitate:\n\nExposure to a broad range of career areas\nIntroductions to the roles and responsibilities in those career areas, as well as the needed technical and professional skills; \nProgress to degree and career goals; and\nFormation of career development habits and skills.\n\n\nThe workshops and online tool provide guiding questions and activities to help graduate students and postdoctoral scholars with self-assessment, career exploration, skill-strengthening, and goal setting. Very positive initial feedback on the ChemIDP resources is building momentum for scaling and sustaining the project in the long-term.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe ChemIDP project launched by the NSF I-Corps L grant is poised to transform career development of graduate students and postdocs in the chemical sciences.  Input from people at 30 universities helped ACS respond to recommendations for IDPs in credible and flexible ways.  The workshops and online tool are designed to meet critical career planning needs for people who are pursuing different career goals throughout the stages of their career development.  The ChemIDP project does more than just deliver career information in an organized way.  It uses approaches that foster learning and professional development.  The next steps are to encourage graduate programs to take a more comprehensive and directed approach to the career development of their students and use ChemIDP resources.  With the meaningful and effective career planning that ChemIDP resources provide, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars in the chemical sciences will be prepared to successfully identify and pursue careers aligned with their values, skills and job market opportunities.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe ChemIDP project is designed to build human capacity.  Graduate and postdoctoral scholars who take the workshops and use the online tool will begin developing the skills and knowledge needed for pursuing a wide range of careers and for addressing complex societal challenges.  The ChemIDP workshops and online tool will give all graduate students and postdoctoral scholars access to a broad spectrum of career resources as well as the tools to plan and achieve their career goals. This will be of particular benefit to those with disadvantaged backgrounds, international students, as well as other typically underserved groups.\n\n \n\nEffectively designed disciplinary-based IDPs can help maximize the benefits of investments in graduate education and postdoctoral training, fostering U.S. competitiveness.  ACS has begun sharing the process of developing ChemIDP resources, along with insights learned, with other scientific organizations fostering career development.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jodi L Wesemann"
