 "awd_abstract_narration": "1541869 (Miller). This workshop will: 1) provide a forum to consider sustainability within the context of transitioning urban landscapes and economies, and 2) lead to a deeper understanding of the integrative nature of food, energy, and water systems within post-industrial urban environs (e.g., Detroit and Baltimore). Research on sustainability in maturing urban environments, yet with potential for future growth and development, provides an opportunity for setting and meeting sustainable goals. The pursuit of environmental sustainability, especially in relation to food, energy, and water, is less intuitive in aged and shrinking post-industrial urban settings despite the prevalence of such cities within the global arena and there is a clear need for research and education that supports such a mission in these areas. Given their age, geographical locations, and complex social-ecological histories, the examination and comparison of the Cities of Detroit and Baltimore provide a unique opportunity for evaluation of research needs and opportunities in food-energy-water sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will provide a collaborative gathering of experts and practitioners with a specialized focus on sustainability of food, energy, water systems in the context of transitioning landscapes. The workshop will identify gaps in existing intellectual resources and plan a path forward for resolution of those gaps.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany post-industrial cities depend on systems that are environmentally, economically, and socially unsustainable.  The present work highlights the compelling examples of Detroit, Michigan and Baltimore, Maryland.  These provided the basis for a workshop focused on sustainability at the Food/Energy/Water Nexus within the context of transitioning urban landscapes, economies, and governance processes.  The workshop brought together academics and practitioners from Detroit and Baltimore to collaborate around challenges for food, energy and water sustainability in post-industrial cities, and was held October 14-16, 2015, at Wayne State University in Detroit.  The goal of the workshop was to discuss and envision integrative solutions.  \n\n \n\nDuring the workshop, short presentations by practitioners from both Baltimore and Detroit provided context for all participants, interspersed with discussion sessions that fostered integrative brainstorming and synthesis.  Locally-sourced meals and tours of FEW-related destinations in Detroit provided additional opportunity for discussion and networking.  The 65 speakers, discussion leaders and participants included representatives of non-profit community organizations, city and state government, utility operators, and industry (66% of participants) and the remainder were university faculty and graduate students.\n\n \n\nThe themes identified in the workshop culminated in four unifying concepts &ndash; Partnerships and Governance Structures, Racial Justice, Integrative Metrics and Land Transformation.  These concepts provide an outline for understanding the key challenges, opportunities, preferred pathways, successes and needs for improved sustainability of food, energy and water systems in urban areas.  The following summary is based on workshop discussions.\n\n \n\nPartnerships and Governance Structures\n\nThe disconnects between stakeholders and between the institutions and organizations that represent them are central contributors to unsustainable activity. Water, energy and food systems can be in conflict within governmental structures, between the City center and outlying areas, between utility providers and utility users, and between many of the other societal divisions that co-exist in post-industrial cities.  At the same time, resources such as air, water, energy and biota readily cross socio-political boundaries, as does soil and water contamination and the responsibility for energy and water infrastructure.  Partnerships at the FEW nexus must address these shared resources and challenges in the context of climate change, urban food insecurity and health problems because of the influence of these challenges on FEW sustainability, and the societal and environmental costs of failing to address them.  Successful partnerships as identified in the workshop are defined by sustained and deliberate actions that \"meet people where they are;\" obtaining stakeholder representation and buy-in around collaboratively developed goals, strategies and actions; and timely feedback.  This process requires translating scientific language and concepts to achieve urban relevance, articulating stakeholder group interests, resolving past distrust and misperceptions among groups, balancing demands for immediate action with strategies for long-term effectiveness, and developing adequate capacity and strength for long-term governance. \n\n \n\nEnvironmental Justice and Social Equity\n\nRacial inequity is a pivotal source of conflict between people that must be addressed in order for sustainability work in legacy cities to be successful.  As a result of decades of land use transition in and around urban centers, poverty and lack of economic opportunity is concentrated in minority neighborhoods.  This economic and racial segregation occurs consistently in many cities across the United States, including Detroit and Baltimore.  Such inequity perpetuates conflict that interferes with the development of sustainable collaborative regio..."
