Topics to be addressed include biological devices, emerging Electronic device materials (graphene, MoS2), devices for energy scavenging power, memory, nanoscale applications, including Terahertz and spin-based approaches.  The Conference seeks financial support to support student participation.  It has a strong tradition of student involvement, with strong student attendance to its short courses, poster session and oral presentations. The DRC also has a tradition of offering discounted student registration fees, not only for general attendance but also for its short courses, in order to encourage student participation and attendance from additional students who are not presenting an abstract. Support will allow offering 50% discount for student registration to the general conference and the day-long short course \"Devices Beyond CMOS\",held just prior to the beginning of the conference.",
