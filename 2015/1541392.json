The university is developing a perimeter network named UW-DMZ (University of Wyoming \"science DMZ\") that contains and exposes the university's external facing services to Internet2. UW-DMZ enhances Big Computing and Big Data based research by providing infrastructure needed to leverage high performance, dynamic network services. Research is informed by a wide variety of data collected from field work and sensor networks, mined from databases, observed by lab experiments, or generated by simulations. The movement of data from their source to computational and visualization resources and then to the scientific world is critical.\r\n\r\nThe CI Engineer provides essential knowledge for how to best use the UW-DMZ facilities to researchers and students who have not experienced very fast computer networking or Big Data environments. The CI Engineer provides short courses for students and researchers that provide deeper, enriching experiences. Through the university's significant research collaborations with Jackson State University on environmental hydrology, their students and faculty are trained in accessing and using computational and visualization resources and gain firsthand experience in how to facilitate scientific discovery through management and integration of Big Computing and Big Data.",
