 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research project is to develop a portable, smart biosensor for monitoring of abnormal blood activities in patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). Despite the advanced healthcare system in the US, life expectancy of SCD patients is limited to about 50 years and patients suffer from unpredictable pain crises. Vascular occlusion is the primary cause of various clinical complications and shortened lifespan. The developed method will provide rapid blood testing in a minimally-invasive manner. Specifically, a quantitative measurement of cell sickling that is a primary contributing factor of vascular occlusion will be made. This project will open up new opportunities to gather large quantities of longitudinal cell sickling data to be associated with clinical outcomes and to help establish criteria for prediction of pain crises in individual SCD patients. Alerts will be raised when the measured cell sickling level is higher than the patient's \"normal\" range, allowing quicker interventions to prevent further complications and pain crises. This effort can potentially revolutionize the diagnostics and personalized-management of SCD. \r\n\r\nThe essential idea of the smart biosensor is to integrate a microfluidic impedance sensing module and a sensing interface module on a single portable device. The disposable sensing module consumes a single drop of blood, allowing in situ measurement of cell sickling induced by deoxygenated abnormal sickle hemoglobin. The integration of smart phone with the biosensor will provide flexible opportunities to SCD patients for long-term monitoring of abnormal blood activities outside hospital and laboratory. To accomplish this goal, the PI will focus on the following research objectives: (a) Integrate a microelectrode impedance transducer into a microfluidic hypoxia channel that mimics in vivo hypoxia-induced cell sickling conditions; determine the accuracy and sensitivity of electrical impedance as a sensing signal of cell sickling; (b) Functionalize the microfluidic channel with oxidoreductase agent to miniaturize the hypoxia control unit as well as to accelerate the cell sickling rate; (c) Establish communication between the microfluidic impedance sensing module and a smartphone through Bluetooth technology for analysis and display of results. This research will be the first attempt to electrically measure cell sickling events triggered by on-chip hypoxia in a portable device. This project makes contributions to the fields of  biosensing, hematopathology, and healthcare monitoring.",

In order to better manage the disease, we need to have a convenient, cost-efficient approach to monitor the blood activities of sickle cell patients. The goal of this study was to develop a portable, smart phone operated-sensor that can be used to test changes in sickle cell blood from finger prick. The key was to measure the abnormal blood activities, such as the fraction of rigid red cells and the kinetics of cell sickling in a drop of blood. Our hypothesis was that these critical parameters can be measured by electrical impedance. We explored, for the first time, the capability of electrical impedance in detecting cell sickling events. We tested the hypothesis by comparing the impedance data of normal blood cells and sickle blood cells under different oxygen levels using a commercial benchtop equipment via a customized disposable microscale fluidic chip. We found that electrical impedance was sensitive to differentiate sickle cells from normal cells, as well as rigid sickled cells from deformable ones. These differences exist at single-cell level and in a population of cells. We further developed a portable, smart phone operated-impedance measurement device. This new development achieved the impedance measurement of sickle blood in the disposable microscale fluidic chip. The results obtained by the portable system were comparable to the results obtained by the benchtop equipment. This suggests that the developed sensor system can measure the activities of sickle cell blood with very low blood volume. Our work provides a new opportunity for point-of-care monitoring of sickle cell disease.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/16/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: E&nbsp;Du</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1464102/1464102_10368413_1542427998503_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1464102/1464102_10368413_1542427998503_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Picture 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1464102/1464102_10368413_1542427998503_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Picture 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The developed portable, electrical impedance measurement device.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">E Du</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">E&nbsp;Du</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Picture 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1464102/1464102_10368413_1542428086924_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1464102/1464102_10368413_1542428086924_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Picture 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1464102/1464102_10368413_1542428086924_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Picture 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Disposable microfluidic chip for measuring cell impedance under controlled oxygen level.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">E Du</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">E&nbsp;Du</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Picture 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1464102/1464102_10368413_1542428184749_Picture3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1464102/1464102_10368413_1542428184749_Picture3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Picture 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1464102/1464102_10368413_1542428184749_Picture3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Picture 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Microscopic images of sickle cells in the microfluidic chip under normoxia and hypoxia conditions.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">E Du</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">E&nbsp;Du</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Picture 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
