 "awd_abstract_narration": "Given the imbalance between supply and demand of cybersecurity workforce and its impact on national security and the economy, a team of academic institutions, led by Whatcom Community College, will dramatically increase the contribution of two-year colleges in this critical area. This project has two major goals:\r\n(1) in three years, double the number of community colleges holding the \"National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance 2-Year Education\" (CAE2Y) designation sponsored by the National Security Agency (NSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS); and\r\n(2) create and disseminate \"CSP-Cyber,\" a cybersecurity-themed version of the AP course \"Computer Science Principles\" (CSP), which is being finalized by a team of computer science educators organized by the College Board and NSF.\r\n\r\nTo support the first goal, the project will grow and strengthen a strong national network of experienced, effective faculty mentors who have successfully completed the NSA's Knowledge Units (KU) mapping and the CAE2Y application process. These mentors will work with faculty at other colleges to complete the CAE2Y application and will leverage the resources offered by NSF's ATE centers for cybersecurity education, such as the National CyberWatch Center, CyberWatch West, and the Center for Systems Security and Information Assurance (CSSIA). To support the second goal, the project will engage faculty at CAE2Y-designated colleges (as well as those seeking the designation) and other computer science educators, including those who have been involved in the development of the CSP course nationally, to develop and pilot the planned cybersecurity-themed CSP course, train community college faculty to teach the new course, and disseminate it nationally.",
