 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Symposium on Computational Geometry (SOCG) is the premiere international conference in computational geometry.  Throughout its more than 30-year history, SOCG has played a seminal role in the formation and evolution of the field, and it continues to serve as the flagship venue for groundbreaking research in all areas of geometric computing. In recent years SOCG has expanded to incorporate CG Week, an event that includes technical sessions with contributed talks, at least two invited talks, a multimedia/video session, satellite workshops, and the Young Researchers Forum, a setting for students and postdocs to present their research.  This award will provide travel funding for students and post-doctoral fellows to participate at SOCG and CG Week as well as general support for CG Week activities. Participation by members of underrepresented groups will be encouraged.",
