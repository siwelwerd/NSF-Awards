By organizing the second workshop on  Women in Robotics at the Robot Science and Systems (RSS) conference on  July 16th in Rome, Italy, we built on last year's workshop's success and  achieved the following goals:<br />- The workshop raised visibility of  women in robotics by presenting a full-day of invited talks by women  leaders in the field, demonstrating that women can and do play an  important role in the field.<br />- The workshop brought together women  from various disciplines in robotics, thereby strengthening the  community and providing an opportunity for networking,<br />- The workshop provided junior researchers mentorship opportunity.<br />Approximately 25 women participated. This full-day workshop was a blend of contributed paper spotlight presentations, invited<br />talks,  a poster session, and a panel. We held three oral sessions, each with a  30-minute invited talk and 5 minute contributed paper spotlights. We  also organized a panel on the academic and industry job market from  multiple perspectives (successful candidates from this year, junior  faculty and recent hires in industry, people who were on the search  committee).
