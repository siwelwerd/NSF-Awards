This forum will provide an environment for rich discussions and interactions to not only assess the state-of-the-art in materials-related manufacturing innovations, but also to roadmap the key areas of future directions for the field.\r\n\r\nThe conference will bring together scientists, engineers and decision makers from academia, industry and government. The key technical theme will be the integration of materials and manufacturing innovations. The summit will provide a forum for presentations and discussions on materials-related manufacturing topics including digital manufacturing, Integrated Computational Engineering (ICME), hybrid manufacturing processes, nanomaterials, sustainable manufacturing and additive manufacturing to name a few. The outcomes will be identification of technological and economic limitations and barriers to implementation as well as a roadmap for key areas for future development.",
