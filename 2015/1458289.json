 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Science Learning Community (SLC) Scholarship Project at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg will provide scholarships and academic support to 24 academically talented and financially disadvantaged students from rural areas in Pennsylvania. The SLC Scholars will receive a liberal arts education solidly rooted in science and mathematics.  The scholarship support will remove the financial and societal barriers to earning a college degree.\r\n\r\nThe primary objective is to graduate the SLC Scholars successfully with baccalaureate degrees in Biological Science or Chemistry, and to facilitate their entry into STEM careers or graduate programs through enhancement of support services via curricular and co-curricular activities. Some of these activities include a summer bridge program, a science seminar for freshman scholars, the establishment of study groups, opportunities to develop a mentee/mentor relationship with a faculty member which could lead to undergraduate research, and training as peer mentors, teaching assistants for labs, or tutors for courses to enhance scholars' leadership skills and learning experiences. Career services will also be available, such as a career seminar course, graduate school prep course, and development of relationships with faculty and staff. Additionally, SLC Scholars will help build the next generation of science students by assisting during the university's middle and high school Summer Science and Math Experience and Quest Career camps. The project outcomes, lessons learned, and best practices will be broadly disseminated, contributing to the body of research on model approaches to supporting undergraduate student retention and educational success. Assessment of the efficacy of these different activities will help contribute to expanding the knowledge base regarding the circumstances under which scholarship projects of this type are successful.",

The SLC Scholarship Program aimed to attract, recruit, retain, and graduate academically talented traditional and transfer STEM students from rural areas. Program aims were accomplished by utilizing a year-long first-year Science Seminar course sequence, science learning communities, academic orientation, academic advising, journal clubs, career learning experiences, and tutoring in STEM fields to reduce academic barriers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong>&nbsp;We examined if Science Seminar and scholarship support impacted the retention, GPA, and success of SLC Scholars. Science Seminar is a year-long, 3 credit course that helps students develop academic skills (study habits, time management, scientific writing), utilize campus resources, establish personal and career goals, and creates a learning community among peers. Before the SLC Program, we observed greater than 50% attrition from Biological Science, Chemistry, and Biochemistry majors after their first year. After the introduction of Science Seminar, we decreased our first-year attrition to ~12% for students who completed the course (including&mdash;but not limited to&mdash;SLC Scholars). Data from the 2019 class shows that the 4-year graduation rate of Science Seminar students who started and graduated as science majors was ~40%, compared to 10% for non-Seminar students. The successful year-long Science Seminar course was then adapted into a one-semester Transfer Science Seminar for the two cohorts of transfer SLC Scholars. Feedback from our transfer SLC Scholars shows that Transfer Science Seminar was pivotal to their success and helped provide connections to other Scholars and STEM faculty members who instructed their courses. The Science Seminar course provided a significant impact on both our SLC Scholars and other STEM majors enrolled in the course, serving as the cornerstone to the success of the SLC program. SLC Scholars also reported that relationships with peers and faculty were critical to motivation and academic success. Supplementary grant support&mdash;such as academic orientation, tutoring, journal clubs, and attendance at research conferences&mdash;aided scholarly progress and provided a positive attitude toward the cohort experience. Overall, the retention, graduation rates, and GPA for all SLC graduates were significantly higher than matched control groups.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At its inception, Pitt-Greensburg&rsquo;s SLC Scholarship Program&rsquo;s primary objective was to successfully graduate 87.5% of all SLC Scholars with baccalaureate degrees in Biological Science, Chemistry, and Biochemistry who then continue into STEM careers by enhancing support services from enrollment through degree completion.&nbsp; Of the 32 unique SLC Scholars the program allowed us to support, twenty-eight (87.5%) of the SLC scholars successfully graduated with STEM degrees. Of those SLC scholars who graduated, 100% either enrolled in graduate programs or achieved employment in a STEM field directly after graduation. This accomplishment is particularly remarkable given that most SLC Scholars finished their undergraduate degrees and began graduate programs or careers during a worldwide pandemic. Scholarship and support services provided by the SLC Program helped to mitigate financial and societal barriers to earning a post-secondary degree.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>: The ultimate goal of University of Pittsburg at Greensburg SLC Scholarship Program was to equip low-income but academically talented students with the necessary skills and knowledge to graduate and transition into STEM careers or graduate programs. As mentioned above, ~90% of SLC Scholars have accomplished this goal. The SLC Scholarship Program has expanded and developed student interventions and strategies to enhance student success. Using the best practices learned from the SLC grant, we hoped to create a sustainable and expandable model for student retention. The SLC program has dramatically changed how first-year seminars are utilized on the Pitt-Greensburg campus, leading to the establishment of Transfer Science Seminar, Psychology Seminar, and a Criminal Justice Learning Community. Preliminary results indicate these learning communities have increased first-to-second year retention for those programs. The established series of courses within these majors provides for opportunities to cohort the students, a key advantage learned from the SLC Program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Moreover, the program outcomes, lessons learned, and best practices have been disseminated to the broader community, contributing to the body of research about model approaches to supporting both traditional and transfer undergraduate student retention and educational success. Presentations have resulted in mentoring faculty interested in starting similar programs through a cloud content manager account containing information on initiating Science Seminar and Learning Communities. Several mentored faculty have initiated similar Science Seminar courses on their own campuses. The model's success piloted in the SLC grant has proven transformative and will be sustained both at the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg and beyond.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/28/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Olivia&nbsp;S&nbsp;Long</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1458289/1458289_10354508_1648328439937_SLCLogo--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1458289/1458289_10354508_1648328439937_SLCLogo--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SLC Logo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1458289/1458289_10354508_1648328439937_SLCLogo--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SLC Logo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Science Learning Community Scholarship Program at University of Pittsburg at Greensburg.
