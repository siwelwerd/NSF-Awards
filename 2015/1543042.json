 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnership for Innovation: Accelerating Innovation Research Technology Translation project focuses on translating a modular and field deployable electrochemical sensing technology to fill the unmet need for rapid, low cost, and on-site characterization of toxic metals such as arsenic, cadmium, copper, lead, zinc, and mercury in water and sediments. This project will result in the development and field demonstration of a modular prototype \"E-tongue\" probe. This E-tongue probe will facilitate accurate, rapid, and cost-effective detection and quantification of heavy metals and have a direct impact on improving health and safety of humans. Standard spectro-analytical methods are expensive, bulky and require trained personnel for operation. The E-Tongue probe has the following unique features and advantages over existing laboratory and portable technologies, including: a) Portability and robustness, enabling rapid on-site testing; b) High sensitivity to detect multiple toxic metal ions below EPA specified maximum contamination limits; c) Integrated pH and temperature sensor for additional data and improved accuracy; d) User-friendly; and e) Low cost. By ascertaining levels of heavy metal contaminants at sites with sufficient accuracy in real-time, the E-Tongue probe can assist engineers to make onsite decisions, such as determining optimum locations for placement of monitoring wells, identifying hot-spots for sample collection for detailed laboratory testing, and adjusting field activity to control remediation options. It will also provide regulatory agencies with critical information so that they can take appropriate steps such as communicating drinking water advisories in a timely manner. \r\n\r\nThe project will result in the creation of a field deployable prototype E-tongue probe comprising an electrochemical sensor array, data acquisition/control and intelligent pattern recognition software. To develop the prototype, and move from research discovery to commercial application, the project will address the following technology gaps: 1) Simultaneous detection of multiple analytes, 2) Interfering compounds and electrode fouling, 3) Effects of temperature and pH, 4) Sampling challenges in the monitoring well and sediment testing systems. These technology gaps will be overcome by the use of multiple modified electrodes to enhance selectivity and sensitivity, elimination of interference and fouling through the use of appropriate sampling electrolytes and electrode protection strategies, integration of pH and temperature sensors to compensate for variations in pH and temperature, and incorporation of automated sampling systems. This project will provide the investigators, postdoctoral researcher and graduate student, the experience in transforming novel discoveries into prototype devices to solve real-world problems, as well as interdisciplinary, multicultural, global entrepreneurship experience through the Manning School of Business \"Global Entrepreneurship and Innovation\" program. \r\n\r\nGeoprobe and K2 Engineering will partner in manufacturing the prototype E-Tongue probe and princed circuit board (PCB) fabrication and assembly of the miniature potentiostat. Demonstration of the prototype E-Tongue probe will be conducted in collaboration with the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (Mass DEP) and CH2M Hill. Mass DEP will help locate appropriate sites for prototype demonstration. CH2M Hill will partner in the demonstration of the E-Tongue probe in heavy metal contaminated river sediments. The diverse skills and complementary expertise of the team, and collaborations with industry and regulatory agencies (CH2M, and Mass DEP) will ensure the successful translation of this project.",
