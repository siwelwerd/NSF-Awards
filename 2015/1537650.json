 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fluid circulation through the oceanic crust at the axis of mid-ocean ridges is a primary mechanism through which the Earth loses its internal heat. At the seafloor, this circulation releases hot fluids into the deep ocean. These hydrothermal sites typically host ecosystems and life forms found nowhere else on the planet and are thought to be one of the places on Earth where life may have originated. Hydrothermal fluid venting often occurs at or near major fault or fracture zones, suggesting that these breaks in the ocean crust can act as highly permeable conduits for fluids escape. It is unclear, however, to what extent these breaks in Earth's crust enable fluids to enter and move downward into the seafloor where they get heated. This research uses analog experiments, using a 3-D printer, and modeling to explore how fluid circulation at mid-ocean ridges spontaneously organizes itself and transports heat in highly fractured and faulted crust. By allowing exploration of the relation between venting sites and major tectonic features, the research facilitates our understanding of geothermal processes and the search for new hydrothermal sites on the seafloor.  Broader impacts of the work include integration of research and education and support of three early career investigators, one from an institution in an EPSCoR state (Idaho).  Results have applications ranging from terrestrial groundwater hydrology to geothermal energy, carbon sequestration, and the oil industry.\r\n\r\nThis research employs numerical and analog experiments to describe and quantitatively explain the effect of heterogeneous permeability on subsurface flow geometry and heat extraction. Using a 3-D printer, we will generate plastic analogs of oceanic crust, containing a series of regularly spaced tubes that will act as fluid pathways of defined permeability. Within this permeable matrix, a planar slot of prescribed width, inclination, and greater permeability (achieved through wider tubes) will be created, representing the damage zone that typically surrounds active faults. The printed volume will be placed in a glass-walled tank containing a mixture of glucose and water. The fluid will be heated from below to initiate porous convection. A combination of particle image velocimetry, thermo-chromic liquid crystals, and temperature sensors at the top and bottom of the volume will allow quantification of the locations of fluid recharge and discharge and the heat output of the convective system as the permeability contrast and geometry of the slot is varied.  Results will be compared to numerical models of porous convection in heterogeneous media and then extrapolated to natural conditions. The research will focus on predicting the conditions under which high-permeability fault zones can trap and focus hydrothermal convection rolls. The combined experimental and theoretical approach will greatly inform the investigation of targeted hydrothermal sites on slow-spreading mid-ocean ridges that sit next to major fault systems or near major crustal heterogeneities.",

These high temperature fluids modify the long-term chemistry of the oceans, account for a large fraction of the cooling of our planet, and form important mineral deposits. However, it is not well understood what controls the locations of hydrothermal vents and the spacing between them. For instance, some groups of vents appear to be regularly spaced, but others lack a systematic pattern. One likely control on vent location is the physical structure of the oceanic crust. For example, many hydrothermal vents are found near exposed faults on the seafloor. It is possible that faults may alter the route high-temperature fluids take as they rise toward the surface because movement on faults (e.g. during earthquakes) causes rocks around the fault to break, opening gaps and spaces that are easier for fluids to pass through than the small pores in unbroken rock. Faults at mid-ocean ridges are commonly observed to dip downward at an angle of about 60? and to be approximately planar. Thus, fluids rising from beneath a fault encounter the broken-up rocks and sometimes move up along the fault dip, rather than rising vertically through unbroken rock. This study aimed to quantify the extent to which broken-up rocks around faults alter the paths that high-temperature fluids take on their way to the surface.
