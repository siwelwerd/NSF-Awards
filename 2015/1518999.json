 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI:  Mochalin, Vadym\r\nProposal Number:  1518999\r\n\r\nThe devastating effects of the Ebola virus in humans are largely related to overproduction of pro-inflammatory proteins, called cytokines, which are responsible for fatal clinical symptoms of the Ebola disease: inflammation, fever, massive internal hemorrhage, and catastrophic thrombosis around the body. Quick removal of pro-inflammatory cytokines from blood by adsorption is essential to mitigate these severe clinical symptoms while the immune system prepares to eliminate the virus. The adsorption of cytokines is complicated by their large variations in molecular size and shape, some being small and elongated, others large and more globular, so when a mix of these molecules is present, larger molecules quickly stick to the outer surface of the adsorbent blocking access to the smaller pores for smaller molecules, significantly reducing available surface. The solution is to create adsorbents with hierarchical pore structure, containing large and small pores which fit all possible sizes and shapes of cytokines. These hierarchical carbon adsorbents will be synthesized from polymer precursors and optimized for specific, quick, and complete removal of cytokines from blood of the Ebola virus disease patients. The proposed research will allow the development of a range of carbon materials featuring precisely controlled pore size, pore volume, pore shape, surface area, and surface chemistry. The developed materials will find broader applications in biotechnology, bioengineering, medicine, water purification, and cosmetics. Medical applications of selective protein adsorption, including removal of wastes or toxins from blood of patients with kidney disease or liver failure, may particularly benefit from this research.  This award is being made jointly by two Programs:  (1) Chemical and Biological Separations, (2) Biomedical Engineering, both in the Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems Division in the Engineering Directorate.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research is focused on investigation of the effects of pore size, shape, and surface termination in hierarchical mesoporous carbons on adsorption and intraporous diffusion of cytokines. Based on this knowledge, hierarchical porous carbon adsorbents will be synthesized and tailored for quick removal of a mix of cytokines specific for the Ebola virus disease. The performance of the developed hierarchical carbon adsorbents will be demonstrated on blood plasma samples spiked with cytokine cocktails in compositions and concentrations typical for those in patients with the Ebola virus disease. The adsorbents will be synthesized from silicon containing polymer-derived ceramics with subsequent removal of silicon by high temperature chlorination. This process allows for full control of pore size and shape through variations of precursor composition, chlorination temperature and time, and has been demonstrated to produce hierarchical porosity with subnanometer control of the pore size. Adsorption of cytokines from blood plasma will then be measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To increase their affinity to cytokines, surface chemistry of the synthesized adsorbents will be modified by oxidation in air or carbon dioxide, reduction in hydrogen, and treatment in ammonia gas. At the end of the experimental program, mesoporous carbon adsorbents with a hierarchical pore structure and large particle size will be developed for quick and complete removal of cytokines from blood of the Ebola virus disease patients by extracorporeal perfusion. The proposed treatments will reduce mortality, accelerate recovery and, when used in conjunction with emerging methods and supporting care, will minimize long-term damage to the patient.",
