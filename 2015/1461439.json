 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will enhance the Nation?s knowledge of the impact of providing relevant STEM instruction on recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals. For those students entering the workforce directly from the college, it is important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce. \r\n\r\nUniversity of Hawaii-West Oahu will develop math and science courses sufficient to offer middle and secondary math and science education concentration and a BS in applied math, and develop a peer-tutoring program.  The curriculum improvements will be developed with attention to inquiry- and place-based instruction, local tradition and culture, and indigenous knowledge.",
