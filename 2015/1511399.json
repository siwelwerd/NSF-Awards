Poultry litter has been a topic of recent interest due to high nutrient loads in runoff from agricultural areas. Moving forward, a paradigm shift is needed to reconsider waste streams from a resource recovery perspective. The overall aim of this project is to investigate a hybrid technology that allows for continuous-flow treatment of poultry litter and high recovery of phosphorus. By shifting nutrient loading issues into potential resource/revenue streams,  progress in reducing nutrient loads to sensitive ecosystems can be accelerated. This goal will be pursued through partnership with Triea Technologies, a company focused on agricultural sustainability.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of this research is that phosphorus can be sustainably recovered from concentrated poultry litter slurries using a two-phase process. This process consists of a Phosphorus Extraction and Recovery System (PEARS), which allows for phosphorus release from poultry litter and subsequent precipitation as a high-value product, and a hybrid ion exchange, Hydrated Ferric Oxide - Polymeric Ligand Exchanger (HFO-PLE) unit that polishes PEARS effluent to ensure low-phosphorus effluent. The hypothesis will be tested through study of the following specific objectives: Objective 1: Optimize and model the process chemistry for PEARS to produce struvite and potassium struvite from poultry litter. Objective 2: Achieve additional phosphorus recovery from PEARS effluent using specialty polymeric ligand exchangers impregnated with hydrated ferric oxide. Objective 3: Determine the purity of the recovered phosphorus product and explore the sustainable reuse of extraction and regeneration solutions. Objective 4: Determine potential nutrient load reductions in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and development a start-up program for a PEARS-HFO-PLE pilot. The generation of high-value phosphorus-based fertilizers from poultry litter would be an important advancement in the environmental-agricultural field. The approach to coupling the PEARS and HFO-PLE systems will ensure process effluent has low phosphorus content. The project will leverage ongoing relationships with the Meyerhoff Scholars Programs, which primarily serves African American students, to engage and mentor undergraduate students in research. The research team will engage farmers and agricultural communities to describe the benefits of phosphorus recovery.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLivestock husbandry in concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs) is a major source of phosphorus influx into nutrient-sensitive water bodies, causing massive algal blooms.  As the algae die, bacteria use dead algal cells as their food source, and this consumes Dissolved Oxygen (DO).  Severe depletion of DO may result in ?dead zones? where aquatic organisms cannot survive, and compromised water quality.  This in turn results in costly emergency situations, the need for advanced treatment processes capable of handling future contamination events and decreased public confidence in municipal water systems. Furthermore, dead zones eliminate a potential revenue stream from fishing, shrimping, and tourism industries, while also reducing biodiversity.\n\nPhosphorus is a nonrenewable resource that is critical for global food security.  Unfortunately, the majority of world?s phosphorus supply stems from phosphorus-rich ores, whose geographical distribution is highly skewed, and more importantly, these deposits are rapidly being depleted.  If current usage trends continue, the world will run out of mineable phosphorus supplies in the next hundred years, resulting in an unprecedented global crisis.\n\nThis project demonstrated that phosphorus recovery from agricultural waste streams is a sustainable endeavor that can benefit the farming community, the environment, and the economy.  Phosphorus was recovered from poultry litter using a two-phase process, the Phosphorus Extraction and Recovery System (PEARS) system.  In the first phase, phosphorus was released from poultry litter by mixing it with a carbon dioxide-rich acid solution.  In Phase 2, the orthophosphate-phosphorus anion released in phase 1 was precipitated as a high- value product, and the solution can be reused for the next cycle of phosphorus release after pH adjustment.  A subsequent hybrid polymeric ion-exchanger unit polished the PEARS effluent to ensure a low-phosphorus (&lt; 50 ppb) effluent which does not cause eutrophication of the receiving water body.  The regeneration of the exhausted ion-exchanger results in a concentrated orthophosphate -phosphorus solution that can be used to extract additional quantity of high-value fertilizer.  After precipitation of the fertilizer, the regenerant can be reused for the next cycle.  This project not only transformed an agricultural waste pollutant (phosphorus) - that demands a high cost for disposal (to prevent water quality challenges) ? to a revenue-generating product (phosphorus-rich fertilizer) but also demonstrated minimal use of chemicals by reusing process solutions over multiple cycles.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sukalyan Sengupta"
