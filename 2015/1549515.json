 "awd_abstract_narration": "Consistent with the National Science Foundation's goal \"to initiate and support ... programs to strengthen scientific and engineering research potential [and] science and engineering education programs at all levels\", this project develops materials that will support education and broad awareness of the importance of key engineering advances . In particular, it will support creation of educational films and corresponding lesson materials for K-12 mathematics and science teachers that will allow students to be exposed not just to the advances in information theory, but also to how an ordinary person played a pivotal role in fostering them. By adapting material previously restricted to graduate-level courses and technical conferences to a larger audience, a broader dissemination of information theory should profitably inform teachers and researchers in other fields, thereby fueling the nation's STEM workforce and improving commercial technology. \r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the efforts and advances of Claude Shannon, who established the field of information theory by stating some of its most fundamental problems and solving them. The technologies that his work made possible form a major driving force of our economy. His information theory concepts provide the foundation for nearly every aspect of modern information technology and have been applied to many fields, including communication, language, genetics, computing, cryptography, psychology, perception, memory, artificial intelligence, quantum physics, and others.",
