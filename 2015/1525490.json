 "awd_abstract_narration": "St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas, will conduct a significant transformation of the first-year experience for all beginning college STEM majors by creating multiple activities to enrich students' learning and college experience, enhance the likelihood of academic success, promote students' satisfaction with, persistence in, and completion of STEM degrees, and prepare students for STEM careers. A Summer Bridge Program to prepare entering students, STEM-Living Learning Communities for first-year students, and course-based and summer research experiences will enrich student learning. Faculty will also shift the pedagogical approach in STEM first-year courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics and computer science to feature more active, experiential, and peer learning strategies. Selected second-year STEM courses will be developed to provide further opportunities for students to engage in STEM research and improve their communication skills. The project will provide liberal arts colleges like St. Edward's with a useful model for strengthening student success in early STEM courses, a period that is important to student retention and long-term success in STEM study. As an Hispanic-serving institution, St. Edward's is especially well-positioned to model and study the impact of these interventions in the experiences of Hispanic and women students, who are underrepresented nationally among STEM graduates.\r\n\r\nKey project components include: residence hall-based STEM Living-Learning Communities, pedagogies emphasizing group interaction within first-year gateway STEM courses, summer research experiences, sophomore course experiences designed to maintain community cohesiveness and increase students' research and communication skills, course scheduling designed to create student cohorts, and faculty workshops and a faculty learning community to support the use of new pedagogical strategies. The project's research program will study the effect of these interventions, including the impact of cohort scheduling on student learning outcomes in STEM, the influence of shared cohort living on collaborative learning, and the impact of elements of the sophomore program. This program focuses on scientific communication, ethics, and entrepreneurship with the aim of increasing students' retention and academic success. In developing and evaluating the impact of a set of innovative interventions designed to deepen STEM learning in the first two years, the project will provide models and lessons to all institutions seeking ways to strengthen the success of STEM undergraduate students, especially students from underrepresented groups.",

Starting with an initial focus on the introductory biology, chemistry, and mathematics courses: BIOL 1307 &amp; 1308, CHEM 1340, and MATH 2413 (Calculus 1), the project succeeded in completely transforming how science is taught. \n\nThe Biology Department transformed seven courses to feature active learning pedagogy.  In the introductory biology courses, learning outcomes were drafted and content streamlined to focus on what was deemed to be essential course content.  A Biology Activity Library was created including 46 learning activities that was shared across all sections of the introductory biology courses. Five other courses were likewise transformed, including the introductory biology laboratory courses which now feature Course-Based Undergraduate Research (CURE) modality.\n\nThe Chemistry Department redeveloped eight courses. Introductory courses and laboratories and selected upper-division courses were transformed to use 100% active learning pedagogies including Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL), explicit course learning outcomes, and mastery-based grading. The upper-division laboratories use now a CURE modality. Early quantitative results in general chemistry show a decrease in DFW rate from 35% pre-POGIL to 25% and the average course grade improved from 2.30 to 2.43, even in the pandemic year. \n\nThe Mathematics Department focused on transforming the Calculus I course, then later developed five other courses, including the remaining calculus courses.  Other courses now incorporate active learning pedagogy as well.  Over 30 videos were created for the Calc I course along with an associated quiz for each.  Active-learning resources were disseminated in a database of resources and best practices.\n\nThe Computer Sciences Department introduced a new sophomore-level course entitled Component-Based Programming, designed and developed to leverage both active and experiential learning opportunities using common objects with well-known behaviors. CBP now required in degree plans and prerequisite for Algorithms &amp; Data Structures. Consequently, DF rates in ADS dropped from 21% (students without CBP) to 14% (students with CBP).\n\nThe Physics introductory two-course lecture-laboratory sequence set was merged into two four-credit courses utilizing a team-based, project-based teaching modality.  The Forensic Science Department transformed three courses.  All produced a variety of materials to facilitate active learning.\n\nIn Spring 2020 and throughout the 2020-21 academic year, the pandemic forced a pivot from face-to-face to online instruction.  Thirteen courses were recast to feature online active learning using new technology.  Laboratory courses were also pivoted to an online format.\n\nOf note during this period of virtual learning, faculty surveys demonstrate evidence of active learning in four gateway courses, in biology, in chemistry, in computer science and a tendency in mathematics. First year students reported significantly more experiences characteristic of active learning pedagogy than they recalled in their science or mathematics courses the previous year before matriculating.\n\nOne expectation is that through active learning, students will develop positive attitudes toward learning mathematics and science, learn content conceptually, and benefit from learning together with peers.

Over the lifetime of the project, up to five LLCs were supported.  Over the period encompassed by both grants (Fall 2010 - present), 50% of the Science LLC members completed a STEM degree vs. 41% of the STEM majors not participating.  Cumulative 1st year retention was 73% vs. 63% for other STEM majors.  Many LLC members continued their education in professional or graduate school, with one receiving an NSF Graduate Fellowship, and one awarded a Fulbright Research Fellowship.\n\nA summer bridge program - Freshman Accelerated Research Methods (FARM) Workshop was supported.  FARM has been very effective at fostering strong bonds between the participants, the faculty, LLC alums, and the university.  Nearly 100% of the participants over the years have indicated high satisfaction with the workshops, which we expect to continue.\n\nA Faculty Learning Community was established, which was revived after a brief hiatus due to the pandemic.  Ciencia Sin Fronteras, a student interest group, was established by the faculty with partial grant support to present and discuss science in Spanish for our Spanish speaking students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/02/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard L Kopec"
