 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will benefit both the research astronomy community and the general public in the US by providing access to the Millennium Database, the most important and widely used simulation worldwide, which has so far been a fully European effort, published and maintained in Germany, and largely inaccessible elsewhere.  Once established, other simulation datasets will later be made available, providing a resource of tremendous value, capable of making a meaningful difference to US scientists.  The virtual numerical laboratory that will be created represents technical solutions widely applicable to many areas of scientific and educational endeavor.\r\n\r\nCosmological computer simulations with large dynamic range that model statistically representative parts of the observable universe are an essential component of the quest to understand the structure of the universe, and in particular how galaxies form, how they are distributed in space, and how environment influences their evolution.  The data sets produced by such simulations have started to exceed in size and richness the results of the largest observational surveys, straining the computational and storage resources that support the required complex algorithms.  This is especially true because much of the analysis will be performed by scientists who were not involved in the original work and may be unfamiliar with the properties of the simulation outputs.  This project will allow access to the original simulations, and simultaneously extend and complete the creation of synthetic observations that can be directly compared to telescope data.  The system will allow experts and non-experts to investigate the virtual universes created by simulations and match them to observation, by forming a virtual observatory with access to everything from raw outputs, through idealized intermediate products, to realistic model observations.  Users can investigate such aspects of gravitational collapse as scaling relations and distinct clustering patterns, and study systematic biases and information loss.  The objective is to enable everyone to perform the sort of scientific experiments on simulation data that can currently only be done by specialists.\r\n\r\nThe broadly usable technical solutions that will be created by this study will tie raw Petabyte size simulation output files to structured relational databases, with direct applications as diverse as turbulence and genomics.  Forward modelling to the observational domain will benefit any area where theory and simulation must be interpreted by non-specialists.  The project will establish the Johns Hopkins group as a core US partner in the European Virgo Consortium, and further establish a public simulation database effort in the US.",

Only through such simulations can we hope to follow the complex processes involved in the formation and properties of galaxies and galaxy clusters and understand their large-scale distribution throughout space. When the PI was working at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Munich, Germany he created a publicly accessible database of some of the largest simulations of this kind. Though the methods for accessing these data were relatively limited, it helped make the Millennium Run the most intensely researched simulation of its kind, with over 1000 publications using data from it and its successors. Figure 1 shows what such a simulation looks like.</p>\n<p>The Institute for Data Intensive Engineering and Science (IDIES) at the Johns Hopkins University had been developing a science platform called SciServer and when the PI moved to IDIES, he brought the simulation data with him. SciServer provides online support for greatly enhanced data analysis capabilities, which will allow more detailed investigation of these big data sets. In particular the SciServer/Compute tool allows sophisticated analysis using the full power of computer scripting languages such as python, R or Matlab. And since these scripts are executed on the same computers hosting the data, no time- and space-consuming downloads of the data are required.</p>\n<p>A new type of analysis that is now open to any user is the investigation of the raw data coming from the simulations. The original Millennium Database restricted itself to storing information about clusters extracted from the raw simulation outputs. But to find out more about the structure of these objects, for example to calculate their three dimensional shapes or density profiles, one needs access to their constituent particles. As these simulations are very large, in this case containing from 10 to 300 billion particles, efficient manners to extract these are required. In this project we developed a solution for this and deployed this on the SciServer system.</p>\n<p>We called this FileDB and it uses a specific, fractal-like organization of particles in the simulation to be able to make fast retrieval of particles in selected small search volumes. For example, Figure 2 shows the four most massive clusters in the Millennium simulation which were retrieved from inside the SciServer compute environment.</p>\n<p>Apart from such visualizations these scripts allow more interesting results to be obtained almost as easily. A typical quantity that scientists are interested in is a measure of the how the density of particles falls off with the distance to the center. Such density profiles can be obtained easily and it has been observed in earlier simulations that they can be fit quite well with a rather simple function. Figure 3 shows such density profiles and their fit (the red line).<br />Note that although the function fits reasonably well for most halos, there are quite some examples where there is a clear deviation. This could be because nearby clusters are included in the density profile, but maybe there are other dynamical effects at work. By providing access to the full information about these clusters over their complete formation history, scientists can investigate this in detail.</p>\n<p>Importantly, by opening these data sets to the world in the SciServer science platform, such analysis is no longer restricted to the scientists who created these simulations. This is of particular importance for scientists who would like to use these results in a very different context, especially for observational programs. An important use case for simulations like these is to make realistic predictions for what observers could see with their telescopes. To do so requires complex software that can simulate a telescope and its instruments. We have created and deployed such software on SciServer&nbsp; and attached them to the simulations on the same system. through which it is now available for all end users. An example of the results one can obtain with such software is shown in Figure 4, which shows on the right a real image obtained over many nights with the Hubble Space Telescope, and the left shows an image with a \"virtual telescope\" that was configured according to the same parameters as the real observation.</p>\n<p>The importance of this is that observers can start tuning their analysis software, that eventually will be applied to the real observations, already on simulated universes for which all the details are known. And by doing so in the context of science platforms such as SciServer, the increasingly large collaborations that are required to produce the next large observational surveys, can do so by sharing access to hardware and software resources that access the largest and most refined simulations made today.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/27/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gerard&nbsp;Lemson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1517007/1517007_10379902_1574718475461_mrxxl--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1517007/1517007_10379902_1574718475461_mrxxl--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1517007/1517007_10379902_1574718475461_mrxxl--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An illustration of a cosmological simulation such as used in this project.
