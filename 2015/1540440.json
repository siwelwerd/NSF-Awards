 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will fund a new campus initiative for the cultivation of ethical climates and practices in STEM research, using a novel online communications platform combined with a project-based training designed to be compatible with that platform. UC Riverside will deploy and evaluate this campus-wide interdisciplinary project, Institutional Re-engineering Ethical Discourse in STEM (iREDS), by examining the effects of two randomized interventions, separately and combined, and in comparison with a fourth control group receiving the standard ethics training that currently exists on campus. \r\n\r\nThe project represents a paradigm shift from changing individuals' behavior through instruction, to cultivating a campus culture intended to emerge from intensive digital interaction amplified by ethics training introduced during laboratory projects. Broader Impacts of the deployment and evaluation of the interaction of two novel interventions include a model transferable to other institutions, a test bed at an Hispanic Serving Institute (HSI) in the midst of rapid research and student population growth (25% of incoming domestic PhD graduate students are underrepresented minorities), and the potential offer guidance to federal agencies regarding future Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) policy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Institutional Re-engineering Ethical Discourse in STEM (iREDS) team developed and evaluated a novel, project-based and discursive approach to research ethics training.  The project is part of a University of California, Riverside (UCR) campus initiative for the cultivation of ethical climate and practices in STEM research, and was the result of a collaboration between the UCR Graduate Division and the Center for Open Science (COS).  The training specifically encourages discussion among students, faculty and staff within a STEM lab on the ethical dimensions of a research project that is currently in progress in the lab, empowering lab participants to engage in interpersonal communication about appropriate and justifiable research practices.  The training curriculum was scaffolded on the Open Science Framework (OSF; http://osf.io/), which is free, open-source, web-based collaboration tool that is maintained by COS. \n\nIn this project we focused the training on two important research ethics topics that align with features of the OSF: authorship attribution and data management.  To assess the impacts of the training we made use of a randomized control trial (RCT) fielded among faculty-led STEM labs at UC Riverside and Scripps Research, in which some labs were randomized to receive the training and others to a control group, combined with an ethnography of selected labs.  \n\nUsing an outcomes survey that we administered four and a half months after each training session concluded, we found that the training enhances the capacity of lab members to discuss the ethical implications of research constructively, and the durability of the findings show that the training helps to routinize ethics discourse within the lab workflow.  The theory and methods have considerable intellectual merit and are at the leading edge of communication research and advance the social scientific literature on research ethics. Our RCT findings rigorously follow from a design-based approach to causal inference, and are the product of state-of-the-art multilevel inferential statistical methods that nest participants within labs.  As a result, our findings advance the academic literature on research ethics, and help to address the gap in evidence-based evaluation of ethics training identified in the recent National Academies report \"Fostering Integrity in Research\" (2017). \n\nThe iREDS project represents a paradigm shift from the traditional approach to research ethics training that focuses on didactic instruction of individuals, to cultivating a campus culture that routinizes the respectful and informed discussion of ethical best practices between lab members, and between the lab and the broader public.
