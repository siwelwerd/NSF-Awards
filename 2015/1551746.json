 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports participation of approximately 17 graduate students from US institutions in the third instance of the Conference on Online Social Networks (COSN) of the Association for Computing Machinery, to be held in Stanford University, California, on November 2-3, 2015 (http://cosn.acm.org/2015/). CONS provides a premier publication venue that features high quality research from academia and industry across multiple disciplines focused around the study of online social networks (OSNs).  COSN is an international conference that stimulates exchanges between various international research communities. Participation in conferences such as COSN is an important part of the graduate school experience. Attendance at the conference will enhance the scientific workforce in this emerging research area by developing a group of promising young researchers interested in online social networks. The support will enable these young researchers to interact with other researchers and conference events; to learn of potential career paths within academia and industry; to access an international network of researchers who can support their professional development; and to observe the interdisciplinary nature, diversity and interrelationships of research in online social networks. The support provided for student participation will promote diversity by encouraging and enabling women and other under-represented minorities to participate in and benefit from the CONS experience. \r\n\r\nCONS focuses on systems, security and privacy, graphs, data management, analysis, and data mining, relevant to the design, analysis and development of OSNs.  This year?s conference invites submissions on a wide range of research on social networks, including systems and algorithms for social search, infrastructure support for social networks and systems, social properties in systems design, clean-slate designs for social systems, learnings from operational social networks, transient OSNs (e.g. Snapchat)s, special purpose OSNs (e.g., Instagram, Vine), measurement and analysis of social and crowdsourcing systems, benchmarking, modeling, performance and workload characterization, etc. (see http://cosn.acm.org/2015/). Student participation is expected to have a positive impact on the students' research interests. COSN incorporates poster sessions that provide a unique opportunity for participating students to present their research project and receive valuable feedback from senior researchers and other members of the community.",
