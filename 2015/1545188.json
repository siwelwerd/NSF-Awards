 "awd_abstract_narration": "NRT-DESE: Risk and Uncertainty Quantification in Marine Science\r\n\r\nThe ocean is the last great frontier on Earth, a major driver of climate and productivity, and a critical resource for humans and wildlife. Managing ocean resources requires scientists and managers to work seamlessly to understand the top-down effects of human actions and the bottom-up effects of climate-change on the ocean system. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) project at Oregon State University (OSU) will prepare a new generation of natural resource scientists and managers who will combine mathematics, statistics, and computer science with environmental and social sciences to study, protect, and manage ocean systems. This traineeship program anticipates preparing sixty-one (61) MS and PhD students, including thirty (30) funded trainees, to work in transdisciplinary research groups on user-inspired problems using large and ever-expanding data resources.  With powerful analytical tools, they will be best equipped to track and study the top-down effects of human actions and the bottom-up effects of climate change on the ocean system. Besides fulfilling current educational gaps in marine science and management, this OSU NRT program promotes: 1) a transformative and scalable new marine science and policy graduate minor that teaches students to quantify and communicate risk and uncertainty of data-based model forecasts and policy scenarios; 2) the discovery of mechanisms that control the response of marine systems to climate change and human pressures; 3) the development of evidence-based practices for recruiting, training, and retaining diverse graduate students and for placing them into a range of successful careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).  \r\n\r\nThrough a combination of technical coursework, communication workshops, national and international internships, stakeholder engagement, peer mentoring, and involvement in transdisciplinary research projects, OSU NRT trainees will learn about the science of big data, risk and uncertainty quantification and communication and sustainability. They will learn tools and techniques to assist communities in managing resources through change and to recover quickly in the event of a disaster. In line with the learning objectives, the training and research will link new developments in mathematical and statistical quantification of risk and uncertainty, complex and large datasets on marine systems emerging from novel sensors, and outreach and engagement of stakeholders who affect, and are affected by, ocean systems.  In addition, students with diverse expertise, developed through internships, will leverage each other's strong disciplinary knowledge and skills as they collaborate to address complex stakeholder-identified climate and policy problems. These collaborations will have the ultimate goal of devising management solutions in the face of change and uncertainty. \t\r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative, and scalable models for STEM graduate education training.  The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through the comprehensive traineeship model that is innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.\r\n\r\nThis work is supported, in part, by the Alliances for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (AGEP) program.  AGEP is committed to the national goal of increasing the numbers of underrepresented minorities (URMs), entering and completing STEM graduate education and postdoctoral training to levels representative of the available pool. The AGEP program supports the development, implementation, study, and dissemination of innovative models and standards of graduate education and postdoctoral training that are designed to improve URM participation, preparation, and success.",

The first is the Oregon State University graduate minor in Risk and Uncertainty Quantification in Marine Sciences was established in 2016. This interdisciplinary minor provided graduate students with knowledge and skills to quantify and communicate risk and uncertainty derived from the analyses of large data in earth system science. Students extend their ability to perceive and solve problems in a transdisciplinary context related to statistical inference, uncertainty quantification, risk analyses, earth system science, and social systems.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In addition to the Minor, we submitted a proposal to the OSU graduate school for a Graduate Certificate in Transdisciplinary Research for Marine Social-Ecological-Technological Systems (SETS). The proposed certificate meets employer and student demand for training in systems thinking, communication, collaboration, and research to address societal challenges. It includes: 1. Skill building in transdisciplinary approaches; 2. Experience with collaborative team science; and 3. Application of these skills to problems in marine systems, such as conservation, food/water/energy security, and climate change adaptation. The proposed certificate complements existing interdisciplinary programs at OSU, and could expand in the future, beyond marine systems and in person training, to broader topics and online modality.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Lastly, as a result of the NRT Summit Transformative Connections (Goal 4), seven academic institutions produced a Declaration of Cooperation expressing institutional commitments to transdisciplinary research and education.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Goal 3: Provide students with a transdisciplinary collaborative research experience and education to prepare them in related careers in academia, the private sector, government, and industry.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Outcomes 3: Trainees were engaged in several professional training activities, including: working toward a transdisciplinary report and interdisciplinary thesis chapter, participating in the annual IFC (Intensive Field Course) prior to fall term, and taking the required professional training for the minor. Through these activities students worked in research groups, attended lectures by academics and government entities, participated in panel discussions with stakeholders, traveled to internship sites, engaged with practitioners and stakeholders, communicated and published their research, and devoted at least one chapter of their dissertations addressing on their NRT group?s project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Goal 4: Host a nationwide summit for all NRTs with a coastal/marine theme with the participation of graduate students, PIs/Co-PIs, faculty, and higher up administrators, to provide a synergistic platform for accelerating transdisciplinarity and discussions on successful university sustainability of programs.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Outcomes 4: We hosted a Nationwide Summit for programs that have a marine and/or coastal focus. The Summit was successful and provided several opportunities for networking for graduate students and communication avenues for entities such as students and higher end administrators. As an outcome from the summit we produced a Declaration of Cooperation, as a commitment to advance transdisciplinary and convergent marine/coastal research through National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) Programs at Academic Institutions. The declaration was signed by the administrative leadership of the six participating academic institutions, and is uploaded to our NSF NRT final report.</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Broader Impacts</span></p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 12pt; margin-bottom: 12pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Since the inception of the grant (2015; 4 annual student cohorts) we have had 44 graduate students and faculty participate in the Risk and Uncertainty Quantification in Marine Science NRT Program at Oregon State University (OSU).

  "por_txt_cntn": "Intellectual merit\nThe project successfully addressed all four Goals. \nGoal 1: Educate and train scientists, engineers, and resource managers to work in transdisciplinary teams that create tools and techniques for DESE applied to marine systems.\nOutcomes 1: External evaluation indicated that students who completed the training and advising faculty were more prepared to work in interdisciplinary groups inside and outside of academia. Students rated internship opportunities, and getting involved in transdisciplinary research topics and teams, as the most valuable parts of the Program. Students produced societally relevant and actionable outcomes such as apps, tsunami models, and tools to predict the ocean conditions for fishermen and other stakeholders.\nGoal 2: Promote a transformative and scalable new transdisciplinary marine science and policy education program that teaches students to quantify and communicate risk and uncertainty and to engage with stakeholders.\nOutcomes 2: There are three tangible outcomes. The first is the Oregon State University graduate minor in Risk and Uncertainty Quantification in Marine Sciences was established in 2016. This interdisciplinary minor provided graduate students with knowledge and skills to quantify and communicate risk and uncertainty derived from the analyses of large data in earth system science. Students extend their ability to perceive and solve problems in a transdisciplinary context related to statistical inference, uncertainty quantification, risk analyses, earth system science, and social systems. \nIn addition to the Minor, we submitted a proposal to the OSU graduate school for a Graduate Certificate in Transdisciplinary Research for Marine Social-Ecological-Technological Systems (SETS). The proposed certificate meets employer and student demand for training in systems thinking, communication, collaboration, and research to address societal challenges. It includes: 1. Skill building in transdisciplinary approaches; 2. Experience with collaborative team science; and 3. Application of these skills to problems in marine systems, such as conservation, food/water/energy security, and climate change adaptation. The proposed certificate complements existing interdisciplinary programs at OSU, and could expand in the future, beyond marine systems and in person training, to broader topics and online modality.\nLastly, as a result of the NRT Summit Transformative Connections (Goal 4), seven academic institutions produced a Declaration of Cooperation expressing institutional commitments to transdisciplinary research and education.\n\n \nGoal 3: Provide students with a transdisciplinary collaborative research experience and education to prepare them in related careers in academia, the private sector, government, and industry.\nOutcomes 3: Trainees were engaged in several professional training activities, including: working toward a transdisciplinary report and interdisciplinary thesis chapter, participating in the annual IFC (Intensive Field Course) prior to fall term, and taking the required professional training for the minor. Through these activities students worked in research groups, attended lectures by academics and government entities, participated in panel discussions with stakeholders, traveled to internship sites, engaged with practitioners and stakeholders, communicated and published their research, and devoted at least one chapter of their dissertations addressing on their NRT group?s project.  \nGoal 4: Host a nationwide summit for all NRTs with a coastal/marine theme with the participation of graduate students, PIs/Co-PIs, faculty, and higher up administrators, to provide a synergistic platform for accelerating transdisciplinarity and discussions on successful university sustainability of programs.\nOutcomes 4: We hosted a Nationwide Summit for programs that have a marine and/or coastal focus. The Summit was successful and provided several opportunities for networking for graduate students and communication avenues for entities such as students and higher end administrators. As an outcome from the summit we produced a Declaration of Cooperation, as a commitment to advance transdisciplinary and convergent marine/coastal research through National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) Programs at Academic Institutions. The declaration was signed by the administrative leadership of the six participating academic institutions, and is uploaded to our NSF NRT final report.\nBroader Impacts\nSince the inception of the grant (2015; 4 annual student cohorts) we have had 44 graduate students and faculty participate in the Risk and Uncertainty Quantification in Marine Science NRT Program at Oregon State University (OSU). Students took classes, traveled to conference and internship sites, and worked in transdisciplinary teams to address interdisciplinary,  compelling, and timely research problems ranging from microplastics to tsunamis and other large scale challenges such as climate change and food and energy security.\nExternal evaluations indicated that the program was successful in:\n\n\nEstablishing a network of faculty and students, and creating new synergies among interdisciplinary marine-focused programs.\n\n\nSharing examples of successful forward-looking transdisciplinary research/education programs linking coupled natural-human dimensions, data science, and analysis.\n\n\nAllowing students and faculty to participate in a comfortable and safe space to talk about challenges and opportunities in transdisciplinary education.\n\n\nFostering professional training in communication, engagement and collaboration\n\n\nProviding career opportunities\n\n\nUnderstanding and articulating what we are doing in transdisciplinary marine sciences to inform NSF, professionals, and academic administrators.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/18/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lorenzo Ciannelli"
