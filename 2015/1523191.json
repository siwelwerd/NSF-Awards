 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research investigates community exposure to coastal climate hazards in Alaska?s North Slope and incorporates community assessment of the potential effects on loss of land, infrastructure, and other assets. This analysis will inform response strategies and planning by developing new methods of hazard assessment that can support community resilience in the North Slope and potentially serve as a model for advancing assessment and planning in other rural and urban communities. This research will expand traditional assessments of financial exposure to also include non-material factors such as values and priorities of diverse social groups within a community including a diverse set of stakeholders, ranging from multinational oil companies to individual subsistence hunters. This study surveys community views of asset importance and integrates results with a geophysical hazard data model for a coproduced community exposure map of the North Slope coast. This research will contribute to understanding the human and social dimensions of climate change impacts, including how social, economic, political, and cultural factors shape vulnerabilities and condition response strategies.  Methods and findings could enhance nation-wide efforts in the United States to map community exposure to coastal climate hazards by demonstrating methods for, and the importance of systematically incorporating non-market values in exposure analysis.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the proposed research include adapting the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) coastal vulnerability index (CVI) to the Arctic context, and integrating results with formal asset databases and a spatial community landscape value model while working with affected communities during the process to coproduce exposure maps. Specifically, working with North Slope Alaskan communities the study will incorporate wind fetch (i.e., the open water distance over which wind can generate near shore waves, determined by sea ice extent) into the CVI and get community feedback on the results. In addition to community input on the CVI maps, coproducing the exposure maps includes the community assigning values to traditional land use places using existing spatial datasets and mapping and investigating specific sites threatened by coastal hazards with the aim to learn why exposed assets threaten the community.",

A major goal was to collaboratively map community perceptions of coastal risks, focusing on threats from shoreline change occurring in the region. A secondary goal was to collect local manager feedback on usability potential of a geospatial data model of shoreline change susceptibility to be integrated with the resulting community risk maps to assess exposure.</span></p>\n<p><span>The research focused on two research questions corresponding with the project objectives: 1. from the local community perspective, where along the coast are the societal threats from shoreline change and what are the risks?; and, 2. from the local manager perspective, what improvements are needed to make the geospatial data model more usable, that is, relevant, credible, and legitimate, for land use decision and planning support?&nbsp;The research to answer these questions entailed community mapping workshops in April 2016 in three North Slope communities: Wainwright, Barrow, and Kaktovik, with 66 participants in total. To answer the first question, Michael collected community perceptions from a total of 50 of the 66 participants who placed coded stickers on printed maps of the shoreline where they perceive a threat and described the problem verbally and/or directly on the maps using a marker. Collectively, the 50 participants identified just under 300 such places, covering much of the shoreline extending across two major federal land units: the National Petroleum Reserve - Alaska (NPR-A) and the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). The threat locations and descriptions were digitized and linked with biographical surveys and audio-recordings for qualitative geographical analysis using the sticker codes. Not all interviews were audio-recorded; 23 of the 50 participated in audio-recorded, one-on-one or small group interactive mappings, and the other 27 participated without audio or significant researcher interaction. To answer the second question, Michael organized a usability&nbsp; workshop with 16 participants consisting mostly of local managers and GIS programmers in collaboration with the North Slope Borough Planning and Community Services Department (NSB). In this workshop, he collected local manager feedback on the (digital) geospatial data model using draft results summarized at relevant locations using existing asset spatial data loaded onto the NSB WebGIS Portal.

For example, in addition to direct impacts to hunting camps, a general risk voiced by many participants is threats from shoreline change impacts on boating access to camps, important hunting grounds, and neighboring communities.&nbsp;Participants also emphasized risk at lands controlled by the Borough, native corporations, the state, and the federal government that support energy and national defense industries.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Results from the usability workshop using the shoreline change risk WebGIS to research question 2 suggest that usability perceptions are favorable, and there is interest in expanding the tool.

Continued dissemination of the project results including in public and policy settings would enhance public knowledge about climate change impacts and risks, and may guide a pathway for National Climate Assessments and other efforts to effectively engage Arctic communities to meet their program objectives such as addressing local and regional information needs. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/05/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;B&nbsp;Brady</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523191/1523191_10401659_1483469870209_webportal--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523191/1523191_10401659_1483469870209_webportal--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NSB Web Portal Front Page\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523191/1523191_10401659_1483469870209_webportal--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NSB Web Portal Front Page\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">NSB Web Portal front page showing shoreline change risk map tool.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">NSB</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;B&nbsp;Brady</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">NSB Web Portal Front Page</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523191/1523191_10401659_1483469235111_study_site--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523191/1523191_10401659_1483469235111_study_site--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Study Site\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523191/1523191_10401659_1483469235111_study_site--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Study Site\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Study Site and Three Participating Communities.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Brady</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;B&nbsp;Brady</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Study Site</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523191/1523191_10401659_1483469599247_problem_places--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523191/1523191_10401659_1483469599247_problem_places--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Shoreline Change &quot;Problem Places&quot;\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523191/1523191_10401659_1483469599247_problem_places--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Shoreline Change &quot;Problem Places&quot;\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Places at risk identified by participants on hard copy maps, digitized.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Brady</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;B&nbsp;Brady</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Shoreline Change \"Problem Places\"</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523191/1523191_10401659_1483469730734_bti_filled--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523191/1523191_10401659_1483469730734_bti_filled--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Kaktovik Map Marked\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523191/1523191_10401659_1483469730734_bti_filled--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Kaktovik Map Marked\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example participant contribution on hard copy maps.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Brady</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;B&nbsp;Brady</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Kaktovik Map Marked</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523191/1523191_10401659_1483659198406_edit_20160407_182057--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523191/1523191_10401659_1483659198406_edit_20160407_182057--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Barrow Mapping Workshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523191/1523191_10401659_1483659198406_edit_20160407_182057--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Barrow Mapping Workshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Barrow Mapping Workshop</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Brady</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;B&nbsp;Brady</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Barrow Mapping Workshop</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
