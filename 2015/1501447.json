 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"InnovATE\" project is increasing graduates in STEM disciplines, particularly underrepresented minorities and women, in response to demand for local, highly-skilled workforce needs in the power, aerospace, and manufacturing industries. Synergistic programs are increasing awareness of STEM in middle through high schools, strengthening math skills, and developing a pathway for pursuit of associate and baccalaureate high-tech degrees. These programs include: a STEM outreach program impacting 1680 middle and secondary students; a summer program for incoming students to complete the Production Technician Certification earning 15 college credit-hours; a contextualized Intermediate Algebra gateway course to improve math skills proficiency; intensive academic support through math/science Supplemental Instruction; and articulation agreements to baccalaureate degrees.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit drivers of InnovATE are aligned with rigorous assessments to advance understanding of which tools and strategies aid successful completion of associate degrees in Electrical Power and Engineering Technologies. This includes developing assessment tools and activities for identifying key factors influencing enrollment in STEM programs, establishing instructional supports needed in Mathematics, studying the influence of mentors and industry partners have on students to induce willingness to succeed, and evaluating learning strategies to advance discovery of how STEM technicians learn, study, and train. InnovATE will address the need to diversify the STEM workforce by targeting Title I schools as the primary pipeline for students from underrepresented groups enrolling in the college to advance desired economic and societal outcomes. In addition, InnovATE's broader impacts will provide a transferable model to increase students pursuing degrees to join a highly-qualified STEM workforce.",

Our numerous outreach events were designed to evangelize on the vibrancy and meaningfulness of STEM content and careers, and included STEM competitions where students worked not only on ecological challenges, but did so under the theme of gracious professionalism. We connected not only with students and teachers, but also with parents and guardians, community non-profits, working engineers, and in so doing created an ecosystem. Our team also collaborated closely with supportive industry to host student tours of local manufacturing and aerospace facilities, engaging our Business Development Board, the Palm Beach County School District, and local businesses and community groups tied to STEM, education, or both. An important component of the InnovATE grant was our opportunity to bring college and secondary school students to campus to touch and experience real-world technology, and to tour local industry sites to bridge the gap between classroom and the career.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The grant intended to create a pipeline between young people and industry, which has a high demand for technically trained individuals. Specific target populations included young women and Title I high school students, who traditionally lack opportunities in, awareness of, and support to pursue engineering technology degrees, a college education in general, and/or a STEM career. Engineering-related jobs can lead to a successful, stable financial future for those who take interest in certain technological tracks, and help fulfill a local talent gap. The Electrical Power Technology (EPT) and Engineering Technology (ET) Associate in Science degree programs at PBSC maintain strong relationships with area companies who regularly offer internships and jobs to students, and provided robust vocal and financial support of the grant?s goals. Industry partners were a key component of our success in that they willingly hosted tours, served as adjunct faculty, donated equipment, and shared their time with students.
