 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER project integrates research, educational, and outreach components to overcome current scientific limitations to achieving effective smart electronic sensor miniaturization. The main societal benefits will be realized in the healthcare sector, where a medical chip can be implanted in the human brain or heart tissue to diagnose and treat patients with physical, neurological and psychological disabilities and diseases. By enabling large-scale neuro-modulation, the miniaturized sensor could lead to new solutions for neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's, memory loss or pain management. \r\n\r\nThe project's multi-faceted educational plan will incorporate class and online teaching and outreach to educate a broad international audience of academics, students, and the general public about the project's research theories, designs and experiments. High school students from underrepresented groups will participate in laboratory research, and an online, open-access course will be developed to broadly disseminate results to the larger community. Emerging online teaching and learning platforms and techniques will be utilized. \r\n\r\nTechnical\r\n\r\nSensor size reduction is essential for a variety of next generation smart sensor applications including medical implants that can monitor and modulate local physiology, and diagnose and treat disabilities and diseases. Current methodologies cannot deliver sufficient power to millimeter (mm) or sub-mm scale sensors, and functionally-acceptable sensors are either too large for their intended application or, if scaled, have extremely limited operational capability and range. These limitations are fundamental, and further optimization of the same techniques and methodologies cannot meet application requirements.\r\n\r\nThe research project seeks to overcome those limitations by using acoustic waves in the ultrasonic range - a new wireless power delivery technique for implantable devices to substantially improve the overall efficiency, sensor dimensions and depth of operation.",

IMDs have also been proposed for more precise long-term health monitoring to enable closed-loop personalized diagnostics and therapeutics. In order to treat and diagnose diseases locally and mitigate unwanted side effects from invasive surgeries, long wires, and large device sizes, our goal was to realize wireless miniaturized and robust medical implants. To achieve minimally invasive millimeter or sub-millimeter dimensions, we eliminated bulky batteries and wires which are present in today?s implants by using ultrasound wireless power transfer and communication.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Ultrasound provides an efficient mechanism for power and data transfer because of its low propagation loss in the body, high FDA safety limit, and focusing capabilities. For this project we first developed a design framework for ultrasonic power and communication links. Using this framework we found the optimal design parameters including materials, operating frequency, transmitter/receiver size, and packaging for different applications. Using these findings, we demonstrated the feasibility of powering and communicating with mm-sized implants at large enough distances to effectively cover anywhere in the body. Implant packaging and wireless operation were also extensively evaluated to verify biocompatibility and safe operation. Finally, we improved the robustness of the system by developing hardware, protocols, and algorithms to localize, focus power, and communicate with multiple implants in real-time. These developments have resulted in a scalable ultrasonic wireless power and data implant platform that can be used for a variety of biomedical applications.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In collaboration with many researchers across different departments at Stanford, we designed and tested mm-sized, ultrasonically powered implants for continuous sensing and therapeutic applications. Unlike a visit to the doctor or sending a sample to the lab, implants can continuously measure biomarkers and provide treatment on demand. For sensing, we developed ultrasonically powered implants that can wirelessly transmit data externally to monitor patient health. These include a pressure sensor for measuring pressure in the bladder and blood, a gut sensor for measuring oxidation reduction potential (ORP) to evaluate gut microbiome health, an aptamer sensor for biomolecular monitoring to track drug distribution, and an imager for ultrasound and thermoacoustic imaging. To demonstrate therapeutic wireless implants, we developed an implant that can electrically stimulate nerves and a programmable electrochemical drug delivery implant. We also developed an RF-ultrasound relay system to enable wireless powering for deep retinal and brain implants. These IMDs demonstrate the potential of our ultrasonic implant platform which can be further expanded to many more applications in the future.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Our research has been published in journals and presented at many conferences and seminars.
