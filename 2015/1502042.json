 "awd_abstract_narration": "The San Francisco Bay Area has been called the \"birthplace of biotechnology\" and continues to dominate the international biotechnology industry with the largest concentration of biotechnology companies and employees in the world. Because biotechnology is a dynamic and evolving field, employers want well-rounded individuals with more than traditional technical skills. Skyline College proposes to build a strong biotechnology program that responds to new and emerging market forces and addresses the needs of the local community,\r\n\r\nInitially, biotechnology faculty will collaborate with industry partners to design an entry- and mid-level Biotechnology Technician Certificate program. Additionally, a summer bridge program will be developed followed by development of the BioBridge program. The BioBridge project will attract students from groups under-represented in STEM fields and launch them on a pathway to further education and careers in biotechnology, while advancing the field of biotech education. The two-semester program will employ a cohort model; a curriculum that contextualizes and integrates science, math, English, and 21st century skills acquisition; project-based learning and teamwork experience in a lab environment; workplace soft skills instruction; work-based learning opportunities, and wraparound supports for students. It will be closely aligned with evolving trends and workforce needs of the immediate geographic region as well as the larger San Francisco Bay Area. In year one, Skyline and its partners will develop the BioBridge curriculum; obtain industry commitments for work-based learning opportunities; and recruit the first cohort of students from high schools in San Mateo County's South San Francisco school district. In years two and three, the program will be piloted with cohorts of 25 students. As the program will target and promote the success of students from groups underrepresented in STEM (specifically Latinos and women), it will increase their participation in post-secondary STEM education and careers and support the development of a diverse STEM workforce.",

In addition, BioBridge strategically recruits students to the field who may not otherwise choose to pursue it, while enhancing students&rsquo; science, basic skills learning, soft skills development and career readiness. The original pilot cohort has led to additional cohorts, bridge programs, and partnerships; among them strong partnerships with K-12 resulting in biotechnology dual enrollment opportunities for high school students, summer bridge programs in biotechnology, and a robust regional learning community focused on sharing best practices, leveraging resources, and developing an engaged and active biotechnology student body. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;\">In an effort to remain reflexive, document and disseminate high impact practices, and engage in ongoing, real-time program improvement, the BioBridge program conducted regular evaluations, reviewed data and student outcomes, and engaged in active dialogue with all stakeholders to ensure the program remained responsive and adaptive to student and industry needs. Based on the BioBridge student survey evaluations from fall 2016 to spring 2018, student survey respondents reported feeling supported by biotechnology faculty, and many respondents cite the direct hands-on experience they are gaining and the opportunity to collaborate with peers in the learning process as program strengths. The majority of BioBridge students expressed a desire to obtain an associate&rsquo;s degree and/or transfer to obtain a four-year degree in a STEM field, which indicates further inquiry is needed to determine the appropriate programmatic changes to ensure an increase in granted certificates. Lastly, improved tutoring resources and connections to industry were also areas of interest for students. As the survey data on working for pay indicates, the majority of BioBridge students work and have outside responsibilities beyond school. Therefore, in addition to exploring more structured relations with the College&rsquo;s Learning Center for academic support, the BioBridge program will also consider examining the times for course scheduling and coordinating future tutoring support to meet working adult needs.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: small;\">Since its inception, BioBridge successfully established pipelines to college and higher wage careers by integrating instruction, a robust regional faculty community of practice, work based learning, dedicated counseling, and additional wrap around services and supports. BioBridge increased students&rsquo; foundational skills in reading, writing, and mathematics while enrolling students in career education and training in biotechnology. Skyline College is dedicated to the success of all of its students but has taken significant measures to ensure that youth and young adults, particularly those most under-resourced are prepared for college and career.
