 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Mathematics and its Applications (IMA) is a visitors' institute whose goals are to (1) develop transformative mathematical research through interdisciplinary exploration, (2) strengthen the workforce that engages in interdisciplinary mathematical research, and (3) provide rapid dissemination of research and promote the mathematical sciences. To achieve these goals, the IMA offers activities involving the mathematical sciences in the broadest sense and encompassing the physical, computer, life, and social sciences, as well as engineering and industry. Through these activities, the IMA works to solidify the role of the mathematical sciences as the foundation for twenty-first century research and technology.\r\n\r\nThe IMA serves as a hub for collaboration, bringing together mathematical scientists and application domain experts. The annual thematic program focuses either on an application field where mathematics is poised to make important contributions or on a branch of mathematics and its applications. Long-term visitors and postdoctoral fellows form the intellectual anchor of the activity; shorter-term visitors come for week-long workshops on related topics. The IMA is also an established center for industrial mathematics, serving as a resource for industry through joint sponsorship of postdoctoral fellows and workshops in areas of importance to industry. These activities facilitate technology transfer from researchers to industrial users.\r\n\r\nIMA programs provide research training for postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates. The IMA also offers educational activities designed to engage future scientists of high-school age and beyond. The IMA vigorously pursues the engagement of under-represented groups in the mathematical sciences and also runs workshops directly addressing diversity in the mathematical sciences. The Institute runs a public lecture series to increase awareness of, and appreciation for, the role contemporary mathematics plays in the resolution of important technological, scientific, and societal problems.",
