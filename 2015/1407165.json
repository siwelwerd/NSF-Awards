 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary objective of this RET in Engineering and Computer Science Site: Integrated Nanomanufacturing hosted by the Boston University Photonics Center (BUPC) is to immerse teachers in a six-week summer program that focuses on interdisciplinary research experiences to explore the design, fabrication, and application of nanometer-scale components in optical, electronic, mechanical and biomedical systems addressing important technological problems. Mentored research projects will challenge participants to engage in engineering problem solving, and the knowledge gained will help participants develop sustainable curricula and activities in STEM education. RET teachers will return to their classrooms with an improved and relevant skill set to foster their student's interest in engineering disciplines and to succeed with the ambitious educational goals of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). This proposed RET Site is focused on underserved schools in the greater Boston area with the goal of recruiting participants from a diverse group with 80% from resource-limited schools with high percentages of underrepresented minority students. To achieve this goal the RET Site will work directly with Massachusetts STEM pipeline networks to target schools and individual teachers with STEM interest but limited resources to implement these activities. \r\n\r\nIntegrated nanomanufacturing research is an inherently interdisciplinary intellectual area that is evolving rapidly at the intersecting frontiers of microelectronics, optical science, materials engineering, and biomedicine.  Three thematic research areas will serve as the foundation for this RET Site: nanophotonics, nanostructures, and nanomedicine.  While engaged in mentored discovery, engineering of new devices and fabrication at the nanoscale level to explore optical systems, participants will develop critical skills, awareness and confidence necessary to advance in academics and research in the future. The summer experience will involves training sessions, hands-on cleanroom activities, scientific research in partner laboratories, seminars on classroom integration, and faculty pedagogy discussions. Participants will also be introduced to the idea of Societal Engineers, a new core concept at Boston University to develop engineers who can connect their training to integrate content and applications reflecting how science and engineering is practiced in the real world. \r\n \r\n\r\nAcknowledgement: This project is supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers at the National Science Foundation.",

The undergraduate research population over the course of the program included participant demographics of 65% female and 76% underrepresented minorities in engineering.
