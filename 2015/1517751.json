 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will dissect how plant viruses interact with the actin cytoskeleton, one of the intracellular protein scaffolds along which much molecular movement (trafficking) occurs. Viruses appear to target the actin network to reprogram cellular pathways so that they support the virus life cycle instead of performing normal cellular functions. It has been observed that viruses modify the functionality of the actin network, thereby dramatically reorganizing the infected cells to support viral replication.  A potential societal benefit of this research is a deeper understanding of virus-host interactions that could lead to potent new anti-viral approaches. In addition, this work will provide training for graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow and will provide opportunities for high school students to participate in supervised research and present their results at high school science competitions.\r\n\r\nThe project will exploit the new discovery that plant viruses target cellular cofilin, a major regulator of the actin network. The research will address the questions: How does a virus exploit cofilin to interfere with the actin network? How does actin organization control viral replication in cells? The project will take advantage of yeast as a model host for viruses, allowing the testing of well-characterized cofilin and actin mutants in virus replication. In vitro assays with purified components and microscopy-based analysis of the actin network in yeast and plant cells accumulating viruses will be used to unravel the steps in the viral replication process that are affected by actin. Proteomic analysis of the viral replication complex will determine which of the host proteins that are subverted by viruses are regulated by the actin network.",

The work has shown that viruses target the actin network to reprogram cellular pathways so that they support virus life cycle during disease instead of performing normal cellular function. The PI has found that the actin network plays a role in assembling molecular viral replication machines that copy virus genetic material. The performed work established that the co-opted actin network plays a pro-viral function by facilitating the propagation of infectious viral genomes. The PI has demonstrated that plant-infecting tombusviruses modify the functionality of the actin network, and dramatically reorganize the infected cells to support viral replication. Plant viruses were shown to target the cellular cofilin, a major regulator of the actin network. The research has shown that by the virus-driven inhibition of cofilin function, plant viruses gain organizational control of infected cells. The obtained key discoveries: The PI?s lab has showed that the tombusvirus-coded viral replication factor interacts with the cellular cofilin, which is an actin depolymerization factor. This protein interaction helps the virus to co-opt the actin network to support increased level of tombusvirus replication in yeast and plants and elevated <em>in vitro</em> activity of the purified tombusvirus replicase. The PI showed that the genesis of the large tombusvirus-induced replication organelles depend on actin filaments in infected plant cells. The actin filaments are used by tombusviruses in several ways. For example, tombusviruses utilized the co-opted actin network to efficiently subvert numerous cellular protein factors for pro-viral functions. These include cellular lipid-binding proteins that provide sterols and new membranes for the formation of viral-induced replication organelles. The subverted actin network was also shown to facilitate the recruitment of cellular compartments, such as endosomes and the endosomal Rab5 small GTPase for the genesis of viral replication organelles. The PI has shown that tombusviruses also co-opt the cellular glycolytic pathway, which is responsible for providing ATP for energy-consuming processes during viral replication organelle formation and viral replication. This is the first time that the role of the actin network was shown to be important for the local generation of ATP within the viral replication organelles.</p>\n<p>The PI has developed a new approach based on bacterial protein effectors to block the actin network and affect tombusvirus replication in plants. Proteomics approaches revealed that several of the co-opted host factors were poorly recruited into the tombusvirus replication organelles when the actin network was blocked by the expression of a bacterial protein, called RavK effector. Altogether, the performed works by the PI?s lab showed convincingly that the actin network is absolutely critical for the replication of plant and insect viruses. This is a major paradigm-shift in virus-host interactions, greatly contributing to our understanding of the disease-causing events driven by the virus. By regulating the functions of the actin network, viruses gain supremacy in subversion of cellular factors for pro-viral functions. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Intellectual merit of the project: Virus ? host interactions are currently among the most intensively studied research areas due to the promising new antiviral approaches emerging from these studies. Viruses, which are important human, animal and plant pathogens, exploit host cells by recruiting host factors and escaping host antiviral responses. The PI found that the cellular cofilin gene, which is involved in actin network organization, is a major factor in tombusvirus replication. The discovery that tombusviruses depend on co-opting actin filaments in infected cells opened up a new antiviral strategy to limit virus infections in plants and likely in animals. The PI?s lab developed <em>innovative approaches including yeast and plant assays for tombusviruses a powerful cell-free virus replication assay. Overall, the work is having a major impact on our view on the role of the actin network in virus replication.</em> Altogether, determination of the mechanism of the virus-driven regulation of the actin network during viral infections facilitated the development of novel antiviral approaches. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader impacts of the project: The performed pioneering research on tombusvirus replication <em>will immensely help other scientists working with less tractable, but devastating viral pathogens for which similar studies are currently not yet feasible. </em>Many of the host factors, which have been characterized during this project, have also been shown to pertinent to human viruses. Therefore, research on tombusviruses has great impact on human and veterinary medicine and plant pathology, by unraveling new host factors. Education component: Undergraduate and graduate students actively participated in research in the PI?s laboratory that led to research papers. The students were exposed to highly innovative research and this experience provided them invaluable learning experience. This research promoted interdisciplinary learning. The research also included mentoring postdocs and prepared them for a scientific career in academia as well as industry.
