 "awd_abstract_narration": "1512517 - Henderson\r\n\r\nA special form of polymer that can be tailored to have very unique properties is commonly referred to as a block copolymer. Block copolymers are made by simply joining two different types of polymer chains together.  Since different types of polymers do not like to mix, much like oil and water separate, the two different polymer chains or blocks also try to separate from one another but can only move apart at distances comparable to the length scale of the polymer molecules since they are bonded together.  This naturally gives rise to materials possessing structure and order at nanometer length scales.  These phase separated and ordered block copolymers can have very unique properties because of this micro- and nanostructure.  One interesting and important application for such ordered block copolymers is as templates for making the nanometer scale features used to build microchips.  This project will develop the fundamental knowledge about the self-assembly process that occurs in such block copolymers to allow materials and processes to be designed for manufacturing next generation microchips and other ordered nanostructured materials.         \r\n\r\nThe use of block copolymer micro-phase separation to form polymer thin films with controlled nanoscale morphologies offers potential solutions to problems in diverse fields, including semiconductor manufacturing, fuel cells and batteries, and solar energy.  Directed self-assembly (DSA) methods offer the possibility to use the interaction of a block copolymer thin film with heterogenous patterned interfaces to guide assembly of the block copolymer microphases into desired orientations with long range order.  While most work to date has focused on \"symmetric\" block copolymers with similar block properties (e.g. PS-b-PMMA), block copolymers that possess large differences in their cohesive energy differences (i.e. high polymer Flory-Huggins chi values) are of interest to achieve micro-phase separated morphologies with smaller feature sizes.  Such \"asymmetric\" block copolymers and their phase behavior are not yet well understood. In this project, a new meso-scale molecular dynamics model that can accurately reproduce the properties and behavior of realistic block copolymers possessing asymmetric block interactions will be used to understand the bulk and thin film behavior of such materials, particularly with respect to DSA applications.  This modeling work will be validated by comparison of model results with experimental data from high chi block copolymer thin film DSA systems.   The intellectual merits of the proposed work can broadly be defined as: (1) establishment of fast and efficient tools for predicting behavior of block copolymer films, (2) elucidation of the impact of factors such as polymer composition and block energetics, interface composition and structure, and film thickness on the morphology and properties of microphase separated block copolymer thin films. \r\n\r\nThe broader societal impacts of this activity include: (1) forming the foundation of methods and data that enable general design of block copolymer thin film materials for a range of fields from water separation to organic photovoltaics, (2) advancing the development of DSA patterning methods for fabrication of next generation integrated circuits, (3) developing computational material modeling tools for block copolymers, (4) enhancing under-represented minority education in science and engineering at the undergraduate and graduate level, (5) training of K-12 science teachers, and (6) STEM education K-12 students through the Cub Scout and Boy Scout NOVA program.",
