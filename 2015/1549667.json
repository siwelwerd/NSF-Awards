 "awd_abstract_narration": "Kinematic synthesis is the technique for creating mechanisms which follow a desired path through space. An example of kinematic synthesis is designing a mechanism to drive a robot leg. Although kinematics as a field is two centuries old, there is not yet a general method to go from a path specification to a set of links and joints. This EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project aims to develop a new solution method for computational kinematic design, which will allow for the computation of complete solution sets to large synthesis problems previously regarded as intractable. The new solution method is named the Finite Root Generation method and has direct applications to current needs in the field of biomimetic robotics. Specifically, legged millirobots are in need of switchable kinematics for low to high speed running gaits that will enable a greater range of mobility without the cost of adding actuators. As a broader impact, this research will enable more effective search and rescue robots at lower cost, through the use of inexpensive mechanisms rather than expensive motors.\r\n\r\nThe class of problems considered in this award are complete solution sets to general formulations of kinematic synthesis equations, which result in high degree synthesis equations. The current state-of-the-art root finding method is the homotopy continuation method, which seems limited to systems of degree less than 1 billion. The Finite Root Generation method aims to solve synthesis equations of many orders of magnitude greater than this. This is possible because the Finite Root Generation method avoids computing roots at infinity, where homotopy algorithms spend the majority of their time computing infinite roots only to then filter these solutions out. The Finite Root Generation method intends to provide a complete picture of the design space, offering the designer unintuitive solutions that cannot be found any other way. The intellectual merit of this project centers around the introduction of a new and potentially transformative solution method to the field of computational kinematic design, and the application of this method to biomimetic millirobot design to create drastic improvements in running efficiency and performance.",
