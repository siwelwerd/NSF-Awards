 "awd_abstract_narration": "A major topic under study in this project is mean curvature flow.  Mean curvature flow (MCF) has been used and studied in materials science for almost a century to model phenomena such as cell, grain, and bubble growth.  MCF's computational and theoretical study, as well as that of other similar flows, have had enormous impact in diverse areas of pure and applied mathematics, theoretical physics, materials science, and engineering.  A particular emphasis of this project is to understand the evolution of a typical (or generic) surface.  Are the singularities of flow and the structure of the set where the singularities occur simpler and nicer in the typical case than in bad examples?\r\n\r\nThis research project is divided into four parts.  The first part concerns what happens to a hypersurface under the mean curvature flow. This part is mostly concerned with hypersurfaces that are in general or generic position before the flow starts.  The mean curvature flow (MCF) is the negative gradient flow of volume, so any hypersurface flows through hypersurfaces in the direction of steepest descent for volume and eventually becomes extinct in finite time.  The project further develops the theory of generic MCF, extending recent results to other flows.  A second part of the project concerns Ricci curvature. Previously estimates with applications have been obtained by the PI and Naber, and recently monotonicity formulas have been proved by the PI and used with Minicozzi to settle a long standing open problem about uniqueness of tangent cones of Einstein metrics. This part of the project discusses possible extensions and related conjectures.  The third part of the project concerns the longstanding classification problem in the theory of Heegaard splittings of 3-manifolds: to exhibit for each closed 3-manifold a complete list, without duplication, of all its irreducible Heegaard splittings, up to isotopy. The final and smaller part of the proposal is about bounds for nodal sets (or zero sets) of eigenfunctions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding singularities, and the sets where they occur, is the central problem in mean curvature flow.   The 1980s saw dramatic progress in low dimensions, but less in high dimensions where there is an infinite array of possible singularities.  A 2012 Annals of Math paper by Colding and Minicozzi showed that the only generic singularities are cylindrical, proving a 20 year old conjecture and opening new lines of approach.    In a 2015 Annals of Math paper,    Colding and Minicozzi proved the uniqueness of cylindrical blowups, solving a long-standing open problem.  This uniqueness   opened the door to two sharp results.  The first, in a 2016 Inventiones paper, was a structure theorem and sharp bound for singular sets.  The second, in CPAM papers from 2016 and 2018, was optimal regularity for the level set equation.\n\n Modeling of a wide class of physical phenomema leads to tracking fronts moving with curvature-dependent speed.  The level set method of Osher and Sethian has been used with great success over the last 30 years in both pure and applied mathematics; the analytic foundations were laid by Evans-Spruck,  Chen-Giga-Goto and others.   Given an initial front, the level set method is used to analyze its subsequent motion. When the speed is the mean curvature and the front is monotone, this leads to  one of the classical degenerate elliptic equations on Euclidean space.   A priori solutions are only defined in the viscosity sense.\n  Colding-Minicozzi proved these viscosity solutions are always twice differentiable classical solutions (CPAM, 2016). This result is optimal and the second derivative is continuous only in very rigid situations that have simple geometric interpretations (CPAM, 2018).  This equation fits into a family of much-studied degenerate  PDEs;   such high regularity has been shown only for this equation.  Moreover,   the gradient flow for the arrival time function has a great deal of structure, much like analytic gradient flows, in spite of its low regularity.   In a 2019 CPAM paper, Colding and Minicozzi prove conjectures of Rene Thom and Vladimir Arnold, originally conjecture for analytic flows, for the arrival time.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/18/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tobias Colding"
