Caflisch\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mission of the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IPAM) is to foster the interaction of mathematics with a broad range of science and technology, to build new interdisciplinary research communities, to promote mathematical innovation, and to engage and transform the world through mathematics.  Mathematics is an essential ingredient in much of current technology, including internet search engines, medical imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography, voice recognition systems, DNA sequencing methods, and many others. Future developments -- such as smart electrical grids, personalized medicine, and new forms of social networking -- will require further mathematical innovation.  IPAM's overall goal is to foster the interaction of mathematicians with doctors, engineers, physical scientists, social scientists, and humanists to enable such future technological and social progress.\r\n \r\nIPAM fulfills its mission through workshops and long programs that connect mathematics and other disciplines or multiple areas of mathematics. These activities bring in thousands of visitors annually from academia, government, and industry. IPAM also has programs that encourage the inclusion of women and members of minorities underrepresented in the mathematics community, that serve specific  needs of government agencies, and that inform the public about the excitement of modern mathematics and the important contributions that have come to society through mathematics.\r\n \r\nThrough these activities, IPAM serves the national interest. IPAM promotes the progress of science by stimulating the mathematical developments that are needed for this progress; advances the national health, prosperity, and welfare through programs that address challenges such as disease modeling, systemic financial risk assessment, and traffic control; and helps to secure the national defense through programs that address defense requirements such as advanced radar, computer-aided decision making, and new communication modalities.",
