 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide support for participants, especially junior researchers, in the conference \"Waves, Spectral Theory, and Applications\" in Princeton, NJ from September 10-11, 2015. This conference will bring together experts in both the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations and cutting edge applications, which are dramatically impacted by the study of waves and spectral theory in nonlinear science. The models to be discussed at the conference have applications to the studies of graphene, nonlinear optics, neuroscience, large quantum systems, and the formation of topological states.   Such states are ideal for the transfer or storage of energy or information. Another important set of mathematical problems concerns the issues for design of metamaterials. Metamaterials are composites that include nano-size microstructures. In some regimes these materials exhibit properties not achievable in naturally occurring materials. For example, it is possible to manufacture a metamaterial with negative index or reflection that allows one to \"cloak\" objects, making them invisible.  \r\n\r\nThe conference will focus on the issues of spectral theory and nonlinear dynamics that are instrumental for understanding the behavior of nonlinear bound states interacting with various types of potentials. Another focus of the conference is on the metameterials-related problems that lie outside the realm of standard homogenization theory as well as to problems concerning non-elliptic limits of families of elliptic problems.

Talk topics included degenerate dispersive models, stability theory, adiabatic limits for wave packets, diffusive models from social science, quasilinear PDEs in fluids and relativity, obstacle scattering, and more.   \n\nThe break-out sessions covered highly active topics currently under investigation including Quantum Graphs, Maslov Indices in PDE, Random Schr&ouml;dinger operators, PT symmetric problems in physics, microlocal methods for wave equations and modified energy methods in quasilinear PDE.  Each topic was presented by an expert in the area and featured 2-hour long discussions of open problems, as well as important techniques and intuition.  Most were very directed towards graduate students, featuring a presentation of a toy problem and some lecture notes.  Two included more collaborative discussions amongst active researchers in the field. \n\nThe poster session featured posters to highlight graduate student research presented by Rachael Keller of Columbia on dispersion surfaces for square lattice potentials, Paul Cornwell of UNC on the Maslov Index in stability theory, and Jacob Shapiro of Purdue on scattering theory for the wave equation. \n\nThe workshop served to highlight active research areas, fascilitate research collaborations and pass on ideas/techniques to a new generation of applied mathematicians.  \n\nMore information including talk abstracts can be found on the conference web-page:\n\nhttp://pde.unc.edu/waves-spectral-theory-and-applications-part-2/\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeremy L Marzuola"
