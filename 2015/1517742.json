The large sample will enable detailed studies of systematic uncertainties due to the wide range of observed supernova properties and the environment they explode in, leading to improved measurements of the expansion history of the Universe.  \r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students.  The PI will also work with advanced undergraduate students to create new in-class demonstrations and structured learning activities that will help reform the introductory physics classes at Penn.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe DES SN Survey discovered several thousands of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) during its 5-year program.  This project involves the analysis of their light curves, host galaxy data, and impact on cosmologial measurements.  We performed our first significant analysis of 250 spectroscopically confirmed SN Ia from the first 3 years of the program.  We characterized the biases and developed novel algorithms that accounts for the selection effects.  The many sources of systematic uncertainties including photometric calibration, photometric extraction method, spectroscopic-selection function, and others were studied and quantified through elaborate simulations of our survey.  The final DES constraints on the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, w, is comparable to the previous state-of-the-art dataset using only a small subset of our final 5-year sample.\n\nHost galaxy properties - stellar mass and star-formation rate - of our SN Ia were also derived using optical and near infrared photometry.  Spectroscopic redshifts were measured from the OzDES survey.  Surprising, the DES dataset shows no obvious correlation between host stellar mass and Hubble residuals - a correlation that was seen in essentially all previous datasets.  The DES sample also shows the smallest intrinsic luminosity scatter of all previous surveys.  The cause of this discrepancy is under investigation, and we believe it will eventually shed new light on improving distance measurements with SN Ia.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe PI has helped transfrom the introductory physics courses at Penn from the traditional large-lecture-hall format to incorporating active learning and in-class activities in a collaborative environment.  Numerous new active learning classrooms were constructed on campus.  Our surveys show that active learning not only increases student performance on common exams, but more importantly substantially improves the students' self-assessment of the material and attitude about the field.  More students are excited to learn physics in this format.  We also incorporated laboratory exercises into the classroom and developed hands-on activities that require more critical thinking than the traditional labs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Masao Sako"
