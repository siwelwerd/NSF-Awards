The 2015 Gordon Research Conference on Drinking Water Disinfection By-Products will present cutting-edge research on the purification of water and the generation of disinfection by-products. With the era of pristine source waters ending, vitally important issues confront scientists, engineers, water utilities, industry groups and public health professionals in the production and delivery of high quality potable water. Increasing demands on scarce water sources, drought, water pollution and an aging water delivery infrastructure are preeminent challenges for society. The Conference will feature a wide range of topics including Drinking Water Disinfection By-Products formation, occurrence, toxicity and molecular mechanisms, engineering solutions, health effects and regulation. The conference is entitled, \"Drinking Water Disinfection By-Products\" and will be held at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, MA from August 9-14, 2015. Gordon Research Conferences are high impact Conferences as they assemble scientists at the forefront of their field and will provide a venue for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early career scientists to network, to learn and to plan future work together. For the first time, a Gordon Research Seminar, (August 8-9, 2015) will expand the opportunities for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early career scientists to present their work, and to be integrated into the general discussion of the. The Gordon Research Seminar will allow students and early career scientists to participate in career mentorship with senior scientists in the field.\r\n\r\nThe specific aims of this Gordon Research Conference and Seminar are to introduce novel information and critical review of the following topics; 1) Water disinfection in an era of water scarcity; 2) Water disinfection chemistry: analytical approaches on the formation and detection of emerging DBPs; 3) DBP toxicity: molecular mechanisms of action; 4) Integration of Disinfection By-Product analytical chemistry, quantitative toxicology and epidemiology; 5) Disinfection By-Products and the water energy nexus; 6) Wastewater reuse, desalination and emerging Disinfection By-Products; 7) Water disinfection challenges and Disinfection By-Products research in China; 8) Engineering options on Disinfection By-Product control; and 9) Disinfection By-Products research: the way forward, future research and regulation. This meetings because of its focus on the chemistry, toxicology and engineering of the environmental risks posed by emerging DBPs generated by the use degraded source waters, wastewater reuse and desalination. A goal of the Conference and Seminar is to aid in the establishment of interdisciplinary teams of academic scientists and engineers with industry scientists to develop new solutions and alternative practices to address these Disinfection By-Products issues and to protect the environment and the public health.",
