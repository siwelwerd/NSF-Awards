 "awd_abstract_narration": "This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) program focuses on engineering and technology projects related to mitigating global climate change, and is a collaboration between the University of North Dakota (UND), California State Polytechnic University at Pomona (CPP), and the Energy Research Institute (ERI) at the University of Leeds, UK. The student research projects will include: novel methods to extract, recover, and process the constituents of algae and biomass-derived oils for use as renewable fuels, replacements for fossil-derived commodity chemicals, and other high value specialty chemicals; fundamental studies of solar energy absorption by nanoparticles to improve solar energy systems; integrating biomass pyrolysis/electrical generation systems; identifying ways to remove barriers for a more sustainable civilian aviation  industry; and studying ways to accelerate the adoption of district energy technologies for the supply of heating and cooling in both the US and Europe.  The research will leverage an ongoing partnership between UND and CPP by adding collaborators at a leading UK research institute.\r\n\r\nThrough this award, undergraduate and graduate student investigators will work on key components of ongoing research efforts aimed at developing technologies that help to mitigate the overall emission of fossil-derived carbon, primarily from the supply and use of energy resources, upon the atmosphere.  An annual cohort of five students will participate in a year-long program, and a nine week research experience at Leeds will form the core of the program. The topic theme is designed to provide a wide spectrum of interdisciplinary projects that will enrich the student experience.  Participants will be drawn from UND (a research university) and CPP (a nondoctoral Hispanic serving university) that have a strong partnership with multiple pathways to encourage CPP students to consider research as a future career path.",
