The research effort combines experiment and theory, and will test the hypothesis for harvesting energy from mid-infrared light.  The education effort will include (1) K-12 and undergraduate STEM education, with an emphasis on underrepresented minorities and (2) Georgia Tech summer camp activity entitled \"Wearing the Sun,\" where Atlanta area high school students learn about solar energy harvesting by creating personalized, sunlight-activated clothing (i.e., T-shirts, etc.), will be enhanced during the proposed project.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal aims to investigate the mid-infrared localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) supported in selectively doped Si nanowires by understanding the structural and synthetic parameters that influence LSPR quality factor and probing the near-field coupling of neighboring LSPRs.  It also seeks to demonstrate enhanced vibrational mode sensing in thermal radiation hot spots.   By coupling experiment and theory, the PI will test the hypothesis that mid-infrared light can be confined via doped-Si resonators to the same extent as visible/near-infrared light in conventional plasmonic materials.  The proposed efforts will develop vapor-liquid-solid nanowire growth to engineer extreme light localization and transport via precise control of resonator geometry, carrier density, and spacing, hoping to develop ultra-compact thermal radiation waveguides, modulators, and detectors.",
