Nearly 30 years ago, Douglas Hofstadter showed theoretically that when electrons are exposed to both a magnetic field and a periodic electric field, a recursive self similar behaviour results.  Known as Hofstadter's Butterfly, this complex pattern represents one of the first fractal patterns discovered in Physics, and yet its experimental realization has since remained elusive. In a recent breakthrough discovery, the PI developed new techniques that enabled the first unambiguous observation of the butterfly spectrum in graphene-based devices. The fractal system represents a new kind of complex material that may enable new fundamental studies of patterned two-dimensional systems, as well as new directions in device engineering at the nanoscale. This research program is ideally suited to meaningful involvement by junior level students, since the fabrication and measurement can be quickly learned with limited knowledge of advanced physics.  In addition to providing research opportunities for undergraduates at The City College of New York (CCNY), a minority serving institution located in Harlem, this program will expand partnerships with local area high-schools to provide hands-on training to pre-university aged students in the area of nanotechnology.  Through a combination of lectures, workshops and research placements opportunities, this program is aimed at generating interest in nanoscience at an early age in an effort to promote and expand America's role in developing innovative technology in the coming decades. A unique advantage of the relationship between CCNY and its surrounding community is the ability to further target this program towards young students from traditionally underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nThis NSF Career Award will fund a  research and outreach program centered around  the experimental study of the fractal Hofstadter energy spectrum in graphene/boron nitride heterostructures devices. Nearly 40 years ago Douglas Hofstadter theoretically predicted that electrons subjected simultaneously to a magnetic field  and spatially periodic electric field exhibit fractal behaviour.  In a recent breakthrough discovery the PI demonstrated that the moire pattern resulting from placing graphene in contact with hexagonal boron nitride provides the ideal-sized superlattice potential for experimental realization of Hofstadter's fractal spectrum. Combining these fabrication techniques together with low temperature/high magnetic field transport measurements, the PI will utilize the graphene/h-BN platform to perform the first systematic experimental investigation of the predicted quantum fractal. This effort will address several outstanding and fundamental questions, such as the dependence of the spectrum on both the magnitude and symmetry of the superlattice; the influence of disorder; the nature of symmetry breaking; and the possibility of correlated behaviour due to strong  electron interactions. This research program is ideally suited to meaningful involvement by junior level students, since the fabrication and measurement can be quickly learned with limited knowledge of advanced physics.  In addition to providing research opportunities for undergraduates at The City College of New York (CCNY), a minority serving institution located in Harlem, this program will expand partnerships with local area high-schools to provide hands-on training to pre-university aged students in the area of nanotechnology.

Areas of focus included the hofstadter spectrum under applied magnetic fields as well as the effect of moire superllattices on graphene more broadly.  Major accomplishments within the lifetime of the awared are highlighted below\n\n \n\nHofstadter butterfly:  Development of device fabrifcation processes for realizing high-mobility magneto-transport  allowed first detailed study of the role of strong interactions within the hofstdater butterfly spectrum.   We observed coexistence of conventional fractional quantum Hall effect (QHE) states together with the integer QHE states associated with the fractal Hofstadter spectrum. At large magnetic field, we observed signatures of another series of states, which appeared at fractional Bloch filling index. These fractional Bloch band QHE states are not anticipated by existing theoretical pictures and point toward a distinct type of many-body state.  Studies of the low field magnetoreistance, Hall resistance, and shubnikov de haas were performed and correlated to the theoretical bandstructure. Quantitative measurements include fermi velocity versus density, e-e interaction versus fermi energy, and direct observation of the van hove singularity theoretically anticipated to emerge in the bandstructure \n\nPressure tuning of superlattices:  In moire superlattices the effective superlattice potential is determined by the graphene-BN coupling strength, which itself is related to the equilibrium distance between the atomic layers.  We examined the possibility of tuning these parameters by studying electron transport of BN-encapsulated graphene under high pressures.  Our experiment combined this with low temperature and high magnetic fields where the Hofstadter butterfly emerges.  This study results in several significant findings including i) the observation that the moire-induce bandgap in graphene diverges with increasing pressure; ii) the dielectric constant of the BN varies significantly with pressure;  iii)  we resolved open questions about the microscopic details of the moire patterned graphene, confirming that strain and corrugation plays a critical role iv) we demonstrated  the first capability to tunably control the bandstructure that results from coupling to the Moire superlattice.  In addition to providing a way to tune the strength of the mini-gaps in the fractal spectrum, our results are expected to have significant impact on the broader field of 2D heterostructures where tuning interlayer coupling can be used to modify device properties.\n\nRotationally tunable heterostructures:   The length scale of the moire superlattice plays a critical role in determining the resulting bandstructure of the hybrid material.
