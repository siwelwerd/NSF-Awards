 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific instruments can produce vast amounts of data. Besides capturing and storing data, it is important to give the global research community fast access to this data. In the case of remote sensing instruments like Doppler weather radar the challenges such instruments face in terms of connecting them to high-bandwidth networks is the fact that they have to be placed outside the lab at locations that are well suited for their sensing tasks, which are often not close to high-bandwidth networking infrastructure. For example, a radar is ideally placed at a location that is free of any obstructions such that it can scan the atmosphere with as little interference as possible.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to improve research that focuses on remote sensing by providing researchers the ability to transmit high-bandwidth time-series or spectral data, and analog signals via radio over fiber, in real time from sensors to remote storage and computing. The project improves connectivity from an on-campus tower hosting radar and other atmospheric sensors to the UMass Amherst computer network. A fiber connection is established between the tower and the main campus network with local storage capacity increases to 8 TB at the tower. This integration permits several new modes of real time data analysis for weather system research and allows for both more data to be captured and for more timely access to data.\r\n\r\nImproving atmospheric observations has significant impacts on weather modeling in general and weather warning and prediction in particular. Thus this project has the potential to support applications that increase the safety and security of US communities and the nation as a whole. In addition, this campus network infrastructure opens new opportunities for students. For example, students can obtain live analog or high-bandwidth time series radar data to experiment with.",
