The conference brings together researchers from diverse fields within the discipline of quantum many-body theory, which is a key component of modern theoretical physics. The conference facilitates the exchange of methodological knowledge and ideas between otherwise distant fields by disseminating recent advances that are of common interest; it also highlights the emergence of new fields. NSF support will enable the participation of young investigators and underrepresented minorities who otherwise might not be able to participate, and will also be available for students and young postdocs who wish to participate in lectures and tutorials planned for the intervening day between the two conferences. The conference provides an important educational experience and a networking opportunity for students and young postdocs.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award provides partial support for the 18th International Conference on Recent Progress in Many-Body Theory. This conference will be held back-to-back with the 2015 Symposium on Quantum Fluids and Solids at Niagara Falls on August 16-21, 2015. The conference brings together researchers from diverse fields within the discipline of quantum many-body theory. The conference facilitates the exchange of methodological knowledge and ideas between otherwise distant fields by disseminating recent advances that are of common interest; it also highlights the emergence of new fields. Topics covered include: many-body problems in quantum fluids, nuclear physics, correlated electron physics, relativistic many-body theory, cold gases, and new techniques. The invited speakers include recognized international experts. The conference's relatively small size offers the benefit of closer and more effective interactions among the participants. NSF support will enable the participation of young investigators and underrepresented minorities who otherwise might not be able to participate, and will also be available for students and young postdocs who wish to participate in lectures and tutorials planned for the intervening day between the two conferences. The conference provides an important educational experience and a networking opportunity for students and postdocs.",
