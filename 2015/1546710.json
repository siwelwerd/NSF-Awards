 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forging the link between individual neuron function and the behavior of collections of neurons that can produce complex behaviors is the central goal of contemporary neuroscience. The path towards achieving this goal is being revolutionized by genetic techniques that allow for manipulation of the activity of neurons and measurement of the effect on behavior. Flight behavior in the fruit fly, Drosophila, is highly suitable for this combined analysis, since flies can be genetically manipulated very easily and their rich set of free flight behaviors can be quantitatively characterized in great detail. This project will use this approach to unravel the design and operation of a remarkable neural circuit responsible for giving flies one of the fastest response times in the animal kingdom and controlling their high speed maneuvering capabilities. Using small magnets attached to the flies and applied magnetic fields, flies will be subjected to forces in midair that alter their flight. By turning on and off the neurons in the control circuit that governs their response to such forces and determining the resulting change in their wing motions, the role that each individual neuron plays in the neural circuit that governs the recovery of these insects to the experimental perturbation will be determined. More broadly this work will lay the framework for a general powerful approach for interrogating and building an understanding of many other complex neural circuits. Moreover, the discoveries made will inform design principles for the development of efficient control strategies that can be used in robots. This pipeline for discovery will be publicized through conference meetings, publications, and workshops. In addition, the analysis routines and resulting data will be made available through the Principal Investigator's group web site.  \r\n\r\nThe flight of fruit flies (Drosophila) provides a rich set of free flight behaviors that can be quantitatively characterized in great detail using methods recently developed by the PI. Towards this end, this project will develop a platform in which each neuron in this circuit can be manipulated using optogenetics and the altered behavioral response quantified, with the aim of dissecting with unprecedented detail a behaviorally vital yet poorly understood neural circuit. Crucially, the approach taken entails using large empirical data sets of flight kinematics in conjunction with the mathematical theory of dynamical systems to generate reduced order models. These models will be used to guide the experiment design and interpretation of the resulting kinematic data. Application of this approach to motor-neurons will be used to elucidate the role of specific steering muscles in the flight control process. Application of this approach to the inter-neurons, which relay sensory responses to the motor-neurons, is being used to elucidate the design and function of the neural control circuit that determines the fly's response to mid-air perturbations.  More broadly the complexity and hierarchical layout of the machinery necessary for insect flight is typical of other complex neural circuits.",

Such techniques are most potent when used in combination with top-down approaches in quantitative behavioral analysis that directly elucidate neural circuit function. The flight of fruit flies is highly suitable for this combined analysis, since flies can be genetically manipulated very easily and their rich set of free flight behaviors can be quantitatively characterized in great detail using recently developed methods. Previous work showed that the rapid flight stabilization reflex in fruit flies is well-described by a PI controller model, a subset of the PID controller family. In these models, the fly?s angular velocity and angular displacement?corresponding to the proportional (P) and integral (I) terms of the PI controller, respectively?are linearly combined to determine the modulation of key wing stroke kinematics. Through this grant roughly 220 optogenetically modified flies were generated that allowed for chronically silencing, or optogenetically activating or suppressing neuron firing for neurons in the ventral nervous cord that are responsible for implementing this stabilization circuit. Using lines that targeted the motor neurons for the basilar muscles b1 and b2, it was shown that chronic silencing has a strikingly specific effect on flight stabilization. Suppressing activity of the wing muscle motor neuron b1 removed the integral term in the proportional-integral (PI) controller model for pitch stabilization, but left roll and yaw stabilization unaffected. Like b1, suppressing b2 activity affects only pitch stabilization; however, for b2 this effect is seen in the proportional term in the PI model. Moreover, experiments underway suggest that suppressing motor neuron activity for muscles belonging to two other anatomical groups?the first and third axillary muscles?has a distinct effect on roll control. Together, these results imply that, at the level of the motor system, the flight reflex circuit is functionally segregated to control distinct degrees of freedom.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/10/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Itai&nbsp;Cohen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546710/1546710_10393019_1575923159390_perturbationexperiment--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546710/1546710_10393019_1575923159390_perturbationexperiment--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Perturbation Experiment\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546710/1546710_10393019_1575923159390_perturbationexperiment--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Perturbation Experiment\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Perturbation experiment where a magnet is glued to a fly and used to induce a pitch perturbation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Sam Whitehead and Itai Cohen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Itai&nbsp;Cohen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Perturbation Experiment</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546710/1546710_10393019_1575923087180_b1motorneuron--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546710/1546710_10393019_1575923087180_b1motorneuron--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"b1 motor neuron\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546710/1546710_10393019_1575923087180_b1motorneuron--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"b1 motor neuron\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Genetically modified flies were generated that allowed access to the b1 motor neuron.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Itai Cohen and Sam Whitehead</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Itai&nbsp;Cohen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">b1 motor neuron</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546710/1546710_10393019_1575923271673_controlcircuit--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546710/1546710_10393019_1575923271673_controlcircuit--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Identification of motor neuron function in the pitch control circuit of Drosophila\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1546710/1546710_10393019_1575923271673_controlcircuit--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Identification of motor neuron function in the pitch control circuit of Drosophila\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Control circuit diagram illustrating the roles of the b1 and b2 motor neurons.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Itai Cohen and Sam Whitehead</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Itai&nbsp;Cohen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Identification of motor neuron function in the pitch control circuit of Drosophila</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
