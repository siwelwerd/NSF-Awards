 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning Program (I-Corps L), this project will develop ways to increase the scale and impact of interactive activity to help high school students and the general public understand the foundational principles of stem cell biology.  The project focusing on stem cells is an interactive activity and demonstration developed to educate the public about key principles of stem cell biology and stem cell research. As stem cell research advances, there is a critical need to develop a solid foundational understanding of stem cells in both the next generation of scientists and the general public. Currently, there is a lack of interactive engaging activities and demonstrations available for use in the classroom to engage students on the topic. Most materials are limited to static presentations or non-interactive videos. This stem cell activity is unique in that the students begin to understand key concepts while engaging in an interactive activity. A prototype has been tested in high school biology classrooms and science festivals, with very positive results. Students involved are engaged throughout the interactive demonstration, rather than merely receiving information passively.  The activity improves students' understanding of what stem cells are and the challenges of stem cell research. This I-Corps for Learning project will develop approaches to enable this engaging activity to be easily implemented by other educators throughout the country.\r\n\r\nThe basic biological principles taught though this activity and apparatus include self-renewal, pluripotency, and differentiation. Additionally, students learn about growth factors and inhibitors through the use of the available tools to guide their pluripotent stem cell down the desired path. The equipment is currently available in two different sizes. A table-top sized unit is available for teachers to use in a classroom setting. A larger board version provides a tool for STEM outreach volunteers and STEM advocates to use when participating in STEM outreach events. Through I-Corps L, implementation in public school systems and STEM outreach organizations will be expanded with the goal of achieving broader impact in a sustainable manner.",
