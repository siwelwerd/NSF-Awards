 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ceramic, Composite and Optical Materials Center (CCOMC) is an NSF Phase II, I/UCRC which is managed by Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey (Rutgers) and Clemson University (Clemson). The Center is integrated between the two university partners and is directed by an Industrial Advisory Board (IAB) comprised of 21 multinational member companies and national laboratories. The mission of the CCOMC is to develop new, interdisciplinary technologies to increase the level of ceramic, polymer and optical material science, technology and engineering and to transfer these technologies to its industrial members to foster the development of competitive, reproducible ceramic, polymer fiber and composites made of them for advanced, high performance systems. The continuation proposal aims to broaden the scope of the Center to new areas that are technologically complementary and will lead towards the Center?s long terms self-sufficiency. \r\nThe programs within the Center focus on the creation of new materials, new synthesis and processing methods, process based models, measurements and characterization methods for complex, integrated systems and devices. CCOMC began with program thrusts in ceramic and polymeric materials and processing, nanoparticulates and processes, opaque armor ceramics, optical material synthesis and processing and materials for energy conversion. As we move forward into the next five years, we will expand the scope of our research to include new research thrust areas in ceramic matrix composites and superhard, high temperature material. In addition we will explore green/ecofriendly processing as potential thrusts. It is critical to long-term self-sufficiency that we not only attract a broader base of members, but  also be successful in securing Federal funding to strengthens new and existing thrusts to improve the visibility of the Center within both universities and abroad.",
