The key problem is a construction of a new algebro-geometric approach to 2x2 Fuchsian systems.\r\n\r\nThe technical content of the proposal is focused on exchanging scientific visits between the PI, his PhD students, and Prof. Shramchenko; this will include mini-courses delivered by the PI and the foreign collaborator. The milestone of the proposal is an informal meeting-workshop which is going to be organized in Spring 2015 at the University of Sherbrooke, in Sherbrooke, Canada, and is devoted to the topic of this proposal. The idea is to gather several experts from Canada to discuss the related topics.",
