 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative project involving the University of California, Davis (Award DUE-1525862), Diablo Valley College (Award DUE-1525057), Howard University (Award DUE-1524638), the College of Saint Benedict (Award DUE-1525021), Hope College (Award DUE-1524990), and the University of Arkansas, Little Rock (Award DUE-1525037).\r\n\r\nThis project will expand the content and capabilities of the STEMWiki Hyperlibrary, which was launched to provide vetted Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) learning resources to the public in the form of easily accessible, online college textbooks that alleviate the rising costs of postsecondary education. The STEMWiki Hyperlibrary consists of a number of connected, discipline-focused hypertext applications (ChemWiki, BioWiki, MathWiki, StatWiki, GeoWiki, PhysWiki), which are freely accessible to students regardless of socioeconomic or educational backgrounds. The ChemWiki (http://chemwiki.ucdavis.edu) is currently the most developed STEMWiki, with millions of visits each month. By making high-quality STEM learning resources readily available, the project will positively impact at least four main populations: (1) the non-science community; (2) socioeconomically disadvantaged students; (3) smaller or financially disadvantaged academic institutions, including high schools, that wish to adopt new learning technologies but cannot afford the initial steep costs of a new curriculum; and (4) discipline-based education researchers looking for a platform on which to evaluate new interdisciplinary approaches and curriculum modifications, which would otherwise absorb too large of a budget to develop from scratch. Once sufficiently developed, the Hyperlibary will be a power platform for the dissemination of new educational content and the evaluation of emerging educational technologies.\r\n\r\nThe STEMWiki Hyperlibrary is designed as a collaboratively constructed learning environment that enables the dissemination and evaluation of new educational resources and approaches as online course textbooks, with an emphasis on data-driven assessment of student learning and performance. The STEMWikis allow learners to cooperatively construct and organize knowledge, providing an important alternative to \"one size fits all\" instruction in which content is presented in a static, prepackaged manner. In this project, the investigators will augment the constituent STEMWikis of the Hyperlibrary with ancillary homework and simulation applications, as well as formative assessment modules. They will integrate the content of the STEMWikis both horizontally (across multiple STEM fields) and vertically (across multiple levels of complexity) within a network that will provide not just single textbooks but a rich \"hyperlibrary\" through which new, interconnected STEM textbooks can be constructed. The result will be an easy-to-use platform on which faculty members can collaborate to create and publish reusable, online pedagogical content. The project team will add ancillary online homework (the Student Ability Rating and Inquiry System [SARIS]) and simulations (via the ChemCollective, http://www.chemcollective.org). From these components, they will build an assessment infrastructure that tracks and correlates use of individual Wiki-based textbooks with simulations, homework activity, and exam performance, with the goal of identifying and tracking student performance across multiple STEM curricula.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe essential goal of my two-year NSF grant was to upgrade my freely available web biochemistry textbook to better meet the needs of modern users.  To do this I added new content from recent research publications.  Much of this material is not likely to appear in traditional biochemistry books and when it is, it is not necessarily examined from simple chemical principles. As an example of a recent addition, consider DNA, the carrier of genetic information. The two meters of DNA that is found in the nucleus of a human cell must be tightly compacted.  Part of it must be more open so it can be read out by cellular machinery into RNA and ultimately to proteins.  The transition from more to less compacted has recently been modeled as a transition from a solid to a more liquid state, a concept well studied by any chemistry student.\n\nThe new content is often accompanied by interactive molecular modeling tutorials, which are designed to help users learn how the structure of complex biomolecules mediate their function. This is one of the most important principles in all biochemistry. These tutorials allow users to change how the structures are displayed in ways that can visually and conceptually simplify the structural properties of the molecule.  For example, I?ve added content and interactive molecular models to show how protein complexes can perform such diverse tasks as \"fixing\" nitrogen gas from the atmosphere or initiate an inflammatory immune response when cellular proteins encounter such diverse agents as asbestos or bacteria.  Another example is the CRISPR/Cas9 structure, which is being used to edit genes and cure genetic diseases.\n\nI have also added content and interactive mathematical graphs to show how the interactions between biomolecules and their interacting partners depends on their concentrations and processes that change the molecules and their concentrations.  This topic is important since as our knowledge of the complexity of molecular interactions and their dependencies expands, we need mathematical models to test if our experimental findings match predictions.  Imagine a biomolecular structure than can form from two other molecules and which can be converted to two other structures.  Imagine now that each of the resulting and beginning structures likewise are made and converted to others as well.  Interactive mathematical graphs in the book are the only way the that users can gain a sense of how changes in these systems are linked. \n\nFinally, I added many self-assessment questions and answers based on the research literature, which help students go past the simple learning goals of remembering and understanding, to the higher order goals of applying and analyzing. These two critical learning skills are required for students as they seek employment or further education in an increasingly global and competitive world. \n\nUltimately Biochemistry Online, as part of the expanding LibreTexts collection, serves a much deeper need.  The Libre texts offer people from every walk of life and in every location around the world free texts.  These can be used in any educational setting (in a formal classroom on one?s own).  Their free availability can help mitigate economic and social disparities that decrease fair and equitable access to educational resources and opportunities.   \n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Henry V Jakubowski"
