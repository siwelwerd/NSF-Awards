 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main objective of this proposal is to request travel support for graduate students from\r\nUS institutions, who are co-authors of one or more accepted papers, to participate and present\r\ntheir work at the 3rd International Workshop on Compressed Sensing Theory and its Applications\r\nto Radar, Sonar and Remote Sensing (CoSeRa). This is the third edition of the CoSeRa workshop  \r\nseries, which will be held in Pisa, Italy, from June 16-19, 2015.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe 2015 CoSeRa Workshop will have a highly international profile, with participation from \r\neminent scientists in the Compressing Sensing, Radar Signal Processing and Remote\r\nSensing fields from all over the world. Every day, the conference will offer one plenary session,\r\ngiven by renowned scientists on key topics of research and development, and an oral and poster\r\nparallel scientific sessions, where participants can present their most recent results on\r\nthe different topics of the conference. Using this approach, CoSeRa-2015 will serve as an\r\ninvaluable occasion for US graduate students to get in touch with the worldwide leaders in\r\nsignal processing research and optimum system development. More importantly, the students\r\nwill gain new ideas leading to stronger and more complete theses, and can put their contributions\r\nin perspective and relative to the ongoing research activities. In essence, they will be exposed\r\nto the most recent and advanced findings in the aforementioned areas.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThe proposed graduate student participation is poised to have a positive impact on compressive\r\nsensing research in US institutions in the broad application areas of radar, sonar, and remote\r\nsensing. The broader impact of the proposed student participation will materialize in the\r\nnear future, as these students joining the US workforce will be better positioned to spearhead\r\nresearch and development activities in diverse industrial sectors, such as those serving law\r\nenforcement, homeland security, and defense as well as the automotive industries. Compressive\r\nSensing yields low cost system design, enables fast data acquisition, and simplifies operational\r\nlogistics, which are crucial considerations in many such applications.",
