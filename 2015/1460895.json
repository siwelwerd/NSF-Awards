 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Clemson University, located in Clemson, SC, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2016-2018. The program aims to inspire and empower REU students to pursue research careers by providing them the opportunity to do the things that scientists like to do best: Ask questions, design and carry out experiments, interpret results, and communicate findings. The program offers a collegial, multi-disciplinary environment with a focus on questions concerning an emerging challenge in biology -- the need to construct organismal phenotypes by linking genetic information and the environment. Meeting this challenge requires expertise across cellular, organismal, and ecological scales. Students will be paired with faculty members and lab groups from a range of disciplines in the Departments of Biological Sciences and Genetics & Biochemistry.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. The program includes professional development activities designed to build the students' research skills, written and oral communication skills, self-confidence, and appreciation of the scientific endeavor. Students who have completed one or two years of college will be recruited through the program's website, through visits to their colleges, and faculty-to-faculty communication. Students will be selected based on their research interests, academic record, and potential to carry out outstanding research in ecological genetics and related fields. A selection committee together with program faculty will select applicants for the program. \r\n\r\nThe success of the training program will be measured in various ways, including the REU common assessment tool. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting www.clemson.edu/culsoc/reu or by contacting the PI (Dr. Victoria Corbin at vcorbin@clemson.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Mike Sears at sears3@g.clemson.edu).",

Participants were recruited from primarily undergaduate institutions with particular focus places on recruitment from historically under-represented groups and first generation student. The goals of our program were: ) to inspire and empower under represented and minority undergraduates to pursue research careers, 2) to give students exciting and doable research projects within a dynamic, interdisciplinary environment 3) to help students develop strong written and oral communication skills, and 4) to provide mentoring and career advice beyond teaching students how to carry out experiments and beyond the end of the program. Thirty students participated in the program over a three year period. After a 3-month research experience, students presented their work in a capstone poster session with participants not only from our EU program, but also with other summer programs across the university. Topics ranged from the physiological responses of salamanders to environmental change, the responses of arsenic exposure to fish, the climbing kinematics of Hawaiian gobies, the evolution, genomics of the parasite <em>Toxiplasma gondii</em>, and the evolution of snake venom to name a few. Several students went on to present their fundings at national meetings as well as publish in scientific journals including <em>Aquatic Toxicology</em>, <em>Functional Ecology</em>, and <em>Nature Communications</em>. In addition to their research, students participated in a workshops that helped them prepare for graduate studies. Topics ranged from how to give effective presentations, how to find and apply to graduate schools, how to write a great NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Proposal, and the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion in the sciences. Many of these students have already begun graduate studies and likely will go on to have successful careers in science. All of the students are now more scientifically literate than before. They are all more comfortable speaking in front of groups, both large and small. Consequently, these students-- and citizens-- will be better advocates for the importance of scientific inquiry and education. Because the majority of the students are from groups that are under-represented in science (minorities and/or rural and/or first generation college students), their successes will increase the diversity of the scientific workforce (and eventually academia). Even students who do not enter science professions, will have learned many professional development skills. Taken together with their research experiences, these skills should help them lead more successful professional careers and have a positive effect on their communities and society.</span></p>\n<div><span class=\"md-plain md-expand\"><br /></span></div>\n<p class=\"md-end-block md-p\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/07/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;Sears</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
