 "awd_abstract_narration": "OPUS awards fund previously supported NSF scientists to re-evaluate several years of projects and synthesize them into a product to stimulate the research community. This project will synthesize the PIs' forty years of experimental studies on the evolutionary ecology of the pitcher plant mosquito, a model system for understanding climate-driven evolution of a disease vector. This work will include the first evidence that the effects of recent rapid climate change have penetrated to the level of the gene. These data explain not only ongoing changes observed in the timing of seasonal events in the surrounding world, but also help direct new research into shifting patterns of host/vector interactions of some of Earth's most debilitating diseases: malaria, dengue, yellow fever, and West Nile virus. The synthesis will focus on how the physiological capacity of mosquitos to function within a given environment determines whether or not they can transmit disease. This laboratories' work has had a major impact on research examining geographic variation and local adaptation and this synthesis ls likely to expand that influence.\r\n\tThe themes of the book will demonstrate how knowing a specific organism well is key to developing the backbone for discovery and transformational research as new challenges emerge over time.  The combined results from biogeography, seasonal timing, physiology, population biology, evolutionary genetics, and genomics will be woven into each chapter, punctuated by an on-line video describing pattern and process in both natural field and controlled laboratory environments. This project will provide a unique perspective on this approach to science that will serve as inspiration and education for graduate students and early-career researchers.",

The first paper integrates our work over several decades on the role of seasonal timing in response to climate change with genetic connection, if any, between the daily clock that controls the health and well-being of all plants and animals on Earth with the seasonal timer that controls when plants and animals grow, reproduce, migrate, and hibernate.  This work presents our ?commensal model? for resolution of this 80-year long debate in the field of biological timing, showing how the seasonal timer ?borrows? gene expression from the daily clock to use as a time reference point, enabling the seasonal timer to adapt to rapid environmental change or range expansion without disturbing the precise daily organization of physiology and behavior.\n\nIn the second paper, we join with multiple authors on the topic of seasonal time-keeping across a wide spectrum of insects.  As the annual progression of the four seasons has changed with climate, both across geographical distances and historical time scales approaching 200,000 years, so also has the seasonal timing of diverse organisms.  By contrast, the daily clock that controls physiology and behavior has remained unchanged and finely tuned to the 24-hour rhythm of the earth?s rotation. Throughout this important collaborative treatise, data from diverse species validate our ?commensal model? as a now accepted unifying construct.\n\nThe third paper appears in a book on carnivorous plants where Thomas Miller and we focus on how pitcher plants and the diverse communities that live within them have been used as model systems to ask and answer important questions in Ecology (Miller) and Evolution (ourselves).\n\n(3)  The time and resources provided by this grant enabled us to coordinate efforts across five universities in the United States and across two continents to write an integrated paper on the genetic, biochemical, and evolutionary transformation of a blood-feeding mosquito into an obligate non-biting mosquito.  The paper derives its importance from the unique, potent logic that mosquitoes that do not bite cannot transmit disease and that, in fact, if there is no bite there is no spread of disease by mosquitoes, period.  Our model mosquito, Wyeomyia smithii, is the only known extant mosquito that bites (takes a blood meal) in one part of its range, yet is an obligate non-biter throughout the rest of its range.  At the same time, all 100+ populations are fully inter-fertile, thus avoiding complications of different genetic backgrounds.  The fact that this transformation from biting to obligate non-biting has taken place in an existing species means that if ?Mother Nature? can do it, we, as a community of scientists, should be able to figure out How.  It is amazing to imagine a world without malaria, dengue, Zika, and the other serious and fatal human and livestock diseases that make mosquitoes ?the most dangerous animals on Earth.?  We have a real chance to do just that.\n\n \n\n(4)  We used time provided by this grant to contribute to the National Ecological Observatory (NEON) sampling designs and protocols for monitoring abundance, diversity, and seasonal occurrence of ticks, mosquitoes, and rodents, and the parasites of humans and livestock they transmit, and have given numerous talks and lectures on various aspects of our work.  Our perspective is based on our years of NSF-supported experience in the field with geographic variation and with mosquito populations and communities, as well as our background on the importance of seasonality, genetic variation and climate change.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William E Bradshaw"
