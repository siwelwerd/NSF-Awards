 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education on a suite of theoretical tools that will quantify electron delocalization on metal surfaces. Chemical reactions on metal and metal oxide surfaces are central to phenomena from heterogeneous catalysis to corrosion to the properties of metal nanostructures.  Quantum mechanics postulates that the electrons in a molecule, solid, or surface are not spatially restricted to one point, but delocalize in a region of space.  For example, the covalent bonds that hold molecules together involve electrons delocalizing between atoms.  Chemical reactions converting iron into rust, or simple molecules into pharmaceuticals, must break bonds and temporarily re-localize electrons to atoms.  Better understanding of delocalization in surface chemistry could have an enormous impact on developing industrial catalysts, nanomaterials, and many other systems.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, our understanding of delocalization on surfaces faces two major limitations.  First, delocalization is a fundamentally non-classical and non-intuitive phenomenon. Second, the equations modeling the interaction of electrons with each other generally cannot be solved exactly.  The standard approximations used in computer simulations of electrons on metal surfaces are particularly inaccurate for the delocalized and stretched bonds which are important in catalysis. More accurate approximations often require enormously demanding computational resources. Accordingly, better models would be a tremendous benefit.  The PI has developed new tools that quantify electronic delocalization in space. This award supports application of these tools to the fundamental and practical problems associated with electron delocalization on metal surfaces. \r\n\r\nThis project integrates teaching and undergraduate research, providing specific research projects for undergraduate researchers and specific mentoring roles for graduate students. The PI will also develop an online component for his new course \"Computational Chemistry for Experimentalists\", aimed at providing non-specialist users at his institution and around the world with a practical introduction to electronic structure theory. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports theoretical and computational research and education on a suite of theoretical tools that will quantify electron delocalization on metal surfaces. Chemical reactions on metal and metal oxide surfaces are central to phenomena from heterogeneous catalysis to corrosion to the properties of metal nanostructures. Computational models of reactions at surfaces must capture both the non-classical delocalization of electrons in chemical bonds, and the correlation-induced re-localization that occurs during bond breaking. The standard density functional theory approximations in surface science have major limitations for modeling these effects. This leads to significant errors in predicted reaction rates. \r\n\r\nThe PI's group has developed and implemented a suite of tools, based on the one-particle density matrix, which quantify delocalization in calculated wavefunctions. The team will use these tools to quantify how the presence of a catalyst surface affects the delicate interplay between delocalization and correlation-induced \"re-localization\" central to bond breaking and reaction rates. They will also use the tools in real-space models of non-dynamical correlation for computationally tractable treatments of chemistry at metal surfaces. The fundamental ingredient in such models is the extent to which an electron at a given point delocalizes past the expected length scale of a standard (generalized gradient approximation) density functional. \r\n\r\nThis project integrates teaching and undergraduate research, providing specific research projects for undergraduate researchers and specific mentoring roles for graduate students.

Computational chemists have developed sophisticated methods to simulate electrons' behavior. However, using the results of such simulations to visualize and quantify delocalization (and related orbital overlap effects) remains challenging. Moreover, existing simulation methods can be inaccurate for modeling stretched and broken chemical bonds, a particular problem at the surfaces of metal catalysts. We have provided the community with a set of new tools quantifying delocalization and orbital overlap in computed wave functions. These tools measure the extent to which electrons at any point <strong>r</strong> delocalize over distance d, by projecting a computed wavefunction onto a test function of width d (Figure 1). This approach provides both a chemically intuitive interpretation of existing simulations, and new \"ingredients\" for more accurate simulations.</p>\n<p>One part of our work focused on interpreting existing electronic structure simulations. We showed that our orbital overlap tools quantify the \"size\" of electrons trapped in solvent cavities and material defects (Figure 2). This work connected to another quantum-mechanical phenomenon, long-range entanglement of electron pairs for quantum computing. Our delocalization tools, combined with standard simulations (broken-symmetry time-dependent density functional theory), effectively reproduce and interpret experiments on entangled color center defects in crystals [1]. Our orbital overlap tools visualize how a metal catalyst affects delocalization in a breaking chemical bond, and provides a new way to identify reactive sites on a catalyst surface [2] (Figure 3). Our most recent work extends this approach to biomolecules, providing an experimentally testable hypothesis for improving the activity of a proposed cancer therapeutic [3].</p>\n<p>The second part of our work focused on improved protocols for electronic structure simulations. &nbsp;Our work on entangled defects and stretched bonds showed that our tools are sensitive to electron sharing among multiple sites. This \"sharing\" is critically important for chemical bonds breaking and forming at metal catalyst surfaces. Standard electronic structure simulation methods can struggle to model electron sharing: widely used density functional theory (DFT) methods have a \"zero-sum\" tradeoff for radicals vs. covalent bonds (Figure 4 black crosses), while more accurate methods can be very computationally expensive. Our new tools can \"notify\" a DFT method of regions where electrons are shared, enabling improved broad accuracy [4] (Figure 4 blue points). We have added these tools to the widely-used Gaussian electronic structure package. Our latest work directly connects these new tools to existing \"local hybrid\" DFT (Figure 4 red points), providing a rigorous and computationally efficient upper bound to their critical ingredient, the exact exchange energy density [5].</p>\n<p>The final part of our work increases the broad impact of electronic structure simulation. We provided the community with a new implementation of our orbital overlap tools in the free, open-source Multiwfn software package. I prepared a free online course \"Computational Chemistry for Experimentalists\". This series of \"computational lab\" experiments is designed to provide researchers with a straightforward and practical introduction to computational chemistry tools (Figure 5). The course is split into twelve computational experiments, each introducing a new simulation methodology: molecular geometry optimization, transition state finding, vibrational and NMR spectra, and so on.
