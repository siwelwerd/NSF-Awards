 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to obtain the first unambiguous quantification of the temperature-dependent cross section for charge exchange between neutral and ionized atomic oxygen which mediates momentum and energy exchange between the terrestrial ionosphere and thermosphere (IT system). Historical uncertainty in these parameters has limited the quantitative accuracy of numerous aeronomical calculations, such as ionospheric temperatures and density distributions, diffusion coefficients, and plasma drift speeds, effectively precluding reliable prediction of both steady-state and dynamic behavior of the coupled IT system. The research program will involve hardware development and deployment, inverse and tomographic analysis development, physics-based model development, and scientific data analysis and interpretation. \r\n\tThe methodology to obtain the crucial quantification of these parameters will utilize a nested configuration of passive optical and incoherent scatter radar (ISR) instrumentation at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico, including a novel photometric imaging system (Photometer Array for Tomographic Hydrogen Sensing; PATHS) that will be designed and built by undergraduate students at the University of Illinois through a capstone project course. The resulting data, together with the development of realistic radiative transport models of optical emissions and advances in the estimation of light ion velocity from ISR spectra, will enable the height- and time-dependent quantification of neutral, ion, and electron temperatures; distinct proton and oxygen ion velocities; neutral meridional wind speed; ionized oxygen, hydrogen, and helium density; and, for the first time, the neutral oxygen and hydrogen density distributions throughout the upper thermosphere. Quantification of the charge exchange coupling between the ionosphere and thermosphere (via parametric momentum balance) as well as between the exosphere and plasmasphere (via parametric continuity balance) will enable advances in understanding how mass, energy and momentum are transported throughout the coupled regions. The project will involve graduate and undergraduate students, and include outreach activities targeting pre-college girls in order to promote the future gender diversity in this discipline.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project supported major advances in our understanding of the chemical and dynamical coupling between the neutral thermosphere and exosphere, the ionosphere embedded within it, and the plasmasphere beyond. Specifically, this project provided crucial empirical quantification of the role of ion-neutral coupling processes  such as ionization, recombination, and charge exchange  in the production, loss, and transport of atmospheric constituents, both between geomagnetically conjugate hemispheres as well as across the open boundaries of the IT system. \n\n\nAnalysis of the charge exchange cross section between neutral atomic oxygen (O) and oxygen ions (O+) based on combined optical and radar observations of ionospheric momentum balance not only served to establish a more reliable community standard for this key physical parameter but also revealed signfiicant systematic bias in O density specification by the widely-adopted semi-empirical NRLMSISE-00 model of the neutral atmosphere. Analysis of optical O emission data further revealed that radiative recombination of O+ ions is a significant source of O emission excitation and can be used in conjunction with radar measurements of ionospheric O+ density to constrain another key physical parameter: the O+ radiative recombination coefficient. \n\n\nCharge exchange between neutral H atoms and O+ and H+ ions was found to significantly enhance the rate of gravitational escape of H over classic theoretical expectations of thermal evaporation, particularly during solar minimum conditions. This more accurate estimate of H escape flux and its energetic partitioning among thermal and non-thermal (charge exchange driven) pathways advances understanding of both atmospheric evolution as well as exospheric density distributions and their climatological variability. The autonomous optical sensor network, known as PATHS (Photometric Array for Tomographic Hydrogen Sensing), that was developed under this award is ideal for providing crucial ground-based constraints on exospheric structure and dynamics, particularly when operated in conjunction with space-based H emission sensing.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/01/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: LaraSWaldrop\n"
