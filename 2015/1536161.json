 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central mid-Atlantic region of the eastern North America margin is the focus of ongoing studies of rift processes. The region presents the opportunity to understand the role of pre-existing lithospheric weakness in guiding past continental rifting. The tectonic plate at this currently 'passive' margin thins through the transition from continental to oceanic crust, yet details of the topography on the base of the plate, as well as the properties of the underlying ductile mantle are not known. This information can provide clues about how Earth's tectonic plates evolve over time and why continents break up in the pattern that they do.\r\n\r\nDetermination of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) remains controversial, despite this boundary being one of the most fundamental aspects of the plate tectonics paradigm. In addition to limited knowledge about the topography on the base of the lithosphere, constraints on the properties of the uppermost asthenosphere immediately beneath the plate, are poor.  Various interpretations have been presented to explain seismic observations across the margin, including a remnant thermal perturbation from a mantle plume, a hydrous upper mantle and the presence of partial melt. However, the thermal perturbation model is not consistent with a dramatically thinned lithosphere. This study will use magnetotelluric data to bring new constraints to the problem. Processing of data from 14 seafloor instruments deployed across the continental shelf offshore Martha's Vineyard, MA, and 2 stations  on land will be accomplished. A 2-D resistivity model of the upper-mantle structure will be obtained and interpreted in terms of lithospheric alteration resulting from the influence of the Great Meteor hotspot. The depth to the LAB, the nature of the deeper continental lithosphere and whether melt is present at the top of the asthenosphere will be investigated.",

Of particular interest is the transition in thickness of the lithosphere, the outermost rigid tectonic plate, as the region transitions from the continental US to the ocean.
