 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Cynthia J. Burrows at the University of Utah to investigate the redox photochemistry of oxidized bases in DNA and RNA.  Most chemical reactions inside the cell are catalyzed by proteins (enzymes), yet the naturally occurring amino acids are not very redox-active.  To conduct reduction or oxidation reactions, enzymes rely on co-enzymes such as vitamins B2 (riboflavin), B3 (nicotinamide) or B12 (cobalamin).  Interestingly, these co-enzymes are all derivatives of RNA, usually dinucleotides comprising adenosine plus a redox-active heterocycle.   The project being supported will examine the hypothesis that simple oxidized derivatives of naturally occurring DNA or RNA bases can perform as redox cofactors to catalyze electron-transfer reactions.  These modified bases will be components of minimal ribozyme or DNAzyme structures, and reactions will be initiated with light.  Experiments conducted in the Burrows laboratory will be complemented by ultrafast spectroscopic measurements and computational work performed in collaboration.  Graduate, undergraduate and high school  students trained on the project will therefore be engaged in research at the interface of modern bioorganic and biophysical chemistry while testing hypotheses about potential ways in which life emerged from simple biopolymers on Early Earth or other planets.\r\n\r\nIn this project, researchers will use organic synthesis and oligonucleotide assembly to study catalytic redox reactions mediated by flavins and flavin-like heterocycles including 8-oxoguanine.  Minimal oligomers that can self-assemble into G-quadruplexes containing binding sites for nucleotide cofactors will be designed and synthesized.  Biophysical measurements (NMR, CD, UV) will determine folded structures and stabilities,  and will be complemented by single-molecule investigations of G-quadruplexes in nanopore cavities to provide kinetic stability and population studies.  The photophysics of electron-transfer reactions within these purine-rich complexes will help in understanding why the present-day heterocyclic bases were chosen for DNA and RNA, while others have been fine-tuned as redox ribonucleotide cofactors.  The work will provide insights into how a systems chemistry approach to chemical evolution might help explain the emergence of early life.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDNA and RNA are long biopolymers that store and transfer genetic information in the cell via the linear sequence of their monomer base components A, C, G, and T (or U in RNA).  Depending on the sequence, these polymers can fold in specific ways to make higher order structures that include hairpins, double-helical, triple-helical and even quadruplex structures.  The goal of this project was to investigate minimal lengths of certain sequences to determine special folding and/or catalytic properties that emerge from the non-Watson-Crick folds. \n\nOf particular interest are G-rich sequences because of their ability to fold into G-quadruplexes, globular structures mimicking minimalist protein structures.  We found that analogs of the base guanine (G) including an oxidized version (OG) as well as riboflavin, a related structure that is also known as vitamin B-2, could dock with the G-quadruplex structure.  A binding event such as this serves as a model for enzyme-substrate binding wherein complementary hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions help to recognize the small molecule substrate. \n\nThe OG and riboflavin components of the complex are active in oxidation/reduction reactions including photoredox chemistry initiated by light.  In this sense, we investigated the minimalist forms of DNA or RNA that could participate in redox catalysis, giving insight as to how biocatalysis may have evolved in the so-called \"RNA World\" of prebiotic chemistry.  Collaborators on this project included (1) physical chemists who examined the interaction of fast (femtosecond) laser light with the DNA assemblies, and (2) theoretical chemists who calculated reaction trajectories and spectroscopic features of guanine in DNA.  The laboratory research was conducted by graduate students who obtained critical thinking skills and results important to their MS and PhD dissertations.\n\nComplementary to this investigation were studies of C-rich DNA oligomers in which cytosine-cytosine base pairs are formed, interdigitated, in a 4-stranded quadruplex.  We found that certain lengths of oligomers, namely those of 4n-1 length, where n = 4, 5, 6, or 7, were the most stable at neutral pH and room temperature.  Curiously, we also found that these poly-C sequences were statistically overrepresented in the human genome, allowing us to postulate a role for these motifs in cellular function. This study engaged 8 different high school and undergraduate students who gained valuable laboratory experience working with DNA, various spectroscopic instruments, and data analysis.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/02/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cynthia J Burrows"
