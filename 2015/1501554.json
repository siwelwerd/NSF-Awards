 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will examine how the House Finch has evolved resistance and tolerance to a novel pathogen. Novel pathogens are a challenge faced by many species, and understanding how species might respond is integral for informing conservation efforts to protect global biodiversity. Human-mediated introductions of pathogens into new environments are common today given the ease of global travel. In 1994, a species of bacteria, Mycoplamsa gallisepticum, historically associated with poultry, infected the House Finch and killed an estimated 225 million individuals (60% of the eastern population). This pathogen is the cause of one of the most significant diseases of the poultry industry, so any genes identified as targets of evolution in this House Finchmay also be applicable to improving resistance and tolerance in poultry.\r\n\r\nThe project will use whole genome resequencing and genotyping of immune genes such as MHC and TLRs to disentangle the genetic underpinnings of two important immunological responses, resistance and tolerance. Data collected from wild populations around the U.S. in multiple time periods before and after exposure to the pathogen will show how the House Finch has evolved. The researchers will test whether MHC and TLR intra-individual allelic diversity has increased in response to strong selection, or if specific alleles confer resistance or susceptibility to the pathogen by increasing or decreasing in frequency over time. Genotyping of experimentally infected individuals from a historically unexposed population will test whether putatively selected alleles are associated with disease phenotypes such as pathogen load or conjunctival swelling.",
