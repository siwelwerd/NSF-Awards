 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deep convection that penetrates (overshoots) the tropopause affects the trace gas composition of the extratropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, which is important for global atmospheric chemistry and the Earth's radiation balance. This study will combine more than 10 year data of ground-based radar observations with numerical model simulations to study the physical and chemical characteristics of overshooting convection.  Data from approximately 100 NEXRAD radars will be composited onto a three-dimensional regional grid with high spatial and temporal resolution.  Climatology of the physical characteristics of overshooting convection, such as vertical extent, geographic distribution, interannual variability, and annual and diurnal cycles will be computed from the radar observations.  Overshooting convection characteristics derived from the composited radar data will be compared with estimates based on satellite IR observations.  To investigate the mechanisms responsible for cross-tropopause transport and to make quantitative estimates of stratosphere-troposphere exchange, numerical model simulations with explicitly resolved convection and chemistry will be carried out for case studies and for an entire warm season.  The radar data will be used along with in situ trace gas observations from aircraft to evaluate the performance of the numerical simulations.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nIt is well known that convection in the extratropics can penetrate the tropopause and extend into the lower stratosphere, but there is little quantitative information about its geographic distribution, frequency of occurrence, or depth of penetration into the stratosphere.  The radar analyses in this study will lead to a new regional climatology of overshooting convection in the midlatitudes based on direct geometric observations at high spatial and temporal resolution.  The results will be compared with satellite IR estimates of overshooting, which offer the potential to extend the regional results to a global domain. High-resolution numerical simulations of overshooting convection will be used to investigate stratosphere-troposphere exchange mechanisms and to make quantitative estimates of the transport of important trace species.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nThis research will produce a long-term, public, dataset of radar reflectivity over a large portion of the contiguous U.S.  These data will be applicable to a wide range of other hydrometeorological problems.  Since convection is not resolved in current global climate models, these studies will provide guidance for developing parameterizations of stratosphere-troposphere exchange due to overshooting convection.  A better understanding of overshooting convection will help to reduce uncertainties in future climate projections, which is an important economic and social problem.  In addition, diagnosing convective behavior and its impact on atmospheric chemistry will lead to an improved understanding of processes affecting air quality and human health, as both increases in tropospheric ozone and depletion of stratospheric ozone are possible in overshooting storms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMost summertime convective storms over the U.S. are confined to the lower layer of the atmosphere, which is called the troposphere.  This project used observations by the U.S. national weather radar network (NEXRAD) to detect particularly intense storms that reach into the stratosphere.  These are referred to as overshooting storms because they 'overshoot' the top of the troposphere into the stratosphere.  Some of these storms extend 5 km (3 miles) or higher into the stratosphere.  Normally the stratosphere is extremely dry and has high amounts of ozone, which protects the Earth from harmful effects of ultraviolet light from the sun.  Overshooting storms are of interest because they carry water and other substances that can potentially affect ozone in the stratosphere.  As the Earth's climate warms from the effects of manmade greenhouse gases, the frequency and vertical extent of overshooting storms may change, leading to changes in the protective ozone layer.\n\nThrough this research we learned that overshooting storms are much more common than previously thought.  Approximately 50,000 individual overshooting storms happen each year in the U.S.  Like storms in general, most overshooting storms happen in the afternoon and evening hours.  Overshooting storms are most common in the high plains states stretching from Texas to the Dakotas (see map).  They are uncommon over the Rocky Mountains and in the northeast U.S.  Overshooting storms are infrequent during the colder months of the year (October through February). \n\nBased on high-resolution computer models of overshooting storms, we confirmed the processes responsible for a number of storm features, including cirrus clouds in the lower stratosphere and ozone carried downward into the troposphere at the edges of large storms.  Overshooting storms that produce stratospheric cirrus clouds add more water to the lower stratosphere than storms without cirrus clouds.  Model simulations also show that transport by overshooting storms over the U.S. can double the amount of water in the lower stratosphere, decrease ozone in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, and increase pollutants, primarily in the upper troposphere.  Increased water vapor is seen at higher altitudes in the stratosphere than other gases carried from the troposphere by overshooting storms.\n\nThe radar data set produced as part of this project is publicly available at no charge from the Research Data Archive at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (https://rda.ucar.edu/datasets/ds841.0/).  It has already enabled novel research at other institutions on a number of scientific problems.  Additional information can be found at https://gridrad.org.\n\nThis research is a step toward understanding how stratospheric water vapor and Earth's ozone layer will change in the future as the climate warms.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/10/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cameron R Homeyer"
