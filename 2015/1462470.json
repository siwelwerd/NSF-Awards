 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides partial funding for the AWM Research Symposium 2015, organized by the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM), to be held April 11-12, 2015, at the University of Maryland in College Park, MD.  The Symposium is aimed at helping to increase participation of women in the mathematical sciences in academia, government, and industry.  It is part of a series of interconnected conferences and workshops designed to create ongoing networks, encourage research collaborations, and build a stronger sense of community among women in the mathematical sciences.   The conference is expected to draw about 200 participants from all over the country, including many women in the early stages of their career.  While the speakers and funded participants will all be women, the conference will be open to the whole mathematical community, both men and women.  Located in the greater Washington area, the Symposium will also provide a unique opportunity for local businesses and government agencies to reach out to a talented pool of graduate students and recent PhD recipients.\r\n\r\nThe 2015 Symposium will feature four plenary lectures by distinguished women mathematicians, thirteen special sessions on a broad spectrum of mathematical topics, poster sessions for graduate students and recent PhDs, and a networking event.  The plenary speakers are leaders in the fields of symplectic geometry, harmonic analysis, graph theory, and wavelets.  Accompanying the plenary talks are special sessions in related areas.  Nine other special sessions will cover a wide range of topics including algebraic geometry, number theory, topology and geometry, probability theory, and mathematics education.  One session will feature work by under-represented minorities from the EDGE program.  Events of this kind are essential for building community among women in the field, decreasing the sense of isolation, and establishing new research and mentoring relations.  In addition, connections made at these events lead to future speaking invitations, increased participation at other research conferences, and hence better integration into the broader mathematics community.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project involved two major events organized by the Association for Women in Mathematics (AWM).  The first was the AWM Research Symposium 2015, held at the University of Maryland, MD in April 2015.  The Symposium included 4 plenary talks by distinguished women mathematicians, 14 special sessions on a wide range of topics in the mathematical sciences, 2 graduate student poster sessions, a networking  reception focuses around a jobs panel with representatives from industry and government and a banquet with a keynote address.  The Symposium attracted 330 registered participants, including both women and men.\n\nThe second event was a poster session for graduate students run as part of the AWM Workshop held at the Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM) in Seattle, in January 2016.  The workshop featured talks on Algebraic Combinatorics by early-career and senior women and a separate poster session for 20 graduate students presenting their research on a wide range of topics.  Also held in conjunction with the workshop, there was a networking and mentoring luncheon, where best poster awards were presented to two graduate students.  While the presenters in the poster session were all women, selected on the basis of their research contributions, the event was open to all registered participants of the JMM, the largest annual mathematics meeting in the world. \n\nIntellectual Merit:  The special sessions provided an opportunity for women to share their research and discuss new developments with others in their in a field.  In addition to the networking opportunity provided by the special sessions, the plenary talks showcased established women mathematicians, providing strong role models to early-career women and visual reminders to the larger community of the important contributions of women to mathematics today.  The jobs panel discussion and the banquet provide additional opportunities for networking and mentoring. \n\nThe graduate student poster sessions at the Symposium and the Workshop featured new research on a wide range of topics by young researchers.   It provided opportunities for the graduate students to share their research with the broader mathematical community. \n\nBroader Impact:  These events were designed to address the persistent lack of adequate representation of women in the mathematical sciences through mentoring, career advice, and network building.\n\nThe Research Symposium and the poster session at the workshop proved to be invaluable for building community among female mathematicians, showcasing women\u00c6s work in mathematics, and attracting attention, support, and sponsorship for the organization and its mission.
