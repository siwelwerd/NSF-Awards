 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, the University of Oregon will acquire an epifluorescence microscope.  The instrument consists of a light source and a microscope.  The microscope detects the light that is emitted (fluoresced) from a sample after irradiation by the light source.  The instrument will enable experiments focused on imaging of live cells. It will be used by undergraduate and graduate students in their research. This training will assist them in future careers as live cell imaging is widely used in the biotechnology industry.  The acquisition will be incorporated in community outreach activities including K-12 programs.  \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) creating imaging tools for hydrogen sulfide detection and delivery; (b) making molecular probes for small molecule/ion recognition; (c) preparing Pt(II) reagents for RNA biochemistry; and (d) using carbon quantum dots to engineer nanostructures for biomedical imaging.",
