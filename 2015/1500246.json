 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation (TT) project addresses the high failure rate of K12 students to learn mathematics.   This project focuses on technology translation of an intelligent online tutor, named MathSpring, which is important because it provides adaptive and personalized responses to students and teaches by matching the learning needs of individual students with effective teaching approaches. It applies theoretical understanding of cognitive, metacognitive and affective student characteristics to each tutor response. The MathSpring Tutor is also important because no online tutor today responds by analyzing both student knowledge and behavior. This PFI:AIR-TT project will result in a scale-up of the MathSpring Tutor and provide advantages in the marketplace by capitalizing on the general appeal of animation and humanoid characters that talk to students about the importance of perseverance and effort. The project will also provide low-cost, quality solutions for a wide range of students, adaptive tutoring based on student models, just-in-time verbal and animated interactions designed to move students away from boredom or disengagement, and the capability to select from among potentially 700 problems in the system. \r\n\r\nThese features of the MathSpring tutor provide improved performance, efficiency and efficacy when compared to classroom teaching or to the leading competing technology, primarily drill and practice problems, videos of lectures or games in this market space.  The potential economic impact of translating this technology to the market place will positively contribute to the growth rate of eLearning within the next 5 years and to the U.S. competitiveness in the eLearning domain. Since the annual U.S. education expenditure for K-12 is approximately $625 billion, a large potential exists for making both a commercial and social impact in this space.  Potential outcomes include: personalized tutors that guide students into their own zone or state of ?flow?; identification of target educational markets; and reaching any student with access to a computer and an Internet connection.\r\n\r\nThis PFI project addresses the following technology gaps as the software is translated from research discovery toward commercial application: identification of tutor responses that are effective for students in distress (e.g., bored, unmotivated); building sufficient content so the tutor can be used through an entire semester in Grades 5-9; and providing tools that enable teachers to select math problem based on the Common Core curriculum. The project work also includes hardening the tutor, porting it to two platforms (e.g., Android, IOS) and identifying consortia of schools (e.g., linked by geography, or pedagogy) for long-term partnerships. \r\n\r\nPersonnel involved in this project, e.g., graduate students and programmers, will receive innovation and technology translation experiences through efforts to identify paths through the idiosyncratic school procurement process and the communication of the efficacy studies arising from credible evaluation of MathSpring. The project engages CarneyLabs to guide commercial aspects of the translation and Virginia Advanced Studies Strategies (VASS), a non-profit company that works with the Virginia Department of Education (DoED), to provide a test environment in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.",

This PFI: AIR TT project focused on technology transfer of NSF sponsored online instructional systems into the market place and ultimately into daily use in US schools. We focused on scaling-up MathSpring, an NSF sponsored intelligent tutor that recognizes a student&rsquo;s cognitive, social and affective levels. We also enhanced the MARi personal platform, that is used with several school districts in Virginia to explore the market space, the market need, the competitive technologies and the potential impact of the proposed technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;The combined tutor+personal-platform MathSpring+MARi, has several unique features; the system personalizes math problems from among potentially 700 problems based on students&rsquo; prior knowledge and emotional state. Digital learning companions talk to students about their effort and motivation, communicate about the malleability of intelligence and support students to reason about their own learning. The system is adaptive to each student&rsquo;s learning needs and provides just-in-time verbal and animated interactions.</p>\n<p>To prepare for commercial use of the tutor+personal-platform, we developed 200 new math problems to cover the curriculum for grades 5-8. Every math problem is aligned to a Common Core (CC) standard and every CC standard for grades, 5-8 is included in the tutor, see supporting spreadsheet. Teachers select math problems for students based on grade, or CC standard to be taught.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The tutor+personal-platform provides continuous monitoring of and interactions with students working with the tutor; it identifies tutor comments that are effective for students in distress (e.g., unengaged, unmotivated).

VASS (Virginia Advanced Study Strategies, Inc, a 501c(3) nonprofit organization has combined with six eligible rural Local Education Agencies (LEA) in Virginia to form the Rural Math Excel Partnership).</p>\n<p>MARi is a personal learning platform that brokers personal attributes for an individual&rsquo;s benefit. After interviewing 38 individuals currently working in high demand jobs, such as electrician, automotive technician, occupational therapy assistant, forestry technician, EMT, firefighter, etc., the math development team created a resource guide for teachers who teach the foundational math course for each career, including Algebra I, Algebra II, Geometry, and Algebra, Functions, Statistics, Probability and Data Analysis. &nbsp;This platform learns the individual&rsquo;s academic and career skills and identifies a personalized path to achieve desired destinations.&nbsp; Based on 10 years of R&amp;D &ndash; backed by a team of data scientists, educators and entrepreneurs, the platform is intended to create actionable teaching. VASS, in partnership with six rural Southside school divisions, local businesses, and parents worked to improve middle and high school students&rsquo; math skills and better prepare students to pursue critically needed STEM jobs at the technician level or higher. VASS has collaborated with one lead math teacher from each school division to develop instructional materials and training activities pertaining to the ways math is used in technician-level occupations. We expect that the potential economic impact of translating this technology into the market place will contribute to the growth rate in eLearning within the next 5 years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Researchers at UMass and MARi, LLC discussed the necessary issues to bring education technology to market: intellectual property protection, licensing opportunities and freedom to operate issues. Within a very crowded online mathematic technology market, our mathematics tutor is unique because it selects math content by analyzing student knowledge and emotion.
