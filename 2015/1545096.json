 "awd_abstract_narration": "Infrastructure networks are the foundation of the modern world. Their continued reliable and efficient function without exhausting finite natural resources is critical to the security, continued growth and technological advancement of the United States. Currently these systems are in a state of rapid flux due to a collision of trends such as growing populations, expanding integration of information technology, and increasing motivation to adopt sustainable practices. These trends beget both exciting potential benefits and dangerous challenges. Added sensing, communication, and computational capabilities hold the promise of increased reliability, efficiency and sustainability from \"smart\" infrastructure systems. At the same time, new technologies such as renewable energy resources in power systems, autonomous vehicles, and software defined communication networks, are testing the limits of current operational and market policies. The rapidly changing suite of system components can cause new, unforeseen interactions that can lead to instability, performance deterioration, or catastrophic failures. Achieving the full benefits of these systems will require a shift from the existing focus on approaches that analyze each aspect of interest in isolation, to a more holistic view that encompasses all of the relevant factors such as stability, robustness, performance and efficiency, and takes into account the presence of human participants. \r\n\r\nThis project provides a research roadmap to construct analysis, design and control tools that ensure the seamless integration of computational algorithms, physical components and human interactions in next generation infrastructure systems. Although there has been a great deal of research on stability questions in large scale distributed systems, there has been little effort directed toward questions of performance, robustness and efficiency in these systems, especially those with heterogeneous components and human participants. This research employs coupled oscillator systems as a common modeling framework to (i) characterize stability and performance of infrastructure systems, and (ii) develop distributed controllers that guarantee performance, efficiency and robustness by isolating disturbances and optimizing performance objectives. Practical solutions require that the theory be tightly integrated with the economic mechanisms necessary to incentivize users to enhance system stability, efficiency and reliability; therefore the work will also include the design of economic controls. In order to ground the mathematical foundations, theory and algorithms described above, the results will be applied to three target infrastructure networks where coupled oscillator models have played a foundational role in design and control: power, communication, and transportation systems. This approach allows the development of cross-cutting, fundamental principles that can be applied across problem specific boundaries and ensures that the research makes an impact on these specific infrastructure networks. This project will also incorporate concepts into existing undergraduate and graduate courses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research program pursued in this grant developed new theoretical tools for characterizing how to maintain a stable or desireable state in a networked system in the presence of disturbances, focusing not just on stability but also efficiency and performance.  The tools developed are interdiscplinary, spanning control, optimization, and economics; and can be used to provide a rigorous design for layered architectures in infrastricture networks that integrate economic and engineered control. The tools represent significant contributions to the area of control and optimization.  They allow characterization of the relationship between performance, communication, and network topology for the purpose of performance-aware intrastructure control.\n\nThe theoreitical results not only represent contributions to control and optimization, they also have been applied in real systems during the lifetime of the grant.  In particular, the theoretical tools developed were demonstrated in the context of three target infrastructure systems, including power systems, transportation systems, and communication networks.  The project was collaborative and Caltech led the deployment of the ideas in the power system domain, making significant contributions to the integration of markets and control for generation planning and localized control to mitigate the impact of failures -- reducing the size and likelihood of cascading failures.  \n\nThe research pursued has the potential for broad impact through the deployment of smarter infrastructure control.  For example, cascading failures of power systems create enormous social and economic damage and the work in this grant provides new approaches for localization and mitigation of the impact of such cascades, with the potential for order-of-magnitude reduction in the number and size of failure events.  \n\nBeyond the broad impact of the research itself, as part of the grant the PIs have pursued a number of initiatives focused on broadening participation in STEM by underrepresented groupls.  These have included rediesigns of UG curriculurm, the creation of new programs for UG research at Caltech, and the development of accelerated education programs for underrepresented middle school students interested in STEM. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/24/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adam C Wierman"
