 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award uses funds, under the auspices of the EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) program, for a project aimed at making paleoclimate data more accessible to the wider science community and the interested public.\r\n\r\nThe project will help the NSF coordinate and cooperate with the NOAA World Data Center for Paleoclimatology (WDC-Paleo) in Boulder Colorado in an effort to create standards for describing variables in paleoclimate datasets and to use these standards to normalize variables in the WDC-Paleo archive.  Such variables include depth, age, and proxy measurements used to infer past climate. \r\n\r\nTo accomplish these goals, the researcher will draw upon the expertise of data generators and data scientists and will generate the first set of extensible controlled vocabularies that are consistent across multiple proxy types and that have the level of detail necessary to support data intensive science.  \r\n\r\nThe planned activities fit well into the potentially transformative, high risk, and exploratory nature of the EAGER programs because it is an untested path forward for the paleoclimatology community.  Past related efforts were limited to sub-disciplines within paleoclimatology and, more importantly, not focused on creating vocabularies that are complete enough and precise enough to facilitate the sorts of data compilations that are now beginning to drive the field of paleoclimatology forward.  This project is also inherently interdisciplinary, as it relies heavily on input from both the paleoclimate and the informatics communities.  \r\n\r\nIf successful, this project will have a large impact on the field of paleoclimatology by facilitating data-intensive analyses using large numbers of proxy datasets in new and transformative ways within the discipline and through collaboration with other disciplines. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, such an activity aids the NSF in complying with its federal requirements to aid access of scientific data from publicly-funded research by the wider science community and the interested public.",
