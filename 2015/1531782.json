 "awd_abstract_narration": "The acquisition of the iDXA instrument will enable researchers to examine basic behavioral factors which have the potential to effect  health behavior change (dietary habits, physical activity, and sedentary behavior) and thereby, improve key physiological markers (body composition and bone density) related to chronic disease. The iDXA uses x-ray technology to differentiate between tissues in the body which provides measures of bone density (total, neck of femur, lumbar spine), site-specific body fat and lean muscle mass, and type of body fat (subcutaneous or visceral). Researchers will use the iDXA for  trials of novel dietary pattern treatments (e.g. those high in protein from plant sources) to support bone health, increase lean mass, and reduce site-specific adiposity. Projects will also include controlled trials to examine innovative strategies (e.g. using commercially-available activity monitors and standing desks) to increase physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior and examine the impact of these interventions on visceral body fat and lean muscle mass. Furthermore, worksite wellness programs targeting underserved, local small businesses will also include the use of the iDXA to measure physiological changes and to encourage behavior change. Researchers will also examine the impact of strength training on lean muscle mass and balance among individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy. In sum, access to the iDXA will allow a highly trained team of researchers to effectively address critically important outcomes with research into health behavior.\r\n\r\nThe investigators' institution is nationally recognized for leadership in Undergraduate Research, hosting the first National Conference on Undergraduate Research (NCUR) and set to host the 30th Anniversary NCUR conference in 2016.  At least seven undergraduate researchers will be trained yearly on use of the iDXA for collaborative research, and findings will be disseminated internationally through publication in scientific journals and to North Carolina communities through reports from the NC Center for Health and Wellness and the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute.",
