 "awd_abstract_narration": "An understanding of species-habitat relationship is fundamental for adopting a balanced approach for managing and conserving natural resources.  This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate surface water resources and habitat changes over the past two decades to understand habitat resource availability for migratory shore birds.  The project will assess broad and fine-scale habitat availability and will analyze differences between habitat types across wet and dry years.  The research will contribute to a better understanding of natural wetlands and agriculture lands as potential habitats and the challenges of managing these water-rich resources under stressed conditions.  It will provide new information regarding how spatio-temporal dynamics influence habitat quality and how public and private lands can be optimally managed to serve socio-economic and environmental needs.  The doctoral student will work closely with several local organizations and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) with the findings likely to guide policy makers in selecting and protecting fragile environments.  Because shorebirds are among the most migratory species on a global level, the research will inform habitat management and conservation managers on a broad scale.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\nChanges in habitat availability preferred by shorebirds are not well understood, particularly for inland wetlands and flood-irrigated agricultural areas.  Because large portions of the habitat exist on agricultural lands, the synchronization of rice-field inundations with shorebird migration plays an important role in providing habitat benefits to the birds.  This project will address two core questions: (1) What are the external drivers impacting long-term shorebird habitat availability? (2) How do these changes in habitat availability vary across spatial scales?  The project will use multi-temporal satellite imagery, survey data, and in situ information for the Sacramento River Valley in California to quantify habitat availability in the area.  The analyses will provide an assessment of the response of migratory shorebirds to changes in habitat availability, water depth and land use.  As a key component, the comparative differences across wet and dry years will help improve monitoring and management of shorebirds and their wetland habitats.",
