 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is investigating the potential for agricultural emissions of nitrogen and sulfur gases from sources such as dairy farms, piggeries, and other animal production sources to lead to the formation of very small particles in the atmosphere.  Previous studies have shown that gas phase compounds related to waste management practices from animal agriculture could influence the formation of atmospheric particles.  This project includes laboratory, field and modeling studies to investigate the environmental fate of nitrogen and sulfur compounds from these sources. \r\n\r\nAn environmental chamber will be used to quantify secondary aerosol formation potentials at different relative humidities and temperatures for select amines (diethylamine (DEA), trimethylamine (TMA), butylamine (BA), a diamine, or NH3) oxidized in the presence of an organosulfur compound (methanethiol, dimethylsulfide (DMS), or dimethyldisulfide (DMDS)) or hydrogen sulfide.  The investigators will perform field sampling of particulate matter and precursors at agricultural operations in Kentucky at the USDA-Agricultural Research Station (ARS) laboratory to determine the impact of elevated amine and sulfur concentrations on atmospheric chemistry.\r\n\r\nKinetic modeling calculations will help clarify the sequence of chemical reactions responsible for the data seen in laboratory experiments.  This will, in turn, help explain emission rates observed in field observations.  The investigators expect to elucidate the atmospheric oxidation routes for reduced sulfur compounds and amines.  Empirical estimates of the aerosol formation potential of key agricultural emissions will be developed for use in predicting local and regional air quality impacts and emissions inventories of the reduced nitrogen and sulfur species will be developed as an additional input to air quality models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCollaborative Research: Aerosol Formation From Agricultural Volatile Organic Compounds\n\nThe chemical formation of particulate matter air pollution (also known as aerosols) is important to study for health and environmental reasons.  Breathing in aerosols can cause an increase in respiratory illnesses, depending on the size, chemical composition, and concentration of the particles in the air.  Aerosols of different chemical species can either absorb or reflect radiation as well, which has a direct impact on Earth?s energy balance and climate.  Particles in the atmosphere can lead to reduced visibility in the atmosphere and often act as nuclei for water condensation to form clouds. \n\nOur research focused on how two types of gases?compounds containing nitrogen (alkylamines) and compounds containing sulfur (sulfides) can react to form particulate matter.  Amines are similar to ammonia but with organic groups attached to it in place of hydrogen atoms while sulfides are similar to hydrogen sulfide but with organic groups attached.  Both these classes of compounds can be emitted from animal feeding operations, but not much is known about how these gas phase emissions react near the source to produce particulate matter.  We do know from previous work that amine gases can be either oxidized to form less volatile amines that can deposit on particles or they can react with an acid to form a salt.
