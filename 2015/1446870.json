 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop a geographic synthesis of snow, streamflow, and soil moisture data across the western U.S. and the analyses will provide key information that can be used to identify areas most vulnerable to large hydrologic changes due to smaller snowpack accumulation.   Datasets produced will be publicly available and this information can be incorporated into land and aquatic resource management, particularly in locations that lack hydrologic data. The project will train a PhD student and undergraduate research assistants, develop an interactive digital display for education outreach and student recruitment, and develop a hydrology class activity using soil moisture simulations. \r\n\t\r\nLoss of persistent winter snowpack impacts water resources in mountain and high latitude regions throughout the world, and the need to understand water resource vulnerability to snow loss is pressing. The central hypothesis guiding this research is that loss of a persistent snowpack triggers changes in both stream flow and soil moisture, but the magnitude of this change is greater in more arid climates. This project will document the geographic distribution of intermittent-persistent snow transitions in the western U.S. and examine how streamflow and soil moisture are affected by these transitions. Snow transitions will be mapped using both MODIS snow cover imagery and snow water equivalent data from SNOTEL sites. Indices of snow transitions will then be compared to streamflow and soil moisture data at both annual-decadal time scales and event-seasonal time scales. HYDRUS-1D simulations of soil moisture changes in response to varying scenarios of snow persistence will be developed for SNOTEL sites in two different climate regions to examine how process interactions between snow loss and hydrologic response vary with climate. The study synthesizes a top-down approach examining runoff and soil moisture changes across geographic gradients of snow persistence with a bottom-up process modeling approach examining how soil moisture responds to a transition from persistent to intermittent snow. The multi-scale approach will help in understanding how regional long-term patterns link with local conditions in individual seasons.",

We hypothesized that loss of snow in dry areas would cause a threshold-like loss of streamflow at the transition between seasonally persistent and intermittent snowpack. To examine this we first mapped snow persistence across the western U.S. using MODIS satellite data to identify where snow was seasonally persistent and intermittent (Hammond et al. 2017a,b). Next we examined how annual streamflow relates to these patterns of snow across the region. This revealed limited connection between snow and streamflow in wet climates but a strong non-linear correlation between snow persistence and streamflow in dry/cold climates. As hypothesized, we identified a sharp increase in streamflow generation at the transition between seasonally intermittent and persistent snowpack (Hammond et al. 2018).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We then examined whether streamflow generation is different for snowmelt vs. rainfall (Hammond and Kampf 2020). To do this we divided time periods of streamflow response based on the rise and fall of hydrographs and quantified the relative amounts of snow and rainfall inputs for these &ldquo;quickflow response intervals.&rdquo; Results revealed that snowmelt often does produce more streamflow than rainfall because it tends to have higher total input over longer durations. However, rainfall generated streamflow more efficiently than snowmelt during winter rainfall because of high moisture conditions. In some cases this winter rainfall can counteract the dominant tendency for streamflow to decline with loss of snow.
