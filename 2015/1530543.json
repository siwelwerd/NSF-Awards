The funds will provide for approximately 30 partial travel grant awards to U.S. speakers, authors of papers, particularly young academic participants at the Conference. Travel awards will be made based on the following considerations: (1) scientific or technological merit of the speaker/participant; (2) professional qualifications relative to age and position; (3) institutional and geographical distribution. All awards will be made in full compliance with the Civil Rights Acts of 1964. NSF travel policies with respect to U.S. air carriers will be followed.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe theme of the conference is: \"New Era of Opportunities and Challenges of Chemical Engineering: Frontier of Chemical Engineering and Future Development of Chemical Industry.\" The Conference is co-sponsored by the Chinese Academy of Engineering, Chinese Academy of Science, the Chemical Industry & Engineering Society of China (CIESC), and the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE). The purpose of the Conference is to provide a forum for U.S. Chemical Engineers to meet their counterpart in China to discuss the latest advances, exchange research ideas and discuss opportunities for collaboration.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nGlobal issues such as new and renewable energy sources, clean fuels, sustainability and environment will be among the focal points of discussion that will be beneficial to the U.S. participants, and lead to the development of new research ideas and collaborations. The direct communication will facilitate development and expansion of the potentially vast markets in China as well as Asia for U.S. chemical products.",
