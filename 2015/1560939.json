 "awd_abstract_narration": "Following natural disasters in the United States, federal, state and local government officials must facilitate the recovery of the functionality and well-being of the affected communities. The housing sector plays a vital role in recovery because schools, businesses, neighborhoods and community-based organizations all rely on residents having healthy living conditions so that they can remain in the affected region. Existing disaster risk modeling methods are not able to adequately represent the housing recovery process and its long-term impacts to communities. This project will address this problem by developing and applying new data and computer model methods to simulate post-disaster housing recovery. The computer model will enable policy-makers and planners to quantify the benefits and tradeoffs associated with possible pre- and post-disaster housing interventions. They will be able to explore potential scenarios for various future hazard events towards the goal of enhancing housing recovery after disasters in the United States. To facilitate technology transfer to other researchers and disaster risk managers, the computer model and data from this project will be free, open source, and available over the World Wide Web. The research will provide training for a doctoral student and an opportunity to teach undergraduate students from different backgrounds about the role of science and engineering in improving the resilience of communities to natural disasters.\r\n\r\nWe will investigate key questions related to housing recovery using a post-disaster recovery simulation model that integrates building performance information and homeowner decision making over space and time. The three main components of the research are (1) a probabilistic model that computes building damage using data about loss of functionality, habitability, and repairability (2) a model that quantifies the influences and uncertainty associated with homeowners' decisions whether to repair, reoccupy, sell, or abandon damaged homes based on the extent of damage, demographics, neighborhood conditions, and utility services and (3) a simulation of post-disaster housing recovery, that accounts for the influences of building, homeowner, and resource attributes, such as housing stock and population movement. We will apply the simulation model to a large urban jurisdiction for the purposes of (a) evaluation, (b) hypothesis testing, (c) and assessing potential policies and other interventions for enhancing recovery. The project will further the science in performance-based engineering and urban modeling to facilitate experiments for examining the geographic effects of post-disaster residential building functionality and housing occupancy.",

The housing sector plays a vital role in this recovery because schools, businesses, neighborhoods and community-based organizations all rely on residents having healthy living conditions so that they can remain in the affected region. The primary goal of this project was to develop and apply new data and computer models to simulate disaster housing recovery.</p>\n<p>We started by performing an exhaustive state-of-the-art review and synthesis of the literature toward building a community researchers and practitioners around the most effective methods, datasets, and tools for modeling disaster recovery. From this review, we determined that there is a need for future models to consider the dynamics of rental housing and the role of race and ethnicity. Additionally, there needs to be more of a coordinated research effort towards creating comprehensive multi-sector (e.g. housing, businesses, schools etc.) modeling platforms.</p>\n<p>The project analyzed various resource factors to understand their influence on housing recovery after the 2014 Napa County earthquake. Examples of such factors include 1) building inspector availability, 2) building permit review length, 3) construction worker and material access, and 4) household liquid assets. We found, for example, the building permit review lengths in Napa after the 2014 earthquake was similar to three other cities, suggesting the county permit processing was not an unreasonable bottleneck for housing repair and reconstruction. Similarly, the analysis found that its unlikely that access to construction workers or construction materials slowed repairs or reconstruction in post-earthquake Napa County.</p>\n<p>The literature review and analysis findings informed creation of a computer simulation model of housing recovery. The open-source computer model is called DESaster (discrete event simulation of disaster recovery). It is freely available to the public on the website Github.com and includes features for visualizing the large amounts of output data the model can produce. DESaster is designed to be a modular ?toolbox? that permits users, such as emergency managers, to assemble custom simulations useful case studies and scenarios. DESaster is unique in how it represents the likely influence of several types of important human, financial, and physical resources on the events that households experience during recovery, as well as the progress of reconstructing the single-family houses they occupy. The model is also unique because it represents recovery for both homeowners and renters (including the role of landlords), in addition to the role of temporary and transitional housing availability on household recovery.</p>\n<p>After creating and testing the model, we applied it to better understand Napa County housing recovery after the 2014 earthquake. The simulation showed us that house damage has a significant influence on rebuilding outcomes. Using the simulation, we also found that, on average, homeowners who successfully rebuilt their houses had 3.5 times more liquid assets (e.g., savings) than homeowners who could not rebuild their houses. Similarly, homeowners that rebuilt (in the simulation) had, on average, 1.5 times higher incomes. We found that the financial assistance provided by the federal government (grants and loans) was generally insufficient for homeowners with low incomes and amounts of liquid assets to repair or rebuild their homes. Based on simulation outputs, credit score of households was not found to have a statistically significant effect on house rebuilding. All homeowners who had earthquake insurance (around 10% of homeowners) rebuilt their homes in all simulated scenarios. Within the simulation, the average time for homeowners to repair or rebuild their houses was about 2 years, which is similar to what occurred in Napa County. Several homeowner attributes, for example income, were found to be correlated with simulated repair or rebuilding time. The simulation gave us insight into other times related to housing recovery. Average post-earthquake building inspection time was about six months because of lack of building inspectors after the first couple of weeks. Average federal loan application processing time was around six months, with federal grant processing time about one month faster. The financial resource that took the longest for homeowners to receive in the simulation was earthquake insurance, with a claim processing time around 11 months.</p>\n<p>To demonstrate the possibility of applying the housing recovery model DESaster outside of the United States we applied also applied it to better understand housing recovery after the 2015 Nepal earthquake. While the model application was effective, less availability of data and the greater diversity of less standardized recovery resources in Nepal made application of DESaster more difficult and therefore more uncertain.</p>\n<p>This project resulted in significant contributions to the state of the art of housing recovery modeling, an aspect of disasters that has seen relatively little modeling research. The computer model researched in this project provides an immediate tool for emergency managers and policy makers to use to better plan for housing recovery after future disasters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/03/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Scott&nbsp;B&nbsp;Miles</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560939/1560939_10392235_1578084984572_DESaster_simple_des_sequence_diagram--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560939/1560939_10392235_1578084984572_DESaster_simple_des_sequence_diagram--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"DESaster Conceptual Model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560939/1560939_10392235_1578084984572_DESaster_simple_des_sequence_diagram--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"DESaster Conceptual Model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An overview of the conceptual approach of the housing recovery model DESaster.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Scott Miles</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Scott&nbsp;B&nbsp;Miles</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">DESaster Conceptual Model</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560939/1560939_10392235_1578085151880_fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560939/1560939_10392235_1578085151880_fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Example household outputs\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560939/1560939_10392235_1578085151880_fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Example household outputs\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example outputs from DESaster.
