 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cyber-physical additive layer manufacturing, e.g., 3D printing, has become a promising technology for providing cost, time, and space effective solution by reducing the gap between designers and manufacturers. However, the concern for the protection of intellectual property is arising in conjunction with the capabilities of supporting massive innovative designs and rapid prototyping. Intellectual property in the additive layer manufacturing system consists of: i) geometric design of an object; ii) attributes of an object; iii) process information; and iv) machine information. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project seeks to develop defense mechanisms for detecting malware and counterfeit articles using a variety of signals that are observed during the manufacturing process including acoustic, temperature, power, and others.  The project is an EAGER because both the uniqueness of the observed signal signatures, and their utilization in securing the manufacturing process are high risk with potential for high reward in thwarting attacks.\r\n\r\nThis project will demonstrate that during the life-cycle of the additive layer manufacturing system, the intellectual property information contained in the cyber domain can be recovered/reconstructed through attacks occurring during the manufacturing process in the physical domain through various non-intrusive techniques. It will then focus on creating both machine-dependent and machine-independent defense mechanisms for avoiding such an attack. This project will significantly impact US competitiveness over technology-oriented manufacturing. The attack model will provide feedback to 3D printer manufacturers and CAD tool designers to build defenses against these new types of attack. Moreover, it will have a significant societal impact to the explosively growing maker and crowd-sourcing community in protecting their intellectual property. In addition, the project's approach can be used in other manufacturing systems, e.g., CNC machines, manufacturing robots, etc. This is possibly the very first approach to create defense for additive layer manufacturing mechanisms against such attacks occurring in the physical domain to get access to information of the cyber domain.  This project has three specific objectives: 1) It will demonstrate a proof of concept by presenting a novel attack model constructed using a combination of machine learning, signal processing, and pattern recognition techniques that utilize the side-channel information (power, temperature, acoustic, electromagnetic emission) obtained during the manufacturing process. 2) It will develop a machine-specific defense mechanism against the attack model for the 3D printer. New techniques to add additional physical process encryption, e.g. adding extra information to the G-code to obfuscate the printing process from the attack model between the G-code and the physical manufacturing process, will be demonstrated. 3) It will create a new security-aware 3D-printing algorithm for the machine-independent CAD tools that can protect against such side channel attacks. The 3D-printing algorithm will slice the STL and generate layer description language (e.g. G-code) randomly so that for the same 3D object, different instructions will be sent to the 3D printer and eventually different physical features will be extracted by the attackers.",

The main aim of the project was to validate the hypothesis that side-channels can be used to create attack models that breach the confidentiality of the additive manufacturing system and provide counter-measures for defending the system from such attacks. In order to do this, the project was divided into three specific objects to be carried out throughout the entire life of the award. The summary of the major outcomes corresponding to these objectives are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Objective 1: Novel attack model based on side-channels:&nbsp;</strong>In order to demonstrate the vulnerability of the additive manufacturing to side-channel based attacks, a novel attack model was proposed. The attack model utilized analog emissions from various domains such as acoustics, power, magnetic, and vibrations to detect information leakage. These signals were processes, and features were extracted to train learning algorithms such as decision trees to infer about the geometry of the 3D objects. This novel attack model was presented to provide the proof of concept for the possibility of a confidentiality breach through unconventional means. Feature engineering was performed to utilize the discrete wavelet transforms to extract better features from the signals. Based on this attack model, we were able to reconstruct the 3D objects and the cyber-domain data. Specifically, we tested the attack model with nominal printing speed and the acoustic side-channel and were able to reconstruct simple objects such as square, triangle with an average accuracy of 78.35% (accuracy of the classification models), and length prediction error of 17.82% (error of the regression models). Moreover, the dimension of the objects tested ranged from 5 mm to 20 mm. By incorporating the discrete wavelet transforms as one of the features, we were able to increase the accuracy of the learning models in reconstructing the G/M-codes through the acoustic side-channels. More specifically, with the new features, were able to reconstruct simple objects such as square, triangle with an average accuracy of 86% (accuracy of the classification models), and length prediction error of 11.11% (error of the regression models).&nbsp; Furthermore, various other side-channels were also analyzed to see the total information leaked, which revealed that acoustic and vibration side-channels revealed more information about the cyber-domain data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Objective 2: Machine-specific defense mechanism:&nbsp;</strong>In order to provide the defense against the zero-day attacks on the integrity of the 3D-Printer, a detection method was developed leveraging the analog emission from the acoustic side-channel. For the integrity attack detection model, we assume that an attacker can place malicious code in the firmware. With the single acoustic sensor continuously monitoring the analog emissions, the accuracy of detecting the variation introduced in the speed, axis and dimension was 77.45%.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Objective 3: Security aware 3D printing algorithm:&nbsp;</strong>To minimize the information leakage from the 3D Printer, we have created secured slicing and tool path generation algorithm, that tracks the analog emissions from the side-channel, measures the amount of information leakage and minimizes the information leakage through changing the design parameters in the computer-aided manufacturing tools. Moreover, this methodology can be extended to Computer Aided Design (CAD) Tools and incorporated in the firmware of the 3D printer as well. By giving a feedback about the amount of information being leaked from the various side-channel, the proposed algorithm modifies the design variables (machine specific parameters, and 3D objects specific parameters). Moreover, using this algorithm only in the CAM tool, and using few design variables, we were able to decrease the mutual information in the acoustic side-channel by 24.76%<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Furthermore, for various benchmark 3D models, we were able to achieve an average mutual information reduction of 24.94% in acoustic side-channel, 32.91% in power side-channel, 32.29% in magnetic side-channel, and 55.65% in vibration side-channel of the fused-deposition modeling based Cartesian 3D printer. To validate the proposed methodology, a case study with an attack model is used to calculate the success rate. For the various threshold of G/M-code reconstruction, the average drop in success rate obtained is 8.74%. With this work, the capability of a leakage-aware cyber-domain computer aided manufacturing tool for maintaining the confidentiality of the system without physical system modification is highlighted.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Beside these scopes, multiple works were carried out to improve and disseminate knowledge about the security research in additive manufacturing systems.&nbsp;In order to understand the security issues brought forth by the industry 4.0 on manufacturing system, a survey was carried to understand the issues of enabling components of industry 4.0 on the product life-cycle of the manufacturing system.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/02/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mohammad&nbsp;Al Faruque</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1546993/1546993_10393294_1543810796869_acoustic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1546993/1546993_10393294_1543810796869_acoustic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Acoustic Side-Channel Attack on 3D-Printer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1546993/1546993_10393294_1543810796869_acoustic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Acoustic Side-Channel Attack on 3D-Printer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Acoustic Side-Channel Attack on 3D-Printer</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">AICPS</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mohammad&nbsp;Al Faruque</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Acoustic Side-Channel Attack on 3D-Printer</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1546993/1546993_10393294_1543811231203_attack--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1546993/1546993_10393294_1543811231203_attack--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Attack Model\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1546993/1546993_10393294_1543811231203_attack--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Attack Model\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Attack Model</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">AICPS, UCI</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use -
