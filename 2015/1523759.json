 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow and a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Delbert A. Green II is \"Molecular genetic basis of migration in the Monarch butterfly.\" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Chicago, and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Marcus Kronforst (primary) and Dr. Steven Reppert (The University of Massachusetts Medical School). \r\n\r\nMigration is a behavioral adaptation that has evolved in diverse taxa, from bacteria to humans, and is a successful and complex strategy for surviving in heterogeneous environments. Current knowledge suggests that there is no single explanataion of how migration works and elucidating the mechanisms requires integrating studies of behavior, physiology, and morphology. Although many species-specific migration adaptations have been described without the emergence of a single mechanism, there are some features of animal migrations that are nearly universal. The evolutionary conservation of these traits suggests that a common mechanism may underlie animal migrations. The monarch butterfly, one of America's treasured migrators, presents an excellent model for researching the mechanism of animal migration.  This research seeks to uncover the molecular genetic basis of monarch migration using a combination of behavioral, developmental, genetic/genomic, and biochemical studies. The fellowship also affords the opportunity for scientific training for the Fellow with a focus on experimental techniques to study various aspects of monarch biology, including development, behavior, anatomy, and physiology as well as next-generation sequencing data generation and analysis. New tools for conducting functional genetics studies in monarchs are being developed. Coupled with existing knowledge of monarch natural history and ecology, the research promises to produce a comprehensive model for understanding complex trait evolution. Exploring environmental and genetic determinants of migration promises critical new insights relevant to monarch conservation strategies.  \r\n \r\nA major goal of this project is to broaden participation of under-represented groups in biology through educational outreach by training and mentoring undergraduate students as a role model. Additionally, a novel pilot program to engage high school and middle school students in studies of monarch biology is being developed to provide technical preparation in STEM subjects and promote community-centered science engagement. The pilot program complements ongoing efforts to enhance existing programs for monarch conservation and learning about monarchs in particular but also to generate enthusiasm for and success in STEM fields for under-represented groups.",
