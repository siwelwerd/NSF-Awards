 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Capacity-building (CAP) projects increase the ability of researchers to understand how such technology should be designed and used in the future and supports new capacity in allowing researchers to answer questions about how people learn, how to foster or assess learning, and/or how to design for learning. This project supports a workshop in which experts in museums, informal learning, complex systems, and data science collaborate with technologists to examine what types of technologies could help track how learners behave, and learn, in museums and other informal learning locations. The workshops would lead to a written document summarizing what is known about how to track learners for these purposes, and would help spark new collaborations leading to new approaches to these problems. Ethics would be a core theme, and experts in ethics would help ensure that all approaches explored would respect the privacy of museumgoers and other learners. The intellectual merit of this project is to advance the state of the art on how we track what learners do in museums, and the broader impact would be to make it easier to design museums and other learning environments to support learners, and to allow more rigorous assessment of learning behavior in museums.\r\n\r\nThis project will conduct a three-day workshop leading to an edited volume on technology-enabled visitor metrics in museums and other science and technology centers. The leadership team includes expertise in learning sciences, computer science, interaction design, complex systems, and informal science education, and the workshop will additionally be supported by an advisory committee including experts in educational performance assessment and psychometrics, learning analytics, cross-cultural and cross-setting sociocultural learning theory, and educational policy. Workshop invitees will be recruited to include participants from several categories, including learning sciences, data sciences and learning analytics, informal science education and museum design, ubiquitous and pervasive computing, and data ethics. An embedded evaluation will interview participants after the workshops to gauge whether the meeting spurred new research collaborations.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The Tracing Learning across Time and Space workshop was held at the New York Hall of Science in July of 2015. By bringing together experts from learning research, museum practice, sensing technology, and data analytics, the workshop sought to jump-start a conversation about how learning in informal spaces like museums can be documented and characterized using new types of evidence and new analytic techniques. To move towards this goal, the workshop participants identified a number of needs with respect to data collection, data management, data analysis, ethics, and collaboration and knowledge sharing. These ideas were generated via a mix of hands-on activities, wherein participants enacted learning scenarios within exhibits and then analyzed the data they produced, and a series of brainstorming and consolidation sessions, all informed by keynotes delivered by experts who each had a different take on how behavior can be studied in situ. The finings of the workshop demand a shift from more traditional &nbsp;<strong><em>outcome-centric</em></strong> measures of learning, to more <strong><em>process-centric</em></strong> documentation of how learning unfolds. In other words, documenting learning in informal settings needs to be less about measuring the residue of learning activity, as is often measured via pre-post test contrasts, and instead more about attending to what learners <strong>can show us they can do </strong>while they are learning. Likewise, documenting learning in informal settings demands a shift from <strong><em>individual-level</em></strong> documentation to <strong><em>group-level and context-sensitive</em></strong> documentation. So rather than focusing on measuring the knowledge and success of individual learners, there is a need to adopt instead a more <strong>distributed model of learning</strong>, acknowledging the integral role of the learning ecologies in learning processes. The ideas generated by workshop participants were presented at a number of conferences and workshops and in a final report made available online, and the connections made by participants led to a number of subsequent grant proposals to pursue the identified needs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/01/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Leilah&nbsp;Lyons</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1457431/1457431_10351322_1525180763693_CAP2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1457431/1457431_10351322_1525180763693_CAP2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Workshop Logo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1457431/1457431_10351322_1525180763693_CAP2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Workshop Logo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Workshop Logo</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Leilah Lyons / Andrew Kelly</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Leilah&nbsp;Lyons</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Workshop Logo</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1457431/1457431_10351322_1525180217867_IMG_2328--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1457431/1457431_10351322_1525180217867_IMG_2328--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Brainstorming session\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1457431/1457431_10351322_1525180217867_IMG_2328--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Brainstorming session\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants use sticky notes to generate and prioritize ideas.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Leilah Lyons</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Leilah&nbsp;Lyons</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Brainstorming session</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1457431/1457431_10351322_1525180994933_CKcSCDjWgAA6ppA--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1457431/1457431_10351322_1525180994933_CKcSCDjWgAA6ppA--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Dr. Tanya Berger-Wolf presenting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1457431/1457431_10351322_1525180994933_CKcSCDjWgAA6ppA--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Dr. Tanya Berger-Wolf presenting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Tanya Berger-Wolf presenting on the application of social inference algorithms for identifying animal behavior.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Leilah Lyons</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Leilah&nbsp;Lyons</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Dr. Tanya Berger-Wolf presenting</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
