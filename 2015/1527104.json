 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many modern data analysis techniques and applications in machine \r\nlearning try to learn what input data has the largest effects on the \r\noutputs. Rayleigh Quotients (RQ), or, more generally, RQ-type \r\nobjective functions, are the basis of a mathematical technique that \r\ncaptures this information. This project conducts in-depth theoretical \r\nand algorithmic studies of three RQ-type optimizations: robust RQ \r\noptimizations that can handle data uncertainty, constrained RQ-type \r\noptimizations that can incorporate prior information from image \r\nsegmentation or data clustering, and trace ratio optimizations that \r\ncan perform multi-view spectral clustering. This project improves \r\nunderstanding of this practically important and user-oriented \r\nmathematical theory, creating computational methods that are embodied \r\nin open-source software. It not only advances mathematical theory \r\nand optimization algorithms in data science, but trains computer \r\nscience and computational mathematics graduate students in \r\ninterdisciplinary knowledge and tools necessary to undertake the \r\nproject successfully. The PIs also involve undergraduate students \r\nin all aspects of this research project. \r\n\r\nThe PIs expect to produce a unified view of RQ-type optimizations, \r\nreformulating them into linear and nonlinear eigenvalue problems for \r\nwhich new variational principles can characterize the optimal \r\nsolutions. These new principles should expose the numerical linear \r\nalgebra characteristics of the underlying problems, supporting the \r\ndevelopment of fast algorithms that exploint the mathematical \r\nproperties and sparse data structure.",
