The International Congress has met every two years since 1990, the Congress usually attracts between 100 and 200 delegates from all over the world. The students are selected by the Standing Organizing Committee for the conference based on need and the quality of abstracts submitted for presentation. \r\n\r\nEnvironmental research is interdisciplinary and this meeting brings together scientists, engineers, and health care researchers to discuss the environmental issues surrounding combustion. This meeting brings academic, government, and industrial representatives together to present research findings, update international policy, and discuss critical issues concerning emissions of toxic by-products from the combustion processes.",
