The program supports 10 students who conduct independent research projects during a 10-week summer program that includes seminars in marine sciences, field trips and a series of workshops. Science seminars cover a wide range of marine science topics, and workshops focus on professional development issues such as analyzing complex data sets, how to write scientific papers, life in graduate school, and career paths in marine sciences.  At the end of the summer, interns present their results during a mini-symposium and write up their results in the form of a regular scientific paper.",

We received over 1000 applications for these 30 positions and were delighted to accept our interns from across the United States, including Puerto Rico. Over 50% of our interns were from non-PhD granting institutions, providing them access to the cutting edge marine science research at our Lewes, DE campus.

In addition to their research activities, interns participated in several field experiences to explore the diversity of coastal environments around Lewes, Delaware. A day trip aboard the RV/Joanne Daiber introduced them to a wide variety of research questions and sampling techniques including trawling, plankton sampling and identification of organisms. An expert in local geology guided students on a tour of the geological features of nearby Cape Henlopen. Another field trip highlight was a nighttime trip to monitor the spawning behavior of horseshoe crabs, a remarkable phenomenon that occurs in May and June each year. In addition, interns participated in a marsh walk, during which they were introduced to the flora and fauna of a <em>Spartina</em> dominated salt-marsh as well as the ecological role of these coastal systems. Many of our interns also conducted field work for their individual projects. Weekly seminars and workshops included career planning, writing and communication in the sciences, funding for grad school and a Boating and Seamanship course offered through the US Coast Guard Auxiliary.

During this funding cycle, we initiated a novel approach to retention in STEM, and in Geoscience, specifically, by directly recruiting our REU interns into our graduate program in Marine Science. Our thoughts in setting up this approach to graduate recruitment were several. Our REU program is highly competitive, with acceptance of just 3-5% of applicants in a given year. The cohort of students that we accept is diverse and this allows us access to very highly qualified AND diverse students for our graduate program. Of the 30 REU interns hosted in summers 2015, 2016, and 2017, 26% have joined the graduate program in the School of Marine Science and Policy at UD.

Over 90% of our former interns are either pursuing graduate degrees or working in a STEM field. Our program has contributed to workforce development for STEM fields in the United States.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/28/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joanna&nbsp;York</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460963/1460963_10352612_1588084758025_2016-CEOE-summer-interns_11--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460963/1460963_10352612_1588084758025_2016-CEOE-summer-interns_11--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Summer 2016 REUs- University of Delaware\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460963/1460963_10352612_1588084758025_2016-CEOE-summer-interns_11--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Summer 2016 REUs- University of Delaware\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summer 2016 REU interns at the School of Marine Science and Policy at the University of Delaware.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Lisa Tossey, University of Delaware</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joanna&nbsp;York</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Summer 2016 REUs- University of Delaware</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460963/1460963_10352612_1588084227175_CassandraRaquel2017--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460963/1460963_10352612_1588084227175_CassandraRaquel2017--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Interns working in the lab\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460963/1460963_10352612_1588084227175_CassandraRaquel2017--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Interns working in the lab\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Former REU intern Cassandra Harris (2016) (left) working with current intern Raquel Jaramillo (2017) (right)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University of Delaware</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joanna&nbsp;York</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Interns working in the lab</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460963/1460963_10352612_1588085216991_REUMarshWalk12018_JYork--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460963/1460963_10352612_1588085216991_REUMarshWalk12018_JYork--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Summer 2018 REUs on marsh walk- University of Delaware\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460963/1460963_10352612_1588085216991_REUMarshWalk12018_JYork--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Summer 2018 REUs on marsh walk- University of Delaware\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summer 2018 REUs on marsh walk in Lewes, DE.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Joanna York</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Joanna&nbsp;York</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Summer 2018 REUs on marsh walk- University of Delaware</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
