 "awd_abstract_narration": "A better understanding of past climatic variability and the extent to which different climate systems influence moisture availability is essential for future water resources planning and allocation.  This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate historical drivers of moisture variability near the intersection of two dominant climate systems in Central Asia.  The doctoral student will use tree-ring data to characterize spatial and temporal climatic changes and the reasons behind these changes across a region that is not well understood climatically.  She will provide new information regarding how multiple climate systems dictate the amount of moisture delivered to semi-arid regions that are susceptible to persistent and severe droughts.  The student will work closely with natural resource offices internationally and will mentor undergraduate students, many of whom will be from underrepresented groups.  The hydroclimatic nature of this study has important implications for water resource managers around the world as they develop regional plans for future water allocations.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\nThis project will address the core question of whether shifting climate systems are responsible for changes in spatial hydroclimatic variability or whether such convergences are a response to human-related warming.  A new multi-parametric tree-ring approach at a fine temporal resolution (annual) will be used to understand the drivers of past climate variability.  Tree-ring parameters including ring width, latewood density, carbon and oxygen isotopes will be analyzed using standard dendrochronological procedures.  The analyses will provide a quantitative assessment of the factors driving large-scale drought dynamics.  The research in an arid region of the world will provide a better understanding of water resources use and allocation for agricultural, environmental, and human use in a broad range of locales around the world, including some in the U.S.",
