 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the proposed research is to discover and understand phenomena that occur in two-dimensional suspensions of particles. These are particles that are suspended in solutions that are so spread-out that they form what are known as monolayer suspensions. This is a very fundamental problem with industrial and biological implications, since such suspensions are very common in both industry and nature, including emulsions and foams, cells, organelles and biological fluids. \r\n\r\nThe proposal is focused on the understanding of the rheological behavior of particulate dispersions embedded in insoluble monolayers of surfactants. Carefully conceived theoretical and experimental studies of model two-dimensional particulate dispersions are proposed. It is very important to note that the choice of a 2D system was made so that study of the lubrication phenomena in flows between approaching particles can reveal new modes of behavior in interfacial suspensions that have no analog in conventional three dimensional suspensions. In other words, this is a case where the investigation of a 2D system offers as rich a field of exploration and relevance to the real world as the investigation of 3D systems. The proposed research will involve theoretical analysis of a series of paradigmatic problems (e.g. lubrication flows and colloidal pair dynamics) involving monolayers whose surface rheology thickens, thins, or exhibits phase transitions as a function of surface pressure. It will also involve complementary experiments using photolithographically-designed particles and structures dispersed within surfactant monolayer. Exploratory experimental studies of concentrated 2D suspensions, including detailed particle dynamics, effective rheology, and discontinuous shear thickening will be conducted. Outreach and dissemination of research is planned, involving URM students in research. In addition,  there are activities planned to reach out to 4th-6th grade students and attract them to  mechanical, computer, and chemical engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBackground.  Surfactants are everywhere -- they make up our cell membranes, they lift grease and grime off of our skin, hair, and clothes, they make the foams in bubble bath, whipped cream and shaving cream, and they make it possible for us to breathe.   What allows them to do all of this is their tendency to stick to fluid surfaces.  While most surfactants - like the soaps in your shampoo - rapidly hop onto and off of fluid surfaces, others (like the lipids in your lungs) essentially won't re-dissolve into water once they've found air. \n\n\nScientific Merit.  Some surfactants form stiff films on liquid interfaces - the molecular version of the 'skin' that forms as warm milk cools.  These 2D mechanical properties can be important: some microbes actively 'tune' the composition of their cell membranes as temperature changes to maintain a particular two-dimensional fluidity.\n\n\nThis project elucidated counterintuitive fluid mechanical effects that arise when surfactant films with two-dimensional viscosity flow.  The effects occur on small length scales - e.g. hundreds of nanometers to tens of microns - where the damping effects of viscosity typically overwhelm any inertial forces.  Under these conditions, particles and flows tend to be kinematically reversible:  particles and fluids move with a velocity that depends instantaneously on the forces driving it.  Reverse the force exactly, and the flows and trajectories reverse exactly.  This reversibility has profound implications for microbial life, for cell sorting and materials processing.\n\n\nThis project was motivated by the observation that surfactant monolayers are readily compressible, unlike bulk liquids.  Moreover, the surface viscosity of surfactant films often changes strongly when they are compressed.  In this project, we found that compression-dependent viscosity changes the response of 2D surfactant films in ways that would be unexpected in 3D fluids.  For example, there can be an upper limit on how much surfactant can flow through an opening (fig. 1), or on how fast one embedded particle (like a protein) can approach another.  A particle that rotates while translating through a surfactant film follows an arced trajectory (fig. 2), and groups of embedded particles within a shearing film may repel and shear-thin, or aggregate and shear-thicken, depending on whether the surface viscosity increases or decreases with compression (fig. 3).  These and other effects we discovered may influence how biological, industrial, and technological systems are designed and operate.\n \nBroader Impacts.\nI developed and have continually refined a unique technical elective on the science of formulated products for undergraduate and graduate students in science and engineering.  The course discusses the science and engineering of multi-component, multifunctional soft materials - like consumer products, pharmaceutical formulations, paints and coatings, foods, biological materials, and others.  Students learn the fundamental science behind the 'building blocks' of soft material formulations - surfactants, colloids, polymers, solvents and solutes - and how to design and combine them to achieve both flow properties and chemical functionalities.  I make a direct case for the economic and societal value of diversity within these industries.  Namely, the aspects of identity that make each of us unique - like ethnicity, culture, socio-economic, gender or gender identity, or even hobbies - represents unique insight into the needs, tastes, and desires of our respective communities.  Diversity, in all its forms, should be viewed as valuable market insight that can be utilized to benefit each community, as well as the companies wise enough to serve them.\n\n\nWe have since worked to advance this integrated approach to teaching, understanding, and designing formulated products through a perspective piece in Chem. Eng. Prog., and through direct engagement with relevant companies.  Moreover, this framework has enabled an interdisciplinary club of motivated students in Chemistry, Chemical Engineering, and other departments at UCSB.  Each term, the club selects one or two consumer products, and we learn about the underlying scientific foundation:  how surfactant, colloid, polymer, solute and solvent 'building blocks' combine to build microstructure, establish mechanical or flow properties, and perform chemical tasks.  Club members then develop and refine their own formulations.\n\n\nA final outcome of this project that has already shown broad impact is a pedagogic review and perspective on surfactant dynamics, published in J. Fluid Mech.  Multiple academic disciplines and distinct industries have studied and exploited surfactants for centuries, resulting in considerable collective wisdom and expertise, yet lies siloed within distinct communities.  Differences in approach -- e.g. molecular, thermodynamic, continuum mechanical, microstructural, chemical, or functional -- makes it difficult to connect concepts from one community or industry with another.  Our comprehensive, 115-page article lays out, in a single coherent piece, a common framework that connects and bridges these communities.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/23/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Todd M Squires"
