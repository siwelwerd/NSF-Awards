 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is in the availability of an additive manufacturing (3D printing) process suitable for full-scale building construction. The construction industry represents a critical nexus in the American economy. Building construction impacts nearly every economic sector, particularly manufacturing, transportation, energy, consumer products and appliances, and real estate. Simply, a building is perhaps the most essential economic stimulus there is. Yet, the practice of building has seen little of the technological revolution that has transformed virtually every other industry. As a result, the construction industry produces significant material and financial waste, and its productivity has steadily declined over the past several decades. Additive manufacturing is the most efficient and cost-effective approach to creating custom products, of which buildings are by far the most valuable and most widely purchased. Customization is increasingly driving demand by today?s consumers. Additive manufacturing in construction could reduce costs and material waste while providing unparalleled design freedom and driving innovation through the consolidation of many isolated industrial activities into one highly flexible and efficient manufacturing process, which directly serves industry professionals and clients at an individual level.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project stems from the vast potential of Additive Manufacturing to transform design and making. In a broad sense, the proposed method of construction aims to make the complexity, efficiency, and freedom of digital architectural design accessible to the average consumer. Phase I research will serve to scale and develop a new large-scale additive manufacturing process, and to evaluate the performance of the physical products in their functions as building components. The proposed method may potentially impact other types of large-scale manufacturing as well, including aerospace and automotive. Our technology is rooted in observations of the processes in which forms are created in the natural world. Structures in nature have long fascinated scientists and engineers, due to their remarkable efficiency and complex forms. 3D printing now allows us to manufacture products of similar efficiency and complexity which reflect our observations of nature. We believe that if the genius of natural organisms can be applied to the way we create shelter, provide transportation, design infrastructure, or construct cities, the resulting innovations could profoundly, and very literally, shape the way our societies develop, and transform our relationship with the natural world.",

The goals of this project were to develop algorithms to capable of accommodating a large scale manufacturing process, to increase production throughput of the process, to design and test new extrusion nozzle technologies, and to develop prototypes for demonstration and research purposes.\n\nThe team at Branch Technology has accomplished a great amount during the course of the funding of this project.  In fact, more was accomplished than was set out in the Phase I grant proposal, both the original and revised scopes.  All of the key goals have been accomplished, many with results beyond what was anticipated.  In particular, significant progress with respect to algorithm development has been achieved and a number of viable prototypes that test the limits of the additive manufacturing process have been produced. (See Figure 3.)  The algorithm can not only handle and automatically parse walls (thickened planes) into geometry and robotic code, but now volumetric objects also (any shaped object).  The throughput of the additive manufacturing process has also been significantly improved, achieving speeds beyond the original milestones targeted at the beginning of the grant.  The process is now freeform extruding 6.25X faster than the baseline doubly curved wall from March.  In addition, the output has increased 4.57X in terms of pounds per hour and 4.62X in terms of volume per hour over what was possible in March.  Finally, the robotic automation achieved now allows Branch to 3D print without manual intervention, a feat that was not possible even 3 months ago.\n\nFurther, significant progress has also been made towards the secondary technical thrusts of the project.
