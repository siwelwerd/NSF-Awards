 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Summary\r\n\r\nSocial scientists and policy makers rely on assumptions about people?s preferences to explain human behavior. Preferences are thought to be stable, measureable and predictive of economic and social success. For example when a policy is designed to get people to save for the future we make assumptions about citizens' preferences for discounting the future. We have measures that approximate how much people value the future and we rely on those measures to inform policy. The problem is that we do not know whether those measures are either valid or reliable. Do they predict the significant life choices that individuals make? The same problem holds for many measures of preference that are used when making public policy. The aim of this project is to develop measures of preference that will be accurate and simple to use, and that will predict behavior.\r\n \r\nTechnical Summary\r\n\r\nHuman preferences are assumed to be stable, measurable and predictive of economic, social and political success.  Preferences related to risk, time discounting (or patience), altruism, trust, reciprocity, and competition provide the underpinnings for models of decision-making in arenas as diverse as investment, savings, charitable giving and volunteering, collective decision making, voting and civic engagement, or the choice of a profession. While preferences are key constructs for the social sciences, they have proven difficult to measure. We make use of a natural experiment, random assignment of students to four-year residential colleges, to accomplish three objectives. First, we will calibrate commonly used measures of preference and test for their reliability and validity. Second, we will measure preference stability. Our study allows us to measure preferences over time with the same individuals in an effort to gauge whether they remain stable. Preference stability is a central claim in the social sciences, yet we know little about which preferences are stable. Third, we will map preferences to outcomes. By using a panel of subjects tracked over five years we can identify which measures of preference predict outcomes like civic engagement, competitive behavior, and academic and employment success.",

People decreased their social interactions; they changed the amount of time spent in public; and they decided what personal actions to take in dealing with a global pandemic. This study focuses on changes in economic preferences for a group of college students before and after COVID-19 over a period of 6 years. The core sample of students (553 respondents), drawn from an elite private university, participated in 10 studies between 2016 and 2020. These studies measured fundamental economic and political preferences. Many of the measures were repeated multiple times. During COVID this sample was augmented with students from the same university, a land grant university, and a historically Black university (a total of 2,219 respondents). Students were presented with survey items about their behavior with respect to COVID-19 and participated in on-line experiments. The same students participated in the study five times. Each study corresponded to waves of the pandemic (April 2020, July 2020, October 2020, January 2021, and July 2021). Across our study waves we observe our sample adjusting to different preventative behavior as information about the pandemic was clarified. We also observe those in the sample relied on very specific sources of information about the pandemic and what they believe is the appropriate response. The norms held by those in the sample about appropriate responses to the pandemic mimic the sources from which they get their information. Those norms, while quickly developed, are very slow to change. We find that those in sample have relatively stable risk preferences over time. Their risk-taking behavior toward COVID-19 is consistent with changing events in their environment and in line with their risk preferences. Finally, we find that interpersonal trust is not altered during this pandemic period. However, we do find that trust in governing institutions declines across over this period. This occurs at both the national and local levels. Overall, despite the changes in behavior, we find that many fundamental economic preferences appear stable over time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/14/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rick&nbsp;K&nbsp;Wilson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
