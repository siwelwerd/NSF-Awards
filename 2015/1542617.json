Furthermore, ISBRA seeks to provide important formative experiences to graduate students and post-doctoral scholars, helping them to become future leaders in the field.  The 11th ISBRA will be held at the Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia from June\r\n7h to June 10th, 2015.  Accepted extended abstracts will be published as volume 9096 in the Springer Verlag's Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics (LNBI) series.  To ensure broad dissemination of research findings, full versions of 20-25 selected abstracts presented at the symposium will be published in peer-reviewed special issues of IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, BMC Bioinformatics and BMC Genomics.",
