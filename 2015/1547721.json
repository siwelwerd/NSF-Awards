This workshop is the central event in the area of Quantum Computing and, more generally, Quantum Information Science. It is expected that QIP will bring together about 500 leading researchers in theoretical aspects of quantum information and computation, and play a role as one of the most important venues for the groundbreaking research in theoretical computer science. NSF support will help broaden participation at the QIP Workshop by subsidizing the travel for up to 20  student participants who might not otherwise attend QIP. Organizers aim at increasing the number of student and postdoctoral participants from the under-represented groups.",
