Initial integration efforts in the industry are focused on streaming device data\r\ninto electronic health records and integrating information from multiple devices into single \r\ncustomizable displays.  This proposal provides a research foundation for engineering and verification\r\nof these safety critical systems through creating an open source Medical Device Coordination \r\nFramework (MDCF) which includes: 1)middleware for integrating medical devices and electronic health \r\nrecords, and 2) a model-based development environment that implements medical device coordination\r\napplications (apps for short), enabling a systems of systems paradigm for medical devices. \r\n\r\nThe project has substantial broader impact via tools and techniques for verifying the integration of \r\nmedical systems that are compatible with the Integrated Clinical Environment standard.  In addition,\r\n the proposer includes extensive interaction with FDA specialists who are looking to transition these \r\nmethods into their validation and verification processes for their regulatory mission.",
