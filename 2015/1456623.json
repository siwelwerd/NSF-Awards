 "awd_abstract_narration": "The sliding filament theory is widely accepted as a useful model of muscle contraction in isolated preparations. However, the theory fails to account for critically important characteristics of muscle function. Despite decades of work, a predictive model of muscle force during natural movements remains elusive. The researchers will test the hypothesis that important properties of muscle can be explained by the winding filament hypothesis. The proposed work has significant potential to inform our understanding of how neural activation and applied forces together determine in vivo muscle force. Results from the research will be integrated into graduate and/or undergraduate courses at Denison University (RUI-eligible), Northwestern University, and Northern Arizona University. In addition, the research team will leverage programs at Denison University and Northern Arizona University  for recruiting under-represented participants in research. Results will be disseminated to broad audiences through standard mechanisms of publication and diverse public media, as well as participation in interdisciplinary conferences in the areas of engineering, biomechanics, and physiology.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will use the mdm mouse to test predictions of the winding filament hypothesis. The winding hypothesis claims that, in addition to the thin filaments, titin is activated by Ca2+, and that cross-bridges not only translate but also rotate the thin filaments, storing elastic energy in PEVK titin during isometric force development. Due to constraints of sarcomere geometry on titin activation and winding, the hypothesis makes unique quantitative predictions about the effects of stimulation and length changes on muscle force. By including different muscles in the proposed studies, the researchers can determine whether naturally occurring variation in titin structure and function contributes to activation- and length-dependent muscle properties (e.g., doublet potentiation and force depression/enhancement). The experiments will test whether titin activation and winding, alone or in combination, can account for observed muscle forces by comparing experimental results to model predictions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTitin is a giant protein found in skeletal muscle.  It plays a major role in muscle development and is likely to be a major determinate of passive tension in muscle.  Dr Kiisa Nishikawa developed a theory, called the winding filament hypothesis, that suggests when a muscle is active, titin is wound around another protein in muscle, helping generate force.  Thus, when a muscle contracts, titin is responsible for part of the force produced. If the hypothesis is correct it would substantially change the understanding of muscle contraction.  This would lead to improved predictions of muscle force and stiffness.  It would increase understanding of muscle diseases. \n\nThe overall goal of this collaborative research was to test the winding filament hypothesis.  Dr Sandercock?s portion of the project was to develop a mathematical model to critically test the winding filament hypothesis and well as titin?s role in passive tension.  Models of calcium dynamics (based on Baylor and Hollingsworth?s data) and cross-bridge cycling (based on Huxley?s two state model) were combined with a kinematic model of titin.  The models were always tested on a broad set of experimental data, to make sure improving the model to explain titin?s behavior, did not degrade the overall performance of the model.\n\nFour different models of titin were explored.  First a passive model of titin was considered.  Titin was modeled as a spring.  The simulation showed that titin reduced the heterogeneous distribution of sarcomere lengths in muscle resulting from force variation in half sarcomeres.  Next, a model was developed assuming that titin is bound to the thin filament when calcium levels were high.  Nishikawa and colleagues demonstrated in ex vivo experiments that titin can bind to the thin filament.  Titin was still modeled as a passive spring, but it is effectively stiffer during activation because its length is shortened by the binding.  Titin unbinding was considered a first order rate equation that did not depend on calcium. This model was able to fix a flaw in current muscle models?force enhancement.  This is the extra force that remains after an active muscle is stretched and held at a longer length.  Unfortunately, titin binding did not fully correct the model fit to experimental force-velocity data during muscle stretch.  The third titin model that was considered was pre-stretch of titin during binding to the thin filament.  It was assumed that calcium release lead to refolding of some part of titin (IG domain) producing force.  Thus, titin acts as a stretched spring.  This allows the muscle model to explain the force deficit in a muscle.  That is, the decrease in force when an active muscle is shortened and then allowed to redevelop tension at the shorter length.  Finally, the winding filament theory of titin was explored.  The theory suggests muscle cross bridge attachments increase the force from titin.  Sandercock was unable to find a mechanism for the relaxation of force consistent with both the winding filament theory and Huxleys?s crossbridge model for the velocity of shortening.\n\nIn general, titin improved the performance of the mathematical model of muscle force. Passive titin enhances the fit to a wide set of experimental data and there were no negative aspects.  However, the modeling efforts were unable to support the winding filament hypothesis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas G Sandercock"
