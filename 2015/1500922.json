 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many problems in the physical sciences and engineering can be modeled by noncommutative functions. Such functions are used to encode information about physical systems, so  studying  various  aspects of them  could reveal important information  about how to design systems  that perform desired tasks or how to maximize their performance. The motivation for this project is the relatively recent worldwide interest in the noncommutative aspects of multivariable operator theory and function theory, and their interplay with the classical theory of functions, algebras, and harmonic analysis. The present project aims at extending fundamental ideas from analysis, algebra, and geometry to the noncommutative context and finding applications in science and engineering.  The study of noncommutative  functions and the algebras that they generate,  which is the goal of the project, has potential applications  to  free probability, interpolation , optimization and control, and systems theory. The principal investigator expects the results of the project to make new connections   between several areas of mathematics and  to have applications in mathematical physics.  Another important objective of the project is to attract graduate students to the PI's research program and help build a Ph.D. program in mathematics  at the University of Texas-San Antonio.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed project  is a continuation of the ongoing program of the principal investigator to develop a  free analogue of the Sz.-Nagy-Foias  theory of contractions for noncommutative domains and varieties  in several noncommuting  variables and to develop the theory of free holomorphic functions on these  domains.  The  project is devoted to enhancing the understanding of  the structure of the noncommutative polydomains and varieties  that admit  universal models  and have  rich  analytic function theory,  and  to make advances towards their  classification  up to free biholomorphic equivalence.  This is accompanied  by the study of free holomorphic  functions on these polydomains with the emphasis on geometric aspects and the connection with  the hyperbolic geometry. The most prominent  feature of this project is the interaction between the structure of the noncommutative polydomains and varieties,  the  operator  algebras generated by  the corresponding  universal model operators,  and the noncommutative  analytic function theory  on  these  polydomains. Moreover, this study is anchored in classical  complex function theory in  several variables and in  complex algebraic geometry. The project focuses  on the following problems:  classification of noncommutative  polydomains and varieties up to free biholomorphic equivalence and  the classification of the associated  universal algebras up to completely  isometric isomorphisms;  universal models, invariant subspaces, and commutant lifting; unitary invariants on noncommutative polydomains (e.g., the curvature, the Euler characteristic,  and  the entropy); hyperbolic geometry  on noncommutative polyballs;  free holomorphic   functions on polydomains; free holomorphic self-maps of noncommutative balls and composition operators.",
