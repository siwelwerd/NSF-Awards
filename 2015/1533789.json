 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to support a Doctoral Consortium (workshop) of approximately 6 promising graduate students from the United States, along with a panel of about 5 distinguished research faculty mentors.  The event will take place in conjunction with the ACM 2015 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2015), which is sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (SIGCHI) and will be held April 18-23 in Seoul, Republic of Korea.  The annual CHI conference is the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice, and is attended by approximately 2,500 HCI professionals from around the world.  Research reports published in the CHI Conference Proceedings and the CHI Extended Abstracts are heavily-refereed and widely cited; they are among the most scientifically respected and impactful research publications in the field of HCI.  More information about the conference is available at http://chi2015.acm.org.  The annual CHI doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of HCI researchers, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Applications are encouraged from all doctoral students whose research is HCI-related, regardless of the fields in which they are earning their degrees.  In accordance with CISE policy regarding conferences held abroad, NSF funds will be used solely to support participation by students enrolled in graduate programs in the United States.  As an expression of their commitment to diversity among the student participants, the event organizers have undertaken that only one student per school will be accepted, except in the case where including a second student from the same school would allow a woman to be a participant.\r\n\r\nThe Doctoral Consortium is a research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the CHI conference since 1986, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers.  Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will then have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the research field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference.  Student participants will make formal presentations of their research during the workshop, and will receive feedback from the faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Student participants will present their work to the doctoral consortium on April 18-19, with follow up activities planned during the technical program of the conference.  Extended abstracts of the students' work will be published in the CHI 2015 Extended Abstracts.  SIGCHI's conference management committee will evaluate the doctoral consortium, and the results will be made available to the organizers of future consortia.  The CHI doctoral consortia have been highly successful in providing a forum for the initial socialization into the field of young doctoral scholars; many of today's leading HCI researchers participated as students in earlier consortia.",
