 "awd_abstract_narration": "Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) have become understood and widely used in technical fields, especially those relating to information security and privacy, as necessary to protect human subjects in computer studies.  However, IRBs do not address all issues.  This workshop explores the notion of a broader ethical review procedure in white papers, opinion pieces, and public comments. This multidisciplinary workshop develops how organizations can develop ethical review boards for data uses outside the Common Rule.\r\n\r\nThe workshop considers how ethical guidelines, based on the foundational Belmont principles for human subject research, can help entities make careful decisions to balance data experimentation against risks to individual privacy and civil liberties broadly. It surveys lessons drawn from the medical research ethics community and existing institutional review boards (IRBs). The purpose of this workshop is to bring together experts in academia and industry, as well as ethicists, privacy officials, and government regulators, to develop a blueprint for ethical reviews for computer science research, and provide guidance to those who might seek an ethical opinion to engage in important research, and find a balance to promote research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe FPF Education and Innovation Foundation (FPF EIF) received an award from the National Science Foundation in support of a workshop to address how organizations can develop ethical review boards for data uses outside of the Common Rule and to facilitate further research into ethical review processes associated with Big Data.\n\nIn an age of data abundance, new uses of data are constantly emerging in a wide variety of contexts, including research performed outside of traditional academic institutions.  The lack of ethical guidelines covering the use of data for research purposes in these settings presents concerns about ethics, individual privacy and autonomy.  Left unresolved, it may jeopardize or limit opportunities for research with widely recognized societal benefit.  A solution addressing these concerns involves encouraging the development of ethical review mechanisms to approve and monitor data-driven experimentation.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, FPF EIF convened a workshop, Beyond IRBs: Designing Ethical Review Processes for Big Data Research, on December 10, 2015, at the Future of Privacy Forum offices in Washington, DC.  More than 65 researchers, including lawyers, computer scientists, ethicists and philosophers, as well as policymakers from government, industry and civil society, came together to discuss methods for infusing ethical considerations into organizational processes in a data rich environment.  The workshop was designed to produce thought leadership moving beyond existing ethical frameworks and IRB structures to adopt flexible, scalable processes that can be readily deployed in business or government settings, and to advance specific, practical guidelines for researchers and project managers who seek to incorporate ethical reviews into data projects.\n\nAccomplishments and associated outcomes included a Call for Papers that was widely circulated in established academic networks and resulted in submissions and participation by an interdisciplinary group of leading academic and industry voices (see papers and participants at bigdata.fpf.org) and publication of a selection of submitted papers in a special online issue of the Washington &amp; Lee Law Review.  FPF completed a white paper, entitled Beyond IRBs: Ethical Guidelines for Data Research, that set the stage for the workshop and provided a literature review and synthesis of conference papers.  The workshop included keynote presentations by Professor Ryan Calo, University of Washington School of Law, whose concept of consumer subject review boards underlies the Obama Administration\u00c6s proposal of Privacy Review Boards under the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights, and Erin Kenneally, lead author of the Menlo Report for computer and information security research.  It also included operational case studies provided by global industry leaders in healthcare, information technology, and social media.  The workshop provided a first look at a paper describing Facebook\u00c6s process of ethical data review and presentation of a study on how to do privacy-protective internal research at wearables companies that benefits customers and society at large (both subject of a roundtable to be held in June 2016 as one of many special extensions of the workshop).\n\nThe \"Beyond IRBs\" workshop brought the following insights to light, helping shape future discussions, deliverables and outcomes and facilitate further research:  1) Significant work is already taking place in data ethics in different sectors, academic disciplines, industry initiatives, government and business organizations, as well as civil society.  However, the work on data ethics remains confined to separate silos as each sector develops its own approach and with limited, shared visibility.  2) Companies continue to struggle to define the differences between day-to-day product testing and more ethically challenging projects and experiments.  3) Existing legal frameworks in both the United States and European Union already pro..."
