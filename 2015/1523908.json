 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow and a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Christopher J. Schell is \"Cosmopolitan carnivores: An investigation of the behavioral, hormonal, and genetic factors underlying coyote success in urban environments.\"  The host institutions for this fellowship are Colorado State University and the National Wildlife Research Center, and the sponsoring scientists are Drs. Lisa Angeloni (CSU) and Stewart Breck (NWRC). \r\n\r\nHuman-dominated landscapes are consistently expanding.  Landscape conversion and fragmentation are particularly salient for carnivores, as they require large contiguous habitat, have strict dietary needs, and have a low reproductive output.  Nevertheless, various carnivores have adjusted to cope with human-induced environmental change via dietary, activity, and landscape use changes.  Individual behavioral flexibility is considered integral for carnivore urban residency, yet no study to date has quantified this flexibility.  Hormones and genetic variation likely underlie this flexibility; however, no endocrine or genetic data exist.  Coyotes are an excellent model system to quantify the biological consequences of urban residency, as multiple rural and metropolitan areas have established and documented populations.  The fellowship research assesses the relationships among stress hormones, genetic variation, and personality traits of coyotes in the Denver, CO and Los Angeles, CA areas, specifically, how the hormone cortisol (crucial to the biological stress response) and the dopamine receptor D4 gene (linked to heightened activity, impulsivity, and novel-seeking behaviors) co-vary with tolerance and boldness of coyotes from natural to urban habitats.  These data are useful for interpreting the range of behavioral flexibility and other associated biological factors in urban coyotes.\r\n\r\nCareer advancement activities include refining teaching skills. The Fellow is establishing a new scientific outreach program titled \"The REAL Wile E. Coyote,\" an educational series to engage K-12 students in Denver and Los Angeles.  The program combines school visits with a congruent blog site to help dispel long-held fallacies about coyotes in cities and provide students hands-on experience with wildlife biology.  Educational outreach also includes workshops for the annual Diversity Symposium held at CSU, a two-day conference addressing diversity issues to increase participation from under-represented groups in wildlife science.  Public outreach includes presenting research findings at town hall meetings or neighborhood summits in Denver, making the work accessible to an audience not directly familiar with urban carnivores.",

Under the guidance of advisors Drs. Lisa Angeloni (Colorado State University) and Stewart W. Breck (National Wildlife Research Center), we have completed and are working on several impactful projects that emanate from the completion of this NSF postdoctoral fellowship.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The main objective of the study was to determine how individual behavioral flexibility corresponds to the functional and genetic mechanisms that may govern such behaviors in urban coyotes. To that end, we collected and are currently analyzing blood samples from n=38 individuals over a 5-year span, using several candidate gene regions that correlate with activity, boldness, neophobia, and exploration in related canid species. In addition, we are employing novel analytical methods (i.e. Bayesian inference and fine-scale GPS fixation) that can be used to assess consistent individual differences in coyotes as a function of habitat preferences and home range estimation. These novel methods, in combination with the genetic data, are the cornerstone data of two publications in preparation that will be submitted in the first quarter of 2019. Moreover, we anticipate that these data will be broadly applicable to other systems and species, as an effective means of determining behavioral type from remotely acquired data has been a leading yet unanswered question in wildlife biology and ecology. Even further, out of this investigation several fruitful collaborations were made with officials at the University of Edmonton, Lincoln Park Zoo, the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, Fordham University, Princeton University, the University of Wyoming, Portland State University, the University of Puget Sound, and the University of Colorado, Boulder. As a result, we and collaborators from those institutions are composing a high-impact factor manuscript that provides a broad review of urban carnivore ecology research and the potential to integrate urban evolution into the narrative of urban wildlife investigations.&nbsp; That manuscript is slated for submission late December of 2018. We also anticipate submission of a high-impact grant in 2019 for the &ldquo;Rules of Life&rdquo; solicitation to continue work that bridges the fields of genomics, animal behavior, endocrinology, and urban evolutionary biology.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This NSF project has also generated several ancillary projects that have yielded research products. In early 2018, I (Dr. Schell) published a special issue review entitled &ldquo;Urban Evolutionary Ecology and the Potential Benefits of Implementing Genomics&rdquo; in the Journal of Heredity, as a product of co-organizing a postdoc and student-led workshop entitled &ldquo;Genomics of Adaptation to Human Contexts&rdquo; (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/109/2/101/4791166?searchresult=1\">https://academic.oup.com/jhered/article/109/2/101/4791166?searchresult=1</a>). From 2016-2018, we additionally collected occupancy and abundance metrics from the Fort Collins and Denver, CO areas using motion-triggered camera traps under the auspices of the broad research collective, the Urban Wildlife Information Network (UWIN: <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y9rjz2np\">https://tinyurl.com/y9rjz2np</a>). From this wildlife camera project, we have mentored a dozen undergraduate students at Colorado State University, 4 of which are preparing manuscripts and undergraduate theses using data from the UWIN project. Further, the wildlife camera trap project has been integral to outreach efforts in the broader Fort Collins. Specifically, we built a collaborative outreach effort with the Cache La Poudre Middle School and Mrs. Mary Richmond that contained several active-learning lessons on wildlife cameras, data processes, and principles in urban ecology. To that end, we provided Mrs. Richmond a wildlife camera and necessary supplies for students to fully participate in the data collection process.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, this project and its many outcomes helped to propel me to an Assistant Professor position at the University of Washington, Tacoma. Many of the research products generated from this original NSF postdoctoral fellowship are serving as the foundation for future investigations and project proposals that will investigate the environmental factors contributing to urban mesocarnivore behavior in the Pacific Northwest. Much of the efforts in Colorado are being replicated in Tacoma and Seattle with the help of staff and researchers at the Point Defiance Zoo &amp; Aquarium. Moreover, through the University of Washington, I plan to initiate a multi-city investigation with many of the institutions listed above to serve as a project that is both intellectually sound and community-inspired. Thus, my ongoing products and future endeavors have been profoundly shaped by the results and experiences generated from this NSF fellowship.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/15/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christopher&nbsp;J&nbsp;Schell</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523908/1523908_10390947_1539637683096_2016-10-1110.41.54--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523908/1523908_10390947_1539637683096_2016-10-1110.41.54--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Coyote Capture &amp; GPS collaring\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523908/1523908_10390947_1539637683096_2016-10-1110.41.54--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Coyote Capture &amp; GPS collaring\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Christopher Schell (right) labels sample bags for hair collection and blood sampling for genetic analysis, as researcher Dave (left) checks the vitals of the anesthetized individual</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Christopher J Schell</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;J&nbsp;Schell</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Coyote Capture & GPS collaring</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523908/1523908_10390947_1539637942501_CacheLaPoudre_OutreachPhotos_Fall2016--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523908/1523908_10390947_1539637942501_CacheLaPoudre_OutreachPhotos_Fall2016--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UWIN Fort Collins Outreach\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523908/1523908_10390947_1539637942501_CacheLaPoudre_OutreachPhotos_Fall2016--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UWIN Fort Collins Outreach\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Working with Cache La Poudre Middle School students on the basics of motion-triggered cameras and their effectiveness in noninvasive bio-monitoring of wildlife in their neighborhood</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mary Richmond</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;J&nbsp;Schell</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UWIN Fort Collins Outreach</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523908/1523908_10390947_1539638364568_DenverMuseumNatureScience_Photoshoot_2017--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523908/1523908_10390947_1539638364568_DenverMuseumNatureScience_Photoshoot_2017--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Collaboration with the Denver Museum of Nature and Science\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523908/1523908_10390947_1539638364568_DenverMuseumNatureScience_Photoshoot_2017--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Collaboration with the Denver Museum of Nature and Science\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Schell posing with a prepared coyote pelt at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science.
