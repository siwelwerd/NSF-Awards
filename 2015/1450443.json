 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a project from Howard University that establishes an I-Corps Site with Hampton University. NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\nThe Howard University I-Corps Site is a novel partnership involving two Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), with assistance from the DC I-Corps Node, a regional I-Corps node supporting the DC-MD-VA region. The partnership supports enhanced participation of HBCU students and faculty from Howard and Hampton universities in technology transfer and venture creation by leveraging DC I-Corps' expertise in the Lean Launch Pad philosophy and curriculum. DC I-Corps benefits from the Site's regional alignment to accelerate the participation of African-Americans in future I-Corps Node cohorts thereby enhancing diversity. I-Corps activities on each campus and assessment of these targeted programs also informs strategies for improving innovation and entrepreneurship interventions aimed at under-represented minorities (URM) and enhance ongoing educational research.\r\n\r\nThese institutions are uniquely positioned among the HBCUs to undertake this effort. Both institutions are among the inaugural cohort of HBCUs participating in the HBCU Innovation and Entrepreneurship Collaborative (IEC) organized by the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU) to stimulate innovation activity on HBCU campuses. The IEC effort connects HBCUs with best practices to implementing entrepreneurship and innovation activities on campus. These best practices are based on models advocated by Stanford University and the National Collegiate Inventors and Innovators Alliance (NCIIA - recently renamed VentureWell), among others. \r\n\r\nThe partnership between the Howard and Hampton University Site and the DC I-Corps Node allows for greater opportunities to assess diversity as a variable in innovation and entrepreneurship programming interventions targeting under-represented minorities; enhancing fundamental understanding of effective frameworks for LLP education for diverse populations. Additionally, the Site seeks to increase technical entrepreneurship participation among the HBCU faculty and students by focusing on the following activities:\r\n\r\n1.\tIncreasing the training of HBCU faculty and students in Lean Launchpad methodology.\r\n2.\tDeveloping a strong inter-related network of HBCU entrepreneurs with the NSF I-Corps system. \r\n3.\tOrganizing and growing a diverse mentorship network. \r\n4.\tEncouraging applications from in response to NSF I-Corps Regional and National training and/or SBIR solicitations.",
