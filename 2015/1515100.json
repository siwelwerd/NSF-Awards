 "awd_abstract_narration": "Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. Development of new treatment methods has focused on the use of mechanical tools, including mechanical material removal processes to remove plaque. To best develop these processes to fight cardiovascular diseases, researchers must understand the structural changes of the arterial system under similar loading conditions. This award supports research that aims to describe changes in the macro and micro structures of blood vessel tissues experiencing extensile load. The proposed research is innovative in that it uses animal arteries and incorporates the expertise and recently advanced technology of multi-photon microscopy from Dr. Leo Hwa Liang?s Biofluid Mechanics Research Laboratory at the National University of Singapore. In addition to scientific benefits, the project will help a graduate student broaden his interaction with researchers in biomechanical engineering leading center of excellence in Asia. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Singapore.\r\n \r\nDue to the histological inhomogeneity of arterial walls, a study at the microscopic level is important for understanding the nature of the artery and its response to external loading conditions. In this study, aortic arteries will be cut into tensile test samples in longitudinal, circumferential, and angular directions. The samples will be horizontally stretched using a specially-designed tensile tester under a multi-photon microscope. Various changes in the displacement and interactions of each arterial layer will be analyzed in the areas of deformation, stress, and morphology of elastin and collagen fibers. The significance of the results will explain the role of elastin and collagen fibers in responding to in-body and out-body loading conditions. The proposed research will provide better understanding of mechanical loads on the microscopic architecture of the artery for medical device research and development including machining processes for removing arterial plaque.",
