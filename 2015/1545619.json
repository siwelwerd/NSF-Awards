 "awd_abstract_narration": "RAPID: SEDIMENTARY RECORD OF CYCLONE PAM FROM VANUATU: IMPLICATIONS FOR LONG-TERM CYCLONE AND TSUNAMI RECORDS FOR THE SOUTH PACIFIC\r\n\r\nThis proposal is a co-funding effort between the Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology Program/EAR and the East Asia and Pacific Program/OISE/IIA.\r\n\r\nNontechnical explanation of the project:\r\nLand-falling tropical cyclones (TCs) pose an economic and environmental hazard to coastlines of the South Pacific, however, little is known about their long-term variability.  The uncertainty surrounding TC hazards in this region was tragically underscored on 6 March 2015 when TC Pam, one of the most intense storms to impact the South Pacific, made landfall on Vanuatu as a Category 5 cyclone.  Records of past cyclones, developed from the sedimentary deposits they leave behind, improve our understanding of processes and frequency by expanding the age range of events to include centennial and millennial timescales.  However, one of the major obstacles associated with using sedimentary deposits to reconstruct reliable records of past storms is that sediments deposited by land-falling TCs can often be confused with those deposited by tsunamis.  PIs will address this obstacle by comparing the impact and associated sedimentary deposits of TC Pam and the 2009 South Pacific tsunami.  This study is an important step towards improving the assessment of hazard risk for coastlines that are vulnerable to both forms of marine inundation.\r\n\r\nTechnical description of the project:\r\nPIs developed a unique opportunity to compare the impacts of a known storm (TC Pam on Vanuatu in 2015) and tsunami (South Pacific tsunami in 2009) in a region where the event record is fragmentary and incomplete.  A comparison of the impact of TC Pam and the 2009 South Pacific tsunami (previously documented by members of the team) enables an assessment of two extreme events of similar magnitude, but different genesis.  To carry out this comparison PIs will rapidly dispatch a four-person survey team to the islands that sustained the greatest impact (Efate and Tanna in Vanuatu).  They will collect vital physical characteristics of the cyclone?s storm surge (e.g., surge height, inundation distance) and its associated sedimentary deposits (e.g., lithology, thickness, spatial extent).  Through detailed stratigraphic, grain size, and micropaleontological (foraminiferal taxonomy and taphonomy) analyses PIs aim to identify differences in the sedimentary deposits emplaced by these events and that these differences can be used to improve hazard assessment for coastlines impacted by both forms of marine inundation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nLandfalling Category 5 tropical cyclones are rare.  Understanding patterns related to tropical cyclone frequency and intensity is difficult because instrumental records are too short to estimate the potential frequency and intensity of the strongest events, which can occur centuries apart on the same coastline.  Scientists circumvent the short instrumental record by examining the long-term geologic record for evidence of past tropical cyclones.  Geologic records have produced many reconstructions of landfalling tropical cyclones and can be used to assess the risk of future events.  However, a critically important question remains.  Can sedimentary deposits be used to assess the intensity of landfalling tropical cyclones?  Sediments deposited by landfalling storms address this question because they preserve evidence of past events that have occurred over centennial and millennial timescales.  Sedimentological and paleontological proxies provide further information because they indicate how far offshore sediments were transported by storm surge.  More intense events are often associated with higher storm surges and are expected to transport large volumes of sediment from deeper environments offshore.  Less intense events, with lower transport capacity, are expected to transport less material that is predominantly sourced from closer to shore.  However, this can vary from site to site and is dependent on both the sediment available for transport and the bathymetry of the coastal zone.\n\nThis study presents urgent and perishable data, which was rapidly being lost due to post-depositional change, and provides the first modern survey of an intense (Category 5) tropical cyclone impacting the South Pacific islands.  The numerous coastlines that TC Pam impacted span a distance of over 350 km, providing a unique opportunity to assess the environmental impact and associated sedimentary deposit over a large distance.  Our study examined the latitudinal changes in TC Pam sediments and wave heights associated with changes in TC Pam?s track and intensity.\n\nA research team consisting of members from Rutgers, Georgia Tech, University of Southern Mississippi, and the Vanuatu Meteorological and Geo-Hazards Department explored low-lying coastal areas on six islands in Vanuatu in search of sedimentary evidence deposited by TC Pam.  On Efate and Tanna islands we found fresh deposits of TC Pam sediments that extended up to 800 m inland.  These deposits could be discriminated from underlying layers by a sharp basal contact, a reduction in organic matter, and the presence of a thick marine sand bed that contained foraminifera (marine protists).  We discovered that TC Pam sediments deposited over coastal sequences, both of which contain marine-derived sand, could be differentiated by the condition of foraminifera.  While the species present in TC Pam sediments and the underlying layer were often similar, they could be differentiated based on how pristine the foraminifera were.  Foraminifera from underlying layers had signs of reworking, including edge roundness due to abrasion, and chalkiness and pittedness due to exposure to air and humic acid.  Foraminifera from the TC Pam sediments were more pristine, and when fragmented, had edges that were angular indicating breakage by TC Pam surge.  We assessed the provenance of TC Pam sediments using two independent methods: (1) a statistical comparison of modern foraminifera with those from TC Pam sediments, and (2) a sediment transport calculation using measured storm surge flow depths and settling velocities from individual sediment grains.  Each method corroborated the other and indicated that the storm surge associated with TC Pam scoured and transported material from the beach and nearshore environment (up to a depth of 5 m).\n\nThese insights can be applied to older tropical cyclone sediments preserved in the geologic record and will help to determine how best to prepare for future storms.  Our characterization of sediments deposited by a known tropical cyclone in Vanuatu can be used as an analogue for other storm studies that are conducted in tropical environments.\n\nWe have engaged in diverse activities to increase public awareness and education about tropical cyclone hazards.  During fieldwork we met with local village leaders on Matasso Island and addressed villagers during a town meeting, providing information about TC Pam to an otherwise isolated community.  We led a hands-on seminar that educated Matasso Island villagers on the risks associated with tropical cyclones.  Drawing on our experience from other tropical cyclone-impacted regions, we provided local residents with evacuation procedures and safe shelter options. Findings from this study were disseminated at the 4th Girls in Science and Engineering Day held at the Intrepid Sea, Air, and Space Museum in New York City in 2016.  The annual event aims to introduce teens and young women to STEM subjects through presentations and activities provided by local organizations.  We used this opportunity to demonstrate how foraminifera within overwash sediments can be used to establish long-term records of tropical cyclones.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jessica Pilarczyk"
