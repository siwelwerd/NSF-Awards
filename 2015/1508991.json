 "awd_abstract_narration": "The continued scaling of CMOS technology is being driven by various approaches including spin-based electronics (or 'spintronics') due to potential gains in low-power operation, and by the prospect of realizing new forms of non-volatile, on-chip data storage.  However, spintronic devices typically exhibit poor magnetoresistive values, except at cryogenic temperatures, and there are often practical issues regarding their manufacturability. Consequently, the full potential impact of spintronics on technology and society has remained unrealized. The ability to induce a high degree of spin polarization in epitaxially-formed graphene layers, deposited on complex oxides, is a major goal of this research; one that will allow the development of high performance, non-volatile, spin-based devices, capable of operating above room temperature. Social and economic benefits of such advances is huge, allowing not only the continuation of smaller, cheaper, and faster computing, but also making possible the development of massively-parallel, yet low-power and fault-tolerant, computer architectures. Graduate students will be trained in the interdisciplinary aspects of understanding fundamental relationships between surface/interface chemistry, charge and spin transport, and device physics.  This mentoring also extends to the recruitment of undergraduate and high school students through existing, proven programs at the University of Buffalo, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and at the University of North Texas.\r\n\r\nIn the interest of a new generation of post-CMOS nanoelectronics, technological challenges of spintronic devices include achieving high-fidelity spin-polarized carrier injection into a nonmagnetic semiconductor, and; realization of electrical schemes for the manipulation of magnetism while not compromising the possible energy gains offered by spintronics. This program provides a solution by realizing practical, graphene-based spintronic devices, based on industry-compatible graphene growth methods and operating at or above room temperature. These devices feature directly-grown, high-quality graphene on magnetic/multiferroic oxide substrates, and will exploit the spin polarization induced in the graphene channel through its interaction with the substrate, thereby obviating the need for efficient spin injection from ferromagnetic electrodes. The devices will furthermore be switched by means of the electric field applied across insulating oxides, thereby ensuring low-power operation. This project combines studies of the interfacial-chemistry of graphene/oxide hetero-junction formation, its effects on graphene spin polarization, and the development and testing of spin-field effect transistors. These devices are based on the direct growth of graphene/oxide heterojunctions, including Co3O4(111), Cr2O3(0001), and other ordered multiferroic oxides. The goal is to have a fundamental insight into how surface chemistry impacts spin transport, and also to yield manufacturable graphene-based spintronic devices, capable of exhibiting superior per-formance (MR>200%) in operation above room temperature.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutcomes Report\n\n \n\nProgram Objectives and Accomplishments   The continued development of smaller/faster/cheaper Si-based electronics of the last half-century&mdash;with its dramatic impact on all aspects of modern life, is coming to an end.  This is due to certain fundamental (quantum physics) and practical (device fabrication) limits to Si microelectronics, where a chip now contains billions of transistors, and individual structures on each chip are approaching the atomic scale.  If new technologies are not introduced, microelectronics will become a cost-driven industry, with elimination or off-shoring of US jobs in research and manufacturing.  Overcoming these limitations requires the introduction of new materials, such as graphene and magnetic oxides, and their fabrication by industrially practical methods into devices with the speed and functionality to replace the Si-based transistor.  The development of devices based on electron spin&mdash;spintronics&mdash;opens a path forward beyond Si.  Graphene is a potentially disruptive material for spintronics as, unlike Si, it allows spins to rapidly travel long distances without collisions that induce spin-depolarization.  The challenge here was to fabricate structures that allow the facile introduction of spins into graphene, and to fabricate such structures in ways practical for industrial-scale production. \n\n                This program combined efforts in materials growth (Kelber, University of North Texas), electronic and magnetic structure (Dowben, University of Nebraska-Lincoln), and device fabrication and testing (Bird, SUNY Buffalo) to grow magnetic oxide thin films and graphene by practical methods.  These efforts benefited strongly from an informal theoretical collaboration (Goddard, Caltech) to interpret experimental results.  Success was achieved in growing thin, well characterized films of cobalt oxide (CoO and Co3O4) and non-magnetic MgO.  Success was also achieved in growing high quality graphene/graphene oxide multilayers on these oxides.  This paves the way for growing magnetic oxide/graphene structures in which interactions between spins in the magnetic oxide and the electrons in the graphene can result in the production of strong spin current, at room temperature.  These structures can then be assembled into devices in which permit control of such spin currents as replacements for the Si transistor.\n\nIntellectual Merit  This interdisciplinary effort demonstrated and explained a route towards the industrial scale preparation of high quality graphene on oxides, using molecular beam epitaxy.  This effort also revealed the materials considerations important to achieving thermally and chemically stable oxide/graphene interfaces for the development of spintronic devices.  Theory was used to predict and explain the electrical properties of these materials.  The experimental and theoretical results are important for the future development of spintronic devices based on these materials.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact   This project supported the education and training of several Ph.D. graduate students and undergraduates, including those of historically underrepresented groups.  Additionally, outreach through the UNT Texas Academy of Math and Sciences (TAMS) supported several high school students and introduced them to graduate-level scientific research.  Those students are now enrolled as undergraduates in science programs at various US Research Universities.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffry A Kelber"
