 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extraordinary mechanical, optical, electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties are possible in materials at the nano-scale. To successfully exploit these useful properties in a wide range of applications, nano-scale features, especially 10 nm and less, must be formed reliably and in a cost-effective manner. Although continuous, roll-to-roll nanoimprinting processes exist for replicating nanofeatures, they are currently limited to ultra violet light curable resins. Additionally, the fidelity of the replication needs considerable improvement.  This collaborative research award supports fundamental research to provide the needed knowledge base for the investigation of continuous imprinting of nano-scale features on any type of thermoplastic polymers, reliably. Thermoplastic polymers with versatile physical and chemical properties are highly desired in numerous disposable devices for applications in energy, healthcare, biomedical, chemical, automotive, telecommunication industries.  It is anticipated that the results of the project will form the scientific basis to facilitate successful transfer of this novel nanomanufacturing technology to industry. The project will augment curriculum development, particularly in the interdisciplinary area of nanomanufacturing. In addition, it will promote teaching, training, and learning through multidisciplinary approaches and broaden the participation of underrepresented groups including women students.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative research uses a multidisciplinary approach to address the need to manufacture cost-effective nanostructures onto extruded film surfaces. The project will study the variotherm extrusion roll imprinting process as a clear path to scalable nanomanufacturing. It will investigate the fabrication of belt molds with micro/nano features from a planar geometry, study a Leonov type continuum-based constitutive model to capture the nonlinear viscoelastic behavior of the polymer film during roll-to-roll nanoimprinting, and perform molecular dynamics simulation to study the nanocavity filling process. Fundamental contributions are anticipated in the nanoscale dynamics of polymer flow and deformation during continuous imprinting. Specifically, the research will advance understanding of boundary effects (including wall slip) on micro/nano deformation, dynamics of polymer chains under geometrical confinement, viscoelasticity in size scales below 100 nm, multiscale modeling capabilities for non-equilibrium deformation of macromolecules, and control of thermomechanical history in nanofabrication.",

The process can be used for imprinting any thermoplastic polymers, such as polyethylene and polystyrene, thus overcoming the limitation of existing technology that relies on very few expensive, UV curable materials. The grant awarded to UMass has been used to support faculty summer salary, student stipend, and materials and supply. Throughout the project, UMass Amherst led the effort in design of the new fabrication apparatus, process study and optimization, experimental study of drag reduction using assorted micro/nano patterns, and experimental study of surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) using replicated polymer nanopatterns.</p>\n<p>Specifically, the new fabrication process is able to apply an extremely responsive thermo-mechanical history to the imprinting film so that the desired imprinting results can be produced. Through process studies with different micro/nano geometrical patterns, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the new process for pattern transfer onto continuous thermoplastic polymer films. The process can be run continuously at a high speed up to 10 m/min. Mold heating was found to play a major role in achieving high replication fidelity in this continuous production platform. In such a high-speed process, complete fill of nanosized cavities can only be made possible with a hot belt mold.</p>\n<p>We also developed a new process for making a loop-belt nickel mold that is suitable for transferring patterns on delicate substrates such as silicon wafers onto a durable metallic material with high magnetic permeability. Due to the high magnetic permeability, the belt mold can be rapidly heated by induction heating and then rapidly cooled after leaving the imprinting zone.</p>\n<p>We also performed a mechanistic analysis of the nanocavity filling process to identify the major factors affecting the replication fidelity in rapid, continuous production. The focus was placed on determining the major factors to enable cavity fill in an extremely short imprinting period on the order of 1 second. It is found that a high surface energy mold surface is highly preferred for nanocavity filling. Furthermore, a contact pressure must be large enough to overcome the elastic stress of the material at nanoscale. For viscoelastic deformation, a dual-mode fractional viscoelastic model has also been formulated, which has an excellent data fitting capability to dynamic mechanical data of common polymer melts.</p>\n<p>We also conducted research on fabrication of cylinders with different micro/nano structured surfaces suitable for drag reduction measurement. We found that the type of micro/nano pattern and the material at the surface of testing cylinders significantly affect the drag performance. The drag performance is also dependent on the Reynolds number used in the measurement. At the low range of Reynolds number (1500 to 5500), the cylinders patterned with micro/nano structures, in general, perform better than bare cylinders in terms of drag reduction. The cylinders patterned with sharklet features exhibit the most impressive results; the improvement extends to the high Reynolds number range.</p>\n<p>We have additionally conducted research on embossing of polymer replicates containing nano posts for SERS detection of cancer biomarkers. Such SERS substrates can be made in mass quantity using the extrusion roll embossing process. These cost-effect polymer SERS substrates can be used for effective detection of biomarkers for pancreatic, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers.</p>\n<p>The above results are expected to impact significantly in the area of cost-effective micro and nanofabrication. It is envisioned that disposable micro and nano devices can be fabricated cost-effectively through the new process, enabling industry to economically produce important devices for emerging problems such as cancer detection in biotechnology, drag reduction in marine and aerospace industries, as well as emerging problems in telecommunication and energy industries.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/08/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Byung&nbsp;H&nbsp;Kim</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1462154/1462154_10355250_1562553714657_Image1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1462154/1462154_10355250_1562553714657_Image1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Extrusion Roll Imprinting\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1462154/1462154_10355250_1562553714657_Image1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Extrusion Roll Imprinting\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Extrusion Roll Imprinting of High Fidelity Nano-scale Features on Continuously Moving Substrates</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">B.
