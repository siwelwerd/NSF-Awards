 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nighttime thunderstorms with heavy rainfall pose a threat to lives and property in the central United States and are a difficult forecasting challenge.  A field campaign is planned during the summer of 2015 to study how these thunderstorm complexes form and maintain themselves.  This award will augment that campaign by providing observations from an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) platform.  The UASs will fly in targeted locations near a frontal boundary and in the vicinity of thunderstorms, making measurements that will be input into a computer model.  The overall goal of the project is to improve understanding and forecasting of these hazardous events.  In addition, the project will contribute to scientific workforce development through the education and training of a graduate and undergraduate student and the involvement of a number of other students in the field work.\r\n\r\nThe Program for Research on Elevated Convection with Intense Precipitation is an ongoing project with a goal of characterizing the processes responsible for creating environments conducive to the development and maintenance of organized elevated deep convection.  UAS observations will be assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting model to address the goals of the project by improving the representation of:  1) the airmass upstream of the synoptic scale front, 2) mesoscale lifting mechanisms such as Kelvin-Helmholtz billows and gravity waves within and above the synoptic-scale cold airmass, and 3) the structure of storm-generated outflow within the cold air.  The researchers involved in this award will take the lead on assessing the impact of UAS observations on model forecasts and testing strategies for targeting observations to produce the largest gains in forecast skill.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUniversity of Nebraska-Lincoln researchers participated in the Program for Research on Elevated Convection with Intense Precipitation (PRECIP) with the goal of collecting observations of stationary fronts using unmanned aircraft and a mobile mesonet (an instrumented ground-based vehicle).  Many heavy rainfall and flash flooding events are associated with training thunderstorms with intense rainfall rates on the cool side of the boundary.  The goal was to identify mechanisms that are responsible for increasing the instability on the cool side of the front, and to collect data that cannot easily be obtained with radiosondes, fixed-site stations, and other conventional observing systems.  Despite the absence of targetable elevated convection events during the life of the award, data were still collected on two events that provided unique opportunities to investigate the processes responsible for atmospheric destabilization on the cool side of frontal boundaries and to determine how aircraft observations might improve the accuracy of thunderstorm forecasts.\n\nThe first deployment occurred on June 20, 2016 and targeted a cold front in northwest Kansas.  Multiple frontal transects were executed by the UNL mobile mesonet.  These near-surface observations revealed the presence of a mesoscale airmass with high-theta-e (MAHTE).  MAHTEs are narrow regions on the cool-side of airmas boundaries (e.g., fronts and thunderstorm outflow boundaries) that, despite being cooler than the across-boundary airmass are characterized by higher water vapor and higher conditional instability compared to the warmer across-boundary airmass.  The observations of June 20 represent the first time that high-fidelity observations have been collected across a MAHTE along a synoptic-scale airmass boundary.  Analysis of the data revealed that the MAHTE was ~40 km wide which appears to be substantially larger than previously-documented MAHTEs.  Moreover, conditional instability estimates based on these data indicate more than triple the potential energy available to thunderstorms within the MAHTE than in the warm across-boundary airmass  Although thunderstorms were not observed in association with this MAHTE, any thunderstorms encountering the MAHTE would likely have experienced significant intensification.\n\nA second deployment was conducted on June 28, 2016 in western Nebraska.  Two east-to-west flights of approximately 60 km in length were conducted in advance of developing thunderstorms over southeast Wyoming and a complex of severe thunderstorms which developed near the Black Hills and moved southeast through western Nebraska in the evening.  Aircraft observations revealed variations in temperature and moisture that were not present in the forecast models that day.  Given the proximity of the observed features to incipient thunderstorms, it is conceivable that their resolution might improve model-based forecasts of this event.  In fact, forecast models generally failed to accurately respreent the areal coverage and propagation of the simulated thunderstorms.  Research continues in an effort to assess the potential impact of these observations on forecast model accuracy.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/13/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adam L Houston"
