 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the conditions under which past experiences of protracted risk influence local assessments and policy formulation. Risk is a theme of growing importance both for the sciences and within social and political life, most typically used to describe an orientation toward the future as something open to human intervention. Most risk assessment analyses rely on data from contexts where risk is experienced as a single event from which a set of costs and benefits are to be assessed. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, asks how understandings of risk assessment vary in contexts with a long history of risk management. Findings from this case study will further contribute to public understandings of risk distribution and its implications for public health, policy discussions regarding environmental regulation, and ongoing educational efforts in Baltimore (where the researcher will involve students in the research process and contribute research materials to local archives).\r\n\r\nGeorge Washington University graduate student Chloe Ahmann (under the direction of Dr. Joel Kuipers) will study one Baltimore City community where residents are debating the construction of a trash-burning incinerator in order to understand, first, how past exposure to toxins affects individuals' experience of risk and, second, how such experience can motivate collective mobilization. South Baltimore City has been a site of risk management since the 19th century, from quarantining lepers during the \"great wave\" of immigration to supporting nuclear deterrence with its Cold War chemical holdings. These operations have left significant marks on both land and local health. Today, the region is the planned site of the nation's largest incinerator. While political representatives have supported the project as an \"acceptable risk\" on the path toward energy independence, residents have responded by invoking their historical exposure to risk. In order to understand the historical and toxicological motivations for this, the researcher will conduct both archival and ethnographic research, by (1) tracing histories of risk management that have affected south Baltimore and interrogating their cumulative effects and (2) exploring how residents use this history to make political claims in the present. In doing so, her project will not only contribute to research on environmental justice movements, but will also increase understandings of how history influences experiences of risk more generally (for example, in health, security, and finance). The project will rely on methodological frameworks grounded in actor network theory and new social movement, and make use of conventional methods of ethnographic data collection and analysis, including participant observation within the Baybrook community, oral history, and semi-structured interviews.",
