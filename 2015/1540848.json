 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program, the University of Missouri-Saint Louis (UMSL) Noyce Scholars: Building Excellence in STEM Talent (BEST) Program is recruiting Noyce STEM Teaching Scholars in the sciences and mathematics.  The project is funding 21 scholarships (graduate tuition and stipend) over 5 years. The 21 newly certified STEM teachers will have a masters' degree upon graduation. In this project, UMSL is collaborating with St. Louis Public School district, Ferguson-Florissant school district, and the Hazelwood school district, as well as a local biotechnology business partner, Sigma-Aldrich. The goal of the project is to increase the recruitment and retention of high-quality, culturally-conscious science and mathematics teachers. \r\n\r\nThe project is founded on an existing collaboration between STEM professors and the College of Education (COE), to prepare highly effective secondary teachers with deep content preparation through the UTEACH program and pedagogical preparation in the COE's clinical program, into the first two induction years. The UMSL BEST program is informed by theories of cultural competence, responsive design, problem-based education and professional learning theory. UMSL BEST is improving the preparation and effectiveness of secondary STEM educators through two additions to its existing certification and master's degree program.  The first is a STEM InnoLab in which teacher candidates, along with experienced educators, teacher educators and community leaders, meet, design, and develop new instructional designs tailored to the needs and interests of students. The second addition is a partnership with the local biotech business partner Sigma-Aldrich, which is tightening connections between the STEM high school curriculum and career pathways, as well as with the Next Generation Science Standards and the Common Core Math Standards. Research is being conducted on the effectiveness of the Noyce specific components and the results are informing a sustainable model for the preparation of future STEM teachers. The PI team is using mixed methods data collecting techniques: in addition to the COE assessment system, interviews, surveys, and meta-analysis of classroom observation data will be used.  The results will inform teacher preparation programs nationwide in best practices to recruit, prepare, and retain culturally-conscious teachers for high-needs schools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutcomes of the UMSL BEST Noyce Scholarship Program\n\nThe University of Missouri-St. Louis College of Education  accomplished the four goals identified in their 2015 Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program application primarily through several adaptations.  The UMSL CoE Scholars Building Excellence in STEM Talent (BEST) project adapted their proposed NOYCE program design through methods of collaboration and mentoring.  Together these factors produced three significant outcomes &ndash; the development of Collaborative, Community- and Project-based (CCAP-based) Curriculum Design, peer mentoring and mentor-produced STEM playbooks for elementary, middle and high school. \n\nThe UMSL BEST faculty learned through engaging and listening to the participating NOYCE scholars that the STEM teacher preparation and professional development were in need of innovation.   The UMSL BEST program addressed this through the development of peer mentors and playbooks that provided the NOYCE scholars with support and teaching materials specifically focused on the STEM disciplines.\n\nUMSL BEST Scholars Professional Seminar\n\nIn addition to the regular curriculum for a master\u2019s degree in secondary education, the UMSL BEST faculty developed the UMSL BEST Scholars Professional Seminar.  The seminar was first offered in the Spring 2016 semester.  The seminar accomplished two key outcomes.  First, it created a professional learning community of pre-service and early career in-service STEM teachers in high-needs schools.  The seminar provided the time and space for these teachers to collaborate and network resulting in better informed and more confident STEM teachers in high-needs schools. Second, the seminar proved to be an effective means of communication between the resources afforded by the UMSL BEST faculty and the grant-supported scholars.   \n\nPeer Collaboration\n\nThere were two forms of peer collaboration in the UMSL BEST Scholars Professional Seminar:\n\n1.     Scholars would present a STEM lesson design of their own interest and classmates would provide systematic feedback.  Each scholar would then videotape themselves teaching the lesson and classmates would provide feedback on the lesson as taught.  Peer feedback on teaching videos resulted in scholars changing their practice.\n\n2.     Scholars collaborated on community-based curriculum designs to improve the connection between STEM in the classroom and STEM applied in the community.\n\nCommunity Collaboration\n\nUMSL BEST adapted its original program design by adding four community partnerships in Year 3 which enhanced their community-based approach: Green St. Louis Machine, Mathews-Dickey Boys\u2019 and Girls\u2019 Club, Straw Hat Aquaponics, and Seeds of Hope urban farm.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNoyce Conference Collaboration\n\nThe UMSL BEST Scholars Professional Seminar was effective as a mechanism for developing project posters which were utilized for dissemination of information about good STEM teaching practices.  The UMSL BEST Scholars between years 1 and 2 identified a project that could result in lesson plans that could cross their disciplines (sciences, engineering, math) and reach into the communities in which high need schools are located.  These projects, with implementation data, were disseminated through the Noyce Midwest Regional conferences.\n\nSTEM Playbooks\n\nIn Year 5 UMSL BEST faculty supported the need expressed by scholars that STEM pre-service and in-service teaches did not have access to lesson plan development guides that enabled them to effectively incorporate the three dimension of learning (3D) in Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).  UMSL BEST faculty, instead of working with mentor teachers, recruited three STEM leaders to prepare elementary, middle and high school level playbooks to be implemented with teacher mentors in districts across the state.\n\nThe playbooks were structured as meta-resources, incorporating and referring teachers to the discrete materials on each topic.  The playbooks were designed for the 1st year teacher, but they quickly discovered that in smaller districts without curriculum coordinators or science-supportive administration, in-service teachers need as much assistance as the pre-service teachers.\n\nNear-Peer Mentoring\n\nAnother innovation of the UMSL BEST program originated in a discussion during the Scholars Professional Seminar where it was noted that it\u2019s not always clear how to adapt general teaching strategies to STEM lessons.  UMSL BEST faculty supported a proposal for four in-service STEM teachers/NOYCE scholars to prepare a 90-minute presentation for pre-service STEM teachers. The four presenters all stated the basic idea of the presentation was to provide the pre-service STEM teachers with insights and guidance on the differences between teacher education, generally, and what they will experience in their first year as an in-service STEM teacher.\n\nCollaboration was again the characteristic of the development of this STEM presentation for pre-service teachers.  The four presenters started working as a support group, helping each other develop the content of the presentation.  They all agreed on the organizing idea of STEM teachers reaching out to STEM teachers.  The issue of STEM teacher \u2018isolation\u2019 was present in most of the Scholars\u2019 first year teaching.  In many cases a STEM teacher is the only STEM teacher in the building or when there are other STEM teachers they are of different disciplines. The Peer Mentoring program has created a network of near-peers for beginning STEM teachers to access.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Phyllis Balcerzak"
