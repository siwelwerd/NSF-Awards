The funds sought in this proposal will be used to defray travel and registration costs for approximately 10 graduate and undergraduate students from United States institutions.\r\n\r\nThe catalyst symposium and related talks will provide students an opportunity to learn about the most recent advances in the field of catalysis, as well as emerging areas of research and technological interest.  They will also have an opportunity to present their own research findings and discuss results with other students and established experts in the field.  Catalysis is an important enabling technology for many pressing economic and societal needs, including energy sustainability, chemical manufacturing and petroleum refining, shale gas processing, and environmental protection.  Conference participation will help train the next generation of catalytic scientists and engineers, and also inspire undergraduate students to pursue careers in the area of catalysis, thus ensuring a well-trained workforce to meet growing demands in the catalysis area.",
