 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybrid zones are areas where the distribution of two distinct species overlap, allowing the species to exchange genes in the area of contact. The width of hybrid zones can provide important insights into the process of speciation, and in particular how species remain distinct in the face of ongoing gene flow. The work will leverage the power of next-generation sequencing to quantify gene flow and the permeability of thousands of genes across three hybrid zones between divergent lineages in the widespread Bynoe?s gecko (Heteronotia binoei). This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Craig Moritz, a world renowned expert in the field of evolutionary biology, at Australia National University in Canberra, Australia. The biogeographic history of Australia plays an important role in understanding the mechanisms of biotic diversification in arid regions, and this project will contribute insights into how lineages diverge during the dynamic climatic environments of the Pliocene and Pleistocene.\r\n\r\nSpeciation is a fundamental process in biology and understanding the mechanisms that promote and/or limit biotic diversification has been a core theme in evolutionary science. Hybrid zones are regions where two closely-related species exchange genetic material and thus demonstrate that while reproductive isolation is not necessary for speciation, important biotic and abiotic variables prevent the complete merging of the divergent lineages. This project leverages the power of next-generation sequencing, an emerging model system of diversification in Australia (Heteronotia), and a strong international alliance to impart insights into speciation processes, a primary goal in evolutionary biology. Those loci with steep clines and smaller widths may represent genes important to adaptation.  By incorporating exome data using next-generation sequencing, this project includes a genome-wide functional perspective on understanding the dynamics of speciation, highlighting the exceptional value that genomics has on understanding natural history.\r\n\r\nThis NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.",
