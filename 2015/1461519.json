 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the body of knowledge about the importance and conduct of undergraduate research experiences in recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals. The connection of faculty to research, which connects students to culturally and geographically relevant research, is an important step in engaging students who are more likely to pursue advanced degrees. For those students entering the workforce directly from a tribal college, it is equally important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce. \r\n\r\nDine' College will implement several new degrees or certificates in relevant STEM fields.  These are:  a Bachelor of Science degree in environmental science (the college currently offers an AS degree, which would be expanded with upper division coursework and additional faculty); Bachelor of Arts degrees in math and science secondary education; an Associate of Science degree in pre-engineering; and certification programs in natural resources/GIS and in computer technology.  The intellectual merit of the proposed work is found in the expertise of the key leaders, the impressive faculty credentials that will be brought to bear on the degree and program development, and the alignment of the project goals with STEM workforce opportunities and the goals of the nation and the college.  Additionally, the project evaluation plan will provide insight into effective strategies for community colleges that seek to strengthen instructional capacity in STEM.",

These programs were three Bachelor of Science degrees, in Biology, Science Education, and Math Education. Three other programs are an Associate of Science in Pre-Engineering, and two Certificates, in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and in Computer Technology. This grant also supported undergraduate research positions, one for each of the 6 academic programs each year, and 15 research interns each summer in a 10-week program, mentored by professional scientists. Students worked on various projects during the academic year and summers, usually research projects that were related to unique circumstances on the Navajo Reservation. Examples of research areas worked on by our TCUP-supported student research interns are uranium mine remediation projects with USGS and other scientists, such as watershed pollution (water, soil, plants) and livestock tissue of sheep, goats or cows, for uranium contamination; pollution remediation and education on the Reservation, with oversight by CDC and USGS scientists, focusing on Brownsfield areas of pollution (gas stations, lumber mills, etc.); Food Energy Water (FEWS) grant research with University of Arizona scientists, featuring construction and testing and implementation of solar powered water filtration units for household use and community use, automated greenhouse technology, and focus on solar energy technology; science education programming such as math circles and math mentor circles; also tutoring in computer tech and math; Navajo Nation Fish and Wildlife research, on trout fish hatchery methods, and mortality and disease studies on deer and big horn sheep; National Park Service (NPS) research at Canyon De Chelly (CDC) studying various species&rsquo; counts and activity: bats, spotted owls, black bear; Also NPS CDC invasive plant species inventory and remediation, specifically for tamarisk and Russian olive. Many students report to us that the summer program, particularly, was an important educational experience that stood out as pivotal in their undergraduate studies, and important in their career ideas and decisions. Another important effect of this grant was on the entire STEM program at the College, stimulating higher intellectual and experiential inquiry beyond the two-year Associate of Science degree learning typical in the STEM programs prior to beginning the three BS programs. Furthermore, the advancing of higher-level STEM degrees had a significant stimulating effect on other areas of STEM programming &ndash; such as influencing the creation of three additional BS degrees not long afterwards (Public Health, Agriculture, Biomedical). Additionally, the other academic areas in the College as a whole were stimulated by the TCUP grant activities, inspiring them to create other BA degrees at virtually the same time as the three TCUP BS degrees. Examples of these were in Psychology, Education, Dine&rsquo; Studies, and Fine Arts. Perhaps the greatest long-term achievement of this grant towards evolving the academic programming at Dine&rsquo; College is the stimulatory effect it had to create the next TCUP ICE-TI grant, the MS Biology grant, which has created and implemented the successful Master of Science in Biology program at Dine&rsquo; College. The underlying research laboratories, hiring of research faculty, and money to support faculty and student intern wages, lab equipment, and conference attendance, was instrumental in creating one of the few graduate programs now operating in Tribal Colleges nation-wide.
