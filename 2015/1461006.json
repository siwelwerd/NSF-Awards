 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PIs have been granted an NSF award to implement an REU Site focused on Sustainable Land and Water Resources. The goal of this REU Site will be to introduce undergraduate students to key elements of research on land and water resources essential to improving management practices, with a focus on Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) and diverse interdisciplinary research teams. Students, divided into three teams, will conduct research that integrates Earth-surface dynamics, geology, hydrology and other disciplines. Research teams will be hosted by two Native American communities (Confederated Salish Kootenai Tribes and Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa) and the University of Minnesota to work on projects developed in collaboration with the tribes' resource management divisions. This REU Site will incorporate an interdisciplinary team-oriented approach that emphasizes quantitative and predictive methods, CBPR, indigenous research methods, and traditional ecological knowledge. The REU Site will encourage participation by underrepresented students and students who are unsure about how they fit into the world of science to pursue STEM careers. The PIs expect that at least 75% of the participants will be from groups underrepresented in STEM and 50% will be women. Approximately half of the participants will be students who would not otherwise participate in undergraduate research, such as non-traditional students (which includes parents, married students, and older students). The REU Site also will encourage veterans and students with disabilities to apply. Participants will enhance the diversity of the future geoscience workforce; for example, 20 students from the previous REU Site have received degrees in the geosciences. Of these, 9 are in graduate school, 6 have transferred from their 2-year program to a 4-year STEM program, and 5 are working in the geosciences or a related field. The other 31 participants are still undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nThe REU Site will develop a new paradigm for undergraduate research incorporating place-based and community-based participatory research. The PIs are building knowledge on increasing participation in REUs by the non-traditional students and students from groups underrepresented in STEM. The PIs have developed a proven, structured, scaffolded method of teaching science research and writing, which takes students who may have never written a technical research paper and provides them the skills and support needed to routinely deliver high quality intellectual outputs and increase their intellectual self-confidence in the process. The mentoring plan for the REU Site is focused on helping mentors to: a) prepare to mentor highly diverse teams of students; b) support mentors to deal with the expectations, issues and challenges that arise when you are mentoring teams that have a large number of nontraditional students; and c) help mentors get acculturated to conducting research on tribal lands and with Native people. The students, faculty, graduate and post-doctoral mentors, tribal professionals and other community members will be intimately engaged in CBPR, developing projects that will inherently support tribal resource management goals. Results will be disseminated to tribal authorities and community members as well as the broader scientific community. Outcomes of this REU research paradigm will concurrently establish a legacy of broader scientific capacity within reservation communities and provide pathways to scientific discoveries with a shared foundation of trust and respect.",

Students were advised by a multi-institutional and multidisciplinary team of researchers associated with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, the Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa, Salish Kootenai College (SKC), the National Center for Earth-surface Dynamics (NCED), University of Minnesota (UMN), and the University of Minnesota, Duluth (UMD).

Participants participate in a full day seminar on indigenous research and community-based participatory research during orientation to enable them to make connections between their research and local communities? needs and interests and to help them articulate the social relevance of their research projects. Projects are multidisciplinary and are designed in collaboration with local tribes. Student projects at Fond du Lac (FDL) have focused on hydrology and water quality in lakes that produce wild rice, a plant that is nutritionally and culturally significant to the Ojibwe. Research projects have examined the impact of sulfides and sulfates on plant health. Data about these relationships provide tribal and non-tribal officials with important information about impacts of mining in Minnesota. Team SPAW (Salish and Pend D?Oreille Aboriginal Watershed) projects have included habitat characterizations surrounding the culturally significant plant species <em>Camassia quamash </em>(Blue Camas) and Wild Huckleberries. These characterizations include study of soils, associated plant communities, pollinators, macro-invertebrates, reptiles, amphibians, birds, large and small mammals including bears and bats, water quality, invasive species, disturbance and land use practices, and many other land and water resource issues. Team Stream has focused on issues of sediment transport related to stream restoration and debris flow prediction problems using state of the art facilities at UMN?s St. Anthony Falls Laboratory (SAFL) for computational modeling development. In general, Team Stream projects have not had a direct connection to the reservations. However, in 2017, Team Stream partnered with FDL, to develop a project focused on Spirit Island, an island in Spirit Lake, which is an estuary of the St. Louis River that drains into Lake Superior. This island was newly acquired by FDL in 2016. It is one of the most culturally-significant sacred sites for the Ojibwe people. The tribe is concerned about the continued existence of the island because of shoreline erosion and changes to current patterns in the Lake Superior Estuary. Researchers at SAFL have been working with the tribe to develop a computer model of the problem. A new REU project using complementary physical modeling was developed in conjunction with this research.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts:</p>\n<p>The REU-SLAWR is developing new approaches to undergraduate research that focus on place-based projects that are relevant to students and their communities. In addition, we are working to adapt the experience to be inclusive of students who would not normally participate, including the non-traditional student, parents, students who are tied to their communities for cultural reasons, or students who are caring for ailing parents.
