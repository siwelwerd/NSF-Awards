 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will build on well-documented evidence-based teaching practices to improve STEM education at this college through extensive professional development and support for STEM faculty members. The focus of the project is on redesigning eight gateway courses. The project will offer similar professional development and support to K-12 STEM teachers from eight partner school districts. These activities are in support of the ultimate goal of developing partnerships with business, higher education, and research institutions regionally to improve STEM education outcomes in its service area and to consolidate the regional STEM network. This connected approach to institutional transformation is novel. Within the local pipeline of STEM interested students, it has the promise of smoothing the transition for students from high school (where they will be better prepared for college) into highly effective lower division courses in college.  \r\n\r\nThe project will assess the impact of these project on student success in STEM courses.",
