 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this work is to generate new fundamental science that enables the operation of cyber-physical systems through complex\r\nenvironments. Predicting how a system will behave in the future requires more computing power if that system is complex. Navigating\r\nthrough environments with many obstacles could require significant computing time, which may delay the issue of decisions that have to be\r\nmade by the on-board algorithms. Fortunately, systems do not always need the most accurate model to predict their behavior. This project\r\ndevelops new theory for deciding between the best model to use when making a decision in real time. The approach involves switching between different predictive models of the system, depending on the computational burden of the associated controller, and the accuracy\r\nthat the predictive model provides. These tools will pave the way for more kinds of aircraft to navigate closely and safely with one another through the National Air Space (NAS), including Unmanned Air Systems (UAS).\r\n\r\nThe results from this project will enable more accurate and faster trajectory synthesis for controllers with nonlinear plants, or\r\nnonlinear constraints that encode obstacles. The approach utilizes hybrid control to switch between models whose accuracy is normalized\r\nby their computational burden of predictive control methods. This synergistic approach enables computationally-aware cyber-physical\r\nsystems (CPSs), in which model accuracy can be jointly considered with computational requirements. The project advances the knowledge on\r\nmodeling, analysis, and design of CPSs that utilize predictive methods for trajectory synthesis under constraints in real-time cyber-physical systems.\r\n\r\nThe results will include methods for the design of algorithms that adapt to the computational limitations of autonomous and\r\nsemi-autonomous systems while satisfying stringent timing and safety requirements. With these methods come new tools to account for\r\ncomputational capabilities in real-time, and new hybrid feedback algorithms and prediction schemes that exploit computational\r\ncapabilities to arrive at more accurate predictions within the time constraints. The algorithms will be modeled in terms of hybrid\r\ndynamical systems, to guarantee dynamical properties of interest. The problem space will draw from models of UAS in the NAS.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, we generated new fundamental science for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs).  The new science establishes the foundations of Computationally Aware Cyber-Physical Systems.  The results from this project enable more accurate and faster trajectory synthesis for controllers applied to nonlinear systems and systems experiencing obstacles that need to be encoded via nonlinear constraints.  The developed tools have been designed, developed, and tested on real-world testbeds.  One of the main testbeds for this research was a robotic CAT vehicle.  CAT vehicle stands for Cognitive and Autonomous Test vehicle.  The underlying vehicle used as the CAT vehicle in this project was a modified Ford Escape Hybrid with ByWire XGV.  To allow the CPS to be computationally aware, the research addressed the interaction and coordination of the models, algorithms, hardware, and programming languages of the systems.  The approach focused on using hybrid control strategies to switch between models whose accuracy was normalized by the computational burden involved in controlling the CPSs in real time.  A major focus of the research developed set-valued model predictive control (MPC) strategies.  MPC is a control strategy that selects the present applied control action based on predicting the future system operation.  Standard MPC strategies were extended by formulating the system model where the state is set-valued and the dynamics are defined by a set-valued map.  Over the duration of this project, this award supported multiple graduate students and lead to numerous publications in book collections, journals, and conference venues.  The results from this project were disseminated to the technical community via workshops and visits to partners (domestic and international) and to the broader community via K-12 outreach, an NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program and competition (using the CAT vehicle), and social media.  This project trained numerous students in future research directions involving software engineering, optimization, prediction, and feedback control for hybrid and cyber-physical systems.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/05/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hal S Tharp"
