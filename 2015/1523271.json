 "awd_abstract_narration": "As today's climate fluctuates and severe weather events occur more frequently, sustainability of resources is a prominent concern, not just of scientists but also of government leaders and the public. Humans have adjusted to climate changes in the past. Why have some of these adjustments been more resilient and sustainable than others? Archaeologists are uniquely positioned to provide insights on sustainability because their studies provide information over many centuries. In some cases, archaeological data permit tracking of the development of human societies from small-scale egalitarian groups to large-scale socially and politically complex societies. Inherent to this transition is reliance on and the sustainability of natural resources, including the development of food storage economies. The long-term trajectory of natural resource use and management in this context is pivotal. Dr. Lee Newsom of the Pennsylvania State University, along with colleagues at the Florida Museum of Natural History, will undertake archaeological research on coastal fisher-gatherer-hunter societies that lived in southern Florida for several millennia. The research emphasizes the role of fuelwood resources as a means to preserve surplus food in an emerging storage economy. This research will examine the influence of a past society on forest resources. Insights into the legacy effects of sustained wood use on the modern forest landscape/seascape, and generally the influence of humans on coastal environments, will be of interest to other academic disciplines and to planners. Mangrove forests are endangered world-wide and this investigation will further inform ecologists about their resilience at the edge of their range. Modern management and conservation of coastal forest resources can benefit from the long-term record, as policy makers consider further habitat disruption and loss from coastal development, sea level rise, and global change. \r\n\r\nThe project focuses on the Calusa Indians and their predecessors in southern Florida, using ethnohistoric records and especially archaeological evidence. The research team will test the hypothesis that the development of a food storage economy was a critical factor underlying cultural complexity, and that fuelwoods from coastal mangrove forests were an indispensable and sustainable natural resource inherent to this process. The team will undertake intensive wood-anatomical analysis of charcoal excavated from archaeological sites in the Calusa core area along the southwest coast, emphasizing the characteristics of the fuel supply, the influence of environmental perturbations on the availability of wood, and the role of human agency and influence over local forest resources. Basic wood data collection will include taxonomic assignments, observations on anatomical variation, age, growth form, and growth rate. The research will incorporate modern forest ecological data and experimental methods to establish the hypothetical limitations of the fuel supply. Relevant paleoecological and archaeological data will provide temporal and cultural resolution. All data can be compared in order to test hypotheses on the effects of sustained fuelwood selection and use, the impact of natural disruptions to the fuel supply, and the potential for management.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Southwestern Florida's Calusa Indians have particular significance among anthropologists as one of the relatively few politically complex societies that developed without reliance on agriculture. The inherent productivity of the subtropical near-shore marine and estuarine environments was fundamental to the growth and development of this society.  Dynamic networks of social interaction with other fisher-forager groups located in the interior Okeechobee, Glades, and East Glades wetlands and coastal keys also contributed to a distinctive and resilient Calusa way of life.\nThis research examined the role of fuelwood as an essential coastal resource upon which the Calusa and their Caloosahatchee culture ancestors relied.  A plentiful supply of wood was needed to fire ceramics and make dugout canoes. It also served as the heat source to cook foods and to prepare paints and resins for various technological and artisanal purposes.  Wood burned as torches and in hearths provided light and warmth during occasional cool fronts when temperatures could drop below freezing.  The central importance of having reliable sources of fuelwood is underscored further by a lack of alternative fuels, such as peat from raised bogs and dung from domestic animals. \nGiven these needs, we hypothesized that over time fuelwood played an increasingly important role in late prehistory as the population increased in the area.  Previous research had shown that Calusa/Caloosahatchee fuelwood reliance concentrated on wood from local mangrove forests and pine woodlands, thus a limited range of trees restricted to shoreline and nearby dune and sand ridges. We questioned whether an increased demand for fuelwood outpaced readily available supplies.  If so, it follows that the Calusa and their predecessors would have had to find the means to cope with limitations on wood supplies, and such coping would have left a temporal, spatial, ecosystemic, and species-specific signature.  Thus, we surmised that the fuelwood supply-and-demand dynamic may have been a factor that contributed to Calusa complexity.  We also posited that any benefits or issues that may have arisen with regard to the fuel supply had corresponding effects on the success of the ongoing fishing enterprise, given that wood was the sole or primary means to preserve fish and shellfish for consumption, storage, and distribution.  Food storage is one of the factors that anthropologists associate with the emergence of complex (nonegalitarian) forager societies like the Calusa.  Therefore, fuelwood may be considered as another means of understanding the cultural processes underlying the development of organizationally complex societies, in this instance the Calusa. \n We analyzed fuelwood remnants, specifically wood charcoal from seven archaeological sites in the Calusa heartland, to investigate fuelwood use over time.  Charcoal samples were used to characterize the fuel supply, recording the species, form (branch, stem), condition (age at harvest, deadwood), and size of the wood.  Our findings were contextualized by published research and our own data collected from local mangrove and pine forests, including individual species and forest ecology, as well as the geospatial organization of the forests.  We also considered the potential impacts of natural disasters such as hurricanes, fires, and freezes on local forest resources.  Finally, we examined relevant research on the resilience and sustainability of mangrove wood use by people living in coastal environments and, more generally, the modern charcoal production industry emphasizing mangroves. \nOur results show that coastal mangrove and pine forests in southwestern Florida were resilient in the context of sustained wood extraction pressure by the local Native American community over three to four millennia, even in view of archaeologically documented disturbance from at least one major and devastating hurricane.  The presence of the primary species on which the Calusa and their predecessors relied (pine and black mangrove) was consistent throughout the sample, and mangroves were especially conspicuous in the charcoal assemblages from barrier islands.  Nevertheless, we did isolate some evidence of spatially and temporally limited variation in the range of species used, and we recorded two shifts in fuelwood diameters and a late shift at one site in pine growth ring widths.  These observations may suggest short-term and perhaps spatially restricted stress on the wood resource.  We are intrigued that pine wood has proven relatively ubiquitous among samples from Mound Key, the historically and archaeologically documented ?capital? of the Calusa.  Pine, which was used both for fuel and construction purposes at Mound Key, had to be transported to the island. \nPlans for follow-up research include further investigation of the species and fuel characteristic patterns noted.  In particular, we will examine the Pineland site assemblages at a finer temporal resolution in concert with the published detailed companion data. The charcoal data will also be compared with previously documented fluctuation in mullet fish remains from corresponding zooarchaeological samples. Mullet is a particularly good species for this comparison because it is well suited to smoke preservation, thus food storage.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/03/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: George R Milner"
