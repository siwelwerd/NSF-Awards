 "awd_abstract_narration": "The spread of an invasive species is a poorly understood ecological phenomenon, yet it is of great practical importance causing an estimated $120 billion in damages per year.  Current theory largely considers the situation of a single species invading into a stable habitat.  Those models are inadequate to address the realistic situation of invasive species interacting with competitor species as the invasion front moves across the landscape.  They also do not incorporate the fact that habitats themselves can shift on the landscape as a result of climatic and other environmental changes.   For example, rapid movement of habitats toward the poles and higher elevations is a contemporary, global phenomenon.   This research project will develop new theory, backed by experiments with model species in the laboratory, to explain how species invasions are shaped by the presence of competitor species, and the situation of habitats shifting on the landscape.  This work will advance ecological science by providing a stronger theoretical basis for projections of species range shifts driven by invasive species and climate, and provide models useful to land managers, public health officials, and conservation biologists concerned with the spread of invasive species.  This project will provide hands on training and experience to biologists from undergraduate students to postdoctoral scholars, enabling them to become the leaders of the next generation of scientists tackling complex problems in biology.\r\n\r\nImportant new phenomena for range dynamics emerge when two or more species are considered, and especially given that at the edge of any species range, densities are low, stochasticity must play an important role.  Stochastic models will be developed together with highly replicated, microcosm experiments using a flour beetle model system.  The research will determine 1) how interactions with a resident species modify the range expansion of an invader and its effect on the resident; 2) how species interactions and stochasticity set species ranges in stationary heterogeneous environments; and 3) how species interactions, stochasticity, and moving environments set species ranges and alter spatial community structure.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe overarching goal of this project was to investigate both experimentally and theoretically spatial population dynamics with a focus on two species systems using experimental microcosms with flour beetles as a central tool.  Understanding how populations evolve over space and time, while including the effect of randomness due to small populations, is an important question both for management of ecological populations both desirable and undesirable, as well as a question of fundamental importance.  Randomness is always important, because at the very edge of a species\u2019 range it is less common.  The only way to understand the role of variability is to look at multiple replicates, which is why we used replicated microcosms in the laboratory involving two species of flour beetle as observations of natural systems are not replicated.  The flour beetle also allows us to look at multiple generations within a reasonable time frame to look at dynamics through time.  As a complement to the experimental work, we used mathematical models which provide a way to extend the results to other systems.\n\nUsing these approaches, we found a number of important results.  We found that competition between two species and individual-level variability in dispersal behavior results in more variable spatial spread pointing to potential fundamental limits in forecasting species shifting ranges without considering interspecific interactions and variability in dispersal behavior.  This is important, for example, in understanding the spread of invasive pests.  Emerald ash borer and other introduced species are examples.\n\nWe found that both the duration of transient coexistence and the degree of competitive indeterminacy were sensitive to the form of stochasticity suggesting current estimates of extinction risk, coexistence and time until competitive exclusion may not be accurate unless relevant forms of stochasticity are included in forecasting models.  These general principles and ideas are important, for example, in understanding the risks of extinction for endangered species, which can be at risk due to competition and small numbers.\n\nWe showed how the presence of a second species can be important in setting range limits and that density-dependent dispersal acts in concert with competition to substantially change the shape of a species' range boundary.  This also is important for understanding the dynamics of introduced species.\n\nIn results that may have even more immediate impact, we showed that when implementing a strategy of harvesting (killing) to slow the spread of an invasive species, that there is a large amount of variability in success, as measured by keeping the range of spread limited over a fixed time.  This obviously required multiple replicates which were possible only in a laboratory microcosm system like the one we used.  This provides experimental insights into the difficulties of determining an optimal strategy for control of an invasive species, since to have a very small probability of failure, much more effort would be required than the mean effort required for control.  This is one of the very first experimental demonstrations of ideas underlying what is known as the \u2018precautionary principle\u2019, the requirement of choosing a strategy that may be less optimal in order to guarantee success.  This idea shows up in a variety of bioeconomic aspects in management of ecosystems. \n\nThe overall results on spatial population dynamics, and particularly the results on the precautionary principle, can greatly inform management of natural systems, and thus represent large potential broader impacts.  Other broader impacts are related to the necessity of incorporating approaches based on careful mathematical models combined with empirical work as a way to solve fundamental problems in ecosystem management.  Through the course of the project, one postdoctoral scholar, two graduate students and over 25 undergraduate students received extensive training and experience that prepared them to be future leaders in this multidisciplinary effort.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan M Hastings"
