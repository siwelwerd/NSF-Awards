Specific conference activities that will comprise the broader engagement program include The Workshop Celebrating Diversity, Professional Development Days, Student Days, and a Career Fair. The Society of Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) 2015 Conference on Computational Science and Engineering (CSE15) is a biannual event with approximately 1300 attendees. Given that level of participation, bringing a modest size cohort of students and faculty into CSE represents a unique opportunity to blend the ideas of community building and critical mass with integration into the mainstream.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will provide CSE15 participants scientific training, mentoring, and career and professional development.  The program will serve as a pilot project to test the model as a technique to apply proven methods of engaging people from under-represented communities in mainstream scientific and engineering communities.  This project will directly impact the broadening of computing and computational science participants.  The program attendees will be recruited from populations traditionally underrepresented: women, under-represented minorities, first-generation students, and people with disabilities and people serving these communities.  The project will increase the participation in a major technical conference of people traditionally underrepresented in the field and provide important and meaningful mentoring and professional development opportunities.",

A comparison of a variety of factors ranging from confidence in pursuing research interests to confidence in developing a successful career demonstrated that for all points of comparison, confidence increased after the program.
