 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project builds on the successful prior work of proven partners to support and expand the primary international research and education (R&E) network connections supporting global scientific collaborations involving U.S. researchers and students in the Pacific and Oceania.  The project has two main thrusts.  First, it leverages prior NSF investments and mature international partnerships to maintain support for the current resilient production 2 x 40Gbps submarine fiber connections from Australia (AARNet) and New Zealand (REANNZ) to the U.S. and, in 2016, upgrades these connections to 2 x 100Gbps.  Since the fiber connecting Australia and New Zealand passes through Hawaii, the project also connects one of the world's most important international astronomy sites, Mauna Kea (Hawaii Island), as well as the international observatories on Haleakala (Maui).  The project leverages the trans-Pacific submarine fiber backbone to terminate and transport the connections at major U.S. open R&E network exchanges and hubs.  Second, the project provides leadership in R&E network capacity building throughout the Pacific Islands, the region of the planet most on the front line of climate change and the last area of the world with no regional R&E network initiative.  Intellectual merit and broader impact are reflected in this enabling role for international research collaborations in astronomy, oceanography, high energy physics, coral reef research and more.  Outreach into the Pacific Islands provides an unparalleled opportunity to engage Pacific Islanders, who are highly underrepresented in STEM fields, in a wide range of scientific research and education initiatives that are both appealing (astronomy) as well as of critical concern to their communities (oceanography, biodiversity coral reef health, and climate change).",
