 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to construct a 16-element array receiver system called OMAR (One Millimeter-wave Array Receiver) at the 50 m Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) located in Tonantzintla, Puebla, Mexico. OMAR will be installed as a common-user facility instrument, available for American astronomers. LMT is a joint project of the University of Massachusetts and the Instituto Nacional de Astrofisica, Optica, y Electronica (INAOE). OMAR is designed to operate in the 210 - 280 GHz (~1 mm wavelength) atmospheric window, and will be equipped with state-of-the-art receivers. OMAR will build on the proven experience and the heritage of success of the UMass instrumentation group in building state-of-the-art focal plane arrays. OMAR will provide an unprecedented combination of sensitivity, mapping speed, spectral coverage, spatial and spectral resolution in the 1 mm band, that will enable a wide variety of scientific projects covering the gamut of distant galaxies to comet flybys in our own solar system. \r\n\r\nOMAR will be the first heterodyne array receiver at millimeter wavelengths that is equipped with sideband-separation super-conducting receivers. In each pixel, 8 GHz of effective bandwidth per sideband (16 GHz total) will be available without the use of mechanical tuners. OMAR will be deployed as a 16 element dual polarization array which will be arranged in a 2x4 (8 beams) format. OMAR will be used with on-the-fly (OTF) mapping mode to provide an unprecedented combination of sensitivity, mapping speed, spectral coverage, spatial and spectral resolution in the 1 mm band. OMAR is a technically innovative instrument that will define the state-of-the-art for SIS heterodyne array receivers. As a purely technical advance, this project will implement a high level of integration of mixer, amplifier, local oscillator injection components in a innovative sideband separation system that will have a significant impact in the field of heterodyne focal-plane arrays.",

OMAyA has been designed to operate in the 210 &ndash; 280 GHz (~1mm wavelength) atmospheric window. Each pixel of OMAyA features a novel mixer block with an unprecedented level of integration, and is equipped with the ability to detect two orthogonal polarizations, and contains sideband-separation super-conducting mixers. The focal-plane is arranged in a 2x4 configuration, with the ability to detect emission from 2 polarizations in 8 beams on the sky. In all 32 distinct IF (intermediate frequency) outputs are available from OMAyA.</p>\n<p>One of the significant achievements in this project has been the design and construction of a single mixer block that splits the two orthogonal polarizations with a device called the orthomode transducer (OMT). In addition, in the same mixer block, for each polarization, a sideband-separation receiver has been built with innovative waveguide-based local oscillator (LO) injection, and both RF (radio frequency) and IF hybrids built into the block. Instead of larger bulky electromagnets that are traditionally used in super-conducting mixers to suppress the noisy Cooper pair tunneling effect, the OMAyA mixer block uses carefully designed static magnets. Geometrically, this unprecedented level of integration results in a convenient compact package that lends itself nicely to be integrated into a large format focal-plane array receiver. Ten of these compact mixer blocks have been built (includes 2 spares). A custom test cryostat has been built to test these mixer blocks. The tests indicate excellent noise temperature performance across the designed band at the level of 4-5 times the quantum noise limit.</p>\n<p>A 2x4 square corrugated feed-horn has been designed and constructed in a novel split-block fashion. This square feed-horn will operate at 45K physical temperature, and there is a small throat section of the horns that is built into the OMAyA mixer block which operates at a physical temperature of 4K, with a non-contacting joint between the two feed-horn sections.</p>\n<p>The SIS (super-conductor insulator super-conductor) junctions that are at the heart of the OMAyA mixer blocks were fabricated through a sub-contract with the University of Virginia, and are based on the ALMA Band-6 junction design developed by Tony Kerr at NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory). A large batch of SIS junctions have been obtained, and the yield and performance of these devices have been found to be excellent.</p>\n<p>The OMAyA LO system has been constructed to provide adequate LO power between 216 &ndash; 270 GHz with full computer control, and no moving parts. Optimal LO power can be provided for all 32 SIS junctions in the OMAyA array with a multiplier system. The system uses a commercial oscillator operating at 18 &ndash; 26 GHz, and is multiplied up 12 times, with the last tripler operating cryogenically. The LO stage has multiple power amplifiers at intermediate frequencies and has a custom phase-locked loop. Such multiplied LO sources has the potential for adding to the noise of the overall receiver system through the addition of AM (amplitude modulation) noise from the LO chain, but with careful design and tweaking the worst penalty in OMAyA is about 10 K at some frequencies, which is similar to what is seen in ALMA LO sources.</p>\n<p>A new bias card capable of biasing 32 SIS junctions and 32 IF LNAs (Low Noise Amplifiers) has been built for OMAyA. A large python based monitor and control (M&amp;C) package has been developed for testing OMAyA in the lab and for its eventual deployment and use on the LMT. This system automates all aspects of OMAyA operation with the ability to remotely control all aspects of the receiver operation.</p>\n<p>At these wavelengths, one needs IF low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) following the mixer stage, and after researching and developing hybrid designs at UMass, eventually, during the course of execution of the project, commercial amplifiers developed by a Swedish company, Low Noise Factory Inc. were settled upon as the choice for the IF LNAs. However, because of delays due to the covid-19 pandemic, and supply side issues, the overall price of these amplifiers ended up being significantly higher than budgeted. So only 16 of the 32 IF amplifiers have been procured, and the proposing team has applied for a two-year grant to purchase these remaining amplifiers, and finish and commission the receiver on the LMT.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The OMAyA cryostat holds the entire cryogenic front-end of the array. It has been completely designed including calculation of the thermal budget for heat dissipation from various sources. Most of the cryostat has been fabricated, and awaits integration of the rest of the array for final system integration tests and deployment to the LMT.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/11/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gopal&nbsp;Narayanan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1507267/1507267_10390252_1686514813061_OMAYA_mixer_dual--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1507267/1507267_10390252_1686514813061_OMAYA_mixer_dual--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"OMAyA Mixer block\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1507267/1507267_10390252_1686514813061_OMAYA_mixer_dual--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"OMAyA Mixer block\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Top: Schematic Outline of the split-block bottom block of the OMAyA mixer block with various salient details noted.
