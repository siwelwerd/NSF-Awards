Broader impacts of the work include training of a female postdoctoral researcher, and improved understanding of thermal tides on an Earth-like planet that is not Earth which could inform terrestrial atmospheric science. \r\n\r\nMeasurements from the Curiosity rover would be coupled with orbital data to explore thermal tides in the vicinity of Gale Crater.  The model results would provide an opportunity to separate the effects of migrating and non-migrating tides, and would also inform Mars global climate modelling development.",
