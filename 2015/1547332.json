 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the severe spectrum shortage in conventional cellular bands, millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies between 30 and 300 GHz have been attracting growing attention as a possible candidate for next-generation micro- and pico-cellular wireless networks. The mmWave bands offer orders of magnitude greater spectrum than current cellular allocations and enable very high-dimensional antenna arrays for further gains via beam-forming and spatial multiplexing. However, due to unique nature of propagation in these frequencies, cellular systems will need to be significantly redesigned to fully exploit the potential of these frequencies. This project investigates one key dimension in mmWave network design: resource sharing, involving the sharing of spectrum and network infrastructure resources by multiple operators. It is argued that sharing of this form will be essential to fully exploit the tremendous bandwidth and antenna degrees of freedom offered by these bands and also provide statistical multiplexing to accommodate the highly variable nature of traffic.\r\n\r\nThis inter-disciplinary project explores both the engineering and economic aspects of mmWave resource sharing. On the engineering side, the key challenge is that the spectrum must be shared not only in time and frequency, but also space. In addition, new decentralized mechanisms are required to rapidly reallocate backhaul and core network elements across multiple parties. The project develops signal processing methods, protocols and network optimization algorithms to facilitate directional sharing of spectrum along with dynamic re-routing and load balancing. On the economic and policy side, several shared ownership models under varying forms of licensing agreements between the operators, regulatory agencies and third-party spectrum and resource brokers are investigated. Based on the capacity estimates obtained from the engineering side, economic models are developed to assess key indicators such as operating and capital costs and coalition formation and market concentration.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nCommunication in the millimeter wave (mmWave) has emerged as a central component of fifth generation (5G) cellular wireless systems.   The mmWave bands offer vastly greater bandwidth than conventional cellular allocations enabling new massive data rate applications. This project investigated a key issue in mmWave system design:  resource sharing, by which we mean the sharing of spectrum and network infrastructure resources by multiple operators.  \n\n\nCellular systems in conventional frequencies typically operate with minimal sharing where each operator has exclusive licensed access to spectrum and largely manages its own infrastructure.  In contrast, systems in the mmWave bands may need spectrum and infrastructure sharing to fully exploit the bandwidth and antenna degrees of freedom, and provide statistical multiplexing to accommodate the highly variable nature of traffic.  Also, due to the relatively short range of mmWave signals, infrastructure sharing may be critical for operators to obtain suitable cell density at reasonable cost.\n\n\nThe interdisciplinary project explored both the engineering and economic aspects of mmWave\nresource sharing. The work was divided into four thrusts.  All of these thrusts obtained  significant achievements over the course of the project:  Thrust 1 was on directional network discovery, a key initial step in sharing spatial degrees of freedom.  In this thrust, we developed several power efficient methods for beamforming and search with a focus on power efficient RF front-end architectures.  Fundamental information theoretic limits were derived along with novel algorithms including methods using deep learning.  Detailed circuit models were  also developed providing the first analyses above 100 GHz.  Thrust 2 focused on protocols for spectrum and infrastructure coordination.  In this thrust, we analyzed and optimized several MAC and upper layer protocols for shared deployments including handover, dual connectivity and rate adaptation.   We also provided the first analysis of idle and connected mode beam search and cell discovery.  Spectrum sharing between aerial and terrestrial networks was also explored with assessments of the capacity.  Here, we considered the various deployment models and their impact on capacity.  \n\n\nThrust 3 developed extensive simulation tools and data for assessing spectrum sharing.  At the network layer, we significantly enhanced an open source ns3 simulator to include detailed channel models, support of aspects of the new 5G New Radio standard, handover, and dual connectivity.  A channel sounder was also developed and integrated in an open, programmable testbed in the COSMOS lab.  Several ray tracing studies were performed and all data was made public along with the processing code.  Channel models and machine learning methods were also developed and made public.\n\n\nThrust 4 developed new economic models for spectrum sharing.  A joint economic and engineering model was developed that considers key factors including cell density, coverage, spectrum, interference and how these relate to consumer pricing and service.  The model enabled the first study of how operators will behave in a competitive market and provided insights into how spectrum and infrastructure policy can influence service available to consumers.\n\n\nThe broader impacts have also been significant.  Since the start of the project, commercial systems in the mmWave frequencies have now been deployed and the licensing of further spectrum has become a central focus of the FCC.   Through NYU Wireless, the research directions and issues were discussed with key industrial partners.  Research topics were also discussed at the annual Brooklyn 5G and 6G Summits, a key event sponsored by NYU and Nokia.  The PI Erkip also began a new NYU Wireless workshop where spectrum was one of the key panels.  The PIs gave several keynote talks as well as discussions with the US State Department.   Students had several opportunities to work in leading companies via internships.\n\n\nMaterial, particularly datasets, was integrated into graduate level courses.  This material is open source.  A highly successful program for NYC high school teachers was also enhanced by the project to help build modules where wireless was used to teach STEM concepts.  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/12/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sundeep Rangan"
