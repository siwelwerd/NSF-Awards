 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Audience Summary\r\n\r\nThis award provides funding for a workshop that is to occur over three full days in the early winter of 2015-2016. The topic of the conference is the governance of gene drives. Gene drives are a subset of second generation genetic engineering technologies that are being developed with the aim of moving synthetic gene constructs into wild animal populations to protect, suppress or eliminate them, such as the suppression of mosquitoes that transmit malaria and dengue. Experts from four areas will participate in the workshop: Genetics and molecular biology, ecology and ecological modeling, political economy, and STS (including ethics). The PI plans for there to be equal representation across these areas; experts will include members of academia, practitioners and experts from government, NGOs, and industry. The structure of the workshop will be designed to engage participants in working together to generate analyses and summaries useful for future decision and policy making about gene drives. Following the workshop, papers will be finalized for publication in a special journal edition. A summary article will be published by the program committee that compares issues and system maps across the case studies and summarizes the key findings of the workshop. The program committee will also draft a shorter piece sub mitted for a high profile venue, such as a Nature or Science commentary.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary \r\n\r\nThe proposed workshop will produce a typology of gene drives for more nuanced and productive conversations about governance. Specifically, participants will develop a draft typology of technologies, purposes, and contexts of gene drives, and a framework of issues and research needs for three key areas: ecological risk analysis, political economy analysis (including governance regimes), and ethical analysis. In order to cover a range of technologies, purposes, and issues, but yet be specific enough for productive dialogue, three case studies will be used to anticipate the social, ecological, economic, and ethical issues associated with gene drives. Integration of the natural and social sciences will be achieved through broad multidisciplinary participation and thinking about the cases and the systems in which they are embedded. Collaborative systems mapping will be used as a tool to assist in the integration of natural, social, and ethical variables, as it has been shown to be effective in creating an environment where complexities and uncertainties can be better seen and understood , and where participants are more willing to open up to alternative perspectives. The combination of the topic, approach, and outputs of the workshop make it unique, and it will contribute to deeper intellectual understanding of gene drives in societal contexts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Roadmap to Gene Drives project was designed to take a systems approach to identify and examine the policy, economic, ethical and ecological issues surrounding gene drives, which harness new methods of genetic engineering to introduce genes into populations in managed or unmanaged ecosystems.  In February 2016 a dialogue-based workshop was held to consider three case studies of gene drives and to utilize systems thinking to identify the  societal issues surrounding them.   Research, risk analysis, and governance needs to address such issues upstream of technology deployment were identified. \n\nOver 70 subject matter experts (SMEs) from academe, business, government, and nonprofit organizations from 10 different countries in Europe, Australia, and North and South America attended.  There were participants from the natural sciences (n=33 including ecology, genetics, and molecular biology), social science (n=31 including policy sciences, economics, science and technology studies, and sociology), and humanities (n=8 including law, history, and philosophy).  The workshop also included a significant number of participants at early career stages (17 students and 4 postdocs).\n\nThe workshop made use of both top-down and bottom-up methodologies to elicit research and governance needs. Specific prompts were used to encourage participants to think about intersectional issues (like ethics and ecological risk), and collaborative systems modeling was used as a tool to map relationships among variables in governance systems and feedback loops.  On the first morning, presentations focused on three case studies of gene drives and proposed a framework for considering ethical issues posed by gene drives.  These presentations were followed by parallel, small-group discussions to identify ethical issues specific to each of the case studies or the different molecular mechanisms of gene drives. Each group had 6 to 10 participants and was designed to represent a mix of sectors and disciplines.  On day two, morning presentations in the thematic areas of risk analysis, public policy, environmental studies, science and technology studies, and economics were followed by small-group exercises using collaborative systems modeling (CSM) to map the governance system in the context of a case study while integrating concepts from these thematic areas.  From these maps, governance variables and relationships were identified at the intersection of disciplines.  On day three, further observations from the maps and a list of ethical issues were used to develop a list of information and research needs needed for understanding governance and how social, economic, political, and ecological systems interact. Throughout the workshop, key findings of the small group dialogues were reported back to the full group in voice-recorded sessions.  For the small group dialogues, note takers were present.  Transcripts from the large group meetings and notes from the small group dialogues were combined and consulted in the preparation a manuscript to identify major themes arising from the discussions and to place them into system frameworks.\n\nThe project resulted in a special edition of the Journal of Responsible Innovation (Taylor &amp; Francis) to appear in late 2017 or early 2018.   As of the writing of this summary (Oct 2017) all fourteen articles have been accepted with final editorial changes pending.  The volume will be published as open access to facilitate broad stakeholder and public understanding of the issues and future use of the workshop outcomes.  Papers include typologies of the technologies associated with gene drives, policy issues, and the ethical dimensions; critiques of current risk assessment approaches for GE animals as historical precursors to gene drives; methods for risk analysis of gene drives; analysis of the economics and political economy of gene drives; descriptions of the three cases of gene-drive use and the surrounding societal issues; and a systems framework using institutional analysis and development to explore future research questions linking features of governance to outcomes (based on discussions at the workshop).  Two popular press articles on gene drives summarizing the issues and key workshop points were also published (Kuzma in Aeon magazine and Centers for Humans and Nature).  \n\nThe workshop also contributed to graduate training and education.  Graduate students in the NC State NSF IGERT program on Genetic Pest Management (IGERT-GPM) played key roles in the workshop.  One student presented her cohort?s case study on GPM for mice on islands and was the lead author of that article for the JRI volume.  Another cohort of students co-authored one of the JRI papers on the case study of agricultural pest-management using gene drives.  These and additional NC State students affiliated with the Genetic Engineering and Society Center moderated the small group discussions at the workshop after undergoing additional training in facilitating stakeholder dialogues. \n\nThe workshop was hosted by the NC State GES Center, and co-hosted by the Center for Nanotechnology and Society at Arizona State University, which provided additional support for some attendees.  Synthetic Biology Engineering Research Center (SynBERC) faculty collaborated on the project?s program committee.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/20/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jennifer Kuzma"
