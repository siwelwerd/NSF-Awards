 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program is supporting the collaborative research of Professor John C. Poutsma at the College of William and Mary and Professor Jennifer Poutsma at Old Dominion University. Professor John Poutsma employs mass spectrometry-based experiments to study the subtle interplay between the structure of amino acids and their gas-phase energetic properties. He is studying a class of compounds known as non-proteinogenic amino acids (NPAA), which are found naturally in plants and fungi, but are not used in protein synthesis. Many NPAAs are toxic to humans and other animals in part due to structural similarity to one or more of the twenty common protein amino acids (PAA). NPAAs can compete with PAAs in a variety of biological pathways including being mis-incorporated into proteins and peptides. These experiments will further understanding of the intrinsic chemistry of NPAAs as isolated entities and when incorporated into small peptides. Professor Jennifer Poutsma is performing density functional theory calculations that support and guide the experimental studies. Both research programs integrate research and educational components through the training of undergraduate researchers. The vast majority of the research projects outlined in this proposal are being performed by undergraduates at William and Mary and Old Dominion University. Performing independent research helps expose these students to the modern research in biologically relevant, mechanistic mass spectrometry, supported by advanced computational chemistry.\r\n\r\nIn this research, the intrinsic gas-phase thermochemical properties of di-peptides are being determined using the extended kinetic method in a triple quadrupole instrument. Specifically, the PIs are studying the gas-phase acid-base chemistry of dipeptides that contain proline or one of its non-protein amino acid analogs azetidine-2-carboxylic acid or pipecolic acid. Absolute gas-phase thermochemical properties will be determined using the extended kinetic method (EKM) in a TSQ Quantum triple-quadrupole instrument.  The collaborative research team is working to determine the effects of ring-size and conformational flexibility on the acid-base properties of these species with the goal of applying this knowledge toward a better understanding the mechanisms for selective fragmentations in low-energy tandem mass spectrometry experiments of proline-containing peptides.  Peptides containing these 4- and 6-ring analogues of proline, a typical beta-turn-forming amino acid are of considerable interest in chemical biology and peptide design circles.  The results of these studies are likely to be of interest to scientists in these communities.",

These experiments form the basis of MS-based proteomics experiments aimed at an enhanced knowledge of the behavior of proteins. Though highly automated, these MS-based proteomics experiments rely on empirically-derived \"rules\" for how peptides fall apart in mass spectrometers.

The \"rules\" specify that when energy is added to peptides in the mass spectrometer, they fragment to give b<sub>n</sub><sup>+</sup> and y<sub>m</sub><sup>+</sup> ions, where n and m are the number of amino acids in the individual fragments. By studying not only what the fragmentation products are, but also what their structures are, we hope to further our understanding of the mechanisms for fragmentation and have a better chance of predicting the distribution of fragment ions from any given dissociation. Our first paper on this topic was in collaboration with Vicki Wysocki of Ohio State University in which we showed that the PP b<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> ion from PPG has an oxazolone structure (see Figure 1). This is in stark contrast to the previous study in which the PP b<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> ion from PPP has a diketopiperazine structure. This study shows that one must consider not only the residues that end up in the b-ion fragment, but other nearby residues as well. In a recently submitted paper, we showed that peptides AOAA and AAOA gave b<sub>2</sub><sup>+</sup> and b<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> ions that have a novel lactam structure (see Figure 2), which is the first such experimental evidence for this novel structure. Similarly, in collaboration with Professor Paul Wenthold at Purdue University we demonstrated a lactone structure for the ammonia loss product from sulfonated phenylalanine (see Figure 3), a novel product for deprotonated amino acids. These studies are contributing to the growing body of knowledge on peptide structure mechanisms and product ion structures and will hopefully lead to enhanced peptide sequencing techniques.</p>\n<p>In addition to our peptide fragmentation work, we demonstrated that the arginine analog canavanine forms zwitterionic structures when complexed with Cs<sup>+</sup>, a mixture of zwitterionic and canonical structures with K<sup>+</sup> and canonical structures with Na<sup>+</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>, and H<sup>+ </sup>(Figures 4 and 5). These results contrast those for arginine, which forms zwitterions with Na<sup>+</sup> - Cs<sup>+</sup>.
