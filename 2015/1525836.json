 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past decade, a wide-ranging collection of network functions have been used to accommodate the needs of network users. A diverse set of network functions, including firewalls, security filters, and quality of service enhancers have been implemented using increasingly complex techniques. These functions are used to support predictable, high performance in data and multimedia network environments. To promote flexibility, there has been recent interest in replacing dedicated network hardware with programmable network functions. This approach, called network function virtualization (NFV), allows for the rapid adaptation of network services as security and performance requirements change. NFV allows network administrators to support different network policies by using appropriate programmable network functions on demand.\r\n\r\nIn this project, a new hardware-based approach to NFV construction that provides scalability and programmability, while supporting significant hardware-level parallelism, will be developed. The computing platform will use a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) to implement numerous NFV operations that can be customized to specific network flow needs. As the number of required functions and their characteristics change, the hardware in the FPGA can be reconfigured to support the updated requirements. The management of the deployed classifiers and traffic management functions will be performed by a resource manager which is executed on an accompanying microprocessor. The researchers will create a series of software tools and hardware modules to evaluate the approach, Architectural resources will be managed by a new resource allocation algorithm that will allow for the effective use of the available FPGA area under NFV performance constraints. This algorithm will run periodically to allow for dynamic rebalancing of FPGA resources. \r\n\r\nBroader Impact: Two specific programs to broaden the impact of the work will be developed. These efforts will include a new undergraduate curriculum in network function virtualization focused on scalable real-world systems and a student-run research workshop which will allow students to present their work. FPGA and networking companies will be encouraged to use this technology in new product development.",
