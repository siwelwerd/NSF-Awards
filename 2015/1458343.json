 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"Creating a Community of Transfer Scholars in Computing and Information Technology\" project at the University of Maryland Baltimore County (UMBC), will recruit, retain, and graduate a total of 25 academically-talented transfer students with financial need in computing majors.  Students majoring in four computing majors in two academic departments (Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Information Systems or Business Administration Technology) will be eligible to participate in the program.  The recruitment plan leverages existing collaborations with five community colleges in Maryland and will focus on encouraging woman and underrepresented minorities Students to apply to the scholarship program.  The project will leverage a highly effective student support delivery model (CWIT Scholars Program) and the peer support of its community of undergraduate technology and engineering scholars.\r\n\r\nScholarship recipients will participate in a new scholars retreat; faculty, peer, and industry mentoring; academic and professional development activities; and a transfer student seminar.   The project will contribute to the body of knowledge about the experiences of and challenges faced by transfer students in computing majors, especially women and underrepresented minorities, and will provide evidence regarding the efficacy of support services and community support on the success of transfer students in general and more specifically, students with financial need, women, and underrepresented minorities in computing majors.",
