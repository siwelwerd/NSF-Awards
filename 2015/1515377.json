 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continental hydrothermal systems have immense scientific and practical significance and are critically important to the Earth?s thermal budget and geochemical cycles. Continental hydrothermal systems are a primary source of economically important metal deposits, provide geothermal resources, support exotic ecosystems that are just beginning to be explored, and in some settings pose a significant geologic hazard via hydrothermal explosions. The subsurface conditions and processes that control these systems are poorly understood because they entail the flow of multi-phase and multi-component fluids through rocks with heterogeneous permeability fields that are perturbed by a multitude of geological and environmental processes. Carefully designed multidisciplinary field experiments and modeling efforts are \r\nrequired to understand the coupled processes that drive these dynamic systems and control their response to geological and environmental forcing. This project is focused on quantifying the response of continental hydrothermal systems to tectonic, magmatic, and climatic processes operating on time-scales from seconds to thousands of years. The PIs address important and timely scientific questions, such as: How do multi-phase fluids and dissolved constituents flux through hydrothermal systems? How do these systems redistribute elements to produce mineral deposits and microbial habitats? How do earthquakes and magmatic activity perturb hydrothermal systems? What triggers hydrothermal explosions? How do environmental processes and climate affect continental hydrothermal systems? \r\n\r\nThe study will involve a combination of fieldwork, data analysis, and modeling. The field program uses a combination of innovative instrument networks and sediment coring activities that will be integrated through modeling activities to study the response of the Yellowstone Lake hydrothermal system to tectonic, magmatic, and climatic forcing. Yellowstone Lake is an ideal site for this research because it hosts an active hydrothermal system located in a region with high levels of tectonic and magmatic activity that has been influenced by a broad range of climate conditions in postglacial times. Research activities will include components of geochemistry, seismology, geology, geodesy, heat flow, micropaleontology, limnology, paleoclimatology, statistics, analytical modeling, and numerical modeling, all of which are essential for unraveling the coupled processes that drive system behavior. Working on a lake-floor system provides an exceptional opportunity to study forcing-response relationships on an expanded range of time-scales spanning more than 11 orders of magnitude.",

Only recently, however, has the chemical, physical and biological diversity of hot spring activity beneath Yellowstone Lake become appreciated. These discoveries have occurred in connection with our NSF funded multidisciplinary project called the Hydrothermal Dynamics of Yellowstone Lake. The highly integrated project explored previously unknown geothermal phenomena on the Lake floor. A team from the University of Minnesota has focused on measuring hot spring temperatures and fluid chemistry on the lake floor, while also studying rock and sediment samples from within the area of active venting. To do this, specially designed samplers and chemical sensors were deployed. Many instruments were made from titanium to sustain high temperatures and pressures, and are largely similar to instruments used successfully to acquire \"black smoker\" fluids on the seafloor at deep sea vents.</p>\n<p class=\"Head1\">The hottest vents measured were found in the Deep Hole just east of Stevenson Island, the deepest area of Yellowstone Lake at 125 m (410 feet) (Figure 1). The hottest vent measured was 174?C (345 F). This is much hotter than any surface hot spring at Yellowstone, because the weight from the overlying lake water acts like a pressure cooker lid and allows higher temperatures to be reached. Indeed, these are the hottest hydrothermal vents measured in a lake anywhere in the world to date. The hot water and gas bubbles discharge from small ~10 cm (3-inch) openings in the lake floor, generally aligned along a series on conical depressions, which in turn appear to be associated with linear fractures on the lake floor (Figure 1 and 2).&nbsp; Curiously, the water is even more dilute than the surrounding lake water and contains abundant gasses, such as hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide, which tells us that the vents are powered by steam and support a rich microbial ecosystem (. Much like steam heated areas at the surface in YNP, the lake floor around the Deep Hole vents is almost entirely made of a type of clay called kaolinite owing to the highly acidic nature of the venting fluids (Figure 2).</p>\n<p class=\"Head1\">In addition to studying the geochemical and geophysical controls manifest by lake-floor vent fluid diversity, project goals entailed assessing the role to which seasonal lake level changes affect the temperature and chemistry of the steam-heated Deep Hole vents?

To answer these and related questions, &nbsp;University of Minnesota researchers developed underwater sensors capable of logging the temperature and chemical parameters of the hot spring waters and deployed them for one year.
