 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the era of big-data, one needs to organize massive amounts of data \r\nso that it can be searched quickly. This requires the building of an \r\nindex over the raw data. In many cases of big-data, like world-wide web\r\nor DNA sequencing, the actual information content is low. This data is \r\nhighly compressible. On the other hand, the indexes require space which \r\nis several times the raw data. Thus, indexing and compression are often \r\nconflicting goals. The field of compact (or succinct) data structures \r\nattempts to achieve both these goals -compression and indexability- \r\nsimultaneously. This project will address some of the most fundamental \r\nopen problems in this field. This will have impact on next generation \r\nbiological sequence mining databases which could simply work within the \r\nmemory of a PC instead of requiring high-performance clusters. The \r\nfoundations built by this project will also impact image matching and \r\nmusic retrieval. Since data structures is one of the most fundamental \r\nareas in computer science education, research from this project will \r\nalso impact data structures curriculum.\r\n\r\nSuffix trees are central to string indexing and have myriads of \r\napplications. However, suffix trees are known to take 15 to 50 times \r\nthe size of the text they index. This actually stems from a complexity \r\ngap in the size of data which is n log s bits compared to the size of \r\nthe index which is O( n log n) bits, for the text of n characters drawn \r\nfrom alphabet size of s. The techniques of Burrows-Wheeler Transform(BWT)\r\nand Phi-function were introduced in the last decade to address this gap. \r\nMost subsequent research in this field has treated BWT as a black box, \r\ncompressing augmenting structures around it to address various \r\napplications. However, many problems (like parameterized pattern matching\r\nand 2D pattern matching) have remained open in this field. This project \r\nwill attempt to go deeper and beyond the philosophy of BWT to solve such \r\nissues. It will also try to build foundations for deriving lower bounds \r\nfor problems where compact index would be impossible. To create better \r\nunderstanding of data structure space and query complexity, the project \r\nwill explore the recent theoretical model called \"encoding  model\". The \r\nproject will also explore the applied case of compressed indexing for \r\nhighly repetitive sequences.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web site at:  \r\nhttp://csc.lsu.edu/~rahul/succinct",
