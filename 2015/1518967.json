 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor Sebastian Franco at the City College of the City University of New York.\r\n\r\nThe two pillars of our current understanding of the universe, Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity, are mutually incompatible. String theory reconciles them, unifying all fundamental interactions in nature, including gravity, in a quantum theory. Fundamental physics is going through an era of exceptional developments, both at the experimental and theoretical fronts. Ongoing experiments are probing the basic structure of nature along a multitude of complementary directions, from the cosmological to the intensity frontiers. The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has recently discovered the Higgs boson, the last missing piece of the Standard Model of particle physics, and is vigorously testing several of its possible extensions.  As part of his proposed research, Professor Franco will undertake a comprehensive investigation of the connection between string-theory models and our world. He will also study several new possibilities for physics beyond the Standard Model, with an emphasis on models with ingredients that appear generically in string theory or with a radical departure from conventional scenarios.  As such, the proposed research program will help preserve the United States' long-standing status at the cutting edge of string phenomenology. This proposal also has a significant broader-impact component. One of its salient elements is the creation of the \"From the Collider to the Classroom\" program, in which active physicists will present their research to high school teachers. The PI will actively engage undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral associates in his research, training them in research methods in theoretical physics. He also plans to introduce key improvements to the undergraduate research program at CCNY aimed at developing high-impact practices leading to deep approaches to learning. Finally, the PI will continue and strengthen his ongoing interdisciplinary collaborations bringing together the physics and mathematics communities.\r\n\r\nMore technically, key objectives of this proposal are: a systematic derivation of precise features of the Standard Model, such as its flavor structure in local Type IIB string-theory constructions and comparison with experiments;  the development and implementation of new algorithms for a large-scale computer search of these models;  the study of favorable scenarios in which characteristic features of string theory can lead to recognizable imprints accessible to experiments;  a thorough investigation of a wide range of new supersymmetry-breaking and mediation scenarios and their implications for the LHC, and the development of new tools for studying global aspects of string compactifications and their incidence in experimentally measureable quantities.",
