 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plasma - the fourth state of matter - is of abundant presence in the universe. Plasmas are used by mankind in a broad variety of industrial and scientific applications, from material processing for food packaging, medical applications, and the car industry to next generation particle accelerators and new space propulsion systems. Even in spite of the broad importance of plasma for scientific and\r\nsocio-economical aspects, it is the least addressed physical science topic from K-12 education up to college level. The central goal of this CAREER award project of the National Science Foundation is combining a cutting edge plasma physics research mission with a rigorous outreach activity to make plasma physics more visible to the general public as an important field of physical sciences for the development and progress of modern industrial societies.\r\n\r\nThe central research endeavor of this award project is the generation and understanding of high density plasma regimes using highly efficient plasma sources - in this case helicon waves. Active gas fueling will be explored as a method to overcome the empirical density limit found for such plasma configurations, and state-of-the-art methods of active laser spectroscopy will be employed to measure the dynamics of the neutral particles and of ionization. The Laboratory for Plasma Physics class in the Department of Engineering Physics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison is employed as a central element for education and outreach. A teacher summer class will be developed in collaboration with the Madison Metropolitan School District as a fertilizing environment to foster implementation of basic plasma physics aspects as extensions to present high school curricula. This effort will be at the same time a central training activity for next generation faculty. Two graduate students are involved in the development and execution of this central outreach project, transforming the laboratory course into an advanced discovery learning experience on plasma physics.",

The technical complexity of such setups is moderate, and the amount of power needed to sustain the plasma is small compared to other plasma generation methods.

This research aimed to increase plasma generation efficiency and create an axially homogeneous plasma density for applications in wakefield particle accelerators. Advanced laser-induced fluorescence diagnostics were developed to measure the plasma density and infer the flows of charged and neutral particles in the plasma. The plasma density measured supported that helicon plasmas were achieved in the new device constructed, the Madison AWAKE Prototype (MAP). The radio frequency antenna was optimized for narrow modes, and the axially homogeneous magnetic field in MAP allowed the demonstration of the directionality of the helicon plasma that also supported the nature of this mode as a magnetized plasma wave. The directionality was explained by a drift current in the steep density domain in the plasma edge, which couples to the radio frequency current driven by the propagating wave. This is clear proof of the magnetized nature of the wave that ionizes so efficiently. It points to the possibility of assembling and aligning antennas axially to create a long high-density plasma column with high axial uniformity. Such a plasma source is needed for the Advanced Proton Driven Wakefield Acceleration Experiment (AWAKE) at CERN. The funded team at UW Madison has become a full partner of this project. It supports with these results and diagnostic techniques the advance of this next frontier in high-energy particle physics.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>An outreach program was designed in collaboration with high school partners around Wisconsin to bring plasma physics into the STEM curriculum. The Plasma Academy was launched as a week-long course introducing fundamental principles of plasma physics to high school teachers and students who participated jointly from one high school to transfer this knowledge into the classroom. Course modules were developed as part of the Plasma Academy around practical experimental elements such as a large plasma ball and electrostatic experimental kits, which were provided to the teacher/student teams. The course modules were shaped to be included in the standard curriculum sequence of advanced learning courses on a high school level. In addition, a plasma intern program and a K-12 visit program were established and conducted.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/22/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Oliver&nbsp;Schmitz</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1455210/1455210_10351435_1687468537586_COMSOL_magField--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1455210/1455210_10351435_1687468537586_COMSOL_magField--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Magnetic field in MAP\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1455210/1455210_10351435_1687468537586_COMSOL_magField--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Magnetic field in MAP\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Magnetic field in MAP from COMSOL modeling in forwrad and backward magnetic field direction showing the directionality of a plasma response current which interactions with the helicon mode propagation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marcel Granetzny</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Oliver&nbsp;Schmitz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Magnetic field in MAP</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1455210/1455210_10351435_1687468249538_MAP_device--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1455210/1455210_10351435_1687468249538_MAP_device--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Madison AWAKE Prototype\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1455210/1455210_10351435_1687468249538_MAP_device--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Madison AWAKE Prototype\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Madison AWAKE Prototype (MAP) device was constructed as outcome of this funding and is a general purpose plasma device for helicon research at UW Madison.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marcel Granetzny</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Oliver&nbsp;Schmitz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Madison AWAKE Prototype</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1455210/1455210_10351435_1687468414604_MAP_density--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1455210/1455210_10351435_1687468414604_MAP_density--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Plasma density in MAP\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1455210/1455210_10351435_1687468414604_MAP_density--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Plasma density in MAP\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Plasma density in MAP measured by Laser Induced Fluorescence (LID) demsonstrating efficient generation of a high density plasma with 1kW power.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Zepp</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Oliver&nbsp;Schmitz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Plasma density in MAP</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1455210/1455210_10351435_1687468104736_Screen-Shot-2022-08-04-at-9.07.56-AM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1455210/1455210_10351435_1687468104736_Screen-Shot-2022-08-04-at-9.07.56-AM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Advertisment for the Plasma Academy\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1455210/1455210_10351435_1687468104736_Screen-Shot-2022-08-04-at-9.07.56-AM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Advertisment for the Plasma Academy\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Plasma Academy is an high school outreach program formedd under this CAREER funding.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Madelyn Knilans</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Oliver&nbsp;Schmitz</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Advertisment for the Plasma Academy</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
