The partnership with the University of Chicago leverages strengths of each institution, coupling theoretical and experimental tools in a useful way.  In addition to producing research, this partnership has been successful at moving minority students into the STEM work force.  Funds in this award will be used to continue graduate student stipends, and to continue undergraduate and REU student support.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nDynamics associated with heterogeneous materials, which are controlled by multiple forces, is poorly understood. The difficulty is that interactions involve a range of length scales, from single molecules in condensation processes to colloidal patterns in granular materials. This lack of understanding hinders the development of many applications, such as inkjet printers and coating systems. The work funded here couples experimental, theoretical and simulation tools to help understand the controlling forces at a fundamental level.\r\n",
