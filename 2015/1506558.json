 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the Chemistry Division is supporting Professor John Grey of the University of New Mexico to study spin-dependent processes in self-assembled polymeric systems. Conjugated polymers are large chains consisting of a basic molecular repeat unit that absorb light and conduct charges making them excellent candidates for next-generation optoelectronic applications. For example, these so-called 'plastic' semi-conductors are used in solar cells and light emitting displays, which may eventually replace existing technologies owing to their ever increasing efficiencies over the last 10 years and relatively low cost.  The ways in which the polymer chains fold and pack in thin films has a significant impact on the overall performance of organic solar cells and light-emitting devices (OLEDs).  The proposed research will use new strategies to fabricate ordered polymer structures and study how electrical charges are formed and how electrical current can be generated more efficiently in the resulting films.  In addition, the PI and his NSF-sponsored graduate students actively participate in ongoing educational and research infrastructure development programs at the University of New Mexico. These activities include coordinating with the local Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies (CINT) to increase the participation of undergraduate and graduate researchers through collaboration with CINT staff scientists.  Students take part by writing user proposals that undergo peer review thus providing valuable experience in designing and executing an independent research project.   Lastly, student participants gain valuable and diverse skill sets in academic fields essential for national interests. \r\n\r\nThe interactions between and inter-conversion of electrically neutral (exciton) and charged (polaron) states of different spin in conjugated polymer materials has significant bearing on their overall performance in cutting-edge optoelectronic devices, such as solar cells.  Although the outcomes of these processes are strongly dependent on polymer structure, detailed molecular level structure-function relationships have proven difficult to obtain from conventional polymer functional forms (i.e., bulk thin films).  This difficulty originates from morphological heterogeneity due to intrinsic molecular weight poly-dispersity of polymers.  The proposed research seeks to overcome heterogeneity effects to understand how molecular structure regulates interactions and inter-conversion of excitonic and polaronic spin states.  Self-assembly approaches are used to fabricate well-defined polymer aggregate supramolecular nanostructures that can be exploited to selectively control conformational and packing (intra- and interchain) order and electronic coupling.  The Grey group at the University of New Mexico has pioneered this approach to direct exciton coupling and polaron interactions in polymer aggregates that are leveraged in the proposed research to address longstanding fundamental questions involving spin state exchange interactions and crossover in polymeric semiconductors.  This research also takes new directions for interrogating the fates and interactions of different spin states in individual polymer nanostructures by introducing sensitive and selective electric- and magnetic-field dependent molecular spectroscopic and imaging techniques.  The research aims to establish design rules for reliably tuning subtle polymer chain packing and order within supramolecular assemblies to understand and control exchange interactions and spin state inter-conversion for improved material performance.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPolymeric semiconductor molecules have demonstrated considerable promise for next-generation optoelectronic devices, such as, solar cells. However, the intrinsically disordered nature of these systems at the materials level (e.g., device active layers) makes reliable control of charge and energy flow very difficult.  This aspect also presents enormous challenges for implementing new strategies to exceed classical performance limts which typically seek to harvest a larger fraction of electrical energy from absorbed light energy.  The goal of this research is to understand how molecular structure, including conformation and packing characteristics, impact the relaxation characteristics once a polymer molecule absorbs a photon.  In order to accomplish this goal, we investigate light-induced processes at the single molecule level as well as using new strategies to selectively control structural properties of polymers in order to generate reliable structure-function correlations.  We are particularly interested in understanding how structural order in a polymer determines how energy dissipates both directionally and temporally.  This information has traditionally been inaccessbile because of extreme heterogeneity in the manner in which polymer chains can fold and pack in typical solid state functional forms employed in devices. \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit of the proposed activity.\n\nBy studying one molecule at a time and in environments typically encountered in actual functioning devices, we are able to peer into the complex entanglement between structure and the nature in which absorbed light energy moves within polymers.  We can then build in complexity to better simulate actual materials environments which also have shed new light on longstanding conundrums involving unexpected changes in the manner in which energy relaxes in polymer materials.  Among these include, i) large fluctuations in relaxation pathways following light absorption between the molecular- and materials level, ii) the co-existence of excited states of different electrical and magnetic properties, and iii) the contributions of structural (vibrational) relaxation to key electronic processes.  \n\n \n\nBroader impacts of the proposed activity.\n\nOver the duration of this award, the PI and his students have uncovered new insights into the specific dependences between structure and electronic spin changes.  Not only has this work benefitted the burgeoning field of organic electronics but it has also generated new collaborations with biological chemists that utilize the unique capabilities introduced and refined over the award period. Student participants in this research gain valuable experience in cutting-edge spectroscopy, materials science and theoretical techniques.  The PI has also leveraged the overarching goals of the research (e.g., light energy harvesting) to attract underrepresented and female student participants.  In addition, the PI serves as the faculty advisor for student veteran groups on the UNM campus and has actively sought to enhance the experience of student veterans in STEM courses. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John K Grey"
