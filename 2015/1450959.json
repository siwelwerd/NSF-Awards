 "awd_abstract_narration": "The GLORIAD/InSight program is a global, open-source software development effort to research and experimentally deploy advanced flow-level network measurement technologies at various levels of the research and education (R&E) network eco-system.  The tools developed will enable far-reaching research towards better understanding network utilization, identifying network application performance issues while carefully attending to differing community concerns and requirements regarding data privacy and security. Experimental deployments will showcase actionable analytics and visualizations for network operations, new methods and models of data sharing across the global R&E fabric, and thus a better understood, more performant fabric. \r\n\r\nThrough a global, community-focused, open-source development effort, the project extends the current beta version of InSight - the flow-level passive measurement, analysis and visualization system in use on the GLORIAD network. The InSight tools are based on passive network measurement and monitoring by combining the rich detail of comprehensive, non-sampled, bi-directional, multi-model, multi-layer Argus flow-data with modern big-data analytic and visualization tools. A flexible stream-based method of enriching network flow metadata enables broader, customer-defined analytics.  Working closely with interested large-network providers, the project works toward experimentally deploying InSight on links up to 100 Gbps.",
