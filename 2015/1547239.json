 "awd_abstract_narration": "As new spectrum for data communication becomes available, it is increasingly important to develop cognitive network technologies that can opportunistically use spectrum whenever available and speak different wireless protocols on demand. Full duplex wireless is an exciting new technology that allows a node to send and receive simultaneously on the same spectrum. Despite significant progress, existing work on full duplex wireless focuses on narrowband production wireless systems, such as Wi-Fi and ZigBee. This project aims to develop novel systems and algorithms to embrace full duplex for cognitive networks and support different wireless technologies. The research will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate curriculum, and disseminated broadly to researchers, practitioners policy makers, high school students, parents, and teachers.\r\n\r\nThe project develops techniques that (i) go beyond narrowband and use novel cancellation mechanisms to enable transmit-while-sensing on a wider band spectrum, (ii) support cross technologies that transmit Wi-Fi while receiving LTE and vice versa, and (iii) translate physical layer advances to end-to-end performance benefits by re-visiting upper-layer protocol design. These three thrusts will enable a holistic full duplex cognitive radio platform.",
