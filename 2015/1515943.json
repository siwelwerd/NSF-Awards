The conference will be held in Mumbai, India, in January 2015. VMCAI is a conference that bridges the gap between the various methodologies that are used for formal verification. The conference has brought together two communities---namely, the model checking community and the abstract interpretation-based program analysis community---both of which were largely independent 15 years ago. Supporting student travel to attend professional conferences and workshops is a very important mission of the NSF. Verification technology is being rapidly deployed in a variety of areas both in academic research as well as in industrial systems. Thus the broader significance and importance includes fostering the next generation of researchers in this research area, as well as providing international experiences to build a globally-aware workforce. In particular, students will have the opportunity to learn state-of-the-art methodologies, be exposed to novel techniques, and interact with senior researchers in their areas of expertise.",
