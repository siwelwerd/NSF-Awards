 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implementation Projects in the Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate program provide support to design, implement, study and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the numbers of students and the quality of their preparation by strengthening science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and research. This implementation project at Livingston College, a small, private undergraduate institution, provides a strategic approach to recruit students into STEM degree programs and to provide a support system so that they are retained and persist toward graduation in a STEM major. Livingston College serves a majority of first-generation, low-income students. The project is guided and informed by an on-going evaluation, as well as by internal and external advisory committees.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks prepare students in their selected STEM major using curricula-based and extra-curricular-based methodologies that engage students, enhance learning, and develop skills. Learning opportunities will include project based learning and process skills laboratories, pedagogically sound instruction and content delivery, seminars and workshops for student scientific and professional development, and exploration of industry careers and graduate school. Additional mathematics, science, and computer information systems courses will be developed with emphasis on active and inquiry-based learning. A STEM summer bridge program will foster academic and social integration to facilitate students' adjustment to college and accelerate academic performance in gatekeeper courses. A freshman STEM learning community will be formed by clustering core mathematics and science courses. This project can serve as a model for small, predominantly undergraduate institutions with an open enrollment policy committed to providing educational opportunities to students and their families.",

A total of 31 students were recruited and participated in the STEM Undergraduate Program to Promote Opportunities in Research and Training (SUPPORT) program. Of the 31 students, 24 (77%) graduated with their bachelor?s degrees. Furthermore, 13 (54%) out of the 24 graduates, pursued master?s degrees or work in STEM areas. Additionally, the retention and persistency rates of the participants were significantly higher than non-participant STEM and non-STEM students. The persistency rate for participants was 85% and the retention rate was 77%. Also, this project improved academic performance and increased learning gains of STEM students. For instance, the average GPA (3.47) of the participants increased over the four years and was significantly higher than the average GPA (2.51) of non-participant STEM students.</p>\n<p>The SUPPORT program provided various professional development opportunities to our participants. These students received training in their chosen professions, attended workshops, took part in lunch and learn activities with STEM professionals, participated in career-based field trips, were mentored by STEM faculty members and engaged in research in their disciplines. Three of the participants presented research posters at the 2020 Emerging Researchers National (ERN) conference. Notably, one of our students, Tenecious Underwood, won first place in the Computer Sciences and Information Management category.</p>\n<p>During this project, engaging curricular was developed. Three courses were added and or revised to improve the research experience for the students. For instance, the CIS 432 Analytics course was enhanced with advanced data visualization and analytical techniques. This course is required for CIS STEM students. In comparison with students who had previously taken the course, the CIS SUPPORT students could classify data according to the level of measurements and apply appropriate data visualization techniques to the data. As a result, two SUPPORT students gained summer internships in Data Analytics.</p>\n<p>Additionally, STEM faculty members received professional development for effective teaching and student learning in STEM. Moreover, the SUPPORT team hosted the Research, Reflection, and Readiness (R-cubed), Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL), and Teaching Technologies workshops. During these workshops, attendees received training on how to utilize Rocketbook technology within the classroom, how to use the OkioLabs Document Reader, and how to facilitate Process-Oriented Group Inquiry learning (POGIL). Also, faculty members produced POGIL activities to utilize in their respective courses. Furthermore, one professor received a Ph.D. in Data Science and several others are currently enrolled in Doctoral and Master's programs. Notably, ten scholarly papers were published during the grant period.</p>\n<p>The college experienced a heighted awareness of STEM disciplines through campus wide STEM activities and demonstrations. For example, the STEM participants hosted three college assemblies showcasing their research and experiences. In addition, the SUPPORT team hosted our inargrual Ideas and Innovations to Inspire (I-Cubed) event in the fall of 2019. This symposium showcased student research and course-based innovations to the entire campus. Furthermore, over 115 faculty, staff, and students participated in this event.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the project, the college renovated the science building and added a state-of-the-art annex which includes new chemistry and biology laboratory facilities, smart classrooms, and a planetarium.
