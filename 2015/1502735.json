 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microscopic fungi (microfungi) represent a diverse assemblage that is distributed worldwide and includes bread molds, plant pathogens, powdery mildews, rusts, slime molds, and water molds. A large percentage of these organisms are harmless or even beneficial, but some cause disease and death in animals, plants, and other fungi resulting in major economic loss and serious negative implications for human and ecosystem health. Despite their importance, little is known about their distribution, diversity, ecology, or host associations. This project is a collaborative effort involving 38 institutions in 31 states and aims to consolidate data from specimens housed in biodiversity collections for 2.3 million microfungi specimens and make these data available through online resources. The consolidation and increased accessibility of these data is critical to inform and promote new and innovative research, education and community engagement around this little-known but important group of organisms.\r\n\r\nSpecimen data generated by this project will be used to assess natural and human-induced environmental changes on microfungi distributions, and evaluate the impact of these changes on the function and health of ecosystems. This project fills a critical gap in the national digitization effort by contributing images, digitizing specimen label data, and linking associated ancillary data for over 1.2 million North American specimens of microfungi. Additionally, nomenclature and taxonomic information will be updated to reflect the newest practices as dictated by the International Codes for Nomenclature. These data will provide a foundation for making informed decisions by agribusinesses, educators, forest managers, government agencies, horticulturalists, policy makers, researchers, and the general public. The broader education goals of this project will be facilitated through the development and implementation of a teaching module for high school biology on the economic importance of microfungi. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "MiCC Outcomes \n\nMicrofungi represent a major group of fungi that are difficult or impossible to see with the unaided eye and differ from macrofungi, which produce large, fleshy mushrooms.  Microfungi are found throughout the world and include such things as bread molds, plant pathogens, powdery mildews, rusts, slime molds, and water molds.  Many are harmless, but some cause disease and death of animals, plants, and other fungi resulting in major economic loss and serious negative implications for human and ecosystem health.  Despite their importance, little is known about the distribution, diversity, ecology, or hosts of microfungi throughout the United States.  This project was a collaborative effort among 38 institutions in 31 states to make these data available for 2.3 million specimens of microfungi through an online data portal known as the Mycology Collections Portal (https://mycoportal.org/).  Over 1.8 million images for 1.3 million specimens were created during this project and an additional 2.2 million existing records were added to the MyCoPortal.  These microfungi records serve as a major resource to scientists, students and citizen scientists and have been cited in over 100 peer-reviewed publications, including the first checklist of North American fungi.  National and regional species lists developed through this project have provided the foundation for making informed decisions by agribusinesses, educators, forest managers, government agencies, horticulturalists, policy makers, researchers, and the general public.  Since over 800,000 of these records have been georeferenced, large-scale mapping allows species distributions to be visualized to better understand hot spots of microfungi diversity.  This project has not only raised the profile of microfungi as organisms of great biological, ecological and economic importance but also the profile of collections and their associated digitization efforts that provide real value for science and conservation.\n\nThe large amount of specimen data generated through this project can now be used to explore the impact of environmental change on microfungi and how such changes may affect the function and health of ecosystems.  Critical questions concerning the impact of environmental and human-induced factors on the distributions of microfungi, the potential for early detection of invasive species, and the affect of climate change models on future patterns of microfungal distribution can now be addressed.  This project provides numerous benefits to the broader scientific community by unlocking a biodiversity resource for systematic, taxonomic, and genomic research, standardizing voucher specimen data in public sequence databases, and providing a framework for other data repositories to update their fungal nomenclature.  This project has served as an excellent opportunity to train the next generation of collection managers and curators in the latest digitization techniques through the employment and training of 280 people including 149 undergraduate students and 19 graduate students.  A workshop was presented that provided training opportunities for middle, high school and pre-service teachers and undergraduate students. This workshop incorporated the MyCoPortal in addressing the project\u2019s thematic questions regarding microfungi as invasive species, pathogens of plants and components of the soil ecosystem.  A series of 16 how-to guides have been created in English and Spanish to instruct participants on all aspects of our digitization workflow.  The digital image equipment, workflows and training of staff from this project translates into a continuation of the project long after the funding ends at each institution.  These efforts will greatly benefit future research in biogeography, ecology, genomics, plant pathology, and taxonomy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/24/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew N Miller"
