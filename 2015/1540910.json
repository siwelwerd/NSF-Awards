From a variety of disciplines (biology, economics, engineering, management science, archaeology, anthropology, physics, mathematics) scholars have seriously engaged with the origins and dynamics of innovation in human societies and organizations, across time and across scale (from cities to firms to national economies) informed by complexity science The objective is to assess how useful the concept has been, and whether a general and formal framework of innovation as search can be built that would be useful to policy.",
