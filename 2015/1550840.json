The workshop gathered input from numerous Earth scientists on future research and facility needs for advancing the understanding of Earth processes that generate movement of Earth's tectonic plates, earthquakes, gravity, tidal motions, the motion of ice sheets, and other phenomena.  Two large multi-user facilities supported by NSF currently provide instrumentation, networks, data, and educational materials for this kind of deep-earth research.  As the multi-year operational agreements for these facilities will expire in 2018, NSF is preparing to recompete one or more Cooperative Agreement(s) to support management and operation of future facilities with these kinds of capabilities.  Continuing to advance research on Earth processes through multi-user access to a range of technologies, data, and networks will enhance opportunities for scientific collaboration among a broad research community, increase understanding of changes in the behavior of the Earth, and help to inform decision making regarding preparation for and adaptation to these changes.  Additional, independent opinions from the experts convened by the Academies is helping to strengthen the scientific framework for the recompetition of these facilities and thus support key research on deep-earth processes, their results and impacts.   \r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nThe Division of Earth Sciences in the Directorate for Geosciences at the National Science Foundation (NSF) currently supports two large multi-user facilities, the Geodesy Advancing Geosciences and EarthScope (GAGE) Facility and the Seismological Facilities for Advancement of Geosciences and EarthScope (SAGE), that provide geodetic, seismic, and geophysical instrumentation, data and data management, network operations, education, and workforce training to a broad research community.  GAGE and SAGE operate global and regional networks of continuously operating geodetic, seismic, and related geophysical instrumentation; portable seismic, geodetic, and related geophysical instrumentation; systems for archiving, managing, and distributing geophysical data; they also develop education and outreach materials for various audiences.  NSF is preparing to recompete Cooperative Agreement(s) for these kinds of research facilities and recently funded a workshop to identify key scientific questions and facility needs for future seismic and geodetic research.  This project is bringing together an ad hoc \"meeting of experts\" with backgrounds in solid Earth science and particular expertise in seismology, geodesy, geodynamics, active tectonics, structural geology, and natural hazards to discuss and provide individual, expert opinions on the NSF-generated report from that workshop. The experts are focusing particularly upon science and research questions posed by the community at the workshop; the types of seismic and geodetic facilities that are essential to support this research; and education, outreach, training, and workforce development opportunities provided by such research and the associated facilities.",

The science of these processes involves disiciplines such as seismology and geodesy, the understanding of which can help scientists and decision makers to develop better approaches for anticipating, mitigating, and responding to different kinds of Earth hazards and processes.\n\nThe project supported by NSF involved the Academies' convening a \"meeting of experts\" to review and provide individual, expert opinions about an NSF-generated report from a workshop on seismic and geodetic research and facilities, held in May 2015.  The workshop report, written by attendees at the workshop, was to be used by NSF to help develop a solicitation to support multi-disciplinary, multi-user facilities in geodsy and seismology.  The situation for this kind of infrastructure will reach a key phase in September 2018 when the cooperative agreements supporting the current facilities supported by NSF, the Geodesy Advancing Geosciences and EarthScope (GAGE) and the Seismological Facilities for Advancement of Geosciences and EarthScope (SAGE), are set to expire.\n\nFor this project, 6 experts were identified and vetted through an extensive nomination process organized by the Academies and its Committee on Seismology and Geodynamics.  The experts had backgrounds in seismology and earthquake physics, geodesy, geodynamics, active tectonics, structural geology, mineral physics, and earthquake and volcano monitoring and modeling.  The expert group met one afternoon in late October with NSF staff at NSF headquarters.  Each expert shared approximately 10 minutes of opening remarkds which addressed some of the following elements of the Leesburg report:\n\n(1) Science and research questions posed by the community at the workshop;\n\n(2) The types of seismic and geodetic facilities that are essntial to support this reserach; and\n\n(3)  Education, outreach, training, and workforce development opportunities provided by such facilities.\n\nThe ensuing discussion with NSF staff also included dialogue about future seismic and geodetic facility needs.\n\nThe indepedendent input the experts provded preceded NSF's announcement of the solicitation for proposals and complemented other community-based input NSF had sought and received about the future of these facilities.  The input from the experts was considered by NSF in the final program solicitation for \"Management and Operation of the National Geophysical Observatory for Geoscience (NGEO)\", issued in early 2016, which calls for proposals to manage and operate one or more components of a \"distributed, multi-user, national facility for the development, deployment, management, and operational support of modern geodetic, seismic, and related geophysical instruments and services.\"\n\nGiven the importance to the earth sciences of NSF's support for the management and operation of these kinds of facilities, the Academies-appointed experts also provided early information regarding the science questions such facilities could help to answer.   Continuing to advance research through a range of these kinds of technologies, data, and networks will incraese understanding of changes in the behavior of the soild Earth.  The information provided through this project also helped contribute to the transfer of seismological and geodetic knowledge to areas of public welfare and national need.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Elizabeth..."
