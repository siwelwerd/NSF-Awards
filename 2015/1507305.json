The conference web page is http://www3.nd.edu/~conf/LieConf15/. This conference will bring together junior and senior researchers engaged in mathematical research related to the intersection of and interaction between the fields of algebra, geometry, and theoretical physics. The broader impacts are twofold: training of younger scientists and dissemination of new results and techniques. Expository talks by senior researchers will introduce junior researchers to the frontiers of mathematical research in the topics of the conference. The conference will provide an excellent setting for the exchange of ideas and for developing new collaborations. \r\n\r\nThis conference is intended to be an important occasion for deepening and developing our understanding of  Lie algebras, vertex algebras, quantum groups, and related structures from several different perspectives (algebraic, combinatorial and geometric), with some emphasis given to those fields of mathematics in which James Lepowsky and Robert Wilson made significant contributions. This conference is a necessary component in the timely development of these and related areas, especially in view of rapid developments in theoretical physics. The focus of this conference will be on the following topics: Representation theory of Lie algebras and quantum groups; Vertex operator algebras and their representations; and applications of Lie algebras, quantum groups and vertex operator algebras to other areas of mathematics and mathematical physics.",
