 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data Science is emerging as a highly popular academic degree program type both at undergraduate and graduate levels. Even a quick review of existing programs reveals that there are many different interpretations of data science, and the existing programs vary significantly in terms of their learning objectives and curricula. The programs are offered by many different schools and departments, including computer science, mathematics, statistics, computational science, information science, and business. This workshop will bring together experts from key academic communities that are offering data science degrees and the most important academic and professional societies that have demonstrated a long-term interest in supporting the academic community's efforts in developing effective curricula. The purpose of the workshop is to explore the current state of data science education and discuss actions that will best move the field forward. The results will be reported widely to both academic and practitioner communities, and they will serve as a foundation for further discussion and possible model curriculum development efforts.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will bring together leaders in curriculum development with expertise and interest in data science to explore the opportunities for developing some level of guidance for new and evolving programs of study. The questions are complex, involving interdisciplinary issues as well as variation in what aspects of the field are appropriate in different disciplinary settings. Workshop participants will attempt to establish basic guidelines for further curriculum development efforts. The result will be an exploration of the current state of data science education and a set of actions that will move the field forward.",
