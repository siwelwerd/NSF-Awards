The goal of the conference is to foster a scholarly community focused on collaborative research into the nature of climate and the impacts of climate and climate change on society. The conference will bring together students with diverse academic and personal background and offers a supportive atmosphere where they can learn from one another. This opportunity allows graduate students to familiarize themselves with the breadth of climate science as well as the enormous range of tools available to help answer complex questions. Participation from diverse members of the graduate climate science community will be sought. A significant lasting impact of this conference is the participants' interaction with their contemporary early-career colleagues; providing this contact information will increase the speed at which scientific progress can be made by facilitating graduate students with a professional network of young climate scientists.",
