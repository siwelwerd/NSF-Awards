 "awd_abstract_narration": "Supernova events, the explosion of stars, play an essential role in the Universe. These events are incredibly bright, but rare, seen only once every 100 years in our galaxy. Because these events create all the elements important for formation of life, planets and the next generations of stars, the investigator plans to study the material ejected (Supernova Remnants or SNRs) after the explosions, which may be studied many thousands of years after the explosions.\r\n\r\nThe investigator will combine available radio, infrared, optical, x-ray and gamma-ray data to produce an consistent survey of the 371 known SNRs in our galaxy. The investigator and her team will employ a quantitative approach which is critical to compare these complex sources and to maximize the scientific utility of the data. The project is the first large-scale effort to analyze these observations in a systematic way, using mathematical tools and hydrodynamic simulations developed by the authors. This research will provide crucial insights regarding the nature of Supernova explosions, the chemical enrichment of galaxies, and the complex interaction between Supernova ejecta and the gas and magnetic fields in our galaxy.\r\n\r\nThe investigator will expand the existing Ohio State physics department Masters-to-PhD bridge program to include the astronomy department. The goal of this program is to improve diversity and inclusion in PhD programs, and expanding this initiative to the astronomy department will enable under-represented minorities students to gain research experience and mentorship in astronomy. Her team will network and recruit students from minority-serving institutions.",
