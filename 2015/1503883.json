 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project concerns the analysis of the patterns that emerge when a simple geometric construction is repeated indefinitely. An example of a geometric problem having to do with the arrangement of shapes in space is: If one (endlessly) glues together equilateral triangles so that 7 triangles go around each vertex, is it possible to embed the resulting surface in 3-dimensional space?  An example of a problem having to do with geometric shapes in the plane is to determine the possible shapes swept out by the path of a frictionless ball as it rolls (endlessly) around the inside of a polygonal table and bounces off the sides. Such processes occur both in nature and in a purely abstract mathematical context, and often produce mysterious, intricate, and beautiful patterns. These processes have connections to number theory, geometry, and physics. This research project studies these processes via numerical simulation to generate hypotheses that are subsequently confirmed or disproved via rigorous mathematical justification.\r\n\r\nSpeaking more technically, the principal investigator will continue investigations into geometric dynamics, concentrating on polytope exchange transformations and outer billiards. One common theme in this work is the construction of higher dimensional compactifications of non-compact low-dimensional dynamical systems. Another common theme is the appearance of renormalization phenomena. In the situation of interest, one has a fiber bundle where the base space is the parameter space and each fiber is a polytope exchange transformation based on the parameter it lies over. The goal is then to find an auxiliary transformation of the base space which relates the dynamics at the fiber over one point to the dynamics of the fiber over the image of the point under the transformation. For instance, this seems to happen when one studies the symbolic dynamics of a process, and this project aims to find a general theory for this. The principal investigator will also study a number of geometric iterations, such as the pentagram map, a projectively natural map on the space of polygons that is related to integrable systems and cluster algebras. Finally, the principal investigator plans to attack a number of longstanding unsolved problems in geometry, such as the square peg conjecture.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the period of this award I continued to study various\n\nproblems in geometry and dynamical systems.  I made\n\nprogress in three main directions.  I will talk about\n\neach of these in turn.   \n\n \n\nFirst, I considered the combinatorial properties of outer\n\nbilliards on polygons,. Outer billiards is a game similar to ordinary\n\nbilliards, except that the ball travels around the outside\n\nthe polygonal table, glancing off the corners according to\n\nthe following rule.  A person walking from the current location\n\nof the ball to the next location would move on a line\n\nsegment, keeping the table to the right,  so that a corner of\n\nthe table lies at the exact center of the line segment.\n\nWhen one moves from position to position, generally\n\ncirculating around the table clockwise, one\n\nrecords the sequence of corners encountered.\n\nFor my first project I construced a kind of model which\n\npredicts which vertices are encountered, depending on\n\nthe shape of the polygon and the starting point, when the\n\npolygon is a quadrilateral.   My model reveals a kind\n\nof fractal nature to the sequences, depending on the\n\nnumber theory associated to the coordinates of the\n\npolygon vertices.\n\n \n\nSecond, I considered how five particles will arrange themselves\n\non the sphere so as to minimize their total potential energy\n\nwhen it is computed with respect to a power law.  Some\n\nexperimental work done about 40 years ago  by Melnyk\n\nKnopf and Smith suggested that when the exponent of\n\nthe power law is less than about 15.05, the answer should\n\nbe the triangular bi-pyramid and then the answer changes\n\nto a pyramid-with-square base for larger power law exponents.\n\nThis phenomenon is a simple example of a phase change\n\nin physics or chemistry.   Through a combination of\n\ntheoretical arguments and computer assisted proof, I\n\nrigorously established the existence of this phase change.\n\n \n\nThird, I studied problems related to the famous Toeplitz\n\nsquare peg conjecture, which asserts that one can always\n\nfind 4 points contained in any continuous loop in the plane\n\nwhich make the vertices of a square.  Such a square would\n\nbe called an inscribed square.  Relatedly,  a rectangle inscribed\n\nin a continuous loop would be a collection of four points in\n\nthe loop which make the vertices of the rectangle. I proved that, for\n\nany continuous loop in the plane, all but at most 4 points\n\nare vertices of an inscribed rectangle.  This result does\n\nnot solve the square peg conjecture, but it shows that\n\ninscribed rectangles are very common in continuous loops.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/09/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard Schwartz"
