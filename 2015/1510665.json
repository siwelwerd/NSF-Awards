 "awd_abstract_narration": "1510665\r\nStensel\r\n\r\nThis research project merges two major needs in wastewater management, the recovery and reuse of phosphorus, a nonrenewable essential element for all life, and the need for nitrogen and phosphorus removal to protect surface water quality, with a dramatic development in aerobic granular sludge that offers many advantages over the older more established flocculent activated sludge process. The research objectives are centered around the evaluation of granular sludge to be developed in two process design innovations that facilitate enhanced phosphorus biological removal by retrofitting of existing activated sludge facilities to granular sludge. The work is transformative in that it is a totally different approach to improve nutrient removal of conventional biological process applications while providing a cost effective phosphorus recovery and a sustainable engineering approach. The project will benefit society in the area of food production and economics by providing phosphorus recovery for reuse in an immediate area and to provide a means to slow down the long-term depletion of phosphorus reserves.\r\n\r\nThe key research needs are related to process conditions that select for granular sludge and affect the granular sludge microbial and physical characteristics. Key specific objectives are as follows: 1) test hypotheses on how to select and maintain granular enhanced phosphorus biological removal sludge in the retrofit designs, 2) determine the microbial ecology and long term integrity of granular sludge produced, 3) determine the effect of the relative and uncoupled flocculent and granular sludge solids retention times and dissolved oxygen control strategy on their microbial populations phosphorus and nitrogen removal abilities, and, 4) determine the rate of phosphorus release and attainable phosphorus concentration possible in a waste sludge phosphorus stripping tank. To meet these objectives laboratory reactors will be designed and operated to simulate a granular sludge system for phosphorus removal only and the use of granular sludge in an activated sludge biological nutrient removal system retrofit. Fundamental molecular biology technique will be used to evaluate the granular sludge microbial populations and microscopic and other physical test methods will be used to assess the granules size, density and strength. Process performance data for enhanced phosphorus biological removal, nitrification, and denitrification will be obtained. The proposed project will be important for attracting under represented and female students to a career in engineering with interest in solving important issues of water supply, environmental protection and resource recovery for the public. The project through collaboration with an EPA nutrient management center and the Water Environment Research Foundation will advance new cost effective technology to a wider audience including design engineers, regulators and utilities. A very important impact of the project is in providing a greater opportunity for recovery of phosphorus, a finite and essential element for all life.",

Phosphorus recovery is an important environmental engineering challenge in the face of depleting global phosphorus reserves. The current technology for phosphorus recovery at WWTP requires anaerobic digesters, which are not used at most WWTPs.</p>\n<p>Aerobic granules are dense biofilm aggregates of bacteria. The denser structure and larger size allow granules to settle much faster to greater thickness compared to conventional activated sludge treatment with flocculent sludge (Figure 1). Thus, innovative aerobic granular sludge (AGS) technology allows for high phosphorus and nitrogen removal with reduced tank volume and smaller treatment plant footprint. &nbsp;Investigation of methods to apply this technology to existing activated sludge systems is at a beginning stage. The goal of this project was to investigate an integration of AGS technology for application to existing activated sludge systems and to use the unique features of AGS treatment for phosphorus recovery without anaerobic digestion. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Phosphorus recovery at WWTPs requires the production of a phosphate-rich stream to meet concentration-driven kinetics for precipitation of struvite (MgNH<sub>4</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> ?6H<sub>2</sub>O) crystals, which is a proven fertilizer. Conventionally, this high phosphate concentration is achieved with anaerobic digestion to break down the sludge by which phosphorus is released from the biomass into the liquid phase. Using lab-cultivated aerobic granules, we obtained a phosphate-rich stream by holding thickened aerobic granular sludge from an aerobic treatment process for 24 hours. The specific P release was 0.01 ? 0.02 g P/gVSS for granular sludge, which is similar to previous work with conventional activated sludge. However, because of the ability to rapidly thicken the granular sludge to much higher concentration the released phosphorus concentration is well above the critical concentration needed for struvite production and similar or higher to what is known from anaerobic digesters. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>AGS technology has been applied at WWTPs using sequencing batch reactors (SBRs) but most existing systems use continuous-flow activated sludge (CFAS) treatment and conversion to SBR process is very difficult. An innovative operation scheme to integrate granular sludge into existing CFAS system was developed and simulated with lab-scale reactors (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) are an important group of bacteria needed for biological phosphorus removal/recovery and are also important for developing granular sludge. The innovative operation scheme utilizes a granule selector that gives PAO granules a competitive advantage over the flocculent sludge. The operational scheme was simulated in our laboratory studies to develop a combined granule and floc system while maintaining greater than 90% phosphorus and ammonia removal.</p>\n<p>A major goal of this project was to determine design and operating conditions that select for granules in activated sludge systems. We used a different approach to the recommended method to observe the physical characteristics of activated sludge and applied it to view samples from 16 full-scale CFAS plants. We discovered that CFAS systems that were designed to grow PAOs had some portion of their activated sludge with granular morphology (Figure 4). Due to their small sizes in comparison to that from engineered systems to grow granules, we called them ?baby granules?. The CFAS plants with these granules has exceptional settling and thickening ability. These baby granules had to be present in certain types of CFAS facilities for many decades, but we are the first to observe and report their presence. &nbsp;We also found that the fraction of granules in the activated sludge varied for different plants (Figure 4) and the sludge with higher granule content settled and thickened better. Results from these field studies increased our understanding of design and operational factors that favor granule growth. These included more than one initial anaerobic staging with a high feed soluble carbon to activated sludge ratio for that stage. Microbial community analyses also showed that the PAOs were more abundant in the granules than in flocs, confirming their importance for granule growth at CFAS plants. The knowledge gained will be useful for advancing AGS technology and phosphorus recovery to existing full-scale CFAS systems.</p>\n<p>Over the entire life of the award, we have attracted underrepresented minority students and woman to engineering, fostering research for 6 undergraduate and graduate students to produce high quality graduates. Some of these students have continued their career in the environmental engineering field by working in environmental consulting confirms or receiving their own fellowship to continue doing research in wastewater treatment.
