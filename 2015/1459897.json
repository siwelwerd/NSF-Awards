 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project develops and analyzes a new model of how unemployment can affect lifelong earnings.  The project plans to test a new explanation for the following widely observed facts.  First, for most workers, wages grow over time, whether that is measured as total time in the workforce or time in the current job.  Second, workers who have been unemployed at some point in their work careers often find that their later earnings from employment lag behind the earnings of other workers.  The PI has developed an economic model where firms vary in productivity and the on-the-job training provided to workers.  Workers at productive firms are more likely to avoid unemployment and also gain more skills, which increases their future wages.  The research team will test the model using an innovative data set.  The project advances science in macroeconomics and labor economics.  Because the research may lead to new understanding about the long-run costs of unemployment to American workers, it will contribute to better policies for promoting national prosperity.\r\n\r\nThe work explores the interaction between human capital accumulation and labor market frictions as first order determinants of wage dynamics.  While these are frequently viewed as competing explanations of labor market outcomes, the core idea here is that they work together and the two forces can combine to cause persistence in the response of wages to shocks.  Through the presence of firm heterogeneity, frictions can impact the rate of human capital accumulation, with different firms providing different levels of training.  As such, frictions do not only introduce dispersion in the return to current skills but are also themselves determinants of dispersion in future skill outcomes.  The estimation methodology is based on simulation-based methods and will use micro panel data.",
