Recognizing the vital importance of renewable energy to the long term sustainability of the US energy portfolio and the substantial role that wind energy plays in new power generation capacity, this program provides a unique research experience for undergraduate students to play a role in shaping the US energy future. Research projects are designed to motivate and prepare students for graduate research in science and engineering.  Participants will leave with a greater understanding and appreciation of the importance that wind energy plays in meeting national renewable goals and the rewarding research career opportunities available.  The program builds on existing relationships with HBCUs and universities in Puerto Rico as well as Iowa State University programs for broadening participation of traditionally underrepresented groups in science and engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nIn 2012, for the first time, wind energy accounted for the largest portion of new generating capacity in the US, exceeding new natural gas generation capacity. However, when compared with other nations that are increasing their wind energy portion of energy production, the US ranked 12th with less than 6% of total electric generating capacity. The project addresses a critical, long-term national need to increase the availability of cost-effective renewable energy that will help reduce our carbon footprint, water usage, and meet future energy demands. The WESEP research program includes five research areas: (1) Wind energy resource characterization and aerodynamic loads; (2) Wind energy conversion systems and grid operations; (3) Manufacturing, construction, and supply chain; (4) Reliability and turbine health monitoring; and (5) Politics and policy for wind energy. Individual projects will typically be tied to one or more ongoing ISU research team projects which are funded by a variety of agencies including NSF, DOE, Iowa Department of Economic Development, ISU, and industry partners. Because of its location, strength in wind energy related disciplines, and ongoing partnerships with industry, Iowa State University provides an intellectually challenging environment for interdisciplinary educational programs in WESEP. Participants in the WESEP REU program will learn: (1) how to conduct research as part of a collaborative research team; (2) how to present and publish their findings; (3) the role of ethics in research; (4) the technical and policy challenges in wind energy; and (5) that research can be a rewarding career path.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgement: This project is supported by the Division of Engineering Education and Centers at the National Science Foundation.",

Recognizing the vital importance of renewable energy to the long term sustainability of the US energy portfolio and the substantial role that wind energy plays in new power generation capacity, we provided a unique research experience for undergraduate students to play a role in shaping the US energy future.</p>\n<p>The primary objective of this program was to engage undergraduate students (from engineering and science programs) in high quality research experiences through an intellectually stimulating 10-week summer research program that focused on WESEP research issues. During the 10 week program, students learned about wind energy and the research process through a short course, conducted an independent research project using state-of-the-art equipment and software, were mentored by faculty and graduate students, contributed to a team research effort, engaged with the wind energy industry, and developed their communications skills.</p>\n<p>The WESEP REU program supported three separate cohorts of students for a total of 29 students from multiple engineering and science disciplines. Each REU participant joined a faculty-led research team and was assigned a research project that was within the scope of the 10 week program. Graduate students from the WESEP IGERT program provided mentoring on a daily basis to ensure that REU participants were making progress on their research. Research topics included the effects of icing on wind turbine blades, soft elastomeric sensor networks for structural health monitoring of wind turbine blades, permanent magnet topology for permanent magnet generators, bio-inspired blade designs to reduce wind turbine noise, vibration-based fault detection of gearbox failures, optimal design of wind and solar power generation for high-capacity power transmission, and end of life decision making for wind turbine components.</p>\n<p>To prepare REU participants for their research projects, the WESEP REU Short Course provided instruction in the first two weeks of the program on wind resources, aerodynamics, the research process, communications, research ethics, writing research proposals, wind energy manufacturing, wind energy policy, the power industry, power grid integration, power generation, structural health monitoring, and wind turbine towers and construction. To provide a broader educational experience, three field trips were organized each summer to visit wind energy related sites such as wind farms, power generation companies, and wind turbine manufacturers. Guest speakers from industry and government institutions presented lunch seminars on topics such as tax incentives, impacts on wildlife, electrical power pricing, wind energy cooperatives, and wind turbine maintenance.</p>\n<p>For each cohort, the Research Institute for Studies in Education performed an evaluation of the WESEP REU site to assess the effectiveness of the program. Pre- and post-program surveys were conducted and analyzed to learn about the students? (1) decision to take part in the program, (2) prior involvement in research projects, (3) prior participation in various research related activities, (4) perceptions on abilities related to research, (5) familiarity with various the processes that drive research, (6) knowledge about research related to WESEP, (7) perceived skill levels related to various research-related activities, (8) their plans for after graduation, and (9) the sector of employment they wish to pursue. The cohorts consistently showed significant increases in their understanding of wind energy technology, graduate degree and career options, the information to include in a research report, applying the scientific method, establishing objectivity in a project report, and analyzing and interpreting data. Basic changes in students? familiarity with various aspects of the research process were observed. Students felt more capable regarding literature research skills, guidelines for ethical research, and technical communication skills.</p>\n<p>One of our main project objectives was to recruit REU students such that at least 30% of the participants would be female or from traditionally underrepresented groups in engineering and science. We significantly exceeded this objective with 45% participation from female students and 40% from underrepresented groups. By tracking the academic and professional progress of the REU program participants, we found that a significant number (17%) had entered a graduate program. It should be noted that 38% of the REU participants are in the process of completing their undergraduate program. Therefore, the percentage of students pursuing graduate education is likely to increase.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/08/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
