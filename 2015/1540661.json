 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nA goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the body of knowledge about the importance and conduct of undergraduate and graduate research experiences in recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals. The connection of faculty to research and thereby the students to culturally and geographically relevant research is an important step in retaining students who are more likely to continue their studies and pursue advanced degrees. For those students entering the workforce directly from a tribal college it is equally important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce. \r\n\r\nLeech Lake Tribal College (LLTC) and University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) will collaborate to develop an earth systems science major at the tribal college, establish an educational continuum that will permit LLTC students to earn a BS in tribal resource management from UMD, and develop an ecosystem network and research agenda between the two institutions that will result in workforce opportunities for LLTC students, as well as greater community engagement in ecological issues that impact the reservation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAn Earth System's Science major was created at Leech Lake Tribal College (LLTC), with an emphasis on the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe reservation in Northern Minnesota.  The program incorporates indigenous science methodologies and community-based research projects.  A unique aspect of the program is the incorporation of an environmental monitoring system across the reservation in partnership with Leech Lake Division of Resource Management. Students have engaged in research projects with the reservation and with the US Forest Service.\n\nIn collaboration, University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) faculty have worked to design a Bachelor of Arts degree in Tribal Resource Management that can provide a 2+2 program for students wishing to transfer after their AA at LLTC as either a remote or on-campus student.  A program was developed and two courses with remote delivery with onsite support from LLTC faculty Neville were planned, but not delivered due to a change in scheduling at UMD in Spring 2019 and the Covid19 Pandemic in Spring 2020.  Additional institutional barriers were identified as part of this process, which will continue to inform UMD and LLTC in meaningful ways to address barriers to Native or Tribal college students transferring to 4-yr institutions.  While institutional barriers and the Covid19 Pandemic have slowed realization of the goal of enrolling and graduating LLTC students in a 2+2 program in Tribal Resource Management at UMD, much progress has been made in addressing barriers to Native students at the University of Minnesota through this project.\n\nIntellectual merit:  Collaboration on this effort is working towards identifying and solving barriers that exist preventing smooth transfer from Tribal colleges to universities. The most significant institutional barrier was the high cost of UMD relative to LLTC (three times as expensive) which turned away all interested students in the 2+2 program.  Breckenridge, Mooers, and Dalbotten have shared challenges with the cost of tuition with administrators and advisors of Native American affairs in support of a proposal of extending a tuition waiver for Native students at the University of Minnesota Morris to Native student at any University of Minnesota campus.

Breckenridge is a member of a committee that is focused on Native retention and transfer from Tribal colleges where this issue has been an area of focus and significant progress has been made with the support of the Dean of the UMD Swenson College of Science and Engineering.  \n\nBroader Impacts: Students from Leech Lake Tribal College are pursuing degrees in Earth System's Science.  As part of their program, students are actively engaged in research on tribal lands and in other national research programs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/18/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Diana M Dalbotten"
