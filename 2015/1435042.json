 "awd_abstract_narration": "WHOI proposes to acquire the needed high-resolution imaging systems (3 new, high-resolution digital deep-sea still color cameras and high-intensity deep-sea strobes) so that numerous UNOLS operators would have ready access to robust real-time, deep-sea digital still imaging capabilities for their multicorer systems. Seagoing technical personnel at four (4) UNOLS institutions (SIO,\r\nU. Hawaii, U. Washington, & WHOI) will be trained in operating the systems and in developing\r\n?best-practices? documentation for operating multicorers with imaging systems.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",
