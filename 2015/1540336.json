 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dogs were the first domesticated animal to be widely distributed through the Americas, and their long association with humans suggests that dogs and humans in the Americas may have migrated together. This project will analyze DNA from 100 skeletal dog remains from a wide variety of time periods and regions of the Americas. If the project demonstrates that dogs and humans in the Americas have similar genetic patterns, it is likely that dogs are a good proxy for human population and migration history in the Americas. Given the ethical concerns of excavating and performing destructive analysis on human remains in the Americas, using dogs as a substitute species would be a way to continue to address research questions about human population history while also being respectful of the wishes of the cultural or biological descendants of the human remains. Results from this project will be presented at the Summer Internship for Native Americans in Genomics (SING) workshop, a week-long workshop that brings together Native Americans who are interested in learning about the methods and ethics involved in genetic research. A partnership with the Illinois State Archaeological Survey will produce a virtual museum exhibit that discusses the project as well as relates to the public how genetic and archaeological data can be interpreted to learn more about human history.\r\n\r\nDog burials are widespread across the Americas, and ancient DNA analysis of dogs can be used to infer human population history and movements in cases where human remains are unavailable to study. Nearly all studies of ancient dogs have focused on the hypervariable region (HVR) of the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome), which has limitations as a reliable indicator of population history. Sequencing the complete mitogenome can clarify understanding of domesticated dogs in the Americas and their time of entry, and with the low cost of next-generation sequencing it is possible to reassess previous analyses of dogs in the Americas using mitogenome data in the place of HVR data. With access to dog remains from a broad geographic and temporal span, and an aim to sequence 100 dog mitogenomes to compare to published ancient dog (N=3) and wolf (N=40) mitogenomes, the investigators will assess whether dog and human demographic histories show similar patterns, and if dogs in the Americas derive from Eurasian or American wolves. Clarification of these points using mitogenome data contributes to a better understanding of human populations in the Americas and their demographic history, as well as the origins of dogs in the Americas.",

In this study, we sequenced 68 complete mitochondrial genomes of ancient dogs from 19 archaeological sites, ranging in age from 9000 to 800 years before present (ybp) to gain insight into the population history of dogs in the Americas. We measured the genetic diversity of each population sampled, compared the ancient dogs to modern dogs and wolves, and modeled demographic changes in the population over time. Contrary to previous research, we found that no ancient American genetic lineages are shared with modern dog lineages in the Americas, although the closest modern dog lineages are found in some Asian breeds and Chihuahuas. Additionally, consistent with some previous research, we found that dogs likely arrived in the Americas with the initial human entry into the Americas 15,000 - 20,000 years ago. We identified similarities between dog and human demographic histories, specifically regarding connections between Southeast and Midwest populations, and populations along the Pacific coast. We also found that an increase in dog population diversity in the Midwest coincides with an archaeological cultural transition and hypothesized movement of other populations into the Midwest during the Mississippian period. Sequencing complete mitochondrial genomes provides a clearer picture of dog population history in the Americas, as well as the connections between dog and human populations.
