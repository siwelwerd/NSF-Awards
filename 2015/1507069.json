Pratt\r\nProposal Number:  1507069\r\n\r\nBrown grease is a semi-solid mixture of fats, oils, and greases that collect in the sewage system and sewage treatment plants, and which must be collected and removed to prevent blockages, overflows, and damage to equipment.  The volume of this waste, somewhere between one and two billion gallons per year, is sufficient to consider its recycling into liquid transportation fuel as opposed to incinerating it, which produces greenhouse gases.  This goal of this project is develop a process to convert brown grease into a fuel similar to kerosene using a process called low-temperature pyrolysis, where the brown grease is heated up in absence of air. The research suggests that trace metals such as iron that are present in brown grease may promote the reaction process, and so the research plan will focus on determining which reaction steps in the overall process are catalyzed by these metals. The proposed research will be carried out by a team of undergraduate students at the Medgar Evers College of the City University of New York (CUNY), which is a minority serving institution.  Benefits of this research include increasing the supply of non-fossil fuels, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, elimination of brown grease disposal problems, and training of underrepresented minority students in chemistry, energy, and environmental science.  This project also has international collaborators from Malaysia and Vietnam that are interested in using the new technology to solve similar waste steam problems in their respective countries.\r\n\r\nUnlike triglycerides extracted from vegetable oils, brown grease is predominantly free fatty acids, and so cannot undergo the homogeneous transesterification to biodiesel.  The overall goal of the proposed research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanisms for the low-temperature pyrolysis of brown grease to linear hydrocarbons.   It is hypothesized that the reaction scheme proceeds by a two-step process were fatty acids in the waste stream are decarboxylated to ketone intermediates and then deoxygenated to hydrocarbons.  Furthermore, it is hypothesized that soluble iron or copper present in the waste matrix catalyzes some of these reactions.  The research plan has three objectives.  The first objective is to elucidate the major reaction pathways from brown grease and model mixtures of the waste matrix to hydrocarbon products.  The second objective is to determine how the principal metals found in brown grease catalyze these reactions. The third objective is to develop a continuous reaction process and assess the energy return on energy invested for sustainable energy concepts based on recovery and conversion of brown grease to fuel.  The experimental approach will employ gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and thermogravimetric analysis to characterize the reaction system.  Computational quantum chemistry will also be used to elucidate the reaction mechanisms and to help determine whether some compounds observed in the reaction mixture are byproducts or intermediates.  Although the research focuses on brown grease, the research outcomes have potential to develop new routes and fundamental understanding for the chemical conversion of free fatty acids to fuel.  The proposed research will be carried out by a team of undergraduate students at the Medgar Evers College of the City University of New York (CUNY), which is a minority serving institution.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBrown grease is an oily byproduct of the sewage treatment process.  It consists largely of fatty acids, which are potential precursors of biofuels from this low cost feed stock.  Our early work showed that heating brown grease while gradually increasing the temperature resulted in the formation of hydrocarbons as well as some byproducts.  These hydrocarbons are in the range of kerosene, jet fuel, and diesel fuel, with smaller amounts of heavier hydrocarbbons in the range of heavy heating oils.\n\nIn this project we investigated the reactions that occur when brown grease is heated with the goal of developing a process suitable for industrial scale.  A literature search revealed several known reactions of some of the brown grease components.  In a large set of experiments, both brown grease and its individual components were heated to temperatures between 250 and 350 degrees C, and the the reaction products were determined by gas chromatography coupled with a mass spectrometer (CGMS).  It was determned that known radicl reacttions of unsaturated fatty acids cause a breakdown of the carbon chains, forming hydrocarbons and shorter chain fatty acids.  This is true with pure oleic acid (an unsaturated fatty acid), as well as in mixtures of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids.  These fatty acids further react at higher temperatures where they give off carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide and further form hydrocarbons.  Under these conditions, a ketene intermediate also forms in small amounts, which further reacts with fatty acids to form undesirable ketone byproducts.  That was proven by traping the unstable ketene intermediate with aniline to form the stable amide, which was detected by GCMS.  \n\nIn a separate subproject, a continuous reactor was built to heat the brown grease to 350 degrees C and continuously produce hydrocarbons for fuel.  It was intended for the hydrocarons to distill out of the reactior, which initially happened.  However, the amount of hydrocarbon distillate quickly dropped off and analysis of the reactor contents showed large amounts of heavy hydrocarbons that boil too high to distill from the reactor.  Those are still useful as heavy heating oils, but they are less valuable than the desired kerosene, jet fuels, and diesel fuels.  Separate experiments on the laboratory scale showed that gradual heating of brown grease produces a more desirable product distribution compared to immediately heating at the higher temperature.  \n\nAlthough we now have a better understanding of the chemical reactions that occur, the product distribution is subject to the complex interplay between several cooperative or competing reactions.  A set of experiments in which the brown grease was pre-heated at different temperatures prior to pyrolysis showed partial distillation of residual water, which led to the hypothesis that water is detrimental to the optimum product distribution.  Further experiments showed that water is not the only factor, and the temperature and heating profile has a significant impact.  Formation of heavy oils and ketone byprodu ts was minimized by preheating the brown grease to 300 degrees, where fatty acid chain cleavage occurs.  This wa followed by reactions at higher temperature, which result in the final hydrocarbon products.  \n\nDuring the duration of this project, research training and experience was provided for numerous undergraduate students.  Most of those were underrepresented minorities.  Three students participated in international research internships with one of our colleagues in Malaysia.  A domestic summer internship was arranged for one student in 2018.  He performed research in wastewater analysis and remediation from the biodiesel process at American Green Fuels, a biodiesel company in New Haven, CT.  He had a wonderful experience and plans to pursue a Ph. D. in environmental science, environmental engineering, or a closely related field.  These research experiences go a long way toward preparing students for a tough job market upon graduation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lawrence M Pratt"
