 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organisms whose body temperature is set by the environment (such as fish, insects, and reptiles) are particularly sensitive to environmental change (which includes temperature, rainfall, food, and predators).  The principal researcher of this project has spent more than thirty years working on such organisms (especially salmon, krill, and wasps and economically important fruit flies, such as the Mediterranean fruit fly), always motivated by an important applied problem but at the same time seeking fundamental understanding of species population dynamics. In doing this work, the researcher has developed novel computer modeling methods, ways of connecting models and field and laboratory studies, and has both solved environmental problems as well as generated new understanding and research directions.  This project will provide the opportunity for a synthesis of the ideas developed over the researcher's career.  The result of the project will be a framework that can be used by other scientists, resource managers, and stakeholders for a better understanding species responses to climate change.\r\n\r\nDuring his long career, the principal researcher of this project has developed modeling approaches that link a) behavioral ecology and population biology, b) proximate and ultimate factors that shape behavior and life history of organisms, c) variation in individual behavior to population dynamics, d) evolution and ecology, and e) simultaneously address basic and applied questions. This work has made state dependent life history theory, as implemented by stochastic dynamic programming, one of the most powerful tools for understanding the effects of environmental change on ectotherms and for synthesizing the science needed for understanding and predicting the responses of ectotherms to environmental change.  The project will support the development of a major synthetic publication that will situate this theory with other approaches to understanding ectotherms in changing environments, using case studies to simultaneously highlight species in specific locations and to develop general principles.  Scientists often realize too late in their careers that they should have studied more quantitative methods and learned how to solve problems in biology using mathematical methods. The result of this project will be a source for people to learn how to hypothesize at the mechanisms behind observed patterns, and how to translate them into a living, breathing mathematical model that makes intuitive sense and yet reveals processes or trends that may not be intuitive.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported the writing of a book \"Ectotherms in Changing Environments: Working in Pasteur's Quadrant\", to be published by Princeton University Press.  Ectotherms are colloquially called 'cold-blooded' animals, because their body temperature is set by the external temperature  -- examples include insects, fish, amphibians and reptiles.  They will be senstive to changing temperature, but also other environmental factors such as rainfall and food availability.  Pasteur's Quadrant is the name that Donald Stokes gave to work that is inspired by an important applied problem and seeks fundamental understanding -- this is what Pasteur did through his entire career. \n\n \n\nThe resulting book is a kind of 'lessons learned' for colleagues based on Mangel's nearly 40 years of modeling the behavior and population dynamics of a variety of ectotherms, mainly salmon, southern ocean krill, and insects (particularly insect parasitoids, which are used in biological control).  In the book, the Mangel shows how modeling methods developed he developed [which link the physiological state of the organism with measures of Darwinian fitness]  for the study of these organisms link to other commonly used tools for the study of how ectotherms respond to changing climates.  The other tools include  physiology, population dynamics,  genetics, and the measurement of temperature-performance curves.  The majority of the chapters are about the specific links between the different modeling methods for studying organismal response to environmental change.  The end of the technical portion of the book is a chapter on potential case studies -- hoping to inspire young scientists to take up the charge.  However, since this book is a synthesis of the work of a career, it also includes a chapter on career advice for young scientists -- from undergraduate days to the first years after the PhD (and possibly beyond).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marc S Mangel"
