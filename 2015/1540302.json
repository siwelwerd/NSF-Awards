 "awd_abstract_narration": "This symposium will serve as a forum to examine in a retrospective manner the challenges facing science and engineering software and codes (SESCs) from inception, to deployment, to adoption. The focus of this one-day symposium is on topics related to computational aspects of material science. The overall objective is to identify common threads via shared experiences and success stories through a case-study approach and thereby offer new perspectives and insights about the genesis of contemporary scientific infrastructure. The longer term goals are to develop new educational and research programs in computational sciences, engineering, mathematics, and natural sciences that are more informed about expected challenges and more deliberate about contributing to new vibrant communities of computational scientific infrastructure creation.\r\n \r\nSpeakers will be featured from SESC development efforts that today have emerged into de facto standard tools for materials discovery and innovation.  The primary modeling scales relevant to materials science will be represented: quantum, molecular dynamics, mesoscale, materials information, and continuum.  They will serve as case studies ranging in years of development, level of physical description of the materials theory, degree of community adoption, and the sector that predominantly sees to the curation and maintenance. If a model for best-practices exists for creating, deploying, and maintaining SESCs, the intent of this symposium is to identify this model and fundamentally enable larger dialogues on Cyberinfrastructure, ICME, MGI, and the like. General attendees and observers can expect to learn the developmental, and often circuitous, histories of SESCs seen today as emergent or successful.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCECD/ME Symposium on Computation-Enabled Materials Discovery\n\nSummary Page\n\n \n\nA symposium was held on May 20, 2015 in the Center for Engineering Concepts Development, Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Maryland to take a retrospective look at some of the most prominent science and engineering software and codes (SESC) used today to discover and design materials.\n\nSignificant lessons can be learned, both scientifically and programmatically, from the experiences of the people and programs that have produced some of the present-day de facto infrastructure.\n\nInvited speakers were requested to speak on their current research interests, the experiences of the SESC capability they had a hand in developing and, in particular, the technical and programmatic challenges they overcame.  Questions they were requested to answer included: a) Identify the major periods in the life of the SESC? b) How did stakeholders change as developments matured? c) How did the teams and workforce change? d) Are some challenges unique to your sector (government, academia, industry)? e) What are the greatest virtues and worst threats? f) What is the intellectual property and which models for protection work? \n\nThe primary findings include:\n\nThe SESC life cycle is nonlinear. Related efforts can therefore be difficult to classify clearly as fundamental or applied research using existing taxonomy.\nPerformers, or the developers of SESCs, stretch across varied sectors.  No clear sector exclusively performs basic or applied (or beyond) research.\nStakeholders are diverse and can be well-defined as a function of the development maturity of the SESC.  Due to the nonlinear life cycle, stakeholders cannot be statically defined.\nSectors (government, academia, business) have strengths and weaknesses that are under-defined.  Some strengths are under-utilized.\nThe transition from \"algorithmic ideas\" to de facto infrastructure is not evident in less than 10 years.  \nOpen source licensing is a means to protect IP.  But serves large, complex SESC efforts best and may make potential privatization difficult in the future.\n\n\nSpeakers were selected for their acknowledged contributions to recent SESCs that may be considered a part of today\u00c6s infrastructure for materials discovery and innovation.  The invited speakers (and their presented efforts) included: Douglass Post (DoD CREATE), Robert J. Harrison (NWCHEM), Gerhard Klimeck (NEMO &amp; nanoHUB), Michael Mehl (NRL-TB), Steve Plimpton (LAMMPS), A. (Tom) Arsenlis (ParaDIS), Stefano Curtarolo (AFLOW), Rose McCallen (ALE3D), and Tom McGrath (DYSMAS).  Additional speakers were also invited that included distinguished faculty and scientists from the University of Maryland and government laboratories located near the University of Maryland who attested to the value of these and other SESC capabilities. \n\nSymposium Organizing Committee: Peter W. Chung, Davinder. K. Anand, Balakumar. Balachandran, Ania Picard, Dylan Hazlewood, Mukes Kapilashrami, Millard S. Firebaugh (RADM, Ret), and James M.
