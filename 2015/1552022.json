 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is to support a one-day workshop to bring together leading experts to evaluate the impact of the National Robotics Initiative (NRI) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) initiative, explore possible overlap and synergies between the NRI and CPS, and identify future drivers and opportunities for both areas. An additional goal of the workshop is to explore the extent to which the science of autonomy and autonomous systems, another area of national importance, could be complementary to these initiatives. The workshop provides a short report with vignettes that illustrates the differences and the synergies between these three areas.\r\n\r\nRecent multi-agency initiatives in robotics and cyber physical systems have successfully catalyzed many exciting, high-impact educational and research projects. The need for this workshop stems from the focus on intellectual similarities and differences between the NRI and CPS initiatives, and what should they be going forward. The workshop focus consists of a comprehensive analysis of three important growth areas: robotics, autonomy, and cyber physical systems. Each of these three areas is expected to significantly impact virtually all sectors of our economy including healthcare, manufacturing, construction, mining and agriculture. An ambitious education and research agenda in these areas has the potential to improve our quality of human life. This workshop assembles the top researchers in the fields of robotics, autonomy, and cyber physical systems to discuss the underlying challenges and to produce a report to help inform future education and research investments by academia, government and industry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The Workshop on Future Directions in Cyber-Physucal Systems, Robotics and Autonomy generally concluded that CPS research has, as a major driver, been able to make formal guarantees about a system, its software, and its interface with the physical world.  The NRI has focused on developing the technologies to put robots into the real world with humans, i.e., co-robotic systems.  As such, these two objectives have many synergies: formal analysis of behaviors with complex specifications operating in uncertain environments, and the coupling between computation and the physical world.  Yet the different perspectives taken by the CPS and NRI communities indicate open areas where scientific advancement could have important applications to science, technology and education.  \nIndeed both the CPS and NRI programs have resulted in large gains in our understanding of complex systems---from making formal guarantees, to synthesizing software solutions that meet specifications, to translating these results to robotic systems that interact with the environment and humans in complex ways.  The scientific understanding gained through these programs naturally leads to new horizons in (cloud and wearable) robotic systems and autonomy.  This results in the following general recommendation: \nThe CPS and NRI programs have been highly successful, and should continue to be supported so as to reach their full potential.  Nucleating  and sustaining interactions between the two programs is important to  both programs. In addition, the advances catalyzed by these programs  have brought into focus the need for a new program charged with a  deeper investigation and understanding of physically embedded systems incorporating a combination of autonomous systems and robotics.\nAs noted above, it is likely that new types of physically embedded systems, e.g., wearable robots or an internet of robots (or cloud robotics) will form a central pillar to autonomy.  Conversely, future work in robotics will require the use of autonomy.  All of this will be guided by the formal guarantees and interfacing between computation and the physical given by CPS, coupled with the lessons learned on co-robotic systems in the NRI.   Therefore, the existing CPS and NRI programs have the potential to lead the way to a new program that will have important ramifications to manufacturing, robotics, increasing interest in science and engineering, and educating the next generation of Americans.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: R.
