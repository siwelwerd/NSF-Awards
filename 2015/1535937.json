The PI plans to use these new results for time scale information to substantially update the time scale information provided by marine magnetic anomalies by extending the analysis originally done in the S Atlantic to several spreading centers. The results will impact all of geological disciplines that require accurate time scale for the Cretaceous through Tertiary interval.

The latest in-depth analysis of marine magnetic anomalies, mostly based on the South Atlantic patterns, was carried out more than twenty years ago. The global marine magnetic anomaly record has since grown considerably, and detailed finite plate rotations have been determined on several spreading centers (Central and SE Indian Ridge, Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, NE Pacific, Central N Atlantic). These new results have not been fully analyzed for time scale information, and magnetic anomalies are presently underutilized. The proposed project is to substantially update the time scale information provided by marine magnetic anomalies by extending the analysis originally done in the S Atlantic to several spreading centers. Advancing the state of the art in dating and correlating past events has significant implications in a wide range of geoscience disciplines.  To enhance the broader understanding of the fundamental concepts behind the development of a quantitative geologic time scale and to promote scientific training, the project will support an undergraduate student during a 10-week summer internship at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. The PI will closely supervise the student in selecting suitable profiles, identifying magnetic anomalies, constructing reversal distance data sets, and preparing a presentation of the results. The PI will also run a workshop on the proposed project in the Earth2Class program, where K-12 science teachers are introduced to research by Lamont scientists. The quantification of deep time will be presented to the general public during the Lamont Open House, an annual outreach event that attracts thousands of visitors.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago and evolved over an immense time span compared to human time scales.  Studies of the Earth\u2019s history and climate are based on a geological time scale that has been developed over centuries of research, starting from simple geological observations and progressing to quantitative dating based on the decay of radioactive elements.  The discovery of plate tectonics led to a major advance in time scale development. As plates spread apart at mid-ocean ridges, volcanic rocks that form at the ridge axis become magnetized in the direction of the magnetic field.  The Earth\u2019s magnetic field reversed its polarity during geological time, and seafloor spreading resulted in a series of magnetized blocks on mid-ocean ridge flanks that record the history of field reversals.  The extent of these magnetized blocks can be reconstructed from magnetic anomalies, local highs and lows of the magnetic field measured by survey ships.  The distances between the edges of the magnetized blocks and the mid-ocean ridge axis are the fundamental data to construct a Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS), which is a list of ages of magnetic field reversals. \n\nIf spreading rates remained constant in time, the distances of the magnetized blocks from the ridge axis would be simply proportional to the age of magnetic reversals.  The first GPTS was constructed in this way using the width of magnetized blocks in the South Atlantic Ocean.  The distance-age relationship was calibrated with a single radiometric date for a field reversal, obtained from volcanic samples collected on land.  As more radiometric dates were measured, it became clear that spreading rates did not remain constant over tens of millions of years.  The current GPTS was based on the interpolation of a number of radiometric dates; between these dates, South Atlantic spreading rates were assumed to vary smoothly with time.  An undesirable consequence of the South Atlantic focus is that spreading rates determined from the current GPTS in other oceans are much more variable in time.  In reality, the variability of spreading rates should be similar in all ocean basins.\n\nOur study updates the GPTS in the Late Cretaceous-Eocene period (~84-33 million years ago) by minimizing the variability of spreading rates over the global mid-ocean ridge system.  The new GPTS was constructed using a large, up-to-date data set of 154 ship tracks from the South Atlantic, Indian, Southern Pacific, and Northern Pacific Oceans.  The GPTS we obtained will improve the dating of geologic and climatic events recorded in sediment sequences. By providing independent age information, the new GPTS will aid the developing discipline of astrochronology, which is based on the correlation of sediment cycles with astronomical cycles in the Earth\u2019s orbit and spin axis orientation.  Removing the previous emphasis on the South Atlantic, the new GPTS better constrains the global history of spreading rates and highlights a major change in plate motion at about 47 million years ago.  At that time, seafloor spreading in the Indian Ocean slowed down as the Indian subcontinent collided with Asia, starting the creation of the Himalayan mountains.  At the same time, spreading became faster in the South Atlantic and Northern Pacific.  The increase in Pacific spreading rates 47 million years ago coincides with a marked change in the orientation of the Hawaii-Emperor seamount chain, a long string of seamounts that extends to the northwest of Hawaii and records the motion of the Pacific plate over a deep hot spot.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alberto Malinverno"
