 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will explore the environments of more than 2000 of the nearest star systems to the Sun. The objectives are to (a) discover how unusual our Sun is in its stellar solitude, (b) understand how many stars of different types are multiples, (c) provide fundamental statistics that will drive our knowledge of how stars form, and (d) provide a list of stars where analogues of our Solar System might be found. The project allows us to place our own Sun in context in our Galaxy, answering the broad question, \"How does our Sun compare to other stars?\"  It will also provide important information about the likelihood of habitable worlds. The project provides opportunities for graduate and undergraduate student training at both institutions, each of which includes significant fractions of minority students.  Both institutions will develop supplemental observing programs for students and general public using local facilities, and they will integrate these with their educational programs.\r\n\r\nTwo high-resolution imaging surveys will be completed using the Differential Speckle Survey Instrument (DSSI), a unique speckle imaging system that provides diffraction-limited imaging in two colors simultaneously. Observations will primarily be taken at Lowell Observatory's 4.3-meter Discovery Channel Telescope and at the Gemini North 8.1-meter Telescope. The first survey will target more than 1500 stars within 25 parsecs with V magnitudes brighter than 16. Observing nearby stars with DSSI will enable mapping of their stellar environments down to separations smaller than the distance of Mercury to the Sun, even at the horizon of the sample. The results will provide crucial insight into the star formation process, and the statistics of stellar multiplicity will be the benchmark for other types of multiplicity studies, with an emphasis on the Solar System scales crucial for planet formation. The second survey will target more than a thousand K-dwarfs within 50 parsecs in an equatorial sample that can be observed from both the northern and southern hemispheres. Incorporating other techniques together with DSSI images, these stars will be surveyed for companions down to Jovian masses to provide a unique data set of companions spanning a mass range of 1000 for this specific spectral type, providing a legacy data set that can be referenced for decades to come.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe RECONS group (www.recons.org) observed more than 1000 of the\nnearest stars to reveal companions on scales similar to our Solar\nSystem.  The companions were either other stars, objects known as\nbrown dwarfs that do not have sufficient mass to ignite the reactions\nof true stars, or massive jovian type planets like Jupiter.  Two kinds\nof stars were targeted: K dwarf stars that are slightly smaller and\nless massive than our Sun, and M dwarf stars that are the coolest,\nsmallest types of normal stars known.  Together, these two types of\nstars account for 9 out of 10 of all stars, so are key to\nunderstanding how our Sun fits in among the stars.\n\nCompanions to the stars were found using imaging techniques that\nprobed separations corresponding to inside the orbit of Mercury to a\nthousand times further than the Earth is from the Sun.  The K stars\nwere discovered to have most of their stellar companions between 10\nand 30 AU (where 1 AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth),\ncorresponding to where Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are found in our\nSolar System.  The smaller M dwarf stars were found to have most of\ntheir companions at separations of 4 to 20 AU, similar to Jupiter,\nSaturn, and Uranus.  Thus, smaller stars have smaller solar systems.\nIt was also discovered that about 40% of K dwarfs have stellar\ncompanions, whereas only 30% of M dwarfs have other stars orbiting\nthem, indicating that smaller stars have companions less often.\n\nDuring this project, four students learned to use astrometric,\nphotometric, and spectroscopic data, the triumvirate of data types\nused by most astronomers.  They also learned how to use enormous\ndatabases to select stars and confirm or refute possible companions.\nThe team added a new technique to the imaging surveys used to discover\ncompanions --- detecting the wobbles caused on the target stars by\nunseen companions using the radial velocity technique --- by reopening\na mothballed 1.5-meter telescope at the U.S. national observatory in\nChile.  This telescope is now being used by more than 20 teams,\nincluding the RECONS team, to search for planets orbiting the nearby\nstars.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/19/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Todd J Henry"
