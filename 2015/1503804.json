 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves several parasitologists from the USA, Brazil, Bulgaria, and Ukraine that will collaborate to survey, study, describe, and archive parasites associated with birds in five geographically isolated regions (areas of endemism) of southern Amazonian Brazil.  The research will involve collection and deposition of museum specimens for research and will use both physical characteristics and genetic data from both the birds and their parasites to describe this poorly known segment of biological diversity in the world's richest ecosystem.  At over 6.5 million km2, Amazonia is estimated to harbor more than one tenth of the world's species. Brazilian Amazonia harbors the most diverse bird fauna on earth (~1300 species), yet the parasite fauna of Amazonian birds is almost completely unstudied.  Parasites are incredibly diverse and make up 30-70% of life on earth.  \r\n\r\nThis project has a number of important societal benefits. First, this work fosters international collaboration between US and Brazilian researchers and students, who will travel between these institutions to teach, learn, work, and collaborate to further the understanding of birds and their parasites.  Training of a diverse pool (including underrepresented groups) of US and Brazilian graduate and undergraduate students will augment the diminishing pool of expertise working on understudied parasite groups.  This study also will have long-term value because parasites are known to have important consequences on the health, behavior, demography, and evolution of their hosts (including humans and other animals).  Parasites are known to cause or spread disease among and between hosts.  Thus, through modern approaches to gathering and archiving the material collected, this study will employ cutting edge research to make substantial lasting contributions to our knowledge of the diversity, distribution, and evolutionary history, of avian parasites in Amazonia, and therefore will have important human and wildlife health implications far into the future.  Lastly, this research is a novel collaborative effort to gather data needed to conserve the biodiversity of the Amazon, the richest fauna on earth.",

During the project, PIs, students, and collaborators conducted four joint expeditions in southern Amazonian Brazil to collect birds and their parasites to study and characterize the biodiversity of parasites and other symbiotic organisms living on and in birds from one of the most biodiverse regions of the world.  Brazilian collaborators and postdocs independently collected additional material that was also available for the joint research outcomes of the project.  In total, 19 papers authored by the PIs and student trainees have been published and several more are submitted and in preparation. Among these research outcomes are research papers describing 3 new bird species and 16 new parasite species.\n\nNumerous broader impacts have come out of the project as well.  The project has directly benefitted the training of 4 postdocs, 6 graduate students, 6 undergraduate students, and 4 high school students. Thousands of data rich bird and parasite specimens have been deposited in the collections at the Field Museum, Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University, Museu Goeldi, and Museu de Zoologia da Universidade de S&atilde;o Paulo.

At the 2013 American Ornithologists Union Meeting, PIs Weckstein and Tkach taught a workshop on methods for collecting and studying bird parasites.\n\nLastly, this research project broadened the international collaborative web of researchers for all project participants.  For example, at the initiation of the project we did not have a collaborating Brazilian endoparasitologist.  However, our work down in Brazil provided opportunities for an additional Brazilian collaborator and his students to join research expeditions and participate in collaborative research projects.  We anticipate that these new collaborations will provide exciting opportunities for future collaborative projects.  Furthermore, postdoctoral researchers, including one US postdoc funded by the project and three Brazilian postdocs funded by the Brazilian National Science Foundation, were also able to broaden their collaborations.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason Weckstein"
