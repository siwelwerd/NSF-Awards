 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing new techniques for the creation of highly effective\r\nfuzz testers, also known as \"fuzzers,\" for programming language compilers and\r\ninterpreters.  Fuzz testing is an automatic and low-cost technique for finding\r\ndefects in software systems.  A fuzzer randomly creates test inputs for a\r\nsoftware system; a fuzzer is effective if it can continually create test cases\r\nthat reveal defects throughout the system under test.  It is difficult to\r\ncreate effective fuzzers for programming language compilers and interpreters\r\nbecause these systems have highly structured inputs, but it is important that\r\nsuch fuzzers exist.  Programming language implementations are critical software\r\ninfrastructure: defects in compilers and interpreters can potentially have\r\ngreat costs in terms of software correctness and reliability, human\r\nproductivity, and computer security.  This project seeks to reduce the time and\r\nhuman effort needed to create sophisticated fuzzers for programming language\r\nimplementations.  In so doing, this project is expected to advance the state of\r\nthe art in random software testing, improve the quality of several programming\r\nlanguage implementations selected for study, and produce new open-source\r\nsoftware tools that programmers can use to develop new and more effective fuzz\r\ntesters.\r\n\r\nThe techniques developed by this project will be embodied in a new generator of\r\nfuzz testers, called Xsmith.  Xsmith will generate language fuzzers from\r\nspecifications and thus reduce the time and effort required to create fuzzers.\r\nMore importantly, Xsmith will inject sophisticated program-generation\r\ntechniques into the language fuzzers it creates.  This project will investigate\r\nthree techniques in particular.  This first is generation-time analysis,\r\nintended to allow Xsmith-derived fuzzers to create output that is both complex\r\nand meaningful.  The second is feature subsetting, intended to increase the\r\nlikelihood that Xsmith-derived fuzzers will output bug-triggering test\r\nprograms.  The third is iterative refinement, intended to further diversify the\r\noutputs from Xsmith-derived fuzzers.  The project participants will use Xsmith\r\nto create fuzz testers for a varied set of programming languages.  Where\r\npossible, the bug-finding power of Xsmith-derived fuzzers will be compared to\r\nthat of existing fuzzers: quantitatively, in terms of the number of\r\nidentifiably unique defects found within a fixed test-time budget, and\r\nqualitatively, in terms of the kinds of defects uncovered.  This evaluation\r\nwill allow the investigators to assess the impact of the techniques embodied in\r\nXsmith, both individually and collectively, over a range of programming\r\nlanguage implementations.  Xsmith will be successful if it permits highly\r\neffective fuzz testers to be constructed with significantly less ad hoc code,\r\nand thus significantly less effort, than if they had been constructed from\r\nscratch.",
