 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides renewed funding for the longstanding Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at Northern Arizona University (NAU) and Lowell Observatory. Seven student participants per year will be paired with NAU and Lowell scientists to conduct astrophysics research into a wide variety of topics, including lunar impact craters, cryogenic outer solar system ices, near-earth objects, and exoplanets. In addition, the students will attend biweekly seminars to learn more about professional astrophysics, responsible research conduct, and applying to graduate school. The Site will also introduce students to cutting-edge telescopes, including Lowell's Discovery Channel Telescope and the Naval Precision Optical Interferometer.\r\n\r\nBy offering high-quality research experiences to students at a critical stage of undergraduate education, the REU Site will contribute to increasing the nationwide pool of scientists and engineers. Participants will develop the research methods and analytical skills (mathematical, computational, and logical) necessary to process data, understand primary research, and to remain current with new developments in the field. The REU Site also has an active and highly developed plan to recruit underrepresented minorities into its program, which will expand STEM training opportunities to these groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFor this award we proposed and received funding to support seven students per year. We received at least 150 complete applications in each year. Of the 30 students supported during this four-year grant, 56.6% were female; 16.6% were Hispanic; 6.6% were African American. 30% came from primarily undergraduate institutions with limited research opportunities. Each student was mentored one-on-one by a PhD astronomer or planetary scientist at NAU, Lowell, or USGS.\n\nIntellectual merit: The intellectual merit of these prior awards lies in the excellent research projects carried out by the REU students. During the last 5 years, our REU students have appeared on 10 refereed papers and nearly 50 conference abstracts (AAS, DPS, LPSC, AGU).\n\nBroader impact: The broader impact of this prior award lies in the development of a diverse, globally competitive workforce. Of the 41 students who participated in our program over the past five years, 46% are still undergraduates; 34% are currently graduate students; and 20% have gone into industry or business. Since the beginning of our program in 1991, the overall fraction of females in our program is 58%, and Figure 3 shows that the fraction of females in all the employment categories listed is essentially no different from that number.  We are particularly proud of the fact that there is no evidence in our alumni network of the \"leaky pipeline\" wherein females preferentially are lost from higher level positions. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/17/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David E Trilling"
