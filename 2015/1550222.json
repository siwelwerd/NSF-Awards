 "awd_abstract_narration": "1550222\r\nKnappe\r\n\r\nBecause of their persistence, bioaccumulation potential, and (eco)toxicity, long-chain perfluoroalkyl substances such as perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctane sulfonate are being replaced with short-chain fluorinated alternatives. Almost no information exists about the occurrence of fluorinated alternatives and their behavior during water treatment. The overall goal of the proposed research is to begin to fill this knowledge gap by studying one class of fluorinated alternatives, perfluoro(poly) ethers. \r\n\r\nSpecific research objectives include to: (1) develop a quantitative liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the analysis of 13 perfluoro(poly) ethers in water, (2) apply the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method to (a) determine perfluoro(poly) ether fate in a surface water, (b) quantify perfluoro(poly) ether concentrations and mass flows at the intake of a water treatment plant, (3) in collaboration with the water utility, trace parcels of water through the plant to quantify perfluoro(poly) ether removal/transformation in full-scale water treatment processes, and (4) trace parcels of water through the water distribution system to determine perfluoro(poly) ethers fate during drinking water distribution.  This data would be used to estimate human exposure to perfluoro(poly) ethers via consumption of drinking water. Given the data scarcity surrounding fluorinated alternatives, it is anticipated that the results of this research will receive wide interest.",
