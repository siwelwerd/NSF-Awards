 "awd_abstract_narration": "Membranes surround cells and cellular compartments.  These membranes make possible a dynamic and important storehouse of cellular energy, which is a transmembrane proton gradient, i.e. a situation (by analogy to a battery) in which there are more protons on one side of an energized membrane and fewer on the other. Energy from food or light (in photosynthesis) can be used to make this proton battery, which efficiently fuels the cell.  This research program will study a class of proteins (Heme Copper Oxidases), which includes Cytochrome c oxidase that uses atmospheric oxygen as a fuel. The Heme Copper Oxidase proteins help build the gradient by a common and important mechanism in biology called proton pumping, which moves protons in one direction across a non-electrically conducting membrane, thereby constructing a transmembrane proton gradient.  The objective of this research is to better understand the design features of proton-pumping proteins, which will also help in the design of specialized semi-permeable membranes such as those needed for electrochemical cells (which include batteries).  The project brings together the study of the biology of the cell, of the chemistry of the reactions that fuel the proton pumping process and of the physics of the motion of the charged protons.  The work will train graduate and undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows in interdisciplinary science.\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to carry out computer simulations starting with the known positions of the atoms in the Heme Copper Oxidase proteins. While there is no detailed model for proton pumping in any protein, there is a general outline that forms the basis of the research. The calculations will look for regions of the protein that can provide stopping points for the proton as it moves across the protein.  In addition, protons must move through the protein via pathways that can be made up of channels filled with water molecules.  These pathways will be identified and studied to see where blockages can be formed to keep the protons from moving backwards to dissipate the proton gradient.  The calculation methods used here are evolving state of the art techniques and they will be tested and improved by these calculations. \r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences; the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics, and the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.",

The project used MCCE, developed in the Gunner lab, to study the protonation states of all acidic and basic groups in the protein and the hydrogen bonds within the protein that can establish proton transfer paths.  Classical Molecular Dynamics and network analysis were also applied to help analyze proton transfers.  \n\nTo move protons uphill, against the concenter gradient, a proton must (1) be bound to a high affinity site from the low concentration side of the membrane; (2) close the connection to the low concentration site, reduce the affinity of the binding site and move the proton along proton transfer paths within the protein; (3) release the proton into the side with a high proton concentration.  Calculations were carried out to characterize proton binding sites and proton transfer paths in two important mitochondrial proteins: complex I and complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase).  Proton transfer in the simple, model proteins bacteriorhodopsin and gramicidin were used to test the methodology.\n\nEarlier models of proton transfer looked for simple, linear paths connecting a single amino acid that would bind and release protons. The use of MCCE Monte Carlo sampling and network analysis in this project allowed proton transfer paths and proton binding sites to be found without out prejudging which parts of the protein will be important.  A novel and important conclusion is that proteins can use clusters of residues to bind and release protons and that proton paths are often tangled networks.  Thus, a single protein can use a mixture of motifs, where some parts of the path are extended and complex, while other segments use single sites for binding and simple paths for transfer.  The relative advantages of the different types of structures used to carry out proton transfers are not yet clear.\n\nEarlier versions of MCCE provided the average protonation states for all residues.  New analysis tools were added to MCCE to save and analyze individual protonation and conformation states.  The results have shown that a protein at equilibrium has many states with different proton positions and protein net charge.  This information was used to show how groups of residues change specific proton locations as the system moves the proton across the proton pumping protiens.   \n\nBroader impacts.
