 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Purnendu Dasgupta and students at the University of Texas at Arlington are developing a new generation of small portable analyzers that can be used in the field. This project uses the Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) program of the NSF to form an industry alliance with a leading ion chromatography (IC) manufacturer, Thermo Fisher Dionex (Sunnyvale, CA). Several students will have an opportunity to intern at the manufacturer's facility and industry scientists will co-supervise students towards a building miniature, field-portable ion chromatographs of low footprint and low power. The broader impacts are addressed through the development of a field deployable instrument that will be used in many applications, and through undergraduate and graduate student education and training that includes unique and extensive industrial interactions. \r\n\r\nThis project has two separate broad goals: While most anion analyses today are carried out by ion chromatography, the equipment is still too heavy and consumes too much power to be easily deployed in the field. This project seeks to develop a small, portable, low power consumption ion chromatograph instrument for field deployment. Rather than packed columns, a suppressed open tubular (OT) IC is envisioned where the column will contain an integral suppressor and admittance detector for fully functional gradient-capable, suppressed IC. Further, a second admittance detector will be present. Before this detector, a base will permeate through the wall and mix with the first detector effluent; this principle is known to enable detection of very weak acid anions, not presently possible. The second goal is to explore scanning detection in liquid and ion chromatography, using a variety of detectors and separation modes. Glass, silica and polymer columns are transparent to several types of detectors. A scanning platform provides an inexpensive high-resolution means to look at separations occurring inside columns as they occur. The net result is that one can look at separations in real time and, in principle, provide automated feedback to eluent composition to improve separations. The wealth of data generated during multiple scans will enable accurate quantification actually before complete separation occurs. Scanning detection visualizes what did not elute and provides a diagnostic of column health. Finally, in gradient elution, the three dimensional map of time location and speed of an analyte is expected to provide an identification marker that is intrinsically chromatographic and not detector-dependent.",

Electrodialytic Devices, Ion Exclusion Chromatography, and Automated Volatile Eluent Preparation.</strong> Simple devices were introduced for the preconcentration of carcinogenic Chromium (VI) species in environmentally meaningful levels in real samples while differentiating it from harmless Chromium (III) species with analysis by LED-based spectrophotometry. We introduced a novel high-pressure membrane-based device to prepare high concentrations of dissolved aqueous carbon dioxide on-line; this &ldquo;super soda-water&rdquo; could then be used for the separation and detection of organic acids (of importance in a multitude of fruit-based and fermented beverages), pioneering changes in eluent composition during such analysis. In another such effort, separated volatile fatty acids were extracted on-line into a water stream before detection. The &ldquo;super soda water&rdquo; was sufficiently acidic to separate many positive ions, an unprecedented separation of the entire monovalent cations, lithium to trimethylammonium, was accomplished. The CO<sub>2</sub> dissolution system provided a complete suite to generate eluents from pure carbonic acid to pure carbonate. On-line CO<sub>2</sub> and NH<sub>3</sub> dissolution devices together permitted completely volatile buffer systems spanning a pH of 3.5-10 to separate and measure proteins, monoclonal antibodies, pharmaceutical precursors and many amino acids (Figure 1).</p>\n<p><strong>2. Very Weak Acid Detection in Ion Chromatography.</strong></p>\n<p>Silicate and borate are important in areas as divergent as semiconductor fabrication to ocean nutrition, their trace analysis is particularly difficult. We introduced a new way to conductometrically detect them. We separated many very weak acids with just water as the eluent, enabling a very simple process.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Novel Approaches to Peak Quantitation, Peak Purity testing, Deconvolution.</strong></p>\n<p>Peak-width-based measurement, applicable to an extremely large concentration range, was introduced. Even a misshapen peak half was found to closely correspond to a generalized Gaussian distribution, simplifying impurity detection.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Open Tubular (OT) Capillary Liquid/Ion Chromatography. </strong></p>\n<p>OT capillary chromatography, the project focus, lacks good detectors. An on-column admittance detector was refined and incorporated on a motorized stage. The series of still images representing each scan is a movie when joined together: the developing chromatogram can be observed. The <em>Analytical Scientist </em>chose this as among the ten 2017 &ldquo;landmark literature&rdquo; papers.</p>\n<p><strong>5. New Materials for Open Tubular Liquid/Ion Chromatography. </strong></p>\n<p>Of capillaries, presently only fused silica is in common use but they are attacked by base. We worked to have alternative capillaries made, e.g., from polymethylmethacrylate, polyetherimide, PEEK, and cyclic olefin polymers (COP). We developed a protocols for making them negatively charged to attach positively charged nano particles. OT columns of excellent performance were realized.</p>\n<p><strong>6. Suppressors for Open Tubular Ion Chromatography</strong>. An important advance was the development of a low dead volume end-column suppressor (Fig. 2) with performance shown on the right.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Quantitative Predicting OTIC Behavior from Macrocolumn Data.</strong></p>\n<p>Macro- and open tubular column scales operate at not only vastly different flow rates and eluent concentrations. We proved that the retention behavior of an ion on a latex-coated OT column can be exactly predicted from the corresponding macrocolumn data for the same type of eluent at any eluent concentration. As much macrocolumn data are available, translation of any such extant method to the OT format becomes facile.</p>\n<p><strong>8. Open Tubular Scale Conductivity Detectors.</strong> Open tubular liquid chromatography has largely depended on fluorescence detection for last 4 decades. We have developed multiple contact conductivity detector designs applicable to the open tubular scale. A simple foil sandwich (Figure 3) has proven very capable.</p>\n<p><strong>9. Photothermal Absorbance Detection in Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).</strong></p>\n<p>Light absorption causes a rise in temperature. Direct temperature difference measurement of a flowing stream, just before and after illumination, with microscale temperature sensors permitted a limit of detection of 0.003 &deg;C. With illumination by an inexpensive laser pointer, as little as 2x10<sup>-13</sup> gram of a dye could be detected.</p>\n<p>We theoretically derived and experimentally proved the existence of a path length optimum in absorbance measurements and reported light attenuation coefficients for many tubular conduits. We provided a mathematical description for the on how dispersion takes place in as a function of length, picked as one of 2018 <em>Analytical Scientist</em> &ldquo;landmark literature&rdquo; papers.</p>\n<p><strong>10. A Flowmeter for nL-pL/min range. </strong></p>\n<p>There are no commercially available sensors for flow rates below 70 nL/min, of relevance to OTIC/OTLC. We introduced a new <em>Time of Sight</em> concept in flow measurement using continuously recycled alternating fluorocarbon and conductive aqueous segments sensed by single admittance sensor with sensing electrodes &lt;0.5 mm apart; 1 pL/s was measurable in 5 micrometer diameter capillaries.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/05/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Purnendu&nbsp;K&nbsp;Dasgupta</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1506572/1506572_10377663_1627929379386_Outcome2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1506572/1506572_10377663_1627929379386_Outcome2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Capillary suppressor and chromatogram\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1506572/1506572_10377663_1627929379386_Outcome2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Capillary suppressor and chromatogram\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2.
