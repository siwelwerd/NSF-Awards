 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support an NSF CAREER Proposal Writing Workshop to introduce junior faculty to the NSF CAREER program, and assist in successful strategies for proposal preparation. The NSF CAREER program serves a critical role in the National Science Foundation's efforts to identify, foster and support the nation's most promising junior faculty in both research and education. Professionals just starting their careers often have limited experience with grant writing and evaluation and quite often no interaction with the program directors at NSF. This workshop brings young faculty members to Arlington, VA and provides a robust series of opportunities to improve in proposal writing, focused and strategic interactions with NSF program directors from across CISE and recent CISE CAREER awardees. The major features of the workshop include presentations on proposal writing, experience sharing, mock panels, and a proposal clinic. A limited number of participants will receive travel support to encourage participation from HBCU/MEI faculty to attend this workshop.",
