 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fundamental questions in biology include: How do complex traits, such as eyes, evolve through changes in underlying sub-components? What are the transitional steps in function that link simple light-sensitive structures and complex image-forming eyes?  The studies supported by this award use chitons (Mollusca: Polyplacophora) in an integrative research approach to ask how and why eyes evolve. Specifically, the proposal addresses: 1) changes in genotype associated with the origin of new light-interacting structures and 2) relationships between new light-interacting structures and new light-influenced behaviors. Integrative research on chitons will help advance the field of biomaterials. Studying the aragonite lenses of chitons will help researchers learn how animals build precisely shaped structures through the process of biomineralization.  Studying the origin of eyes in chitons will also help counter popular misconceptions about evolution by demonstrating how complex traits evolve through stepwise processes.  Undergraduate and graduate training, as well as public outreach efforts are also integrated into this project. \r\n\r\nThe research objectives for this award follow the unique sensory organs (aesthetes) embedded in chiton shell plates: photoreceptors, eyespots, and eyes (with aragonite lenses). Specifically, the award supports studies to: (1) Identify the molecular components responsible for light-detection in eyeless chitons and establish the visually-influenced behaviors displayed by these animals; (2) Characterize the pigments and pigment-producing genes associated with the eyespots of certain chitons and establish the light-influenced behaviors unique to these species; and (3) Investigate the molecular components that confer spatial vision in chitons with eyes and identify genes that may be associated with the development of their aragonite lenses.  Results from the studies will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated at scientific meetings.",

We asked <em>how </em>the eyes of chitons evolved by seeking associations between changes in genotype and origins of new light-interacting structures. We also asked <em>why </em>the eyes of chitons evolved by testing associations between new light-interacting structures and new light-influenced behaviors. By studying the molecular components of sensory transduction across extant chitons and by reconstructing ancestral states, we found the eyes of chitons evolved from organs that likely functioned as multimodal sensors. Intriguingly, the eyes and eyespots of chitons express the molecular components of fewer sensory transduction pathways than the simpler sensory structures from which they both evolved, indicating complex relationships between different levels of biological organization during eye evolution. By testing the light-influenced behaviors of chitons, we found both eyespots and eyes are associated with spatial vision. However, we found species with eyespots use spatial vision for orienting to visual landmarks and species with eyes use spatial vision to inform predator-avoidance behaviors. Species with eyespots appear to process visual information differently than species with eyes, a finding relevant to our broader goal of understanding visual processing in animals with distributed visual systems (such as chitons).<strong> <br /></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact:</strong> Chitons produce a wide range of structures through biomineralization, including image-forming lenses made of aragonite and iron-coated teeth.

Now that we have a sequenced genome for <em>A. granulata</em>, we can use it as a scaffold for transcriptome assembly, making transcriptome-based experiments in chitons much more informative.
