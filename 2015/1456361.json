 "awd_abstract_narration": "Some plants have the fascinating property that they hyperaccumulate a particular toxic element to levels that are 100-1000 fold higher than surrounding vegetation. Prince's plume (Stanleya pinnata), from the mustard family, is such a plant. This native to the Western USA can hyperaccumulate selenium up to 0.5% of its dry weight. Selenium is a micronutrient for many life forms including humans, but toxic at high levels. It is very similar to sulfur, and most life forms cannot discriminate between the two elements. This hyperaccumulator, however, has the unique capacity to distinguish selenium from sulfur, and preferentially accumulates selenate. Hyperaccumulators also distinguish themselves by accumulating organic forms of selenium (in amino acids for example) where non-hyperaccumulator relatives accumulate inorganic selenium. This capacity likely explains their selenium tolerance. Questions addressed in this project are: Has S. pinnata evolved a selenate-specific transporter? That would be a first for any organism. In what ways is such a transporter different that would provide insights about its evolution? And which genes underlie the capacity to produce organic selenium? Based on experiments so far, a candidate selenate transporter has been identified, as well as a possible key gene for the accumulation of organic selenium. This and other genes will be investigated in this project by expressing them in both yeast and in the model plant species Arabidopsis: a nonaccumulator from the mustard family. The results from this project are expected to provide better insight into mechanisms of selenium hyperaccumulation: selenate/sulfate discrimination as well as enhanced selenium uptake, assimilation and tolerance. Also, the genes from the hyperaccumulator may be used to breed plants with superior capacity to clean up selenium-polluted land or water (phytoremediation) and that can also serve as selenium-fortified crops with higher nutritional value. From a broader perspective, this project may serve as an evolutionary model to study plant adaptation to extreme soil conditions, and as a biochemical model to study mechanisms by which specificity of transporters and enzymes is controlled. These mechanisms are at the basis of metabolism and membrane transport.\r\n\r\nIn a transcriptome sequencing study using selenium (Se) hyperaccumulator Stanleya pinnata and non-accumulator Stanleya elata, two genes stood out because their transcript levels were much higher in the hyperaccumulator: a high affinity sulfate/selenate transporter homologous to Arabidopsis thaliana Sultr1;2 (44x higher) and an ATP sulfurylase homologous to AtAPS2, a key enzyme of sulfur/selenium assimilation (479x higher). These findings led to the hypotheses that (I) S. pinnata (Sp) Sultr1;2 is responsible for selenium hyperaccumulation and selenate-specific uptake in S. pinnata, and (II) SpAPS2 is key to the selenate assimilation into organic forms, and thus Se tolerance. The research objectives of this project are: (1) To determine whether the elevated expression levels of SpSultr1;2 and SpAPS2 are associated with elevated uptake rates of selenate and/or sulfate and elevated levels of ATP sulfurylase activity; (2) To analyze the intracellular location of the SpSULTR1;2 and SpAPS2 proteins, as well as their tissue-specific expression patterns; (3) To functionally analyze the sulfate and selenate transport properties of the S. pinnata and S. elata SULTR1;2 transporters in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae); (4) To determine the physiological effects of expression of S. pinnata and S. elata Sultr1;2 and APS2 in Arabidopsis thaliana. Parameters that will be measured include uptake kinetics of selenate and sulfate (alone and in combination), concentration, forms and locations of selenium accumulated (using ICP-OES, LC-MS, XAS), and selenium tolerance. In yeast, structure-function studies will also be carried out, to study the importance of selected aminoacids for selenate specificity.",

In earlier NSF-funded projects, we studied ecological and evolutionary aspects this intriguing Se hyperaccumulation trait, and in this project we studied underlying molecular mechanisms. In an extensive gene expression comparison (Wang et al., 2017 10.1111/pbi.12897) of hyperaccumulator (HA) <em>S. pinnata</em> with a non-HA relative, <em>Stanleya elata</em> (desert Prince?s plume) two genes stood out for having much higher expression in the HA: a root sulfate/selenate transporter called <em>Sultr1;2 </em>and an ATP sulfurylase enzyme called<em> APS2</em>, involved in sulfate/selenate assimilation to organic (less toxic) forms. These genes were the focus of the project.</p>\n<p>In Se uptake studies (published by El Mehdawi et al., 2018 10.1111/nph.14838), HA <em>S. pinnata</em> showed not only tenfold higher rates of selenate influx than non-HA <em>S. elata</em>, but inhibition by high sulfate levels was much lower for <em>S. pinnata</em> plants than for the control species. This suggests the HA has a selenate-specific transporter. Furthermore, <em>S. pinnata </em>had 4-fold higher ATP sulfurylase activity than <em>S. elata. </em>Thus, these genes? elevated expression levels in <em>S. pinnata</em> correlated well with plant biochemistry and physiology.</p>\n<p>We cloned the HA and the non-HA version of the sulfate/selenate transporter, <em>SpSultr1;2 </em>and<em> SeSultr1;2</em>, and expressed them in baker?s yeast as well as in model plant Arabidopsis (thesis Guignardi, 2017). The gene sequences revealed some interesting differences, particularly at the tail end of the transporter, in a domain that is known to have a regulatory function. Both transporters were found to restore the ability to grow of a sulfate transporter-deficient yeast, so had sulfate transport capacity. Both also mediated selenate uptake in yeast, so also have selenate transport capacity. Selenate uptake was equally sensitive to sulfate inhibition for both transporters. In Arabidopsis, the <em>SpSultr1;2 </em>overexpressing lines similarly did not show differences in selenate uptake inhibition by sulfate, relative to controls. Thus, SpSULTR1;2 does not appear to be especially selenate-specific.</p>\n<p>We also cloned the HA and the non-HA version of the <em>APS2</em> gene, and expressed them in <em>Escherichia coli</em> bacteria and in Arabidopsis (published by Jiang et al. 2018 10.1016/j.bbagen.2018.03.014). Purified SpAPS2 protein from <em>E. coli</em> was found to be highly active on the sulfur substrate APSe. This reaction was similarly inhibited by selenate and sulfate, so there is no evidence for selenate-specificity for this enzyme. The gene sequences showed some interesting differences, especially at the beginning and end of the predicted proteins. Due to one of these mutations, the HA APS2 protein has different cellular localization. We experimentally found, by coupling the APS2 to a green fluorescent protein, and localizing fluorescence in protoplasts under a microscope, that the SpAPS2 is exclusively localized to the cytosol while SeAPS2 is both cytosolic and chloroplastic. So, the HA is unique in that it has very high, purely cytosolic APS2 activity.
