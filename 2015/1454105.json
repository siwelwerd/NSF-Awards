 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this CAREER award, funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) Program of the Division of Chemistry, Professor Sean A. Garrett-Roe of the University of Pittsburgh and his post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate student colleagues are conducting experimental studies of the unique ways that substances behave when they are dissolved in ionic liquids. Ionic liquids are a unique class of materials, essentially a salt that is molten at very low temperatures.  These ionic liquids show promise as replacements for organic solvents, but their molecular behavior remains poorly understood.  These studies help to inform scientists who are using ionic liquids, and may eventually lead to industrial solvents with improved properties.  Post-doctoral, graduate and undergraduate students working on this project receive world-class training in ultrafast laser science, while working on a compelling chemical problem with real-world impact.  Part of this CAREER program is also focused on a number of education projects, including the development of guided-inquiry curriculum materials and actual hands-on research to introduce undergraduates to an authentic research experience in the first two years of College. \r\n \r\nProf. Sean A. Garrett-Roe and his research group uses ultrafast, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy to probe the transient structures that are present in interactions between solute molecules and ionic liquid solvents. The specific studies include: (1) carbon dioxide uptake in ionic liquids; (2) partitioning between nanoscopic domains of organic and organic azides; (3) the measurement of solvent friction in intramolecular proton transfer reactions.  The young researchers working on this project receive excellent technical training in laser science and cutting edge optical methods.  In the educational projects of this CAREER award, Prof. Garrett-Roe and his students develop curriculum materials on the structure and dynamics of simple liquids for incorporation into the undergraduate (guided inquiry) curriculum, a structured way of introducing early-career undergraduates to scientific research.  Prof. Garrett-Roe also participates in the University of Pittsburgh's FER (First Experiences in Research) Program, which recruits from first- and second-year undergraduates.",
