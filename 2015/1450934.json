 "awd_abstract_narration": "The International Research Network Connections Network Operations Center (IRNC NOC) serves as a cooperative point of contact and communications for IRNC network management, providing consolidated network monitoring, reporting, and operational visibility for the IRNC program.  The IRNC NOC facilitates a single set of operational expectations for all IRNC funded infrastructure programs; this enables greater availability of IRNC infrastructure and improves results in troubleshooting multi-domain network issues.  A central data repository created by the IRNC NOC provides critical operational information; monitoring data and performance metrics in support of NSF funded science and research.\r\n\r\nThe IRNC NOC end-to-end Performance Engagement Team (E2E PET) provides centrally guided and well-coordinated end-to-end performance incident management. The E2E PET coordinates activities with the IRNC Exchange Point and Backbone programs as well as international partners, enabling efficient and timely troubleshooting of end to end performance issues spanning the continents.  The IRNC NOC works together with these programs to create a common framework for handling end-to-end performance problems.  An IRNC NOC Advisory Council with representation from each of the awarded backbone, exchange point, and measurement projects guides interaction to ensure consistent operational practices across the IRNC programs.",
