The overall objective of the Workshop is to improve understanding across the many disciplines that study skeletal biology and the prevention/treatment of skeletal disease including the biological response of bone to mechanical loading. Another goal is to develop the interdisciplinary collaborations which are especially important for younger scientists.\r\n\r\nIn 2015 the overall theme of the Workshop is \"New Mechanisms for Old Problems\", honoring the long-term and founding chairman WSS Jee and the concepts initiated at Sun Valley Workshops.  The award will have a major impact on the participation of young investigators and trainees at the Workshop ensure. The support also will help establish as permanent the Career Development seminar. The goal is for this professional development opportunity to become a signature component of the workshop.",
