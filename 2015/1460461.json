 "awd_abstract_narration": "REU Site: Offshore wind energy - Solving the Engineering, Environmental & Socio-Economic Challenges\r\n \r\n\r\nBROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:\r\n  \r\nThis REU site will introduce the next generation of researchers to the engineering, environmental and social sciences needed to take on the challenges of offshore wind energy. The undergraduate students will be mentored by graduate students who are themselves working in an interdisciplinary program in offshore wind energy engineering, environmental impacts, and policy. The goal of this REU is to develop well-rounded researchers at multiple levels of education and expertise, who will have the background needed to design wind energy systems that better address not only the considerable engineering challenges, but also the environmental, social, economic, and regulatory challenges. \r\n\r\nResearch projects will span these wind energy challenges, and will include investigating  how mooring lines work for floating offshore wind turbines, designing very large turbine blades out of biodegradable materials such as wood, investigating the offshore movements of birds and bats to carefully plan the location and operation of offshore wind farms, and understanding what drives public acceptance and rejection of offshore wind energy in Massachusetts. \r\n\r\nThe project will engage a diverse community of undergraduate students to work on sustainable energy systems, an important global issue, and will encourage students to pursue graduate research in wind energy. The activities will include mentored research and leadership opportunities; technical and professional seminar series; working lunches; fieldwork and  REU field trips; and an end-of-program poster session in which students present the results of their research projects.  Students will be recruited from local women's colleges, local community colleges, North Carolina A&T (an Historically Black University), and UMass diversity organization such as the Society of Women Engineers, The National Society of Black Engineers, and The Center for Multicultural Advancement and Student Success.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:\r\n \r\nThis REU site will introduce the next generation of researchers to the engineering, environmental and social sciences needed to take on the challenges of offshore wind energy. The integration of the ongoing IGERT program in Offshore Wind Energy with this REU will develop well-rounded researchers at multiple levels of education and expertise, who will have the background needed to design wind energy systems that better address the environmental and social/economic/regulatory challenges; to design policies and regulations that enable wind energy technology and development while addressing stakeholder concerns; and to help bridge communication gaps between industry, various stakeholder groups and the academy.  \r\n\r\nResearch projects will span the wind energy challenges mentioned above, and will include investigating fluid-structure interaction of mooring systems; bio-based materials for offshore wind turbine blades; offshore wind farm siting as a robust portfolio problem; habitat use of breeding bald eagles; spatial ecology of marine birds; tracking offshore movements of  songbirds, bats and seabirds; cumulative adverse effects of offshore wind energy development on wildlife; and understanding public acceptance and rejection of offshore wind energy in Massachusetts. \r\n\r\nThe intended impact is to prepare and motivate diverse undergraduate students to pursue graduate education in fields related to the interdisciplinary topic of offshore wind energy. The objectives are to: (1) engage a diverse community of undergraduate students in a global issue,  (2) to introduce undergraduate students to cutting edge interdisciplinary collaborations, and (3) to encourage students to pursue graduate research in wind energy. The activities will include mentored research and leadership opportunities; technical and professional seminar series; working lunches; fieldwork and working REU field trips; and an end of program poster session.  Students will be recruited from local women's colleges, local community colleges, North Carolina A&T State (an HBCU), and UMass diversity organization such as the Society of Women Engineers, The National Society of Black Engineers, and The Center for Multicultural Advancement and Student Success.",
