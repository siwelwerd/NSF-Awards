The project at Texas Southern University seeks to infuse innovative electrical and computer engineering specialized artificial intelligence (AI) tools into traditional engineering problem-solving routines with a problem-based learning approach to bridge current curricula gaps, enhance engineering students' problem-solving and critical thinking skills, expose them to new technology, prepare them for diverse and multidisciplinary workforce requirements, and attract and encourage students to pursue professional engineering licensure or post-graduate studies in engineering field. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project.\r\n\r\nThere are five key objectives: 1) to develop an interactive and comprehensive intelligent database to document, compare, and analyze cutting-edge AI applications in the civil engineering field and use it as the platform and educational media for curricula development and implementation; 2) to develop one new interdisciplinary course  \"AI Tools for Engineering Problem Solving\" for senior engineering students; 3) to enrich current curricula by integrating innovative AI application case studies into twelve existing civil engineering junior and senior level courses; 4) to foster an interdisciplinary academic setting by hosting a server-based intelligent database; and 5) to support undergraduate students' early involvement in research. The project activities can serve as a model for other institutions that desire to strengthen undergraduate education in their engineering and technology programs.",

We plan to revise and enrich sixteen Civil Engineering (CE) and Civil Engineering Technology (CIVT) undergraduate courses with AI application case studies. We also introduced knowledge automation software (tools) to two senior elective courses for computer and electrical engineering students shown at the bottom.&nbsp;Comprehensive AI infused curricula classroom trials&nbsp;were offered to eight&nbsp;different level courses (with green check mark)&nbsp;since Spring semester of 2016, with 63 total credit hours, which equivalent to 21 long semester course sessions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This research has developed and implemented an intelligent database as educational platform.

It serves as an innovative instructional medium to enhance students? learning experiences. Beta version of the database has been developed, modified and installed on 56 computers in the College of Science, Engineering and Technology computer labs/classrooms.&nbsp;&nbsp;At least 400 undergraduate students in the Engineering Department have utilized the database during the project period. It is maintained by the Engineering Department and it will be used for full expansion of the new AI infused curricula after the conclusion of the project. <span>Figure 2 summarizes our conceptual guideline for AI infusion pilot courses.&nbsp;</span>Figure 3 depicts the timeline of AI infusion expansion and progression details. The Engineering Department at TSU now offers&nbsp;enriched curricula with AI infusion to&nbsp;all undergraduate levels, ranging from freshmen to senior, for both core courses and electives. Moreover,&nbsp;new course materials and proposals have been discussed and modified, and soon will be adapted into more courses as planned (total of fourteen courses in the department).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have deployed a full-scaled alignment strategy to guarantee an effective educational process that covers teaching, learning, and student future as a responsible citizen. This three-dimensional alignment strategy includes alignment to teaching objectives, alignment to students? expectations, and alignment to 21-centry STEM field. We gathered data from student learning activities (direct assessment) and national and in-house&nbsp;student&nbsp;surveys (indirect assessment) to study the impacts of the new curricula. The data analysis techniques include the descriptive analysis to find out the frequency data in student surveys, the Independent-Samples T Test to determine if Mean difference is statistically significant with confidence level at 95%, as well as the Grounded Theory method for qualitative data analysis in the indirect assessment. When compared to national benchmarks, TSU results rated fifteen out of twenty-one areas higher than the national average in which they gained a variety of benefits from their AI infusion experiences (Figure 4). With our well-aligned self-developed assessment instruments, TSU student assessment results also indicated very positive results (evidenced in both direct and indirect assessments) in learning engagement, interactions, problem solving skills, future research interests to name a few. To summarize, the new AI infused curricula have noticeably enhanced and enriched the students' experiences by more in-depth learning, generating new knowledge through the exploration of new ideas, improving communication and problem-solving skills. Students received mentoring from faculty not only as their classroom instructor but also as researcher. For future engineers, the ability to understand the problem and to see the big picture is instrumental to their success as responsible practitioners and&nbsp;better candidates for 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;century job market. In addition, TSU project activities can serve as a model for other institutions that desire to strengthen their engineering and technology programs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/30/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Yachi&nbsp;Wanyan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546465000_Figure1Overviewofthecurriculaintegrationframework--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546465000_Figure1Overviewofthecurriculaintegrationframework--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546465000_Figure1Overviewofthecurriculaintegrationframework--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1 Overview of the Curricula Integration Framework</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yachi Wanyan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yachi&nbsp;Wanyan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546538820_Figure2ConceptualGuidelineforAIinfusionpilotcourses--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546538820_Figure2ConceptualGuidelineforAIinfusionpilotcourses--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546538820_Figure2ConceptualGuidelineforAIinfusionpilotcourses--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2 Conceptual Guideline for AI Infusion Pilot Courses</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yachi Wanyan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yachi&nbsp;Wanyan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546666646_Figure3TimelineofAIinfusionexpansionandprogressiondetails--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546666646_Figure3TimelineofAIinfusionexpansionandprogressiondetails--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546666646_Figure3TimelineofAIinfusionexpansionandprogressiondetails--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 3 Timeline of AI Infusion Expansion and Progression Details</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yachi Wanyan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yachi&nbsp;Wanyan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546760756_Figure4SampleResultsofStudentsLearningGains(TSUvs.NationalBenchmarks)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546760756_Figure4SampleResultsofStudentsLearningGains(TSUvs.NationalBenchmarks)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1533569/1533569_10379674_1585546760756_Figure4SampleResultsofStudentsLearningGains(TSUvs.NationalBenchmarks)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 4 Sample Results of Students Learning Gains (TSU vs. National Benchmark)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Yachi Wanyan</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Yachi&nbsp;Wanyan</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
