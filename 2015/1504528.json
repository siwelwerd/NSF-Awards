 "awd_abstract_narration": "Idaho State University (ISU) proposes to add four new cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students to their existing CyberCorps(R) Scholarship for Service (SFS) program in cybersecurity combined with MBA degree. A unique feature of this program is a mandatory participation in a weekly 20-hour Practicum, generating a variety of student research projects focused on the broad theme of organizational information asset protection. Program provides students with hard and soft modalities via emphasis in technical skills as well as policy, operations, and project management. Students need to demonstrate a strong cybersecurity background, critical thinking skills and second language competency. Another feature of the ISU's CyberCorps(R) SFS program is a requirement to complete three standard cybersecurity certifications: Security+, SSCP and CISSP. Integration of MBA business skills with cybersecurity knowledge results in attractive graduates that are in demand by hiring managers of government agencies. The program uses community of scholars approach to learning, case-based cybersecurity projects, Saturday classes for critical thinking topics, hands-on experience in specialized labs, and peer-led learning in policy, procedures and technology.\r\n\r\nThe project is having an immediate impact on the cybersecurity capabilities of the federal workforce by providing graduates with security skills to federal agencies. Through directed work, students may emphasize industrial control systems, cloud security, forensics, secure software, health care security as well as National Security Information procedures. The program has evolved from certification and accreditation focus to continuous monitoring and defensive simulations, including development of cyber competitions and infrastructure simulation. Recruitment of underrepresented groups expands upon the regular recruitment of women and minorities at ISU and is resulting in a better diversity in the SFS program than the overall campus percentages. The PIs have developed a strong partnership with Hampton University, an HBCU, which is creating a strong minority pipeline to the ISU program. Our cyber-range is used worldwide. An annual student led effort during October Cyber Security Awareness month embraced media outlets, including radio PSAs, and cybersecurity lectures at the local schools.",
