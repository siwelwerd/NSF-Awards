 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research focuses on developing strategies to controllably break chemical bonds within polymeric material by adding an inexpensive particle and generating internal heat with applied light. Potential benefits of this research include the development of materials with an additional functionality -- the ability to degrade upon command. Thus this knowledge could enable plastics that are strong and robust during use and then can be triggered to quickly and efficiency break down when the item is no longer needed. This concept follows green design principles by enabling a robust object which can be utilized as many times as possible (without breaking down) and then intentionally transformed into a benign product at the end of life. This strategy would work cooperatively with chemical degradation and provide suitably degraded material for bacterial remediation of plastic.\r\n\r\nThis research tests the hypothesis that the strongly inhomogeneous temperature gradients created in the interior of polymers upon photothermal heating of embedded nanoparticles can be utilized to efficiently trigger thermally-induced bond breaking, possible internal fragmentation of the material, and strongly enhanced degradation as a consequence. Metal nanoparticles strongly absorb light and generate heat as a result. Particles will be incorporated within commercial thermoplastics and biodegradable polymers. The degradation efficacy of photothermal protocols will be compare with that from conventional heating. Aluminum nanoparticles are targeted because they are inexpensive and provide additional thermal energy due to their reaction to aluminum oxide. Aluminum is the most abundant metal on earth and aluminum oxide is an environmentally neutral end product. Enhanced knowledge about the photothermal effect in aluminum nanoparticles, which has previously not been well-explored, will be an additional scientific outcome of this work. Textile Engineering senior design teams will be funded to explore auxiliary topics, such as bacterial remediation, that will enhance the research objectives of this work and contribute to the education of these future engineers and scientists. Senior design students will also develop an interactive experience demonstrating polymer degradation for use in a summer program for high school students, whose demographic historically contains 25% or more STEM unrepresented minorities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe research funded by this project tested different strategies for polymer degradation.  In particular, the differences in degrading with uniform heat (conventionally) versus many isolated internal hot spots (through a process called photothermal heating) were documented.  Nanoparticles embedded in the polymer collected light and converted it to local heat, a photothermal (light-to-heat) process that resulted in very warm temperatures around each nanoparticle, surrounded by cool regions far from any nanoparticles.  For one type of polymer, heating photothermally led to degradation only occurring in the warm regions around each particle, which resulted in mechanical defects and made the polymer samples weak.  This finding may have broader impact for applications where we want degrading polymers to break into pieces so that they can be better processed, for instance, by bacteria.  For a different type of polymer with a different chemical process of degradation, photothermal heating and conventional heating led to almost identical outcomes.  This finding is important because in the photothermal case, visible light was used to create the heat.  This finding may have a broader impact for applications where we want to drive polymer degradation with ambient light (for instance sunlight).   In addition, the ability to use a light-to-heat strategy without making the degrading sample any weaker is important.  As part of the educational broader impact of this grant, a project-based senior design course for physics undergraduate students was developed.  The first students taking the course worked on projects directly related to the grant, but in later years, projects as diverse as designing and building a modular gamma ray telescope and designing and producing a video game that explains important concepts in quantum computing were incorporated. Introducing senior design in physics may serve as a bridge to enable the physics bachelor community to be more effective in industrial settings.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laura I Clarke"
