 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal aims at generating computational mechanisms that will enable individuals to contribute towards making better collective decisions (e.g., news ranking) including crowdsourcing where aggregation of online noise answers can occur. The proposal brings together ideas from economics, statistics, and computation to expand the capabilities of social choice mechanisms to handle large numbers of alternative choices, to extract ground truth from aggregated preferences, and to address problems where individual agents might not be able to compare some alternatives. In contrast to classical social choice theory, which is limited to the selection between two alternatives, the project proposes a rigorous study of a model for computational choice that will be robust enough for discerning between thousands or even millions of alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe proposal could have a profound impact in the way we build multi-agent systems, search engines and recommender systems. The proposed effort can serve as a catalyst in the growing area of computational social choice, including: (1) Rank aggregation has been used in many fields, involving some high impact applications like ranking of news. However, this problem is far from solved using traditional computational social choice methods because they either only work for two alternatives, require full rankings, does poorly in revealing the ground truth, or are hard to compute. The proposed research will develop new methodologies to overcome these deficiencies by designing objective, robust, and computable social choice mechanisms for rich preferences.  (2) Crowdsourcing, whereby online workers' noisy answers are aggregated to produce a better overall answer to some question. This cannot be solved by existing computational social choice techniques as the online workers' answers are often partial orders, workers may manipulate the outcome by providing false answers, and the objective of aggregation is to reveal the true answer. The proposed research will directly tackle these challenges by designing new mechanisms, which are directly applicable to existing systems.",

The major goal of this project is to establish a new theory of social choice by developing new principles and methodologies to combine economics, statistics, and computer science. The project aims at developing general frameworks for researchers and practitioners to discover new mechanisms as well as new paradigms that can potentially guide future directions.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nDirection 1: Truth-revealing social choice. Research in this direction can be categorized into the following two sub-directions.\n\n1.1  Preference learning. The PI and collaborators established the first set of (non)identifiability results of popular statistical models for preferences, especially the Placket-Luce model [ZPX ICML-16], the more general Random utility models [ZVX AAAI-18], and models with features [ZLX IJCAI-23].

The PI and collaborators also designed efficient algorithms for learning and aggregating uncertain preferences [HHX UAI-15, ZLW+ UAI-18, ZX ICML-18, LWLX AAAI-19].\n\n1.2  Truth-revealing and other desiderata.

Research in this direction can be categorized into the following two sub-directions.\n\n2.1  Learning partial preferences. The PI and collaborators have extended the random utility models to handle structured partial orders [ZX NeurIPS-19], general partial orders [LZL+ AAAI-19], and situations where agents and alternatives have features [ZLX IJCAI-23].

Research in this direction can be categorized into the following four sub-directions.\n\n3.1  Automated design. To incorporate fairness and efficiency into AI-powered group decision making, the PI and collaborators have developed a machine-learning-based framework to explore tradeoffs between fairness, efficiency, and privacy [MLC+ JAIR-22]. This framework is flexible and can incorporate classical social choice axiom as well as newly learned desiderata [KKX HCOMP-22].  \n\n3.2  Privacy. The PI and collaborators investigated privacy guarantees of commonly-studied deterministic voting rules  [LLXZ UAI-20] and privacy-fairness tradeoff in social choice [LLX+ AAAI-23].\n\n3.3  Richer dynamics. The PI and collaborators proposed novel frameworks and dynamics for discovering new mechanisms, such as hypothesis testing [Xia UAI-20], iterative voting [KX NeurIPS-21], proxy voting [AFVX AAAI-21], and those of representative democracy [MX NeurIPS-18].\n\n3.4  Beyond the worst-case evaluation.
