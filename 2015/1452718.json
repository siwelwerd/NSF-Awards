 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create advanced algorithms for automatically extracting and evaluating the hierarchical organization of real-world networks. Networks are a ubiquitous feature of complex social and biological systems, including species or genetic interaction networks, online social or offline friendship networks, and more. Interest in networks now spans nearly every scientific discipline. Increasingly, however, answering key scientific questions about complex networks requires new algorithms that can automatically extract their underlying organizational patterns from rich network data, and connect these patterns with scientific hypotheses.  This project creates computational methods that can, for example, recursively separate a network's core from its periphery, distinguish local and global connectivity patterns within a network, and relate these patterns to auxiliary information about vertex attributes and connection strengths and types.\r\n\r\nIn particular, this project will use state-of-the-art probabilistic generative models to: (1) Create advanced algorithms that automatically extract general forms of hierarchical patterns in connectivity, in a manner that is readily interpretable by scientists; (2) Create evaluation methods for distinguishing between alternative structural patterns and for detecting random patterns; (3) Characterize their limitations when applied to answer broad classes of scientific questions and data types, and; (4) Apply these algorithms, in collaboration with domain experts, to answer specific questions about the structure and function of real networks, for example, interactions among biological species, gene recombinations in human pathogenic species, and social interactions among humans. The results of this project will generate new insights into a wide variety of socially and biologically important domains.\r\n\r\nIn addition to creating advanced algorithms with broad applications across science, this project will train new graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge research techniques within the interdisciplinary field of network science, develop and disseminate new educational material on network science, disseminate public-domain software implementations of algorithms, and address real scientific questions in collaboration with scientists from physics, biology, public health, and statistics.",
