This requires, fast, sensitive and specific detection of the virus.  Current methods lack sensitivity and ease of use.  This project will adapt the author's previous method for detecting ultra low Ebola concentration in patient's blood.  Two new methods will be developed; one can be used in the field and the second one, which is more rigorous, is suitable for laboratory tests. These methods are expected to reduce the rate at which Ebola epidemic spreads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently quantitative PCR is the state-of-the-art for Ebola detection, typically from blood samples.  These tests though, are time intensive and require a high degree of expertise to perform.  Further the method is useful when viral concentration is relatively high in the patient. Given the need to test large numbers of people as a part of quarantine strategies, improved early diagnostics are imperative. Therefore the aim of the project is to develop a more sensitive approach to detecting Ebola viral RNA (vRNA) and single viral particles. The research team will develop a single tube assay for detecting viral RNA in whole blood, suitable for field application. In addition, a slide-based assay for detecting single viral particles will also be developed, through the detection of vRNA-protein interactions, with single virion sensitivity suitable for a laboratory setting. In both cases, peptide labeled, single RNA sensitive, RNA imaging probes and proximity ligation assay (PLA) methods will be utilized.  The results will be compared with current methods to demonstrate the improved sensitivity.  The combinations of both site-specific probe binding and distance-dependent detection and amplification, will ensure both specificity (zero errors) and sensitivity (<10 copies/ml).",

These tests though, are time intensive and require a high degree of expertise to perform. Given the need to test large numbers of people as a part of quarantine strategies, improved diagnostics are imperative.  Current methods quote sensitivity of 30-100 copies of viral genomic RNA per ml.  This though is debatable; according to a 2016 CDC report, the sensitivity of the approved field assay is 4000 plaque forming units/ml, meaning 4000 infectious particles per ml.  In our work, we were striving to improve on this.  In response to the need for improved assays, our goals were the following: To develop an improved approach to detecting EBOV viral RNA (vRNA) and single viral particles. \n\nGiven working with Ebola virus itself is quite dangerous, we used a number of model systems to improve on the detection of viral RNA and virions.  We used synthetic RNA targets and the viral genome of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV).  hRSV is respiratory virus that has a genome and virus structure very similar to Ebola, though it does not cause the same disease. We worked on two assays, one to improve detection of RNA, using a straightforward assay, and one to detect viral particles in blood.  Using a combination of magnetic beads, new nucleic acid chemistries and single molecule sensitive fluorescence methods, we were able to achieve detection of ~10 RNAs per bead via microscopy.  For the detection of virion, we were able to achieve detection of ~100 viral particles per sample, but ~1 per bead.  For relatively processed samples, combined with inexpensive detection equipment, this may be a viable commercial approach.  The bead-based approaches did not work well directly in blood. \n\nTo move toward use in blood we instead developed an engineered cell-based approach that only contained biological materials, including antibodies, which are compatible with blood. This is quite critical.  We then pursued this approach using a SHIV (Simian/Human immunodeficiency virus; mostly simian but with an HIV envelope), a blood-borne virus, as our model system.   We were then able to use engineered cells to easily detect individual virions.  This approach has tremendous potential for both lab based assays and field assays, especially if this were combined with shell vial type cell culture systems.   \n\nIn addition to developing new methods, a graduate student was able learn more about the practical difficulties with developing new diagnostics, and pushing the limits of detection.  He is preparing a manuscript for Analytical Chemistry to disseminate our findings.  This student is planning on staying in infectious disease work in the future, working on new diagnostics.
