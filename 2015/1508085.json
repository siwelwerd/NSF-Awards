 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry is supporting Professor Steven Eppell at Case Western Reserve University and Professor Fredy Zypman at Yeshiva University to develop a scanning probe-based technique to map charge onto the surfaces of nanoparticles and molecules with sub-10 nm resolution.  Studying charge distributions is an old problem for which fundamental understanding of the process is still lacking. Gaining insight into those fundamentals is expected have broader scientific impact in areas such as self-assembly at interfaces and macromolecular interactions.  The project will also provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students through both research activities and the development of a new interdisciplinary lab/theory course on \"SFM (Scanned Force Microscopy) Use in Basic Science\". Both PIs actively recruit and engage talented junior students, especially those from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research uses high speed digitization of passive sensors coupled with a theory that reliably converts sensor position into force curves and maps charge onto surfaces of nanoparticles and molecules submerged in electrolytes with sub-10 nm resolution.  The proposed research objectives are (1) to develop a measurement process that converts experimental scanned force microscope force-distance curves into charge density measurements on an object of interest with sub-10 nm spatial resolution; (2) to calibrate the system using known charged nanospheres; and (3) to demonstrate the proposed approach to study the self-assembly and mechanics of collagen nanofibrils, the formation of nanochains and the creation of rechargeable heavy metal cation chelators using magnetic nanoparticles. The technical approach being developed has the potential to impact the discovery process for new materials by allowing existing theories to be matched with experimental measurements of charge distribution, and by allowing synthetic chemists to identify sub-populations of desired products existing within a larger group of otherwise undesired byproducts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project Instrument Development: Charge Sensing In Fluids With Nanometer Precision (federal award id 1508085) was funded by the National Science Foundation from 2015 until 2021, and lead by Steven Eppell and Fredy Zypman-Niechonski.\nThe original aim of the project was to develop the necessary foundational science to produce a method within atomic force microsopy, to measure electric charge on nanomaterials with unprecedent spatial resolution: better than 10 nanometers accross.\n\nWhile there exist techniques to measure charge of small particles, they are designed neither to address individual particles nor to focus on charge content within the particles.  In addition to the high spatial resolution mentioned before, the technique developed in this project solves these additional problems.\n\nElectric charge is ubiquitous around us and a deeper understanding of its arcane behavior in the mundane is centrally necessary to make scientific and technological progress in our current times.  Indeed, electric charge is present in all biological processes including those that control our health.  Electric charge is also present in environmental hazards and in the techniques to process them.  It is present in electronic communications including the early versions of quantum computers.  The food industry depends ultimately on harnessing the knowledge of charge interactions at the nanoscale to naturally extend the life of products, a necessary requirement that must be considered when planning the supply chain.\n\nThus, the charge measurement procedure developed with NSF funding will have infulence in areas far beyond those touched direclty by this research.  In addtion, the discoveries made by the principal investigators, Eppell and Zypman-Niechonski, are of deep scientific relevance.  On the one hand, they refined the use of the atomic force microscope sensor to allow it to correctly convert its dynamics into charged sample-sensor force interactions.  On the other hand, the immerse themselves into the non-trivial problem of elucidating the charge interactions within a fluid medium, which itself is generally charged.  This considerations finally led to the development of an algorithm and software development to assess charge content within tiny regions, less that 10 nanomenters on a side.\n\nThe results of these investigations spilled outside of the research realm, into the educational area.  Indeed, the principal investigators have developed teaching materials for university students based on their discoveries.  For example, the dynamics of the atomic force microscope interacting with charged samples is now a section in the syllabus of Mathematical Methods in Physics, a course offered yearly.  Also, the problem a methods of solutions of charges in liquids is currently being developed pedagogically to be taught in the spring 2022 semester in the Advanced Electromagnetic Theory course.\n\nFifteen students have participated directly in research subprojects during the life of the grant.  The have worked in both experimental and theoretical projects, and in basic science and technology development,\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven J Eppell"
