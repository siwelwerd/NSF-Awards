 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Research Council in 2013 released the report Monitoring Progress toward Successful K-12 STEM Education: A Nation Advancing?, which outlined 14 Indicators as well as the needed research and development to create a system to monitor the quality of STEM education in the nation. This project is funded in response to a Dear Colleague Letter request for research in the Promoting Innovation in Measurement and Evaluation program focused on developing research and tools to advance the nation's capability to measure these indicators. The researchers in this project will address Indicator 5: Classroom coverage of content and practices in the \"Common Core State Standards\" and \"A Framework for K-12 Science Education.\" The quality of instructional practice is generally considered among the most important factors influencing student learning in STEM, yet is costly to reliably assess through direct measures such as classroom observation. The Classroom Artifacts as Indicators of STEM Classroom Practice project will design and study a set of  protocols that use typical classroom work such as homework, projects, quizzes and tests as a source of evidence for measuring the range and quality of instructional practices in mathematics and science classrooms. \r\n\r\nResearch activities will be carried out in four phases. In phase one the research team will review literature and available protocols for artifact evaluation, and will survey large-scale data collection systems that make use of classroom artifacts. In phase two the project will convene a working session with an expert advisory committee to collaboratively design the mathematics and science artifact protocols, scoring processes, and the Phase three pilot study. In phase three the project will pilot the protocols with 500 teachers of mathematics and science and will convene the advisory committee to review findings and further revise the prototypes.  The project will also gather validity information through structured interviews of the artifacts with a subset of the math and science teachers who submitted classroom artifacts. In phase four, the project will produce webinars that will reach and be useful to a national audience of researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers. The project will develop prototype measures that have potential for broad use or adaptation in a range of national and international data collections and/or at the district level to gather evidence about the nature and quality of instructional practice in mathematics and science classrooms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA key way to understand the intellectual challenges that students experience in classrooms is to examine the work that they are asked to do.  Artifact studies of classroom assignments and assessments have been used to shed light on the quality of instruction.  In most studies, artifacts have been used as a measure to characterize instructional quality at the classroom level. \n\nWith the emergence of new standards in science (Next Generation Science Standards; NGSS) and mathematics (Common Core/College and Career Ready Standards; CCRS), NSF has supported a program of research to investigate potential indicators of instructional quality that attempt to capture performance across classrooms within districts, states, or countries.  The fundamental purpose of this program of research is to develop indicators that can capture the extent to which educational institutions are progressing with respect to the skills, knowledge, and reasoning described by these new educational standards. \n\nAs part of this research program, the Classroom Artifacts as Indicators of Quality in STEM Education project focused on the quality of instructional artifacts that have been and are being developed in math and science classrooms for students in grades 5&ndash;9.  Given the focus of these standards documents, protocols focused on knowledge, core ideas, reasoning, and disciplinary practices.  Specific accomplishments of the work included: \n\nDevelopment of two prototype artifact indicator protocols (one math and one science) that include specifications of evidence to be collected, sampling procedures, and scoring methods (e.g., rubric).  Each protocol was designed to support a range of instructional artifacts across grades and content areas. \n\n\nThe science protocol design was guided by the NGSS framework.  The science protocol consisted of three 4-point dimensions and was designed to be appropriate for science and engineering classrooms.  Dimensions were:  Explanation; Argumentation and Solution Design; Investigation; and Data Analysis and Evaluation.\n\n The math protocol design was guided by the Common Core framework.  The math protocol consisted of four 4-point dimensions: Application and Relevance; Argumentation and Communication; Conceptual Understanding; and Procedural Fluency.  For each of the protocols, exemplars and rationales for each score point on each dimension have been developed.\n\nCompletion of a pilot study that included collecting artifacts, training raters to score them, scoring the artifacts, and carrying out reliability and validity analyses.  Although the samples for both studies were not representative, the pilots were successful in establishing that raters could be trained to score artifacts reliably.  Psychometric support for the dimensional structure of each protocol was observed.  Scores varied substantially but tended to be relatively skewed as the majority of scores were low on the respective scales.  Artifacts that were designed with explicit attention to the standards received higher scores than those that were not designed as part of any standards reform project.\n\nExtension of the work to adapt the protocols to support understanding and improvement of educational practice within local contexts.  Professional development efforts with professional educators have been designed and are being studied.  In these projects, educators have learned about the protocols and then have used the protocols and associated construct definitions to consider the quality of instructional artifacts in their own educational settings.\n\n\nThe project did face challenges in recruiting schools and classrooms, a finding that has implications for any large-scale indicator study that makes use of artifacts.  Despite that challenge, the protocols have strong psychometric characteristics and have the potential to be used in a range of studies that wish to explore the quality of instructional artifacts through the lens of new STEM standards.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Drew H Gitomer"
