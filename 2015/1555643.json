 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project was developed at an NSF Ideas Lab on \"Cracking the Olfactory Code\" and is jointly funded by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Physics Division, the Mathematical Biology program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Chemistry Division, and the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems. The project is a synergistic combination of laboratory experiments and computer modeling that will lead to better understanding of how animals use the sense of smell to navigate in the real world. Almost universally, from flies to mice to dogs, animals use odors to find critical resources, such as food, shelter, and mates. To date, no engineered device can replicate this function and understanding the code used by the brain will lead to many novel applications. Cracking codes, from neural codes to the Enigma code of WWII, is aided by a deep understanding of the content of messages that are being transmitted and how they will be used by their intended receivers. To crack the olfactory code, the team will focus on how odors move in landscapes, how animals extract spatial and temporal cues from odor landscapes, and how they use movement for enhancing these cues while progressing towards their targets. The proposed work encompasses physical measurement of odor plumes, behavioral measurement of animals' paths through olfactory environments, electrophysiological and optical measurement of neural activity during olfactory navigation, perturbations of the environment via virtual reality and of neuronal hardware via genetics, and multilevel mathematical modeling. The PIs will teach and work with undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students and especially recruit students from underrepresented groups in science. The project's results may lead to improved methods for the detection of explosives, new olfactory robots to replace trained animals, and new theoretically-grounded advances in robotic control. The project will inform the development of technologies that interfere with the ability of flying insects (including disease vectors and crop pests) to locate their odor target, thus opening a new door for developing 'green' technologies to solve problems that are of global economic and humanitarian importance.\r\n \r\nThis proposal is a synergistic combination of laboratory experiments and computational modeling that will probe how animals use olfaction to navigate in their environment. Specifically, this effort seeks to solve the difficult problem of olfactory navigation through the following aims: (i) Generate and quantify standardized, naturalistic odor environments that can be used to perform empirical and theoretical tests of navigation strategies; (ii) Determine phenomenological algorithms for odor-guided navigation through behavioral experiments in diverse animal species; (iii) Determine how odor cues for navigation are encoded and used in the nervous system by recording neuronal data and simulating putative neural circuits that implement these processes; (iv) Manipulate olfactory environments and neural circuitry, to evaluate model robustness. In contrast to previous attempts to understand olfactory navigation, the present strategy emphasizes mechanisms that are biologically feasible and explores the wide range of temporal and spatial scales in which animals successfully navigate. The project will generate datasets of immediate use and importance to scientists in theoretical biology and mathematics, engineering (fluid mechanics, electronic olfaction, and robotics) and biology (neuroscience, ecology and evolution).",

For example, odors are chemicals but we still can?t predict how a chemical smells, based on its chemical structure. Our team was part of effort to crack this olfactory code. Based on my theoretical work on the evolution of olfaction, our team of physicists and neuroscientists took up the challenge proposed by my hypothesis: that the olfactory code can only be cracked by understanding its role in spatial navigation. Our lab contributed new experiments and also new theory. In our experiments, we focused on how two familiar species - humans and dogs - navigate to odors. Surprisingly, there have been few studies of search dog behavior and almost none of humans navigating to odors. We built sensors that were worn on professional search dogs, to measure their search strategy. The sensors collected data on sniff pattern, their head position, speed and spatial location. We measured the dog?s search strategy while tracking a human for a quarter mile in a natural habitat, under different weather conditions. We found that dogs compensated quickly according to the conditions, switching between two strategies - slowly searching the ground and quickly scenting the air. We found that these strategies were primarily driven by changes in temperature and humidity. We studied same question in humans, using odors in a real world setting and virtual odors in a simple video game environment, using measurements of real odor plumes, provided by our team collaborators. Measuring behavior in almost 200 participants, we showed that humans could oriented accurately in space with only one odor source to guide them.

This is also the first time an olfactory function has been proposed for the human external nose, despite over a century of research in this field. The second theoretical synthesis is related to the first. Recent studies in neuroscience have documented the surprising result that human memory is influenced by nasal respiration. This means specifically breathing through the nose as breathing through the mouth does not have this effect. Why this should be has been a major mystery.
