 "awd_abstract_narration": "Applications that run on billions of mobile devices backed by enormous\r\ndatacenters hold the promise of personal, always-on healthcare; of intelligent\r\nvehicles and homes; and thus of a healthier, more efficient society.  It is\r\nimperative to make such applications secure by protecting their integrity and\r\nkeeping their data confidential. However, malicious programs (``malware'')\r\ntoday can subvert the best software-level defenses by impersonating benign\r\nprocesses on mobile devices or by attacking victim processes through the\r\nhardware on shared datacenter servers.  Grappling with such intelligent malware\r\nrequires fundamental advances in the hardware-software organization of computer\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nThe key observation behind the research project here is that, while seemingly\r\ndisparate, intelligent malware relies on hiding its hardware-level behaviors\r\nfrom operating system-level monitors. By exposing instruction-level and\r\nmicro-architectural behaviors to software analysis, the proposed Exo-core\r\narchitecture enables a new class of malware detectors.  In addition, Exo-core\r\nintroduces programmable hardware accelerators to synthesize run-time program\r\ntraces into robust models of benign programs. The project will also\r\nintegrate research in hardware-software foundations of computer security\r\ninto a new two-semester research course for undergraduate students.",
