The workshop will help synthesize a vision and needs for intelligent systems research that will provide new capabilities envisioned by EarthCube to advance geosciences. The workshop will catalyze a community and research agenda in the emerging area of Discovery Informatics grounded on geoscience requirements. \r\n\r\nParticipants will discuss how to tackle problems in heterogeneous data integration and visualization (e.g., hand-made sketches, aerial imagery, field-data repositories, stakeholder interviews), ontological reasoning with scientific metadata and mathematical models (e.g., representing uncertainty, simulation predictions, evolving theories). The salient themes arising from discussions at the workshop will be articulated in detail in a final workshop report, which will be made available for the broad research community.",
