 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cells are complex machines filled with molecules that can perform simple logic functions like the circuits inside a computer. Many cells can perform complex behaviors such as engulfing other cells, movement towards a source of food, and remembering past events. Even though most cellular components are believed to be discovered, it is still unclear how the molecules in a cell work together to perform relatively complex actions. This project seeks to solve the problem by applying concepts from theoretical computer science to understand how the cell switches from one activity to another. This will open up new possibilities for re-engineering cells by reprogramming their internal controls. This research program will create novel educational and outreach opportunities based on exposing students from a variety of scientific backgrounds, as well as members of the public with interests in electronics and computer hobbies, to the idea that cells can be viewed as computing machines; therefore awareness of quantitative cell biology among the next generation of engineering students will increase.  \r\n\r\nWhile general understanding of the molecular biology of cells is constantly increasing, it has proven difficult to integrate this molecular scale information into a global view of how cells make decisions and perform complex behaviors like migration, phagocytosis, and division. The goal of this project is to connect the huge gap in complexity and detail from the molecular scale to the level of cell behavior by using concepts from computer science.  In computer science, the highly complex details of electronic circuitry can often be understood, analyzed, and designed by using abstract models in which a complex system is represented by a finite set of states, allowing behavior to be represented by transitions between states. Such models are called finite state automata and they are the most fundamental representation of a computing device. In this project cells are described as finite state automata, by using organelle size measurements to identify and define distinct states. It is hypothesized that an organelle-level state description will allow for the reduction of the dimensionality of the state space from millions of dimensions corresponding to individual molecules in the cell down to a much smaller number of dimensions based on organelle morphological measurements that are readily observable in living cells. Large numbers of cells will be imaged at high resolution, numerical descriptors of each organelle will be described, and a state space for cellular organization will be defined using statistically rigorous methods to define states and state transitions. The investigators will explore how chemical and mechanical inputs to the cell drive transitions within this state space, thus providing a way to view the cell as a type of finite-state automaton. Such a representation will also provide a framework for synthetic biology applications in which the regulatory pathways that determine state transitions could be re-wired to produce different behaviors, essentially turning a single cell into a programmable microdevice. The conceptual framework of the cell as a decision-making computational device will be harnessed to present outreach exhibits at Maker Faires, which are an ongoing series of events that bring together electronics, computer, and crafts hobbyists. \r\n\r\nThis project is co-funded by the program in Cellular Dynamics and Function in the division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate of Biological Sciences and the programs in Statistics and Mathematical Biology in the division of Mathematical Sciences in the Directorate of Mathematics and Physical Sciences.",
