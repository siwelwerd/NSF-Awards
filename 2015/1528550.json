 "awd_abstract_narration": "Smart Cities are complex cyber-physical systems with large human populations adding additional complexity.  Instrumentation and modeling are components of a smart city.  Regardless, however, of the ubiquity of instrumentation and precision of models, in the end, humans and human teams will make decisions about citywide operations and management, especially in crisis.  We contend that the hierarchical nature of contemporary command and control systems can create virtual blind spots in which opportunities or dangers may be invisible to the hierarchy because the necessary information is obscured as it moves between levels of abstraction in the hierarchy.  This project will involve teaming with crisis management experts and researchers to develop intelligent agents designed to minimize cognitive load on decision makers, exploit semantic relationships in reports and sensor data to advise of otherwise invisible occurrences, and sequence the actions of ground-level assets to refine causal relationship models to better reflect ongoing developments during crisis and/or event management.  \r\n\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application - a) demonstration of the effectiveness of information presentation and transparency in situations where agents can support and enhance human decision-making without increasing the cognitive workload of the human; b) transfer state-of-the-art foundational research in semantic data and information integration to the complex disaster scenario; c) development of model consistency maintenance tools for automatic update of causal models of various disaster and/or emergency situations. In addition, personnel involved in this project, e.g., graduate students, will receive innovation experiences through the design, development and testing of the model developed.\r\n\r\nThis project will explore transferability of the research results into tools in other application areas such as Pararescuer training, AFRL disaster response system RIPPLE, and Clark County Emergency Management Agency. This project will also have outreach efforts with mentoring high school and undergraduate students at Discovery Lab, Tec^Edge through the Summer at the Edge/Year at the Edge Programs (SATE/YATE).",
