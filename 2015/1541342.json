 "awd_abstract_narration": "Malone University is redesigning its cyberinfrastructure support of scientific research, building a framework that can be utilized by similarly-sized institutions. Malone is improving support of research through: ongoing collaborative planning with campus researchers, information technology personnel, and external partners; implementing an advanced network with application-level network visibility to optimize researcher\u00eds connections to resources and better troubleshoot when issues arise; improving its connections to peer institutions by configuring a Science DMZ, Internet2, and InCommon; and by creating a pool of student-driven programming and technical resources for the explicit purpose of supporting campus researchers.\r\n\r\nMalone is systematically documenting and sharing this process; building a collaboration framework that can be referenced and leveraged by other small institutions who seek to support their own campus researchers. Expertise of statewide ISP OARnet will be leveraged in all aspects of the project but especially in the areas of the ScienceDMZ, Federated Identity (InCommon), and Internet2.",
