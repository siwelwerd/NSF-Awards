 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal sets out a goal to understand the dynamics of nanopore-Room Temperature Ionic Liquids (RTIL) interactions better, in order to improve the ability to design better supercapacitors for energy-storage. The specific objective of this research is to investigate, using atomistic simulations, the electrically-driven transport of RTILs in nanopores and its applications in the charging dynamics of supercapacitors. \r\n\r\nSuccess of this project can help the development of new energy-storage approaches by providing a better understanding of the fundamentals of RTILs in super-capacitors that use nanoporous materials. The PI has an active plan to train undergraduates, participate in K-12 outreach activities, and to publicly share the PI?s Molecular Dynamics codes for modeling charged interfaces, which is an efficient way of disseminating the outcome of this research.",
