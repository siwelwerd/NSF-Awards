 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information in the form of chemicals and energy flows constantly through complex networks of marine microbes. In the surface ocean, sunlight and atmospheric carbon dioxide are captured by autotrophic unicellular phytoplankton and transformed into a vast pool of organic matter that microbes use as metabolic currencies and signaling molecules to form the basis for different trading alliances. Several little-known sulfonate compounds have recently been identified as key currencies underlying marine bacterial-phytoplankton mutualisms and appear to be widespread in coastal communities. In this project, the fellow will investigate the prevalence and role of sulfonates in marine microbial interactions and their resulting impact on the Earth's biogeochemistry. With sponsor Dr. E. Virginia Armbrust at the University of Washington, the fellow will advance professionally through interdisciplinary training in microbial ecology and marine biogeochemistry. Broadening participation activities include mentorship of an undergraduate and development of an outreach program for a local minority-serving high school where students will conduct classroom laboratory exercises using microbiological and bioinformatics concepts. \r\n\t\r\nSulfonates are produced and degraded by several important phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacterial taxa, respectively. Yet, these compounds represent a poorly understood component of the marine organic matter pool. To the extent that sulfonates account for an unquantified flux of carbon and sulfur that supports mutualisms between bacteria and phytoplankton, sulfonates represent cryptic missing links in both carbon and sulfur transformations in the ocean. In this study, the fellow will use laboratory-based approaches to examine physiological and ecological controls on sulfonate production in model phytoplankton species and field-based approaches to examine taxonomically driven dynamics of sulfonate pools in the coastal waters of Puget Sound and surrounding North Pacific. Specifically, the fellow will perform metabolic profiling of model sulfonate-producing phytoplankton taxa (Aim I) and measure spatiotemporal gradients and turnover rates of sulfonates in the ocean environment using targeted in situ metabolite surveys (II) and stable isotope incubations (III), respectively, together with transcriptomics-based identification of marine microbes that control the fate of sulfonate-derived carbon (IV). The planned experiments will provide the first intensive characterization of sulfonates in the environment in terms of their contribution to the marine organic matter pool, their taxonomically driven spatiotemporal dynamics, and their roles in ocean ecosystem interdependencies.",

Through photosynthesis, phytoplankton are able to use energy from sunlight to transform carbon dioxide into hundreds of thousands of different organic molecules. Bacteria and other microorganisms that inhabit seawater consume these different phytoplankton-derived molecules as food and energy sources, an exchange that represents one the most rapid and crucial steps in the ocean carbon cycle. This National Science Foundation fellowship focused on characterization of a special class of sulfur-containing molecules called sulfonates (defined by their R-SO<sup>3-</sup> functional group) that represents a missing link in carbon and sulfur transformations in the ocean.

Using this new method, sulfonates were quantified in ~30 different phytoplankton and bacterial species. These observations indicate that sulfonates can be some of the most abundant molecules produced in eukaryotic phytoplankton cells, accounting for ~10% of the cellular organic sulfur. Sulfonate measurements were also made in natural ocean communities during three cruises in the North Pacific Ocean. Both spatial and temporal patterns were observed in sulfonate abundances. Spatially, sulfonate abundance appears to correlate with the abundance of their primary biological source, eukaryotic phytoplankton. Temporally, some sulfonates show strong diel patterns, likely a reflection of changes in cell size and photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton cells over the day-night cycle. Rate measurements of sulfonate consumption were performed while at sea and indicate rapid turnover times, with estimates of the entire pool being recycled in ~1 day. By pairing these chemical measurements with additional gene expression measurements, further insight has been gleaned into the specific organisms that produce and degrade sulfonates in the sea. Through this project, there is now a greater appreciation for the prevalence and role of sulfonates in the marine microbial food web. This work has provided the first intensive characterization of sulfonates in the marine environment in terms of their contribution to the ocean carbon cycle and marine ecosystem.</p>\n<p>This project supported interdisciplinary training in microbial ecology and marine chemistry for the fellow at the University of Washington.
