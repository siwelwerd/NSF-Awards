 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project in the School of Technology at North Carolina A&T State University (NCA&T) seeks to enhance students' knowledge and instruction in technological innovation using a project-based approach. This training program will be integrated as part of the undergraduate and graduate courses in innovation and technology management while preparing students for the Ph.D. program in Technology Management which is offered at NCA&T through a consortium of five other universities. Undergraduate students are involved in the implementation of this project.\r\n\r\nThe specific objectives of the project are to: create instructional materials for technological innovation in the context of manufacturing and services; incorporate the new content into one new course, one course in the undergraduate applied engineering technology program and one graduate course in the Master of Science in technology management program using project-based learning and case studies; and study the impact of this education and training on students' learning outcomes. Improvements in areas such as higher order cognitive skills, self-efficacy, ease of learning of subject matter, teamwork, and communication skills will be evaluated. The findings of this project will be disseminated and materials will be developed into an instructional package which will be publically available and can be adapted by other institutions to educate and train students in technological innovation.",
