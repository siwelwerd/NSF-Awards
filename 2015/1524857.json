 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Postdoctoral Research Fellowship proposal focuses on characterizing photochemical reactions (caused by sunlight) on laboratory-generated snow crystals. The research will evaluate the impact of crystal type on photochemical reaction rates, and compare these findings to observations from previous work conducted in frozen solution and other natural snow analogs. Because many of the important reactions in snow are photochemically driven, the exact nature of the reaction environment must be well characterized in order to fully understand chemical reactions in snow.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project has the following objectives: (1) develop and build a machine to make nature-identical snow and incorporate impurities into the synthetic snow; (2) determine the location of impurities in this nature-identical snow; (3) determine the relative actinic fluxes for various impurity locations and with various crystal habits; (4) for synthetic snow made in liquid nitrogen, a commonly used snow analog, determine the location of impurities and local actinic flux; and (5) compare photochemistry of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in various compartments of nature-identical and liquid nitrogen synthetic snows.\r\n\r\nIdentifying the locations of co-condensed impurities in nature-identical snow crystals will improve understanding of the possible suite of chemical transformations in the crystals and the eventual fate of their reaction products. Measurements of the sensitivity of photochemical parameters to crystal habit will provide information important for proper modeling of snow and ice photochemistry. By determining photolysis rates for several PAHs under varying snow crystal morphologies and impurity locations, this research will provide useful information about reaction rate constants under natural conditions, including sensitivity to impurity location or crystal habit. These data will help to resolve current discrepancies in measured photolysis rates. The proposed research will significantly advance the understanding of snow and ice photochemistry by providing both a refined tool to study the natural environment and substantial data to more accurately understand photochemical reactions in snow and ice.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSnow can be an important reservoir for chemicals, particularly in polar regions (the Arctic and Antarctic).  Because snow is porous to air, chemicals can move between the snow and the environment.  And because light can penetrate into the snow, photochemical reactions (chemical reactions caused by light) are particularly important. \n\nFurther complicating our understanding of chemistry in snow, chemicals in snow can be present in at least three different reservoirs ? in the bulk ice of the snow crystals, in liquid-like regions between ice crystals, and at the air-ice interface of the snow.  Some previous work has reported somewhat faster photodegradation for organic compounds found in liquid-like regions within ice, and even faster when those compounds are at the air-ice interface.  However, these studies did not measure photon fluxes within the sample, and not all previous studies found enhancement.  Furthermore, these studies were done on ice pellets, which do not resemble natural snow. \n\nTo address these shortcomings, we built a machine to make nature-identical snow in the laboratory, then deposited chemicals to the surface of the snow.  Finally, we illuminated the snow, and measured how fast the chemicals disappeared.  Compared to how quickly the same chemicals are destroyed by light in water, we  found large enhancements at the air ice interface (up to 77-fold for guaiacol, considerably larger than measured in previous studies) for four test compounds, and determined they were changes in chemical reactivity, rather than attributable to increases in the local photon flux. \n\nThese findings could have implications for how chemicals, including pollutants, are changed in snowpacks, which could affect concentrations of chemicals in the atmosphere.  More work is needed to identify the importance of these changes, and what kinds of chemicals are affected. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ted Hullar"
