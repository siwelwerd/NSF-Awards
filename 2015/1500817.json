 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project the principal investigator will tackle problems in two areas in partial differential equations.  The first involves equations for functions that vary with space but not with time.  Such stationary problems model many physical systems in equilibrium, from static electric fields to configurations of elastic bodies, and also arise in fundamental investigations in mathematical analysis, including potential theory and analytic function theory.  Problems of this type often involve unknown functions defined on bounded regions.  One goal of this project is to extend our knowledge of how to handle such problems when the boundaries are quite rough.  The second area involves evolution equations, for functions that vary with time.  Core classes of interest in this project include equations for wave motion, both for classical waves and variants, such as Schrodinger equations and Dirac equations, whose origins lie in the motions of atoms.\r\n\r\nThis project will develop tools to advance the study of elliptic systems on domains with uniformly rectifiable boundary, which is essentially the maximal class of domains on which one can use singular integral operator techniques. One class of problems that will be tackled consists of Riemann-Hilbert type problems.  These were first studied on planar domains, with piecewise smooth interfaces.  This project will develop higher dimensional versions of Riemann-Hilbert problems, on domains with uniformly rectifiable interfaces. A related study will involve a development of the index theory of Toeplitz operators on such rough domains.  The other major part of this project concerns evolution equations.  Specific problems to be tackled include studies of wave decay, via various mechanisms, some related to the formation of harmonics on stringed instruments, but in a higher dimensional context. In addition, wave decay problems will be considered on domains with rough geometry, including cases where the main geometrical hypothesis is a lower bound on the Ricci tensor, and the challenge is to develop a theory of geometrical optics in this setting.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcoms for NSF DMS-1500817\n\nMichael E. Taylor\n\nThis project dealt with a variety of problemsin partial differential equaitons.  The sorts of problems treated fall roughly into two categories.  One consists of equations for functions defined in some spatial domain, with no time dependence, and the other consists of equations for functions that depend on both space and time.  The former are called stationary problems and the latter evolution equations.\n\nEvolution equations model things in motion, particularly wave motion and fluid motion.  One specific problem treated in this project involves incompressible fluid flow on the surface of a rotating body.  This is physically significant, as a model of air flow on a rotating planet.  The rotation gives rise to a Coriolis force, which has an important impact on the nature of the fluid motion, from the production of hurricanes on Earth to the formation of bands in the atmosphere of Jupiter.  The observation that such bands keep their shape for a long time motivated both long time existence theorems and stability analysis done in this project.\n\nStationary problems studied in this project center about space sof null solutions to first order elliptic systmes, of a sort arising in Hodge theory and Dirac equations.  Particular problems focus on operators defined on spaces of such null solutions, known as Toeplitz operators.  Analysis of such operators also figure in work on multidimensional Riemann-Hilbert problems, which involve transmission conditions across interfaces.\n\nThis project also explored other tools in PDE, including the Fourier analysis behind logarithms of Laplace operators and their inverses, the analysis behind uncertainty principles, as they arise in quantum theory, and the analysis of the concentration of eigenfunctions of a class of sublaplacians, of interest in quantum ergodic theory.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/16/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael E Taylor"
