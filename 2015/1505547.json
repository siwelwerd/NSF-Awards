We anticipate 150-200 academic and industrial\r\nresearch scientists from around the world will attend. NMC has been held in Asia, Europe,\r\nand the U. S. annually since 2004. The organization promotes cross- pollination of ideas from\r\nall corners of the globe. The conference consists of oral presentations (invited and juried),\r\nposter sessions, and time for informal networking and discussion. All materials presented\r\nat the meeting are invited to submit a more comprehensive version of their work in a special\r\nedition of the IET journal Micro Nano Letters.\r\n\r\nThe NMC workshop is focused on interdisciplinary research on and with nanoscale sensors. NMC\r\nstarted as a \"Nano mechanical cantilever\" meeting but has grown along with innovations in\r\nNano mechanics and probing at the nanoscale. NMC Workshops are non-profit academic meetings\r\nwhich are self-supporting; the meetings rely on contributions and attendee tuition to offset\r\nall expenses. NSF support is requested to assist in keeping the tuition rate as low as possible\r\nto enable a larger number of students and postdoctoral trainees to attend. NMC2015 provides\r\na single session technical program with the latest research on Nano sensing including renowned\r\ninvited speakers, contributed oral and poster presentations and excellent networking opportunities.\r\nNMC aims to promote interaction among researchers in the micro and Nano sensing and device\r\ncommunity interested in addressing high-impact issues in chemical, biological and physical\r\ndetection e.g. applications from homeland security and health, to materials research for computing\r\nand energy. An important component of the meeting is discussion and exploration on bringing\r\nthis research to the real world. Conference participants hail from major universities and \r\nresearch facilities in the world.\r\n\r\nTechnical\r\n\r\nStudents will be participating in this conference. Attending sessions, and discussing with the researchers in the fields. They will be able to present their technical papers and discuss the latest technology on nanosensors.",
