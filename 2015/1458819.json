Recruitment plans will target transfer students from Minnesota and neighboring states.  This project will build on the successes of a previous S-STEM project at SCSU and will improve SCSU STEM programs, will continue the development and enhancement of student support structures, and will increase SCSU's contributions to the national need for STEM graduates.  \r\n\r\nStudent support structures, such as faculty and peer mentoring, advising, mentoring and tutoring, will be enhanced to ensure student success.  Students will be assigned a faculty mentor, a graduate assistant and senior student support.  Students may optionally engage in a research project, take a 1-credit seminar course or complete an internship in industry or in a national lab that will provide them with practical skills to will help them to be successful in the workplace.  Assessment plans will evaluate the efficacy of the enhancements to the SCSU student support infrastructure and will track student success after leaving the program.",

Students were selected via a tested and refined application and interview process. Senior project personnel selected participants and ensured that they meet program qualifications. This project increased student success and degree attainment in STEM fields and potentially STEM related employment. This process led to academic opportunity and success for many financially challenged academically talented students.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit \n\nAn impact on intellectual merit can be found in the advancement of knowledge for the cohorts of students who were fortunate enough to have been selected for the program. Student scholar and professional development activities for this project were adapted and developed to promote student scholar engagement and relationships with student cohorts, mentors, and experts in the field. Activities which supplemented student scholarships include: mentorship by faculty and graduate students in STEM, development of STEM learning communities, a STEM scholar leadership and soft skills workshop series, and enhanced opportunities for early undergraduate research experiences.

An experienced and diverse team led this project and helped to ensure that this project was executed in an appropriate manner.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nA broader impact of this program was to provide a path to success for each of the cohorts of students. This will benefit society and the workforce as it will help provide a better educated workforce. The outcomes of this project benefited society and contributed to the achievement of specific, desired societal outcomes.  Broader impacts of the research and dissemination of outcomes of this project offer to assist in informing future projects throughout the country about program components which were successful in this program.
