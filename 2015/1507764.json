 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL:\r\n\r\nIonic polymer membranes are used to purify water, convert chemical energy to electrical energy (batteries and fuel cells), and conduct a wide variety of chemical separations.  By controlling membrane chemical structure, it is possible to generate desirable highly conductive (but soft and liquid-like) regions that are surrounded and supported by mechanically and chemically robust regions.  A key problem in designing new membranes lies in understanding the details of these various regions in the membranes, and how these regions affect the movement (transport) of water and ions such as lithium, sodium, and chloride.  This project pulls together disparate techniques and theories, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), computational simulations, electron microscopy, and X-ray analysis, to understand how membrane structure influences properties.  Indeed, new insights into membrane behaviors can only arise from such a combined multi-disciplinary approach.  Such new fundamental knowledge would enable the design of membrane structures to accelerate ion and water motions.  In turn, these advances in design would provide valuable information to engineers and entrepreneurs to increase the efficiency and decrease the cost of devices such as water purification systems and advanced power sources.  Since membrane technology represents a $15B (and growing) commercial market, such advances could bring huge gains in US productivity and competitiveness.  The project also involves education and training of undergraduate and graduate students, as well as K-12 educational outreach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL:\r\n\r\nMembrane-separations applications such as reverse-osmosis water desalinization and fuel cells involve the selective transport of water, alcohols, and ions through an ion-containing polymer (an ionomer). What effects drive the transport of these various mobile species inside an ionomer membrane?  These effects can be thought to arise from a combination of two major contributions:  1) local intermolecular interactions such as ion and water associations, polymer chain topology, or acidity; 2) morphological features such as phase symmetry (cylindrical, lamellar, cubic) and domain sizes and properties. This project will work toward an experimental and theoretical framework for quantitatively separating and fundamentally understanding these two major regimes that affect transport.  By combining an array of cutting-edge nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods combined with molecular dynamics simulations, microscopy and X-ray analyses, this project will systematically study water and ion diffusion as well as local intermolecular associations inside ionomer membranes and thus build a more comprehensive mechanistic understanding of permeation and selectivity in these materials. Starting with existing theories of molecular transport, fluid permeation through porous media, electrolytic transport, and oriented soft matter, new thinking and theories will arise regarding membrane behaviors.  In a broader context, this project aims toward design of all new materials that are less expensive, more efficient in energy use, more robust, and more specific to desired tasks.  Students and collaborators involved in this project will gain sophisticated and fundamental knowledge of polymer membrane behaviors.  This new knowledge will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate polymer science classes on the Virginia Tech campus, and propagated to children and their parents in a K-12 educational outreach program in the New River Valley region of Southwest Virginia.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Final Outcomes Report \nCorrelating Transport with Ionomer Membrane Structure from Molecular to Micron Scales\nPI:  Professor Louis A. Madsen at Virginia Tech\n\nCharged polymer membranes are used to purify water, convert chemical energy to electrical energy (batteries and fuel cells), and conduct a wide variety of chemical separations.  By controlling membrane molecular structure, it is possible to integrate highly conductive regions into the membranes that are surrounded by a non-conductive scaffold that can carry mechanical loads and is chemically stable.  A key problem in designing new membranes lies in understanding the details of these various regions in the membranes, and how these regions affect the movement (transport) of water and ions such as protons, hydroxide, lithium and sodium.  This project has brought together disparate techniques and theories, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), computational simulations, electron microscopy, and X-ray analysis, to understand how membrane structure influences transport.  By developing new fundamental knowledge about membrane behaviors and operation mechanisms, we can begin to rationally design membrane structures to accelerate ion and water motions instead of making membranes traditionally through trial and error.  Such advances in fundamental design rules can provide valuable fodder to engineers and entrepreneurs to increase the efficiency and decrease the cost of devices such as water purification systems and advanced batteries.  Polymer membrane technology represents a growing ($20B) commercial market, so advances in our basic understanding promise to bring huge gains in US productivity and competitiveness. \n\nThe summary figure illustrates some key concepts and discoveries from this project.  Part A shows water moving inside a nanometer-scale conductive pathway (blue) inside a polymer membrane, and we can consider that molecular interactions can determine motion of the water on this scale.  In part B, we look at a different scale (about 10 nanometers), where we see an interconnected network of conductive pathways (dark blue) where some of them are ?broken? and have dead ends where the water cannot freely move through.  If we zoom out further, to the 10 micrometer scale shown in part C, we have larger regions where the conductive pathways are not uniform.  We have developed techniques (NMR, computations, microscopy) to measure the effects of molecular structure and the ?dead end? structure on movement of water or other ions through these membranes.  Part D shows an effect on ?tortuosity? which is a parameter that measures how restrictive the pathways are to water transport.  As we increasingly hydrate polymer membranes, we can quantitatively measure that the tortuosity values decrease, meaning that more dead ends become connected and the water can move more freely through the membrane.  By incorporating these measurements into membrane design schemes, we can improve the efficiency of these membranes and quickly understand why some will work in industrial applications and some will not.\n\nBased on the research accomplished in this project, the Madsen Group at Virginia Tech has published 13 journal articles in high impact scientific journals such as Advanced Materials, Macromolecules, and Journal of Membrane Science.  Madsen has disseminated this work in over 35 invited lectures at international meetings and at universities in the US, Japan, The Netherlands, Italy, and Australia.  Three students have graduated with PhDs from this project, and one with an MS degree.  Three undergraduate researchers involved in this project (all female and/or underrepresented minorities) are now in PhD programs or long term research employment.  All of these students and former students have gained valuable polymer and membrane science training, have mentored and educated younger students, and all have given oral and poster presentations at national and international meetings. The new knowledge from this project has also been integrated into four different undergraduate and graduate polymer science classes on the Virginia Tech campus. \n\nThis project has also involved cultivating programs for fostering scientific curiosity in young children (K-12), through hands on activities aided by parental involvement.  The Madsen lab group has participated in two types of hands-on creative discovery days during this project.   During the weekends of April 2015 and March 2017, the group worked with Kids Tech University at Virginia Tech, interacting each time with 60-100 kids aged 6-12 with our polymer science demonstrations and kits.  Our group additionally participated in the Virginia Tech Science Festival in November of 2015, 2016 and 2017, each time interacting with over 300 kids aged 8-18 and their parents.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Louis A Madsen"
