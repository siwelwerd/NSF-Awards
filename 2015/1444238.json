 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative project will support a planning visit to Ethiopia to determine if early Mesozoic non-marine fossils from the Northwestern Plateau of Ethiopia can help fill a critical knowledge gap regarding mammalian evolution and distribution at the time of the breakup of the supercontinent of Pangaea. The project will look specifically at Upper Triassic-Lower Jurassic formations, seeking to find vertebrate fossils that will provide better information on the evolution, diversification and dispersal of vertebrates across ancient Africa and into Eurasia and the Americas. \r\n\r\nThe overall effort will support travel to Ethiopia by four faculty members and four graduate students. In addition to their excellent qualifications and diverse expertise in paleontology and geosciences, the team includes two early career investigators, three underrepresented ethnic minorities and a woman. The team will work closely with counterparts in Ethiopia from the University of Addis Ababa. The month-long planning visit will include several days for seminars and information exchange between the US team and their Ethiopian collaborators in Addis Ababa, three weeks of collaborative field work to conduct in depth reconnaissance at two sites, then several days to plan and initiate sample processing and begin writing a larger follow-on proposal. \r\n\r\nThe Mesozoic non-marine vertebrate fossil record of Africa remains a virtual \"blank slate\" in comparison to other regions of the world; however, fossil data from this region is critical to understanding how terrestrial communities responded to the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea about 100 million years ago. This part of the world remains relatively un-sampled compared to fossil-bearing horizons of similar age in North and South America and Asia. Ethiopia is strategically positioned with extensive Mesozoic sedimentary rock formations and these fossils may prove very valuable to improving understanding of the paleobiogeography and evolution of many major non-marine vertebrate groups, such as dinosaurs, mammals, lizards, snakes and amphibians.\r\n\r\nThe team has identified two target sampling sites in Ethiopia where early Mesozoic formations are well exposed and may be effectively explored and preliminary samples collected: the Late Jurassic Mugher Mudstone of the upper Blue Nile (Abay) Gorge, and the Early Jurassic Adigrat Formation of the Tigray Province. \r\n\r\nThis collaborative US-Ethiopia planning visit provides a valuable opportunity to begin the multidisciplinary effort that is required to expand the Mesozoic fossil record from Africa. The fossils and science from this proposed project are essential to testing hypotheses regarding early Mesozoic biotas, paleobiogeography following the breakup of Pangaea, and the evolution and dispersal of several modern vertebrate groups hypothesized to originate in Africa. The effort will provide a valuable professional development opportunity for the US team, especially the two early career faculty and the four graduate students. This planning visit will also provide an opportunity for approximately eight undergraduates to gain new research skills and training, in fossil preparation and analysis, as well as experience in museum curation, education and public outreach.",

Here, in the School of Earth Sciences at Addis Ababa University, a day long symposium of talks by both Ethiopian faculty, staff, and students and their counterparts from the US, were presented on the Mesozoic non-marine vertebrate fossil record and geology of the Northwestern Plateau and surrounding areas. A history of earlier paleontolgoical and geological expeditions provided the introduction to future work confimred at this conference and funded by this NSF grant. Following this meeting, plans were confirmed to conduct fieldwork in the Upper Jurassic Mugher Mudstone exposed in the broad river valleysdeep in the Blue Nile (Ababy) Gorge and and its local tributaries, and in the UpperTriassic-Lower Jurassic lower Adigrat Sandstone farther north in Tigray Province along the Mekele Outlier. We agreed to develop continuing research collaborations with Ethiopian faculty and plan for training US and Ethiopian students.</p>\n<p>In 2016, the international field crew participants were: Mark B. Goodwin (UC Berkeley, Museum of Paleontology), Randall B. Irmis (Univ. of Utah), Gregory P. Wilson (Univ. of Washington), Dave DeMar (Postdoc, Univ. of Washington), Keegan Melstron (PhD student, Univ. of Utah), Cornelia (Conny)&nbsp;&nbsp;Rasmussen (PhD student, Univ. of Utah), Balemwal Atnafu (Earth Sciences Dept., Addis Ababa University), Dawit Lebenie (Univ. of Gondar, Ethiopia), Tadesse Berhanu (PhD student, Oklahoma State Univ., Stillwater), Million Alemayehu (Addis Ababa Univ.), Samuel Getachew (Addis Ababa Univ.), Kumarra Tadese (grad student of Dawit?s, Gonder Univ.).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our strategy of \"more eyes\" looking results in \"more fossils\" discovered was proven in 2016 with the discovery of many more fossil localities and signfiicant specimens, including a partial fossil crocodylform skull and jaws from the Mugher Mudstone at a site visited previously by some members of the crew. Preliminary comparative studies indicate that it is a new species related to <em>Machimosaurus</em>, a clade of crocodyliforms that lived during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods and were adapted to marine and estuarine environments. Additionally, the crew discovered the first confirmed sauropod dinosaur tooth from Ethiopia at a nearby locality. Additional microvertebrate fossils, including a partial fish skull, numerous turtle and croc fossils, and theropd dinosaur teeth were also collected by the group from the Mugher Mudstone. Further exploration in the Blue Nile Gorgeresulted in the discovery of fragmentary dinosaur limb bones in the gorge toward the Zea Wodem River. Our crew was likely the first group of paleontologists to visit this area. Smaller fossils were found by crawling over the outcrops on hands and knees and shoveling sack fulls of dirt from these productive zones for later screen-washing and sorting, a method that allows effiecient recovery of mm-sized fossil bones and teeth that otherwise might be overlooked.</p>\n<p>The second portion of the fieldwork targeted the UpperTriassic-Lower Jurassic Adigrat Sandstone exposed in northern Tigray Province. Serendipity often plays a small part in the discovery of new sites and one morning when a team member's flight was delayed, the fieldcrew decided to visit unexplored outcrops of the Jurassic Agula Formation located near Mekele. Here, dozens of partial sauropod dinosaur bones were found weathering out of the terraced hillside of a local pocket of well exposed layers of the Agula Shale. In no time, the crew was assisted by a group of local school children who assisted in collecting these important fossils that are currently under study by the team.</p>\n<p>Visit to the Adigrat Formation outside of Abi Adi resulted in numberous new localiaties and abundant fossils of temnospondyl amphibian skull and skeletal elements.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In 2018,&nbsp;<span id=\"docs-internal-guid-79de1184-7fff-ae94-5f70-5aa603ae1a99\"><span>Alex Brannick discovered a partial sauropod dinosaur skeleton weathering out in situ from the Agula Shale in the vicinity of the village of Hintalo. This is the first associated dinosaur skeleton from Ethiopia and is the most complete dinosaur found to date. At least five elements were uncovered by the team, including what is likely the ischium and pubis from the pelvis, numerous ribs, and as yet unidentified bones, all closely associated and weathering out in the field. Because time was running short, the crew consolidated the bones to prevent further weathering and buried the skeleton. A future trip is planned to collect in and for continued study of these fossil-bearing sediments exposed on the Northwestern Plateau of Ethiopia both in the Blue Nile (Abay) Gorge and in Tigray Province.</span></span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/17/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mark&nbsp;Goodwin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1444238/1444238_10391811_1543611466245_BlueNileProj_2016--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1444238/1444238_10391811_1543611466245_BlueNileProj_2016--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2016 Field Crew in Ethiopia\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1444238/1444238_10391811_1543611466245_BlueNileProj_2016--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2016 Field Crew in Ethiopia\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">At top of flood basalts that cap Blue Nile Gorge, near Fiche, Ethiopia.
