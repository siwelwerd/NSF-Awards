 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in four meetings in a series of annual conferences in number theory held in Upstate New York; the first conference will take place in Ithaca from April 10 to April 12 in 2015, the second conference in Rochester in 2016, the third conference in Binghamton in 2017, and the fourth conference in Buffalo in 2018. The investigators represent four different institutions: Binghamton University, Cornell University, SUNY-Buffalo, and the University of Rochester. The conference series seeks to have a broader impact in a number of ways. It will help graduate students and post-docs by exposing them to work of leading experts, by allowing them to communicate their own research and interests, and by giving them the chance to interact with experts, among themselves and with young people from nearby places. It will also allow specialists to disseminate their ideas to a larger audience.\r\n\r\nAt the level of faculty research, the conference series will stimulate collaborations among several specialists in the region, while at the same time strengthening ties between researchers in Upstate New York and those near Boston, New York City, Montreal, Philadelphia, Princeton, and Toronto.  The meetings will catalyze the region's research in number theory and will enrich the opportunities for education and professional development available to junior researchers in the region. The first conference will be centered on the themes of arithmetic geometry over finite fields and new directions in automorphic forms. More information about the conference series can be found at http://www.math.cornell.edu/~upstatenumber/.",
