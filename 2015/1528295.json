 "awd_abstract_narration": "This three-pronged project focuses on the grammar of Hiaki (Yaqui), an endangered Uto-Aztecan language spoken in southern Arizona and northern Mexico. Investigating understudied languages like Hiaki provides researchers the opportunity to discover hitherto undocumented diversity in the human capacity for linguistic expression, and hence to test and improve upon models of human language and cognition. Basic descriptive research on a broad array of grammatical areas will be conducted, enabling the drafting of the second volume of a projected three-volume series on the grammar of Hiaki. A series of subtitled videos, useful in language teaching as well as serving documentary purposes, will be produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo particularly intriguing aspects of Hiaki will be the focus of the theoretical component of this research. The grammar of Hiak''s noun phrases is like that of German or Russian, with concord for number and case marking on articles, nouns and adjectives. In contrast, Hiaki's verb phrases resemble those of Japanese, requiring complex suffixation processes instead of complement clauses in many contexts. Surprisingly, noun phrase concord becomes dissociated when the noun phrase mentions a possessor, like 'The dancer's beads', such that number marking on the article tracks the number of the possessor but the case of the whole noun phrase. This pattern of dissociation is not expected in many current models of grammatical agreement. Verb phrases also exhibit an unusual property: They permit passivization of already non-active verbs. These two very unusual features of Hiaki will be investigated in detail in consultation with native speakers of the language, and a model of these grammatical patterns developed. The implications for our understanding of the structure of human language will include a new grasp of when and why such variation can arise, and, potentially, new theories of agreement and passivization, respectively.",

Some of our major analytical findings include: an understanding of how passive on a matrix verb can reflect a passive interpretation on an embedded verb via long-disttance agreement; the discovery that vowel-vowel sequences within certain prosodic domains are resolved by deletion of the first vowel; a unified analysis of subject relative clauses and event nominals formed from impersonal passives (which are marked with the same suffixes); the discovery that the glottal stop consonant of the language in many cases is the prosodically-conditioned realization of an underlying, floating glottalizationo feature, rather than a full-fledged consonant; and the discovery that pluralia tantum nouns is much more widespread in the language than previously thought, and are grouped into several distinct and recognizable semantic classes, according to a hiearchy of 'individuation'.
