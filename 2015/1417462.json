Using anthropological methods of ethnographic interviews, open-ended surveys, and archival research, the project will examine the intersection between the formal legal definitions of hunting and fishing rights among the Aleuts of Alaska and local traditional knowledge of these rights.   This research will contribute to a discussion of the relationship between knowledge and power in the context of resource management and control in Alaska. \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this research are its contributions to the training of the CoPI, a Phd Candidate and an Alaska Native woman, thus increasing the representation of this highly underrepresented group in the social sciences.",
