 "awd_abstract_narration": "The water-energy nexus, and the relationship to food production, is a growing national priority.  Water use for energy production has increased dramatically in the last decade and is expected to increase.  This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site at the Colorado School of Mines (CSM), Water-Energy Education for the Next Generation (WE2NG), offers a unique and experiential program focused on the water-energy nexus for STEM teachers at one of the world's leading science and engineering schools with a long-standing and successful relationship with industry partners. WE2NG will be one of the first RET programs to advance the dialogue on the water-energy nexus through integration of teachers, and ultimately their students with cutting-edge water-energy research and technology. \r\n\r\nOver three years, the RET Site will target 30 K-12 STEM teachers and students from the Jefferson County School District for participation in an eight week intensive summer research program related to water and energy mentored by faculty and graduate students.  The WE2NG program will: 1) Build science proficiency in the water-energy nexus in the regional K-12 system; 2) Enhance science lessons and curriculum that address state science standards; 3) Improve science literacy in the Colorado community through teachers and their students; 4) Promote interest in STEM careers in teacher-student groups through interactions with world class researchers at a top-tier science and engineering school; 5) Provide teacher connections to local industry for long-term partnerships; and 6) Develop long-term infrastructure for sustainable teacher-engineer-scientist interactions at CSM. The WE2NG RET Site program has extensive broader impacts, including explicit and sustainable professional development and the creation of educational materials in the water-energy nexus for Colorado school districts.",

Each year Mines&nbsp;hosted between 10-14 K-12 STEM teachers from the surrounding areas public schools. This included Jefferson County and Denver Public School teachers. Each teacher had to apply, interview and be accepted into the program. Once accepted, the RET program leaders at Mines guided the teachers through a 6-week paid course over the summer to expose the teachers to the latest research in water and energy and research methodologies. Teachers were partnered with Mines researchers over the 6-week course that allowed the teachers to both shadow them in their research and the Mines researchers guided the teachers through their own independent research. The goal of the program was to provide the teachers with tangible hands-on experience, broaden their knowledge of water and energy issues in Colorado, and get them excited to bring new ideas and techniques back into their local science classrooms. Teachers walked away with an increased knowledge of science, greater enthusiasm for their subject, and new curriculum modules developed during their 6-week training. We also brought teachers on industry field trips to expose them to how the research ideas at Mines are being applied in the \"real world\".&nbsp; RET program participants also read current literature on the subject to discuss in a weekly book group format. In this way we exposed the teacher participants to first hand experience, relevant literature and jobs in water resources engineering. Teachers brought this first hand experience and knowledge back to their classrooms where they were able to share their experience and photographs from their summer program as well as immerse students in new curriculum that they were excited about. Mines graduate students visited the K-12 classrooms to further the connection between the teachers experience and the world of academic research. This served to support the teacher in their curriculum and show students what a Mines student looks like, demonstrating that they are regular people with the hopes of inspiring students to pursue careers in STEM. The ultimate goal of the WE2NG RET program was to inspire the next generation of scientists and support the STEM teachers who are in local K-12 classrooms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The WE2NG RET program impacted not only the teacher participants but their students and their families.

One way the WE2NG program further inspired students beyond the program was through field trips. Mines RET program leaders helped to guide field trips both on the Mines campus and out on the rivers whenever the teachers asked for help, so many students got to experience some of the same field trips that the RET participant experienced. The RET teacher participants also developed contacts with industry leaders and collaborators in local non-profits, people that can also be a resource for the teachers and students as guest speakers and fiedtrip destinations. Each teacher was given funds during the program to buy equipment needed for their new curriculum. This could be new lab equipment for students to use and in several cases teachers purchased aquarium equipment to participate in a Trout Unlimited \"Trout in the Classroom\" program where teachers and students raise fish from eggs and then release the native fish into the wild, helping populations of the native species and teaching students about conservation.
