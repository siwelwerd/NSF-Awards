 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research to develop algorithms that will be used in the automation of the design of microfluidic laboratories-on-a-chip (LoC). These algorithms will be integrated into a large tool used to create design files for the fabrication of these devices. Microfluidic LoCs are able to perform chemistry experiments on the micro-liter scale with higher precision and no human intervention. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Tsung-Yi Ho, a noted expert on microfluidic design automation, at National Chiao Tung University in Hsinchu, Taiwan. This project will help lead to the first full tool capable of creating design files for fabricating microfluidic devices while also presenting a low bar of entry to chemists, biochemists, and bioengineers hoping to work in the emerging field of microfluidics. The widespread use of microfluidics in these fields will lead to faster, more economical, and more precise chemical experiments, while also freeing up scientist?s time to work on designing experiments instead of running them.\r\n\r\nWhile there are similarities between very-large-scale integration (VSLI) algorithms used in the design of integrated circuits (IC) and those used in the design of microfluidic LoCs, there are several key distinctions in the manufacturing process that makes the direct use of VLSI design algorithms impossible. Instead this research uses VLSI design algorithms as a basis for the development of new algorithms that can meet the specific requirements needed in the design of microfluidic LoCs. These algorithms will be used to place microfluidic components and route the connections between the components to create a microfluidic layer for the flow and manipulation of chemicals. These algorithms will then be integrated into a larger framework capable of controlling the experiment and generating the necessary support systems for the fabrication of a full microfluidic LoC. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan.",
