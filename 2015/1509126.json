The Internet of Things is one of the most promising areas in computing research today.  Yet there is a fundamental problem that must be addressed if we are going to fully realize the promise of a fully connected world: how to validate the complex mixed-signal integrated circuits that are the foundation of this revolution.  Since these chips tightly couple analog and digital blocks, we need to validate the entire analog/digital system together.  Attacking the mixed-signal validation issue is a key challenge that must be addressed to enable this new future, and it is the topic of this research.\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\nRecent work has started to address this issue, by creating models of the analog blocks that can be run in a digital validation environment. This research extends this prior work in two way. First it will address some of the limitations of the current analog modeling work to both make it more general (handle more types of situations that occur in real circuits), and codify the procedure for creating these models.  This first extension will make it much easier to use the current modeling technique. Unfortunately chip systems are so complex today that software based simulation is often too slow for system validation.  As a result most companies rely on hardware emulation platforms for validation. Thus our second goal is to further extend our analog function modeling by creating a system that can map these functional models onto a platform currently used for hardware emulation.  These emulation platforms either consist of field programmable logic arrays (FPGAs) or custom built emulation chips.\r\nWe will explore two approaches to analog functional mapping  directly mapping all analog blocks to FPGA logic, and building an analog model interpreter  and choose the most cost effective approach.  Since the direct mapped approach can maintain a fixed ratio between the rates of the clocks used for the analog and digital blocks, it might make sense to build simple oversampled analog models. Here the challenge is in mapping the required computation to the FPGA.  Most analog functions can be mapped to digital blocks, implemented with lookup tables (LUTs) and filter/DSP blocks.  In the interpreter approach, we will explore building an analog model evaluation engine that will emulate a model when its inputs change.  If the analog signals change more slowly than the main FPGA clock, we might have many cycles for each model evaluation, making this a more efficient approach.  In addition, it is possible that we can build many fewer model evaluation engines than analog functional models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe design of today's complex integrated circuits that power our computers, phones, and internet contain mostly digital circuits.  The industry has developed tools to test these designs before they are built to ensure that they function properly.  These test include simulating the function of these circuits on a fast computer cluster, or even mapping the design to many programmable logic chips, so they emulate the design.  While emulation is more difficult, it leads to higher performance functional models and is widely used in industry.\n\nUnfortunately most complex integrated circuits contain some analog circuits in additional their digital logic, and the current fast functional modeling techniques don't work for these analog block.  These analog circuits then make validation of the overall system more difficult.  Most designers have created ad-hoc ways to address this issue. Our research addresses this problem in two ways.  First we create a method to model the functionality of analog blocks that is completely compatible with current digital simulation environments. Second we have created a method to emulate analog as well as digital circuits.\n\nOur analog modeling framework is built using SystemVerilog, the most popular environment for digital system validation.  Since creating these analog functional models requires some training, to make them easier to use we have created functional model generators for a wide class of different analog circuits.  Now a user can give their parameters (desired performance specifications, exact interface pins, etc.) to the model generator, and it will return a high performance functional model of that block that will run in the digital simulation environment.\n\nTo further improve the speed of validation, we created a system that allows one to create analog functional models that can run on programmable logic emulation systems.  In this system we worked hard to make sure that the emulation of the analog circuits, which are usually a small part of the design, do not slow down the emulation of the larger digital circuits.  This constraint was hard to meet, and required us to build higher-level models of the analog blocks, to decrease the amount of computation each block required.\n\nUsing both techniques we have emulated a number of circuits ranging from the type of high-speed interface pins that are used in processor and networking designs to complex switching power supply regulators used to power today?s low-power systems.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark A Horowitz"
