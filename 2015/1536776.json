 "awd_abstract_narration": "The deepest portion of the ocean is present in ocean trenches, whose steep walls descend from approximately 4 miles down to depths that in some cases are close to 7 miles below the seawater surface.  At these locations Earth's crust is recycled.  Perhaps not surprisingly given their remoteness, deep ocean trenches are the least understood habitats in the ocean.  The researchers participating in this project are working to characterize the microbes present in two of the deepest trenches present on Earth, both in the Pacific Ocean, the Kermadec Trench located north of New Zealand, and the Mariana Trench, located east and south of the island of Guam.  Most of the Mariana Trench is located within the United States Mariana Trench Marine National Monument.  Relatively little is known about the diversity and adaptations of the microorganisms in deep ocean trenches.   An unknown fraction of the microbes present have descended from shallow waters above and are unlikely to participate in any nutrient cycles in the deep sea.  Others are adapted to near freezing temperatures and up to pressures greater than 10e7 kilograms per square meter (16,000 pounds per square inch).  These latter microbes perform important roles recycling organic matter.  But who are they?  This project is contributing to the training of diverse undergraduate and graduate students participating in research, additional undergraduate students learning about microbes inhabiting extreme environments in a web-based class, and additional graduate students and postdoctoral scientists participating in an advanced training course being offered in Antarctica.\r\n\r\nExperiments being performed include direct counts of prokaryotes and viruses in seawater and sediments, analyses of the abundance and phylogenetic breadth of culturable heterotrophic bacteria at a range of pressures, measurements of bacterial community species diversity and richness both within and across seawater and sediment samples, as well as within and across the two trench systems, measurements of microbial activity as a function of pressure and the identification of high pressure-active cells. The data generated from these analyses are being integrated into the results of additional chemical, geological and biological measurements performed by others as a part of the National Science Foundation funded Hadal Ecosystems Studies Project.   Two of the working hypotheses are that prokaryote numbers and diversity are generally positively correlated with surface productivity and proximity to the trench axis and that bacterial taxa exist which are endemic to specific trenches, present in multiple trenches and more widely distributed in deep-sea environments.",

In addition, the microbes were also examined in terms of their activity and growth characteristics.  The results indicated that deep-sea microbial populations consist of a mixture of taxa descending from shallow waters above and taxa adapted to life at great depth, including extremes of high pressure and low temperature.  Seawater depth, trench of collection, size fraction, sediment depth, and organic levels were all found to correlate with distinctive types of microorganisms (Figure 2).  Long-term incubation of trench sediments at the pressures and temperatures of their natural environment dramatically changed the composition of the microbial community to one containing a majority of previously documented and cultured high pressure-adapted microbes.  Seventy-nine draft genome sequences from trench microbes were obtained.  Analyses of these genomes indicated that many of the same species are shared between these two widely separated trenches, but that trench-specific strains also exist.  This work demonstrated that microbes in deep trenches can be shared across great geographic distances, presumably moving along ocean currents. \n\nBroader Impacts: A detailed description was provided of a free-falling and ascending instrument coupled with a pressure-retaining seawater sampling system.
