 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mass spectrometry instruments with ultrahigh mass resolution and extreme sensitivity are especially well suited for the analysis of complex environmental samples, such as found in the organic mixtures in atmospheric aerosols, and a range of natural waters and hydrometeors. The proposal seeks to acquire and commission an ultrahigh mass resolution Thermo Orbitrap Elite MS, with high mass resolution aiding in more accurate molecular weight determination, and interfaced with 2-D liquid chromatography to aid in separation in mixtures of like compounds. \r\n\r\nMolecular signatures and relative quantities of molecules in complex mixtures will be used initially to further our understanding of: (1) atmospheric aerosol processes (e.g., cloud cycling and aging) and properties (e.g., hygroscopicity and volatility); (2) carbon cycling responses to changes in biota and climate; and additional applications such as: (3) multiphase reaction chamber work; (4) fate of organic contaminants during water treatment\r\n\r\nAdvanced analytical instrumentation also significantly expands the research opportunities and training exercises for students, postdocs and the next generation of researchers/teachers.",
