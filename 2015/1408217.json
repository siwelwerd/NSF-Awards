 "awd_abstract_narration": "The main goal of this project is to understand how viruses assemble and transport their genetic material (genome) into cells.  When cells are infected by viruses, the cellular machinery is used to produce viral building blocks (proteins) that assemble with the genome into mature viruses that can be thought of as little machines ready to infect other cells.  For microviruses, which have genomes made up of single-stranded DNA, the machines contain energy and instructions to form a tubular DNA delivery device to transport DNA from the virus to a host cells.  The tube only forms when the virus is on the surface of the cell to be infected, and it falls apart once the DNA has been delivered.  Deciphering the mechanisms underlying construction and function of this kind of biologically-based tubular delivery device will have applications to the fields of nanotechnology and protein engineering.  The project will also have an educational impact by reaching students enrolled in a laboratory course taught by the principal investigator.  Part of the proposed research will be conducted in a virology laboratory course in which students will conduct hypothesis-driven research. The educational paradigm for this course has already been proven successful, yielding two class-generated publications with undergraduates as co-authors.\r\n\r\nThe production of infectious viruses requires a complex array of macromolecular interactions.  The tail-less, icosahedral bacterial virus, phiX174, transiently produces a tube by oligomerization of a DNA pilot protein H, through which DNA is delivered from the viral capsid to the host cell.  After DNA delivery, the tube disassembles. This proposal seeks to address several important questions about viral assembly and infection. A combination of genetic and structural approaches will explore the structure-function relationships in the H protein to understand how the chemical make-up of this pilot protein enables it to transport DNA from virus to host, what factors contribute to making the tube the right length, and what other proteins interact with H to promote proper function. Other experiments will explore how the H protein interacts with internal scaffolding proteins within the viral capsid to promote assembly of the mature virus, and these studies will be extended by reconstituting the early viral assembly steps in vitro.   Because other viruses are likely to operate the same way as phiX174, the results of this research should provide generalized insights on the protein-protein interactions and protein-DNA interactions important for assembly and infection by tail-less viruses.",

Firstly, they organize the genome into a very volumetrically constrained space, a process called packaging. This cannot be a haphazard process. Chaotic organization can prematurely terminate packaging or produce a virus with distorted outer surface, which is specifically poised to interact with molecules on the outside of cells called receptors. After receptor recognition, capsids must rearrange to deliver their genomes into host cells. In microviruses (Figure 1), the viruses used in these studies, a pore forms through which a specialized genome delivery tube descends and transverses the host cell membrane. &nbsp;With NSF support, we structurally characterized these rearrangements (Figure 2), which includes the removal of a protein complex from the capsid. An analogy can be made to removing the cap (the protein complex) from a soda bottle (the capsid). The cell?s surface receptor acts like a bottle opener. We further deciphered the molecular details of this process by examining how viruses could expand their host range: gain the ability to infect cells that they could previously not infect. Selecting for mutant viruses that can infect the new host gives insights into this first step of all viral infections: receptor recognition.&nbsp; In microviruses, these mutations changed the chemical composition between the removed protein complex and the underlying capsid (Figure 3).</p>\n<p>After the cap is removed, the genome must travel through the DNA delivery tube, which is chemically honed to interact with DNA (Figure 4). Thus, tube-DNA interactions would slow down DNA transport, which seems counter-intuitive. However, the infecting virus can be viewed as a compressed gas driven machine.&nbsp; The amide side chains may act like the air gauges that regulate compressed gas driven machines.&nbsp; In this analogy, volumetrically constrained genome is akin to the compressed gas (energy), and the capsid is the gas cylinder. The DNA deliver tube is the conduit through which the energy is released. If too much air pressure (energy) is released from a compressed gas driven machine, the energy can rupture the conduit or blow the gasket that connects the tubing to the cylinder. Our published results demonstrate that the tube-DNA interactions act like a regulatory gauge in a compressed gas driven machine. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>During an infection, the genome, which for microviruses is single-stranded DNA, must be packaged into the capsid. The proteins in the capsid must organize the genome for it to fit into a very volumetrically constrained space. This is not a haphazard process. Two different proteins participate in this process. One of them is the major capsid protein, which comprises the vast majority of the virus?s protein shell. The other one is the DNA binding protein, which guides the DNA between 60 distinct DNA binding sites (Figure 5). The results of our studies uncovered how this process may be regulated. We characterized the consequences associated with an altered DNA binding protein that could not support virus replication. When this altered protein attempts to organize the genome, the capsid becomes unstable and dissociates. To further elucidate this process, we selected for variants that could now organize genomes using the altered protein. The viable variants duplicated a small segment of DNA. This segment is the target site for a replication protein call protein A* (A star). We also demonstrated that elevating A* protein levels during an infection allowed the altered to organize the genome.&nbsp; The A* protein is smaller version of the larger major genome replicating protein called protein A. Although these truncated DNA replication proteins are common in single-stranded DNA viruses, their functions have remained mysterious. Biochemically the A* protein inhibits DNA replication and packaging. The results of our studies are consistent with a model in which the A* protein slows down packaging, ensuring adequate time for the DNA to be properly organized. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The research had a broader educational component. In addition to educating graduate and undergraduate students, some projects involved high school student-teacher teams. We designed hypothesis-driven experiments that could be conducted at their high schools. This was not a trivial endeavor as experiments had to be prepared in a kit-like format.
