 "awd_abstract_narration": "Genetic diversity is important to the health of forest ecosystems, but the factors that influence such diversity remain poorly understood. This research will address how genetic diversity is affected by trees' ability to grow and defend themselves against insect attack, and by competition from neighboring trees for resources.  Also, forest productivity will be explored in light of genetic diversity. The research will take place in experimental stands of aspen, where trees have been grown for several years at different densities and then subjected to an outbreak of leaf-eating caterpillars. This work will advance scientific knowledge of how best to manage forests to maximize production, while also minimizing insect damage. Results from this research will be particularly relevant to regions where aspen populations are in widespread decline. The project will train undergraduate and graduate students in biological science and promote mentoring of high school and college students from groups that are currently under-represented in science.\r\n\r\nThis research will explore how environmentally mediated growth-defense tradeoffs in a foundation plant species influence intraspecific (genotypic) variation and, in turn, how genotypic  variation shapes stand-level productivity and resistance to insect attack. Aspen exhibits striking genotypic variation in physiology, growth and chemical defense, and strong negative genotypic correlations between growth and defense. How such tradeoffs influence selection to shape the genetic architecture of plant populations is largely unknown. An array of experimental aspen stands, each containing 16 genotypes and subjected to low or high intraspecific competition intensity (CI), will be used to test hypotheses concerning: 1) phenotypic expression of leaf physiological and chemical traits under low vs. high CI, 2) shifts in the genotypic composition of aspen stands as a consequence of competition-mediated selection for growth vs. defense traits, and 3) effects of genotypic divergence on stand resistance to defoliation by forest tent caterpillars. Hypothesis testing will incorporate measures of aboveground growth, photosynthesis and foliar chemical defenses, as well as assessments of stand-level defoliation by tent caterpillars. This research will advance understanding of the ecological and evolutionary factors that influence the distribution, genetic composition, and function of forest ecosystems.",

Plant chemistry has been shown to play a role of unparalleled importance in mediating those interactions. More recently, the developing field of eco-evolutionary dynamics has demonstrated the importance of intraspecific (within-species) genetic variation in governing the structure and function of ecological communities and ecosystems.</p>\n<p>In this research program, we combined the approaches of plant-insect interactions, plant chemical ecology, and eco-evolutionary dynamics to address a question of fundamental importance to our understanding of ecological systems. That is, how do plant genotypic variation and environmental context interact to shape tradeoffs between plant performance (survival and growth) and allocation to defense against herbivores, and what are the implications of those tradeoffs for the genetic structure of forest stands?</p>\n<p>Our work focused on a model system of quaking aspen (<em>Populus tremuloides</em>) grown in replicated stands at low or high competition intensities. Each stand contained the same set of 16 aspen genotypes, which exhibit a large range of inherent growth rates and chemical defense expression. We predicted that under high intensity competition, fast-growing (and hence, poorly defended) genotypes would be selectively advantaged. To test our predictions, we conducted extensive surveys of growth and defense from 2016 to 2018. Each year we measured the height and diameter of all trees and recorded mortality rates. Annual leaf samples were collected for chemical analysis to quantify defense levels, and in 2017 and 2018 we measured herbivore damage levels on collected leaves.</p>\n<p>Our results revealed that aspen growth was negatively correlated with defense allocation in both environments. Moreover, as predicted, the low-growth/high-defense genotypes experienced significant mortality only in high-competition stands. Therefore, the interaction between genetically-determined growth-defense tradeoffs and environment (competition intensity) resulted in divergent genotypic compositions between the two types of forest stands. Because herbivore defense traits are largely genetically-determined in aspen, the divergence in genotypic composition was accompanied by a divergence in stand-level defense profiles: selection against low-growth/high-defense genotypes in high-competition stands resulted in lower overall expression of herbivore defense in those stands.</p>\n<p>Our results show that the interaction between genetically-determined growth&ndash;defense tradeoffs and environmental context can have evolutionary implications (a change in genetic structure) over short, ecological time spans. These changes, in turn, have implications for stand-level ecosystem properties, such as productivity, carbon sequestration, and pest resistance. Understanding the ecological and evolutionary factors governing genetic and functional composition of plant populations is especially important in widespread, foundation tree species such as aspen, which support biological diversity and ecosystem functioning across large parts of temperate and boreal North America.</p>\n<p>Two graduate students, five undergraduate REU students, and several other undergraduate research assistants and technicians were trained in ecological research over the course of the project. To date this work has resulted in five journal articles, a book chapter, a graduate thesis, and over a dozen presentations to scientific groups.

In addition to advancing understanding of evolutionary and community ecology, this research also facilitated improvements in chromatographic methods for analyzing plant chemistry.
