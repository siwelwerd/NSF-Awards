 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI John Shareshian studies problems in combinatorics that arise in or have  consequences for other fields of mathematics.  Combinatorics is the study of discrete, typically finite, mathematical structures.  Such structures arise often in mathematics and the natural and social sciences, leading to various applications.  For example, networks of various types are modeled by combinatorialists as graphs, which are simply collections of points, some pairs of which are considered to be related.  Despite the simplicity of such models, mathematicians have derived many deep and applicable theorems about them.  Perhaps surprisingly, there are close connections between combinatorics and other fields of mathematics in which non-discrete objects are studied, including topology and geometry.  The work of PI Shareshian involves the close study of such connections, with the aim of solving problems about both discrete and non-discrete structures.\r\n\r\nPI Shareshian studies connections between combinatorics and other fields of mathematics, including algebra, topology, and geometry.  In joint work with Michelle Wachs, he aims to prove that the graded Frobenius characteristic of a refined version of Stanley's chromatic symmetric function for a unit interval graph is in fact the cohomology of an associated regular semisimple Hessenberg variety, and to use such a result to attack a longstanding conjecture of Stanley and Stembridge about such symmetric functions.  Shareshian studies connections between the structure algebraic objects and the combinatorial structure of lattices naturally associated to such objects.  For example, he aims to provide a result on Lie algebras roughly analogous to his earlier result that a finite group is solvable if and only if the order complex of its subgroup lattice is shellable.\r\n\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPI John Shareshian attacked various combinatorial problems.  Combinatorics is the study of discrete, usually finite, mathematical structures.  Some such structures are closely related to non-discrete mathematical structures, such as geometric objects of arbitrarily high dimension.  The PI and collaborators use such relations to understand better both the discrete and non-discrete structures.\n\nWhile supported by the grant, the PI had papers published in research journals, completed papers that have been submitted for publication, and completed work on problems whose solutions will appear in papers that are being written now.  Among the PI's results are the following:\n\n- In a joint paper Michelle Wachs (University of Miami), a relation between the ways one can assign positive integers to the nodes in a network so that no two related nodes are assigned the same integer and the geometric structure of certain high-dimensional objects called Hessenberg varieties was posited.  This inspired work by other mathematicians, both combinatorialists and geometers.  Another joint paper with Wachs on closely related material was published.\n\n- In a joint paper with Russ Woodroofe (University of Primorska), a problem on prime divisors of binomial coefficients was studied.  Given two positive integers k and n, n being larger than k, the binomial coefficient nCk is the number of different sets one can form by choosing exactly k objects from a set of n objects.  We are interested in knowing if, for each n, there exist two prime numbers p and r so that for every k, nCk is divisible by at least one of p and r.  This problem is closely related to a problem in group theory, an area of abstract algebra.  In a paper with Woodroofe and Bob Guralnick (USC) that has been accepted for publication, it is shown that such p and r exist whenever n is at most one quadrillion. \n\n- In a point paper with Emmanuella Sandratra Rambeloson (then a student at the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences, now a student at Clemson University), a conjecture about assigning integers to nodes in networks as described above was disproved.\n\n - Two joint papers with Laura Escobar Vega and Martha Precup (both at Washington University) about the structure of the above-mentioned Hessenberg varieties were submitted for publication.\n\nWhile supported by the grant, the PI continued work on education through advising of graduate and undergraduate students.  Three students (Alexandru Papiu, Yifei Li, Tiansi Li) completed PhD theses while being advised by the PI.  Papiu works in industry, Yifei Li holds a tenure track job and Tiansi Li holds a postdoctoral position.  The PI currently co-advises PhD students Nathan Lesnevich and Jodi McWhirter, with Martha Precup and Laura Escobar Vega, respectively.  \n\nNine undergraduate students (Connor Basich, Philip Bonneville, Ethan Farber, Sam Heil, Timothy Huber, Riley Lundstorm, Renee Mirka, and Ryan Schneider) completed honors theses while being advised by the PI.  (Farber was coadvised by Matt Kerr.)  Five of these students entered PhD programs in Mathematics or Computer Science.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/28/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Shareshian"
