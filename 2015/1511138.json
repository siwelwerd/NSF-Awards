 "awd_abstract_narration": "1511138(Willis)\r\n\r\nPlasmonics is a general term that describes a broad array of research activity to study the interaction of light with noble metal nanostructures. Noble metals are metals that are resistant to corrosion and oxidation in moist air. Ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, silver, osmium, iridium, platinum, and gold are noble metals. The field of plasmonics is growing rapidly due an increasing number of studies on the applications of plasmonic materials. These applications are for their uses in photocatalysis, as biochemical sensors, as photodetectors, and for solar energy harvesting, including harvesting infrared (IR) wavelengths.\r\n\r\nThe central features of plasmonic materials are localized surface plasmon resonances that lead to strong absorption and scattering of electromagnetic radiation by small metal particles. An experimental research program to investigate tunable plasmonic nano structures is planned, with an emphasis on process schemes for electrical connectivity. The central features of plasmonic materials are localized surface plasmon resonances that lead to strong absorption and scattering of visible and near-IR radiation by small noble metal particles. The resonances are sensitive to the size and shape of nanostructures as well as the dielectric properties of the materials and surroundings, and can be tuned throughout the visible/near-IR region. The coupling of optical phenomena and charge transfer processes is one of the exciting new areas of the science of plasmonic materials. In this work, the PI plans to investigate atomic layer deposition of noble metals on Pd nanostructures to tune the optical and electrical properties of electrically conductive nanostructures coupled by nanogaps on the order of a few nanometers. Atomic layer deposition will be used to create electrically coupled plasmonic nanostructures that combine optical and electrical phenomena at the nanoscale. This research should enhance the ability to engineer useful structures at the nanoscale with critical dimensions on the order of 1 nm.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts encompass STEM educational and outreach activities, including building infrastructure for education through new senior laboratory experiments, starting a new graduate student mentoring program, supporting undergraduate research and participation by underrepresented student populations, and hosting high school students and teachers for summer learning activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this research program we investigated atomic layer deposition as a means to tune the electrical and optical properties of plasmonic nanostructures.  Plasmonic nanostructures are tiny metal structures that act like antennas to collect energy from light, similar to how TV or radio antennas collect signals from broadcast towers.  They have extraordinary properties with many exciting applications in biosensing, energy science, nanoelectronics, and nanophotonics.  Using modern nanofabrication tools, we can control their optical properties with nanometer precision to create plasmonic resonances in the visible and infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Atomic layer deposition is a process used to grow thin films on substrates like glass or silicon wafers.  It is a chemical process used extensively in the semiconductor industry as a key technology to make electronic devices for computers and phones.  Our research investigated atomic layer deposition as a new way to modify plasmonic nanostructures and tune their properties to make new types of nanoscale devices.  We successfully demonstrated that we could modify plasmonic nanostructures with sub-nanometer precision, and that this technology could be useful to make new types of electronic and photonic devices, including possible applications for new energy sources. \n\nThe project also had significant impacts on education and training both at the graduate and undergraduate levels. The work has supported the intellectual development of doctoral and masters degree candidates in Chemical Engineering at the University of Connecticut.  One student successfully defended her PhD dissertation and is now gainfully employed in the semiconductor industry.  Undergraduate students in chemical engineering at the University of Connecticut have also been involved in the research program through hands-on activities in the laboratory and coursework in engineering design and experimentation.  The undergraduate research activities include independent study for credit during the Fall/Spring academic semesters and full time work over the summers.  The work has supported approximately 10 undergraduate research opportunities, including four female students and three persons from Latino and African American heritages.  Six of these students have gone on to graduate school in Chemical Engineering as PhD candidates at universities such as Clemson, University of Delaware, MIT, and UConn.  One student won a Barry Goldwater Scholarship and another won an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship, both female.  Two students completed Undergraduate Honors Theses.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/06/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian G Willis"
