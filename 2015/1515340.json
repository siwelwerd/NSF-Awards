 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the third trimester of gestation, the human brain evolves from having a mostly smooth surface to the characteristic 'wrinkled' appearance of the adult brain.  How does this happen, and why does it sometimes go wrong?  The mechanics community has been interested in these questions for decades, attempting to model the brain as a thin, stiff, growing layer (gray matter) attached to a thicker, softer layer (white matter).  Recent mechanical tests, however, have revealed that gray matter is actually slightly less stiff than the underlying white matter, challenging many prior models and assumptions.  Through collaboration with Dr. Feng Xi-Qiao of Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, an expert in the wrinkling and buckling of soft films, this project will explore the behavior of thin growing layers on substrates of a similar stiffness.  This research will lead to a greater understanding of brain development in light of these recent findings.\r\n\r\nFor a stiff growing layer on a soft substrate, the formation of sinusoidal waves is expected, while the growth of a soft layer on a stiffer substrate will lead to creases with pinched valleys.  The transition between waves and creases happens gradually in the region of interest for brain tissue.  Using both analytical and numerical approaches, this research will explore the behavior of soft layered materials with stiffness ratios close to unity.  Numerical simulations will be performed in the finite element software Abaqus, using the built-in linear perturbation analysis as well as user-defined material models that simulate volumetric growth. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe study of layered materials under compression has been of interest in the mechanics community for decades.  Recently, a new area of application is the development of the brain's characteristic folds, thought to be a result of mechanical forces.  This new problem differs from previous engineering applications, however, in that the ratio between the stiffnesses of the two materials is close to unity, instead of on the order of thousands or tens of thousands.  This regime of stiffness ratios is not understood fully, so the goal of this EAPSI award was to explore the instability behavior of soft bilayered materials with applications in the developing brain.\n\nThe research was undertaken at the Institute for Biomechanics and Medical Engineering at Tsinghua University in Beijing, under the auspices of the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutues.  With host professors Xi-Qiao Feng and Bo Li as well as my advisor Ellen Kuhl, I studied previous models of layered and homogeneous materials under compression.  Ultimately, I derived a set of governing equations for a bilayered material general enough to predict the instability of the system given any stiffness ratio and any combination of compression and growth loading in either material. \n\nThe duration of the EAPSI award was not sufficient to complete the project, but work has continued since my return to Stanford.  It is in preparation for submission to a journal and will be presented in July 2016 at the joint session of the 12th World Congress on Computational Mechanics and the 6th Asia-Pacific Congress on Computational Mechanics.  In addition, other collaborations are expected between the research groups at Tsinghua and Stanford.\n\nIn addition to the project described above, working in a research group internationally was a valuable opportunity for personal and professional development.  Through weekly lab meetings and several seminars, I was able to practice technical communication in both English and Mandarin Chinese.  Other opportunities also presented themselves for talking about research, from interested Chinese people without science backgrounds to the Honorable Max Baucus, U.S. Ambassador to China.  Conversations with local and visiting researchers, including international visitors, offered exposure to the international mechanics community, along with new research ideas and techniques.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/09/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Maria Holland"
