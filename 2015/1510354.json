 "awd_abstract_narration": "Turbulence in the free atmosphere plays a very important role in energy dissipation and the diffusive transport of heat, momentum, and constituents. Understanding the nature and influences of turbulence is among the most challenging topics in fluid dynamics, atmospheric and ocean sciences.  The research will increase understanding of the life cycle of atmospheric turbulence from initiation to decay.  It will also put the derivation of atmospheric turbulence quantities on a firmer basis than it is at present. The new study will be done, such as cataloging the climatology of unstable atmospheric layers that have not been done before.\r\n\r\nA better understanding of the occurrence and influences of atmospheric turbulence will contribute to many aspects of atmospheric science and applications.  These range from improving understanding of the role of turbulent transport of atmospheric constituents, for example, to better forecast clear-air turbulence for aviation.  A strong Ph.D student will gain expertise in state-of-the-art direct numerical simulation (DNS), radiosonde analysis, and the synergism of merging these efforts.  The radiosonde analysis techniques and results will be made publicly available, hopefully stimulating additional investigations by other scientists.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOutcomes Report\n\n \n\n            Atmospheric turbulence is important in transporting chemical constituents as well in considerations of aircraft operations.  With the relatively recent availability of high vertical-resolution radiosonde soundings, a methodology for determining atmospheric turbulence parameters has been suggested that can be used at all of the radiosonde stations that make those data available.  This methodology is based on a procedure initially suggested by Thorpe for use in oceanography.  Such methods cannot be used to determine turbulence parameters for individual unstable layers in either the ocean or atmosphere since both the turbulence initiation mechanism and the stage of turbulence development are unknown.  We have published a paper\n\nWang, L., M. A. Geller, and D. C. Fritts, 2019:  Direct numerical simulation guidance for Thorpe analysis to obtain quantitatively reliable turbulence parameters.
