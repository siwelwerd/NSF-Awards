 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Christopher C. Scarborough of Emory University is developing novel catalysts for oxidation reactions. The catalytic transformation generates commodity chemicals at significantly diminished environmental and economic cost compared to current industrial routes. The catalysts are novel cluster catalysts derived from earth abundant elements and are designed to use oxygen from ambient air to drive the oxidation reactions. Detailed studies correlating structure, reactivity, and catalytic performance are ongoing with the long-term goal of generating optimal catalysts for replacing energy-intensive industrial processes, in particular the Hock Process that is currently employed in the annual production of seven billion kilograms of phenol.\r\n \r\nThis project seeks to develop novel inorganic catalysts, built around Ca and Cu centers with the potential to achieve arene oxidation, initially with hydrogen peroxide, and eventually, if successful, with molecular oxygen. This approach to phenol oxidation represents a fundamentally new direction, and as such, the Division sees this as an important direction to explore from the point of view of developing sustainable chemistry, in general, and new catalytic processses with earth abundant metals, in particular.  Professor Scarborough's outreach efforts are designed to improve inclusion of underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines and to inspire high-achieving students to pursue advanced studies in chemistry. He has established a collaborative symposium for inorganic chemists in the greater Atlanta area that brings together faculty, postdoctoral scholars, and students from colleges and universities across the region, with participation from primarily undergraduate institutions (including those serving under-represented groups in STEM fields) and major research institutions. Professor Scarborough is working to inspire young people to pursue advanced studies in STEM disciplines through a mentorship program that trains gifted high school students through laboratory internships as well as through participation in a team that is revising the undergraduate chemical curriculum.",

The work is aimed at developing catalysts that incorporate earth abundant transition metals to carry out these transformations. This research has led to several important scientific outcomes. First, we have demonstrated that we can prepare, isolate, and characterize transition metal hydrogen peroxide complexes of first-row metal ions. Specifically, have prepared and fully characterized cobalt and zinc complexes with terminal hydrogen peroxide ligands despite previous research that suggested hydrogen peroxide itself was a poor ligand.  These recently discovered complexes are important because metal-peroxide species have been invoked as key intermediates in a number of important chemical transformations. Hydrogen bonding has been shown to play a key role in the stabilization of hydrogen peroxide complexes.  Specifically, strong hydrogen bonding interactions between the coordinated hydrogen peroxide ligand and the sulfonamido ligands are key to isolation.\n\n \n\nIn related studies, we have also explored the role of group II metal ions in the stabilization of novel cobalt complexes.  We have found that group II metal ions such as calcium can form strong interactions with our metal complexes and lead to increased solution-state stability of multinuclear cobalt complexes.  We also have shown that group II metal ions can influence the oxidation potential of the isolated cobalt complexes and can be used to attenuate or tune the reactivity of these complexes in different catalytic transformations.  Finally, the newly prepared complexes have been explored as potential oxidation catalysts for common aromatic compounds. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/20/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cora E Macbeth"
