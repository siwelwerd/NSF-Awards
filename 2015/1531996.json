 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF) as well as the MPS Office of Multidisciplinary Activities (OMA), Professor Markus Raschke from the University of Colorado Boulder and colleagues Steven Cundiff, Prashant Nagpal, Thomas Perkins, and Sean Shaheen are developing an infrared scanning near-field optical microscope (IR s-SNOM) for broadband nano-imaging and spectroscopy. The instrument provides vibrational and chemical infrared imaging data with nanometer spatial resolution, high spectral resolution and single molecule sensitivity.  This instrument is to enable the study of molecular self-organization and nanoscale phase separation in polymer blends, block-copolymers, liquid crystals, and biomembranes; energy and charge transfer in photosynthesis; and organic and inorganic photovoltaics.  The award not only allows  for the development of a new instrument but also provides training to early career scientists in instrumentation development.\r\n\r\nThe instrument development effort is being applied to projects such as:  (a) studying coupling and transport in organic photovoltaics and electrochemical transistors,  (b) achieving label-free access of structure and function of membrane proteins, (c) investigating inter-sub-band transitions in nano-bio-hybrid materials for solar fuel generation, and (d) probing intermolecular coupling and dynamics through local probe vibrational solvatochromism.  The technical innovation in IR s-SNOM may lead to new discoveries in soft-matter and quantum materials of utility to imaging technologies.",
