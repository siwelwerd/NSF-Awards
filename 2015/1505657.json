 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: Materials which are stable to very high temperatures are needed for applications in aerospace, energy, and other technologies. Many such materials contain rare earth oxides, critical materials in potential short supply.  Novel experimental and computational methods are studying the structure and stability of such rare earth oxides. The methodology includes diffraction (determination of crystal structure) and calorimetry (measurement of heat effects associated with melting and other reactions) on laser heated samples levitated in a gas stream and not contaminated by contact with other materials, as well as theoretical calculations. Such studies offer a unique opportunity to obtain fundamental understanding of structures, phase transitions, and melting properties and applications to technological problems. The project will also advance general experimental and computational techniques for high temperature research. It will offer opportunities for both undergraduates and graduate students in materials science, chemistry, physics, and engineering to take part in state-of-the-art research in both university and national laboratory settings. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: Rare earth oxides are critical materials essential to many important technologies yet their high temperature properties, needed for such applications, are poorly known. Their structure and thermodynamics above 2000\u00b0C are being studied using a combination of novel experimental and computational methods. Aerodynamic levitation and laser heating are being used for in situ X-ray diffraction at the Advanced Photon Source, in situ neutron diffraction at the Spallation Neutron Source and for drop calorimetry at the UC Davis Peter A. Rock Thermochemistry Laboratory. Enthalpies of solid state phase transitions and fusion are being measured by calorimetry, and volume changes on phase transitions and thermal expansion of high temperature phases are being determined by diffraction. High temperature thermal analysis complements drop calorimetry. Fusion enthalpies are required for reliable calculations of eutectics of multi-component systems containing rare earths. Ab initio computations of high temperature heat capacities, thermal expansion, and temperatures and enthalpies of phase transitions and fusion are being performed at Brown University using post-density functional theory (DFT) methods, such as hybrid functionals and DFT+U, in conjunction with statistical mechanics techniques such as cluster expansion, lattice dynamics analysis and molecular dynamics. Computed thermal expansion and enthalpies of phase transitions and fusion are being compared to experimental measurements and calculations are being extended to high temperature properties of rare earth oxides not yet accessible experimentally.",

The key tasks for this project were to develop and advance new experimental and computational approaches and to obtain much-needed data on high-temperature refractory materials. The experimental approaches include ultra-high temperature Drop-and-Catch (DnC) calorimetry (see Figure 1) and synchrotron X-ray diffraction on solid laser heated aerodynamically levitated samples. The new computational approaches include statistical mechanical methods to efficiently obtain high temperature thermodynamic properties, such as melting points or absolute free energies in the presence of large deviations from harmonic behavior and significant electronic contributions in correlated electron systems, as well as their implementation as automated software tools. The feasibility of drop calorimetry on laser heated samples and first principles calculations for fusion enthalpies of oxides was validated with measurements and computation of Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> fusion enthalpy (melting point 2054 &deg;C). Fusion enthalpy of Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, Lu<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, and Yb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was measured and found to agree with computations. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction data were collected up to the melting points for rare earth sesquioxides.

Both oxides retain cubic bixbyite-type structures up to melting with no indications of superionic Bredig transition observed in related fluorite-type structures.
