 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the US CLIVAR Project Office (USCPO) for the next five years. US CLIVAR (ClImate VARiability and predictability) is a long-term research program which seeks to\r\n\r\n* Understand the role of the oceans in observed climate variability on different timescales. \r\n\r\n* Understand the processes that contribute to climate variability and change in the past, present, and future. \r\n\r\n* Better quantify uncertainty in the observations, simulations, predictions, and projections of climate variability and change. \r\n\r\n* Improve the development and evaluation of climate simulations and predictions. \r\n\r\n* Collaborate with research and operational communities that develop and use climate information. \r\n\r\nFunds from this award cover USCPO staffing, travel by US scientists to participate in US CLIVAR meetings, costs associated with open science workshops,  and outreach and communication efforts necessary to communicate US CLIVAR findings and opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this proposal enables development of new community-driven scientific plans, coordination of research activity implementation, and provides assistance to US research programs so they can more effectively engage with the research community and address shared research goals.\r\n\r\nUS CLIVAR has broader impacts through its work in organizing the research community to pursue topics which are of societal relevance as well as scientific interest.  US CLIVAR research is motivated by a desire to anticipate forms of climate variability and change that have important human consequences.  In addition, US CLIVAR activities include efforts to work with stakeholders, decision makers, and long-range operational forecasters to ensure that research results of interest to these communities are effectively communicated.",
