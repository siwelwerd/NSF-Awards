 "awd_abstract_narration": "Preferences are orders among a collection of items attributed to a population of judges. Preference data comes in a variety of forms, such as ranked lists and pairwise comparisons, and is ubiquitous in a plethora of applications across different domains.  Over the past decade, there has been a sharp increase in the volume of preference data, in the diversity of applications that use it, and in the richness of preference data analysis methods. Examples of applications include rank aggregation in genomic data analysis, management of votes in elections, and recommendation systems in e-commerce.  The goal of this project is to streamline the management and analysis of preference data.  Towards this goal the PI and her team will develop a framework called DB4Pref, providing support to computational and data scientists who work with preference data. Models, algorithms, data and software products developed as part of this project will be made publicly available. The work will have an impact on the scientific community, in particular on the analysis of functional genomics data, which is central to many areas of bioinformatics, and on social applications, where it will enable efficient and effective analysis of user preferences.  The PI will involve graduate and undergraduate students in her research, and will continue to work with women and under-represented minorities. Both the process and the outcome of this research will be integrated into data management and data science courses taught by the PI.\r\n\r\nThe work will adopt the relational database model, and will enrich it with extensions that are specialized for handling preference data. Specifically, the PI and her team will introduce a special type of a relation that is designed for preference data, and will propose composable operators on preference relations that can be embedded in SQL statements, for convenient reuse across applications.  Scalable implementations of preference relations will be developed, along with analytics such as preference clustering and rank aggregation. Treating preferences, and preference analytics, as first-class citizen in a relational database, and making these available through (augmented) SQL queries, will brings two important advantages. The first is usability: since SQL queries are specified declaratively, users need not worry about data formats and implementation details of data manipulation methods.  The second advantage is efficiency: the system is free to choose an appropriate query execution plan, and an efficient implementation of a specific analysis method, exploiting a trade-off between processing time and answer quality. To evaluate results of this work, and to invite contributions to this area by other members of the community, the PI and her team will develop a set of performance benchmarks based on real and synthetic datasets.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the project website at https://www.cs.drexel.edu/dbgroup/db4pref",

Preference data comes in a variety of forms, such as ranked lists and pairwise comparisons, and is ubiquitous in a plethora of applications across different domains. Over the past decade, there has been a sharp increase in the volume of preference data, in the diversity of applications that use it, and in the richness of preference data analysis methods. Examples of applications include rank aggregation in genomic data analysis, management of votes in elections, and recommendation systems in e-commerce. The overall goal of this project was to develop scalable methods for preference analysis, placing these in the context of a general-purpose database system.\nThis project resulted in several important outcomes, leading to twelve publications at top data management and AI venues.  As part of this work, the PI and her team developed a formalism for incorporating preferences into databases in the form of special-purpose preference relations, characterized the complexity of evaluation of queries that involve preference relations, and developed efficient methods to evaluate these queries.  They also collected and made publicly available several interesting datasets, enabling others to work on problems in this important domain.\nIn addition to advancing the state of the art in data management and AI, this award supported the PI in launching an independent research career.  As an important outcome of this project, the PI established a close collaborative relationship with colleagues at academic institutions, both nationally and internationally.  This award enabled the PI to advise or co-advise four PhD students, one Masters student, and four undergraduate students; and to mentor or co-mentor two postdoctoral researchers.  About half of all students and postdoctoral researchers mentored by the PI are female.\nFinally, the work on preference data management seeded and inspired two ongoing collaborative projects, both receiving subsequent funding from the NSF and from the US-Israel Binational Science Foundation (BSF).  One of these, DBCOMSOC, proposes a novel framework that creates bridges between the computational social choice and the database management communities. This framework enriches the tasks currently supported in computational social choice with relational database context, thus making it possible to formulate sophisticated queries about voting rules, candidates, voters, issues, and positions.    \nThe second project,  Data, Responsibly, establishes a foundational new role for data management technology, in which managing the responsible use of data across the lifecycle becomes a core system requirement.
