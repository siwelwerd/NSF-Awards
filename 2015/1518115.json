 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exciting project will lead to the first ever experimental demonstration of an effect long studied theoretically and numerically, which is crucial for understanding astrophysical systems powered by material flowing through a complex flattened structure and onto a central compact object.  Accretion through a swirling disk concerns many astronomical phenomena on scales from distant quasars to nearby star systems.  This novel and innovative experiment will also provide many educational opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis project will be the first ever study of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in a plasma experiment.  Although the MRI is a major component of current explanations of accretion, studies have so far been theoretical, numerical, and with a limited set of liquid metal experiments.  This study will use the Plasma Couette Experiment (PCX), which uses a new way both to confine and to stir hot, fast-flowing plasmas under the right conditions to observe the MRI, which explains how matter in an accretion disk transports angular momentum outward, and thus falls into the central object.  A weak magnetic field from somewhere outside the disk leads to a quickly growing magnetic instability that itself leads to turbulence, which enhances the effective viscosity.  Numerical simulations have shown an effect of exactly the required sort, and recent experiments with liquid metals have studied the onset conditions.  However, plasma experiments have several key advantages over liquid metals: (1) plasmas are the state of matter that makes up most naturally occurring accretion disks; (2) plasmas can be configured with more appropriate fluid parameters; and (3) plasma viscosity can be varied independently of the conductivity, mimicking conditions both in the outer regions of most disks, and in the regime near the center.  The PCX is now being upgraded to stronger confining magnets, higher input power, and larger plasma volume.  These improvements should more effectively show the onset of the MRI, and even multi-mode MRI turbulence.  This award will support (1) a search for signs of the instability and its comparison with numerical simulations; (2) measurement of the effective momentum transport to compare with theoretical predictions; and (3) identification of physics effects which are plasma specific and beyond the standard model.\r\n\r\nAmong the outreach activities, a basic plasma experiment will be added to the undergraduate physics capstone lab class.  The popular \"Exotic Plasmas of the Universe\" trading cards will be updated, and plasma astrophysics themes will be part of the university's \"Wonders of Physics\" show.",

We developed a plasma stirring technique that mimics flows seen in accretion disks, where matter swirls around an object, eventually falling onto it. Plasma flows in space are driven by the gravitational pull exerted by a massive object.

While we did not reach the conditions for turbulence, we have worked to expand understanding of certain plasma effects associated with flow.

Ions carry most of the plasma flow momentum and undergo charge-exchange collisions with neutral particles. In these collisions, a fast ion comes close enough to 'steal' an electron of a slow neutral particle, become neutral and fly out of the plasma, leaving behind a slow ion. This process causes the momentum carried in the ions to be reduced by a factor related to the percent of neutrals present in the plasma.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>When driving flow from the edge of the plasma, we rely on ion viscosity to couple momentum from the drive location inward to the rest of the plasma volume. We have shown that this momentum coupling directly competes with the momentum loss caused by neutral charge-exchange collisions. This competition can be characterized by a momentum diffusion length, which sets the distance over which flow can be driven from an edge location. In order to increase this momentum diffusion length, we upgraded the confinement system for our plasmas. This confinement upgrade decreased the percentage of neutral particles in our plasmas, reducing the effect of neutral charge-exchange collisions. However, it also caused the density of ions to increase, which lowers the viscosity of the plasma and also shortens the momentum diffusion length.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Ion viscosity is set by the ion density and temperature.

To understand the viscosity better, it was necessary to develop a diagnostic capable of measuring ion temperatures in the sub-1 eV range with high precision. Working with collaborators in Lyon, France, we developed a Fabry-Perot spectrometer and benchmarked it against more conventional diagnostics that are not useable in our plasmas. The Fabry-Perot spectrometer collects light from the plasma, sends it through an interference cavity known as an etalon and creates a concentric ring pattern that contains information of the ion velocity distribution function. The width of this distribution function is caused by the random motion of the ions, which by definition is their temperature. Using this diagnostic, we have successfully measured the ion temperature of our plasmas and, by extension, the viscosity to high precision.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We developed a stirring technique that does not depend on momentum coupling from edge locations. Rather, this technique, volumetric flow drive, drives a current through the entire plasma with a weak background magnetic field. Current crossing a magnetic field imparts a Lorentz force across the entire plasma volume, avoiding the need to couple momentum from an edge. In performing volumetric flow drive, we observed large-scale qualitative Hall effects, wherein the ions are decoupled from the magnetic field. In these cases, electrons flowing across the plasma (carrying the current) cause massive compression or expulsion of the initial weak magnetic field. In one experiment, we observed amplification greater than ten times the initial field strength. The Hall effect occurs in plasmas with a sufficiently low density and is certainly an important phenomenon in many accretion disks, especially protoplanetary disks where large neutral populations lower the ionization of dust particles in the disk.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Throughout the duration of this award, we have certainly deviated from the original goal of driving accretion disk turbulence. Instead, we have uncovered a rich area of research focused on flowing astrophysical plasmas and the effects not previously observed in liquid metal experiments. Additionally, we have developed tools and techniques to probe these plasmas with extremely high precision, opening the range of possibility for further exploration. Finally, our novel approach to plasma flow has been successful at driving plasmas in flow configurations similar to astrophysical phenomena, bringing accretion disks to a terrestrial setting where they can be explored in great detail.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/04/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Cary&nbsp;B&nbsp;Forest</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1518115/1518115_10391002_1575491185671_EdgeStirring--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1518115/1518115_10391002_1575491185671_EdgeStirring--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Electromagnetic Stirring Technique\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1518115/1518115_10391002_1575491185671_EdgeStirring--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Electromagnetic Stirring Technique\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Diagram of the plasma stirring technique we developed.
