 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will create a science and engineering technology enhanced learning pathway from school to home that focuses on home energy efficiency. Students will have multiple opportunities to use what they learn about science and engineering in school to solve authentic real-world energy efficiency problems at home that could potentially lead to cleantech careers. A deeper understanding of science and engineering practices and learning how to apply what is learned in new settings contribute to energy efficiency, sustain power to millions of people, and help clean up the planet. Eight curriculum units will be jointly developed by school educators and industry partners to integrate science and engineering activities into existing school standards, instruction, and assessments. To help teachers prepare to implement these units, professional development will be designed to prepare teachers to actively guide students in the use of infrared cameras, sensors, simulations, and mixed-reality technologies. These technologies will help students visualize, investigate, and design invisible heat and mass flows in real and virtual worlds in real time as they make decisions about ways to conserve energy. \r\n\r\nThis strategies project will advance efforts to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics through the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers program. More than 60 teachers and 2000 students from 10 socioeconomically diverse middle and high schools in Massachusetts will participate in the project.  A mixed-methods research design will capture data about teacher adoption and use, showcase student learning and application, and highlight industry roles and responsibilities in the school to home learning pathway model. These data will measure the effectiveness of the model for improving learning outcomes about home energy efficiency as well as promote student interest and motivation in cleantech careers. This project will serve as a technology-enhanced model of an education and industry collaboration transferable to other communities and states.",

The learning process from school to home is supported by a cleantech-focused curriculum in the fields of energy efficiency and renewable energy, informed by industry through an Advisory Board and external collaborations. Students are equipped with industry-grade technologies (e.g., thermal cameras and computer-aided design software) to perform meaningful activities that aim to increase their self-efficacy and awareness of cognate careers. Project activities and culminating reports were designed to initiate conversation between students and their families about their home energy issues. Students were given the tools to make professional assessments that also serve as means to effectively communicate their findings to stakeholders. This project gives students an opportunity to make substantive recommendations to their families and communities regarding relevant energy topics and demonstrates the true value and purpose of science and engineering in everyday life. By replicating realistic tasks performed by building science professionals and solar energy engineers, students can help discover and design applicable energy solutions to reduce their energy consumption and carbon footprints.</p>\n<p>This applied learning model also gives teachers real-world projects to fulfill \"three-dimensional learning\" requirements in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Specifically, students will learn and apply science and engineering concepts and skills required by NGSS ESS1 (Earth science related to seasons), PS3 (physical science related to energy and heat), and ETS1 (engineering, technology, and applications of science), using energy science and engineering as a driving force. Professional development and teaching assistance were provided to approximately 150 teachers through workshops, onsite training, and webinars to facilitate adoption of the curriculum modules in the classroom. Over the four years, the project has directly reached about 2,800 students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds in 36 middle and high schools across the country. More than 10,000 students per year now use various products developed by the project.</p>\n<p>This project has also conducted cutting-edge educational research to understand student learning in the context of ITEST. Five journal papers based on the project's research have been published to inform researchers and educators. For example, self-regulated learning may play an important role in self-efficacy in relation to career awareness. To shed light on learning from this perspective, the project analyzed the engineering design behaviors of 108 ninth-grade students using principal component analysis and cluster analysis. The students were classified into four distinct types: competent, cognitive-oriented, reflective-oriented, and minimally self-regulated learners. Competent self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the most self-regulated learners and had the greatest learning gains, although they did not perform the best in the task. Cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners perceived themselves as the least self-regulated learners although they were the second best in both the performance of the task and learning gains. In contrast, reflective learners had the best performance in the task. Minimally self-regulated learners did not perform well in the task and had the lowest learning gains. The results revealed that the competent self-regulated learners had an appropriate assessment of themselves to obtain knowledge, cognitive-oriented self-regulated learners underestimated themselves, reflective learners focused on the results of the task, and minimally self-regulated learners overestimated themselves and exerted the least effort. These results offer new insights into STEM education and self-regulated learning using data mining methods.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/28/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Charles&nbsp;Xie</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1512868/1512868_10379898_1572290710200_Untitled-2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1512868/1512868_10379898_1572290710200_Untitled-2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"An thermal image of buildings\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1512868/1512868_10379898_1572290710200_Untitled-2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"An thermal image of buildings\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An thermal image of buildings in Boston, MA</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Charles Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Charles&nbsp;Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">An thermal image of buildings</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1512868/1512868_10379898_1572290580779_Untitled-2(2)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1512868/1512868_10379898_1572290580779_Untitled-2(2)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Solarize Your School\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1512868/1512868_10379898_1572290580779_Untitled-2(2)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Solarize Your School\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Solarize Your School: An engineering design challenge in the real world</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Charles Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Charles&nbsp;Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Solarize Your School</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1512868/1512868_10379898_1572290524973_Untitled-1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1512868/1512868_10379898_1572290524973_Untitled-1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Optimize it!\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1512868/1512868_10379898_1572290524973_Untitled-1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Optimize it!\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Find an optimal position and orientation for a solar panel around a house</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Charles Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Charles&nbsp;Xie</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Optimize it!</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
