 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this program is to commission a polarization-sensitive radio receiver and build a digital backend for the CO Mapping Array Pathfinder (COMAP) experiment, as well as observe for two years using this equipment on a 10m-diameter radio telescope. The COMAP program is part of a much larger effort by the astronomical community to understand the origin and evolution of the universe and the formation of stars and galaxies. Broader impacts of the work include mentoring of undergraduates and research training of graduate students in instrumentation development. The COMAP team will communicate their results via public lectures, web pages, and activities at the telescope. Students and early-career researchers will be trained in a variety of cutting edge techniques in radio frequency design, technology development and analysis of large data sets. Personnel funded by this proposal will participate in an education and outreach program at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, bringing the excitement of scientific research to a diverse community that includes a Native American population. \r\n\r\nCOMAP aims to measure emission from both the CO J=1-0 transition at redshifts 2.4 < z < 2.8 and the J=2-1 transition at 5.8 < z < 6.7, probing the 3D power spectrum of CO, which acts as a tracer for star formation.",

The collaboration includes researchers from Caltech, JPL, Stanford, University of Maryland, University of Miami (UM), University of Manchester, University of Oslo, and ETH, Zurich.</p>\n<p>The COMAP instrument uses a 19 element spectrometer array that will map 10 square degrees of sky in the frequency range of 26-34 GHz with a spectral resolution of ~800.&nbsp; This array is housed in a cryostat that cools the low noise amplifier modules to ~20 K.&nbsp; The cryostat is mounted under a weather shroud in the focal plane of a 10.4 meter telescope located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (see Figure 1).&nbsp; This frequency range will be sensitive to carbon monoxide's (CO) J=1-0 transition at 116 GHz (in the local frame) that gets redshifted by a factor of 2.4-3.4 to 26-34 GHz.&nbsp; This band will also be sensitive to the CO J=2-1 transition in the redshift slice of z=5.8-7.8.&nbsp; A digital backend will process 8 GHz from each of the 19 elements.&nbsp; The goal of the pathfinder experiment is to demonstrate the feasibility and future potential of wide-field CO intensity mapping and provide a test-bed for the technology development and observation strategies.&nbsp; This first phase of COMAP will focus on constraining the CO power spectrum from the Epoch of Galaxy Assembly at redshift of 2.4-3.4.</p>\n<p>The University of Miami's primary contribution to COMAP has been the design and fabrication of the COMAP cryostat that is used to house the spectrometer array, and in particular, to cool the 19 low noise amplifiers to ~20K in order to minimize their noise.&nbsp; The main challenge of the design was to assemble all the electrical, mechanical, thermal, vacuum, and radio frequency (RF) interfaces, and make sure all associated requirements are met.&nbsp; Figures 2 and 3 show external and internal views of the cryostat as taken from the 3D model.&nbsp;

We expect to obtain ~6 months of observing before the end of the year.&nbsp; In the meantime, a number of papers have been submitted regarding analysis techniques that will be applied to COMAP data.&nbsp; These include Chung et al., \"Cross-correlating Carbon Monoxide Line-intensity Maps with Spectroscopic and Photometric Galaxy Surveys\", &nbsp;(arXiv:1809.04550) and Ihle et al., \"Joint power spectrum and voxel intensity distribution forecast on the CO luminosity function with COMAP\", (arXiv:1808.07487).&nbsp; COMAP is one of only a few instruments that are using a new technique (intensity mapping) to understand the high redshift Universe.&nbsp; The project makes use of several novel techniques (such as a large focal plane array of spectrometers) that may impact other areas of radio astronomy while leveraging an existing 10.4 meter antenna (from CARMA) to minimize costs.&nbsp;
