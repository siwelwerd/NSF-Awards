 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research into the mathematics of deformation and flow of materials is motivated by applications to subsurface flows of fluids such as groundwater, oil and gas, avalanche dynamics, including the processing of granular materials in tumblers and chutes, the motion of microscopic fluid droplets, and the role of shock waves in the propagation of signals, for example in optical fibers. The mathematics linking these applications concerns the modeling of continuous processes with nonlinear equations, and the study of wave-like solutions of the equations. Recent experiments and new models have opened up opportunities for fresh insights into these complex systems. The research project will include graduate student training in mathematics and physics, with an emphasis on clear presentation of results at scientific conferences. \r\n\r\nThis research project on nonlinear models of continuum mechanics focuses on four areas where recent developments provide opportunities for progress. The investigation of dispersive and dissipative shock waves will take place in the context of  models of magnetization and porous media flow. New models of  two phase flow possess singular  nonlinearities that stimulate innovations in analysis and numerical simulation. The  study  of  contact lines of droplets on soft elastic substrates involves the formulation of models for asymmetric drops that can be solved by the method of transforms and dual integral equations. A conjectured mechanism for the motion and control of  microscopic droplets is to induce spatial variations in the elastic modulus of the substrate, thereby providing a driving force on the droplet.  Granular flow models, specifically with poly-disperse grain sizes, will be analyzed using the theory of nonlinear partial differential equations. The equations will incorporate recent descriptions of stress distribution in granular materials, coupled to an established dynamic mechanism that quantifies how grains of different sizes accumulate in distinct layers.",
