 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Dr. Andrew C. Kraemer is \"The loss of ecological, morphological, and phylogenetic heritage: extinction in Pacific land snail radiations.\" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of Idaho, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Christine Parent.\r\n  \r\nHuman activity and natural events alter ecosystems around the world, leading to the decline and extinction of many species. The fellowship research addresses two critical questions: 1) how much ecological or morphological diversity is lost during modern extinctions, and 2) is it possible to predict a species' likelihood of extinction from its ecology or morphology? The land snails of Galapagos (Naesiotus) and Hawaii (Achatinellinae) are major lineages (each with 80-100 species). Unfortunately, both groups have recently suffered major declines with the loss of between 20 and 75% of the known species diversity. The ecology and morphology of Naesiotus and Achatinelline species, both living and extinct, are being quantified from specimens housed in the collections of three U.S. museums (the California Academy of Sciences, CAS; National Museum of Natural History, NMNH; and Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum, BPBM). Pairing these datasets with newly expanded molecular phylogenies promises a more nuanced characterization of the link between environment, phenotype (shell size, shape, color, and color patterning), and extinction within a comparative analytical framework. The best way to avoid future extinctions and protect our natural resources and biological heritage is to understand how human activity leads to extinction and loss of diversity.\r\n\r\nTraining goals for the Fellow include developing domestic and foreign collaborations and gaining expertise in conservation biology and phylogenetic comparative analyses.  Public outreach includes partnering with major museums to illustrate the diversity lost through modern extinctions and broadly disseminating information through the Galapagos National Park and the non-profit group Island Conservation (www.islandconservation.org) as well as an online guide to Pacific land snails available to teachers for evolutionary ecology and conservation classes. Finally, by characterizing the decline of two charismatic faunas and the processes likely responsible for those declines, future conservation efforts can be directed in regions rich in biological heritage, i.e., the Galapagos archipelago and Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.",

In particular, the possibility of predicting extinction likelihood from species attributes like morphology or ecology remains untested. The fellowship research addressed these questions in two imperiled species groups, the land snails of Gal&aacute;pagos (<em>Naesiotus</em>) and Hawaii (Achatinellinae). We first re-assessed the threat of extinction (using IUCN criteria) in the Gal&aacute;pagos land snails and found that over the past ~15 years some species have become more threatened, while others have become less threatened through better surveys and significant conservation efforts. During our re-assessment, which relied heavily on field surveys of former and potential habitat, we rediscovered several species long-suspected of being extinct (<em>N. achatellinus, N. asperatus, N. bauri, N. canaliferus, N. cucullinus</em>). We digitized the extensive shell collections of several museums (including the Bishop Museum, the California Academy of Sciences, and the Museum of Comparative Zoology) and characterized shell morphology of 174 putative species.

In particular, large, globose species were more likely to be critically endangered or extinct than small, narrow species. Gal&aacute;pagos species did not exhibit a similar directional decline. Instead, decline in Gal&aacute;pagos species occurs irrespective of species morphology, though still leading to a 40% decline in morphological diversity. To summarize these initial findings, we conclude that species morphology may be informative for predicting extinction likelihood in some groups (e.g. Hawaiian land snails), but not others (e.g. Gal&aacute;pagos land snails). This may be in part a result of differences in the threats to each group.
