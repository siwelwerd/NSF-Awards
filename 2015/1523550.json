 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made by the University of Hawaii to fund additional and replacement instrumentation for the R/V Kilo Moana, (KM), a 185? general purpose research vessel. The vessel is owned by the Navy and operated by the University of Hawaii as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. Instrumentation requested in this proposal incluses:\r\n1)\tScintillation counter\t$47,528\t\r\n2)\t12 kHz acoustic pinger\t$16,650\t\r\n3)\tReverse osmosis water purification system\t$8,135\t\r\n4)\tHigh accuracy pressure standard\t$8,875\t\r\n5)\tReplacement Xducers for subbottom profiling system\t$12,500\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$93,688\t\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

Aboard the R/V Kilo Moana, this includes supporting research using radioisotopes and highly purified water.  The ship also conducts geophysical investigations and is equipped with a 3.5 kHz sonar system that can penetrate the seabed to image underlying sediment structures.\n\nThis grant provided funds to purchase shared-use equipment that supports research aboard the R/V Kilo Moana.
