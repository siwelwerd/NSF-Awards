The science of indoor air chemistry is several decades old, but remains in its infancy. The much more mature science of atmospheric (outdoor) chemistry can be leveraged to rapidly advance knowledge in the indoor environment. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will result in the first of its kind: a focused collaboration of international outdoor and indoor scientists and engineers with a resulting plan of action for research on indoor chemistry. This workshop brings together 50 atmospheric and indoor air chemistry researchers to present and discuss contemporary research in both fields, pose and answer key research questions and define future indoor air chemistry research objectives. A primary outcome of the 2-day workshop will be one or more documents outlining the major questions, research objectives and research solutions that are identified during workshop sessions. Where possible, these documents will be turned into publishable manuscripts in the form of regular journal articles or editorials. The PIs anticipate that the workshop will set the stage for future workshops and that the outcomes of this workshop will help define the direction of indoor chemistry research in the near future.",
