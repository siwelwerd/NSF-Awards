 "awd_abstract_narration": "La Salle University's Math Plus One (M+1)  program will recruit students into mathematics through a focus on career preparation, strong student support services, and scholarship funding that will make college more affordable.  The M+1 program will recruit 16 students (two cohorts of 8) who will major in mathematics and one other related area, with an emphasis on the fields of computer science, economics, finance, and chemistry.  M+1 graduates will have a competitive advantage when seeking post-graduate employment and will fill critical workforce needs in the Greater Philadelphia area.\r\n\r\nLa Salle will provide four years of scholarship assistance to each M+1 student.  Students will participate in undergraduate research, attend regional and national conferences, complete internships, and receive career mentoring from members of the Mathematics Advisory Board.  The Mathematics Advisory Board will consist of local business and educational leaders that, in addition to mentoring scholars, will guide and help shape the M+1 program.  The goals of the M+1 program are to increase the enrollment of math majors, ensure a diversified math student population, provide strong support services to S-STEM recipients, and ensure that S-STEM students graduate in a timely manner and obtain positions in their fields after graduation.  Recruitment efforts will target students underrepresented in the field, particularly women and minorities.",
