 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin-Platteville's (UW- Platteville) \"Increasing Graduates of Online STEM Master's Degree\" program will increase the number of students entering Distance Education online master's programs in STEM related fields. The project will provide students with the opportunity to expand upon their STEM knowledge by providing increased access to online STEM Master's programs.  The online environment allows flexible scheduling, so students can fulfill employment and family obligations.  Providing scholarships will alleviate the financial burden and increase accessibility for students pursuing advanced STEM knowledge.  This project will review best practices for supporting on-campus undergraduate students in STEM majors and apply these to graduate programs in an online environment.  Anticipated outcomes include increased student retention in full-time programs, and placement and advancement in STEM careers.\r\n\r\nThe UW-Platteville Distance Learning Center (DLC) will award 10 annual scholarships for five years to online students pursuing graduate education in STEM fields, and it will improve support services for first-time online students.  Practices such as faculty advising/mentoring, peer mentoring, faculty/student research, and networking with STEM professionals will be utilized and their impact on retention of online students reviewed.  Career guidance and placement will assist graduates who are either advancing their careers or just entering the STEM workforce.  The goal of the project will be to increase the number of students in STEM disciplines and the number of employees in STEM fields, especially underrepresented populations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF grant 1459159, entitled Increasing Graduates of Online STEM Master\u2019s Degree Program, was conceptualized after completion of two successful NSF S-STEM grants for on-campus undergraduate students at the institution.  The director of online programs and this PI discussed whether high-impact practices identified by these first two grants were transferrable to online, graduate programs.  This overarching question became the focus of this grant.  The goals for this grant were\n\nTo attract and      retain academically talented graduate students in STEM fields, with an      emphasis on students from underrepresented groups.\nTo provide a      structure of support services, both formal and informal, that facilitates      a strong STEM student cohort.\nTo encourage      participation in structured networking opportunities, including peer      mentoring, faculty advising and mentoring, faculty/student research, and      interactions with STEM professionals and alumni.\nTo promote      professional development and networking opportunities\nTo support      STEM career selection and job placement that matches students\u2019 career      preferences upon graduation.\nTo serve the      broader community through outreach and service activities aimed at      students.\n\n\nOne key high impact practice was peer and industry mentors who met regularly with the scholars. Each scholar was assigned a peer mentor and an industry mentor.  In an online environment, this was accomplished by using video conferencing software among other tools.  In 2020, this is now commonplace software; however in 2015 at the inception of this grant, it was not something that was often used for student interactions.  Scholars not only had a peer mentor but also an academic advisor who assisted them with both academic and student services help as necessary.  Students found the mentors to be quite helpful; several scholars served as peer mentors and then transitioned to industry mentors upon graduation.\n\nFor professional development, monthly Scholar Spots were presented.  These spots focused primarily on soft skills, such as communication, leadership, and team buiding, among others.  These video conferences were recorded; and in the third year, we began editing these videos to create shorter videos on soft skills tips for online students.  Work continues with editing these videos and they are published to a YouTube channel so that they are easily accessible to all online graduate students. \n\nTo assist with career opportunities and job placement, a virtual career fair was offered three times over a two-year period.  The fair saw growth in the two years it was offered.  Both companies and students were interested in exploring career opportunities in this way.  It seems fortuitous that we explored this model given our current world situation dealing with COVID.  Social distancing and limiting crowd numbers may drive career fairs to the virtual world in the coming months.\n\nOverall, the ability to move high impact practices to online environments was successful.  Masters students do have different needs than on-campus students.  Most master\u2019s students are juggling careers, family, and education.  Their support services vary from on-campus students.  However, it is possible to provide rich online student services that can assist online students.\n\nAt the submission of this grant, 50% of the scholars have graduated from their programs.  The other 50% should finish in the next two years.  Underrepresented students made up 66.6% of the awards granted.  This far exceeded our goal. This model of support for online students is easily extendable to other online programs. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/28/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lisa M Landgraf"
