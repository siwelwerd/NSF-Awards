 "awd_abstract_narration": "Streams and rivers form a vital part of the water cycle, are 'downstream of everything\" and are most affected by most human actions.  It is therefore important to understand how stream and rivers work so we can account for these benefits and anticipate how they may respond to trends like urbanization. The hyporheic zone is the boundary between the water in a river or stream and the water in sediment beneath or alongside the river.  The hyporheic zone has unique properties including enhanced chemical reactions (many of which are good for reducing pollutant levels) and habitat for organisms that live nowhere else.  The hyporheic zone is particularly active when water levels fluctuate in the stream or river, for instance due to storm events, because this forces water into or out of the riverbanks.  This project will use field surveys to determine how much this storm-enhanced hyporheic exchange varies through a wide range of streams in the eastern USA.  The field data will be combined with computer models to predict the presence and significance of this exchange in other streams.  This will allow better understanding of this exchange on aquatic organisms and the transport of nutrients and pollutants.  This project will also enhance several existing classes at Virginia Tech and increase student interest in pursuing careers in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields which are critical for preserving and enhancing America's dynamic economy and quality of life.  The project will reach out to under-represented undergraduates to improve their participation in the career-enhancing research opportunities provided by the project.\r\n \r\nStreams and rivers form a vital link among compartments of the hydrosphere.  The hyporheic zone is a key interface where water exchanges between surface and subsurface, and is important for aquatic organisms, biogeochemical reactions, and contaminant attenuation.  \"Lung model\" hyporheic exchange occurs where water enters and exits the subsurface during transient phenomena such as storms, hydropeaking, and daily snowmelt.  The effect of lung model exchange on water quality has been recently shown to be substantial, yet highly dependent on exchange rate.  This project will use field surveys of stream bank macropores to test whether macropores/soil pipes are common in several provinces of the eastern USA and a range of stream sizes and land uses.  Field surveys will include detailed measurements of macropore geometry, connectivity, sedimentation, and plugging.   These data will be used to compare the Darcy-based SUTRA model of reaction and transport to the computational fluid dynamics code Ansys CFX.   The modeling will determine the relationships between controlling factors (e.g., macropore geometry, head gradients, sediment hydraulic conductivity) and the degree that macropores enhance lung model exchange.  These results will then be upscaled to estimate the degree to which the presence of macropores increases the percent of stream length where lung model hyporheic exchange is significant.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStreams and rivers are a vital link in the hydrologic cycle.  Most water that falls on the land surface as precipitation eventually drains to streams and rivers, and then to the world?s oceans.  Streams thus concentrate and transport human-generated pollutants such as excess nutrients and industrial chemicals.  But streams are not isolated conduits.  Instead, they are constantly interacting with their surroundings.  For example, as water flows along stream and river channels, it leaves the channel and enters groundwater for a while, then returns to the channel a bit farther downstream.  This type of exchange is very common and is called hyporheic exchange.  The area of groundwater where this exchange occurs in called the hyporheic zone. \n\nHyporheic exchange is important because it can remove pollutants by allowing water flowing down the stream channel to interact with bacteria and other microorganisms in the sediment that can break down contaminants into more harmless substances.  For example, water quality credit is now given for restoration of hyporheic exchange within the Chesapeake Bay watershed.  Hyporheic exchange also creates unique habitat for certain kinds of aquatic organisms.  Hyporheic exchange can be divided loosely into to two categories.  In ?gill? type hyporheic exchange, exchange of water occurs continuously with sediments at the bottom of a stream or river.  On the other hand, in ?lung? type hyporheic exchange, exchange of water occurs in pulses at the sides (banks) of streams and rivers in response to storm events and other situations where water levels in the channel fluctuate.  Lung-type exchange has been studied less than gill type exchange.\n\nMost research on hyporheic exchange assumes that water flow is distributed evenly throughout the sediment.  This assumption generally implies that the sediment itself is homogeneous, in other words that the size or distribution of the sediment particles (grains) does not vary much in space.  Yet more and more studies of groundwater flow through soil have shown that evenly distributed flow is rare.  Instead, flow more typically occurs in patterns where most of the flow is concentrated in small areas of the soil, and the rest of the soil experiences comparatively little flow.  This concentrated flow situation is called ?preferential flow?, but has not been fully studied in the context of lung-type hyporheic exchange in stream and river banks.  Preferential flow in soil can be divided into two types, including locations where there is a coarser sediment type in part of the soil column (for example a vein of gravel within a larger area of sandy or silty soil), and also where there are open areas (air pockets) within the soil that are known as soil pipes or macropores.  The research we conducted supported by this NSF award focused on the latter type of preferential flow (i.e. through soil pipes).\n\nWe first conducted a field study where we visited 20 streams throughout the Eastern United States, and surveyed each one to determine how many soil pipes were found in the stream banks of each stream, how the soil pipes were distributed along the length of the stream, and what some of the dimensions of each soil pipe (e.g., diameter, length) were.  This field study showed that soil pipes were found in all streams throughout the region and therefore are normal features rather than unusual features of stream systems.  This indicates that their effect on hyporheic exchange is also probably very widespread.  We next used computer modeling to determine the actual effect of this widespread distribution of stream bank soil pipes on hyporheic exchange.  Modeling showed that streambank and riverbank macropores and soil pipes substantially increase lung-type hyporheic exchange.  Taken together, these two studies indicate that preferential flow through streambank macropores and soil pipes is likely widespread with significant effect on hyporheic exchange. \n\nThese results have substantial implications for pollutants moving down stream and river systems.  In particular, the effect of such lung-type hyporheic exchange on pollutants is likely greater than originally expected based on earlier assumptions of homogeneous bank soils without preferential flow.  In other words, removal of contaminants by hyporheic exchange may be more substantial than previously thought, particularly in finer-grained soils such as those with a lot of silt or clay particles.  Through this project we have highlighted these results in a number of articles in the scientific literature, presentations at scientific conferences, and in the theses and dissertations of a number of graduate students.  This award has supported a number of graduate students that performed the research, as well as a number of undergraduate assistants, some of which were in under-represented categories.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/15/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Erich T Hester"
