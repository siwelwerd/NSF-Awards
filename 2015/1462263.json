From another point of view, it is a possible symmetry group of such a universe, generalizing the crystallographic groups used by chemists and others.  In this project, the Principal Investigator uses abstract and practical algorithms, as well as more traditional mathematical techniques, to study symmetry groups related to 3-manifold groups.  The theorems and software that will be produced should be useful to other investigators of 3-manifolds and geometric group theory.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator will work on two projects in Geometric Group Theory.  The first applies computer algorithms to understand (1) the set of virtually geometric words in free groups and (2) the space of possible counterexamples to the Simple Loop Conjecture.  The second project will refine and expand our understanding of group theoretic Dehn filling.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGroup theory is the study of symmetry.  Finite group theory focuses on symmetries of finite combinatorial objects, like cubes, whereas in Lie theory objects can have continuous families of symmetries, like a sphere.  Geometric group theory is the study of infinite but discrete symmetry groups, like that of an infinite checkerboard, or of an Escher print like \"Circle Limit I\".  The geometry represented in the Escher print is hyperbolic geometry, and the work performed in this grant is about geometries like hyperbolic geometry, called \"negatively curved\" geometries.  Each such geometry has a \"boundary at infinity\" like the circle bounding the Escher print.  In the classical three-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, the boundary at infinity is a two-dimensional sphere, but much more exotic spaces can also occur.  The Cannon Conjecture gives a characterization of those groups which have a two-dimensional sphere at infinity.\n\nNegatively curved groups often fit into families, related to one another by a process called \"Dehn filling\".
