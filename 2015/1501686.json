 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to identify factors that regulate the uptake and storage of carbon within soils of cattle pastures in the southeastern United States. Carbon molecules that have been isotopically labeled will be tracked and used to answer questions about how and where carbon is sequestered by plant roots and soil microbes. The two main questions that will be addressed are: how plants transfer internal carbon from roots to the soil, and how microbes in the soil determine whether that carbon is quickly released back to the atmosphere through respiration or stabilized and stored for long periods of time? Carbon stored in soils for long periods of time is critical for the functioning of healthy ecosystems, in this case important agricultural systems in the US, but is also of interest for managers and policy makers because it represents the strength of the ecosystem for storing carbon from the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nOne promising strategy to at least help offset carbon emissions from human activities is to strengthen the uptake and storage capacity for carbon in the soils of grasslands, since they are globally extensive and also vital for agricultural production. This project will advance technical understanding of the processes that regulate grassland soil carbon storage. Additional outcomes include graduate student training, opportunities for collaboration across scientific disciplines, mentoring and education of undergraduate students, and the extension of results to help farm managers understand and increase their abilities to store carbon on-farm while also improving pasture sustainability.",

It is well known that root system inputs are the source of most grassland SOC, but the impact of grazing on partitioning of carbon allocation to root tissue production compared to fine root exudation is unclear. This uncertainty is significant because root exudates and root tissue have potentially divergent implications for SOC. Generally speaking, root exudate carbon only contributes to SOC after it is assimilated into microbial biomass, and then some fraction of microbial necromass is stabilized as SOC by formation of organo-mineral complexes. By contrast, root litter undergoes decomposition in the soil and contributes both directly plant-derived compounds as well as microbial residues to SOC. Prior research has documented that, in some circumstances, grazing can enhance root production, root exudation, or potentially both. However, very little is known about whether exudation is enhanced long-term, and, if so, what consequences this has for SOC.</p>\n<p>Here we used <em>in situ</em> isotope pulse-chase methodology paired with plant and soil sampling to link plant carbon allocation patterns with SOC pools in a system of long-term grazing exclosures in subtropical pasture in Florida, USA. By comparing carbon allocation patterns and SOC pools in plots where grazing has been excluded for 15+ years to those observed in adjacent grazed pasture, while controlling for plant composition, we were able to infer the impact of cattle (i.e. large herbivore) grazing. Specifically, we quantified allocation of carbon to root tissue, estimated root exudation across grazed and ungrazed plots, and also quantified lignin phenols to assess the relative contribution of plant versus microbial products to total SOC. Lignin phenols are only present in plant tissue, and thus their concentration in SOC inside versus outside of long-term grazing exclosure enabled us to quantify the relative importance of plant tissue inputs compared to microbial carbon in explaining variations in SOC. We link this back to our quantification of root exudation by noting that root exudates can only ultimately contribute microbial carbon to SOC. Thus, if grazing enhances SOC by promoting root exudation, it should be associated with a diluted concentration of lignin phenols, as microbial carbon would be relatively more important in that case.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;We found that grazing exclusion was associated with dramatically reduced overall belowground allocation, and resulted in lower root biomass, fine root exudates, and microbial biomass. Overall, it appears that the pasture grasses inside the long-term exclosure have undergone a significant phenotypic shift favoring investment in aboveground tissue at the expense of belowground allocation, consistent with increased competition for light as a significant driving force: the shoots are taller and wider, and inter-plant spacing is higher. &nbsp;Consistent with greater belowground investment, grazed pasture contained more total SOC (+28% in top 5 cm), and a larger fraction of SOC that originated from plant tissue deposition, suggesting that larger root litter deposition under grazing underlies greater SOC. We did not find evidence that the substantially greater rates of root exudation underlie the higher SOC. We conclude that grazing effects on SOC depend on root system biomass, a pattern that may generalize to other C4-dominated grasslands especially in the subtropics. Although much more research is needed to test the generalizability of our findings across diverse pasture and rangeland systems, we recommend that land managers begin routinely monitoring root system biomass as a key &lsquo;bio-indicator&rsquo; underlying SOC, and hence the role of grazing lands in global climate change.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/21/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Chris&nbsp;H&nbsp;Wilson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501686/1501686_10355340_1500661287447_Lignin_SOC_NSF--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501686/1501686_10355340_1500661287447_Lignin_SOC_NSF--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SOC-Lignin Relationship\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501686/1501686_10355340_1500661287447_Lignin_SOC_NSF--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SOC-Lignin Relationship\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This figure shows the overall very strong relationship between lignin and SOC concentrations.
