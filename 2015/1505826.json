A quantum phase transition takes place at zero temperature and describes a phase transition between competing ground states driven by an external parameter such as chemical composition, pressure, or magnetic field. The recent studies of unconventional superconductors show that superconductivity develops in proximity to a magnetically ordered phase. This raises the possibility of quantum phase transitions in these systems arising from competing types of such orders. The present studies of iron-based superconductors mainly focus on the understanding of the normal state properties of these superconductors and on the mechanism of superconductivity. These studies enhance our fundamental understanding of the extent to which a quantum phase transition controls the finite temperature properties of these superconductors and promise insight into the mutual interplay between superconductivity and magnetism. They could also offer clues about other unconventional superconductors, such as the cuprates, and contribute to a more global understanding of the novel phenomenon of high temperature superconductivity. This highly interdisciplinary project allows graduate and undergraduate students, postdocs, and visitors to benefit from exposure to a diversity of experimental techniques, a variety of different physical systems and phenomena, and forefront topics in condensed matter physics. The diversity of the expertise gained by the participants in this research program is a substantial advantage in today's knowledge based, technology driven economy, being beneficial to a future career in industry, government, or academia. Professional mentoring is provided for the postdoc and graduate students. A female Ph.D. student participates in this project, hence, the project increases diversity within the field. The international collaborations with scientists in Romania and China contribute to the nation's infrastructure for research and education. The principal investigator develops teaching lab modules for a senior laboratory that verifies experimentally counterintuitive physical phenomena learned in Quantum Mechanics. She also addresses the professional development needs of science teachers in grades 6-10 by developing the physical science component of a new physical and life science graduate course. Finally, she provides middle school and high school physics teachers and their students workshops and lab tours.  \r\n\r\nTechnical description:\r\nThis proposal addresses a major theme in condensed matter physics: unconventional superconductivity in Fe-based superconductors. The proposed research significantly enhances our fundamental understanding of charge conduction and magnetism of iron pnictides/chalcogenites, addresses issues related with the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity, and contributes to a more global understanding of the novel phenomenon of high temperature superconductivity. The goals of this research are to:  (1) study novel electronic quantum states with real-space texture in iron pnictides/chalcogenites superconductors with either an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator or antiferromagnetic spin density wave parent compound; (2) reveal the microscopic coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity and its evolution with doping; (3) study quantum criticality in order to reveal possible quantum phase transitions induced by control parameters, elucidate the phase boundary between the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases inside the superconducting state, and generate a phase diagram that provides direct evidence for a quantum critical line inside the superconducting phase; (4) study the symmetry of the superconducting gap in order to unambiguously distinguish between different pairing symmetries and reveal any universality in the doping dependence of the gap; (5) reveal the origin of the pseudogap region; (6) facilitate the training of highly qualified personnel through comprehensive and multifaceted research, improve STEM education through educator development at 6-10 grade levels, and perform outreach activities. The methods that are used in these studies are resistivity, magnetoresistivity, current-voltage, torque, and magnetization measurements. Understanding the intrinsic electronic, magnetic, and magnetotransport mechanisms in these complex materials may be a key component in understanding their unique and potentially useful physical properties. With iron pnictides/chalcogenites and cuprates to compare and contrast, the proposed research could contribute to finally uncovering the vital clues that theorists need to solve the mystery of high-temperature superconductivity. More broadly, the results from these basic investigations provide further understanding of the interplay between magnetism and superconductivity of other unconventional superconductors and insight into appropriate doping schemes to facilitate applications to electronic sensors and devices.",

Unveiling what these various materials share in common and what aspects of their behavior are system specific lead to basic scientific insights with important practical relevance to developing functional materials for technological applications.  Our studies of the physics of strongly correlated electron systems impact science and engineering research in many beneficial ways.  \n\nEducation, training, and professional development:\n\nThese projects provided opportunities for research, teaching, and mentoring, for graduate and undergraduate students.  Since these projects were not overly large and unwieldy, the researchers pursuing them necessarily became trained in a wide array of skills and technologies.  Specifically, these projects have contributed to the development of experimental skills and experience with low-temperature systems, electronics and mechanical design and construction, equipment \"debugging\", planning and executing microcomputer interfaces for automated experimental control and data acquisition, and programming including writing special-purpose programs in high-level languages.  Also, these projects has exposed the students to new physics phenomena that are at the forefront of condensed matter physics.  Finally, thedy provided a unique opportunity for developing scientific presentation and writing skills.  All students participated in regular laboratory group as well as departmental meetings.  In addition, they also attended national and international conferences where they presented their work.  Moreover, they contributed to manuscript preparation and writing.\nThe principal investigator believes that professional development is a fundamental component of the training experience of graduate students.  For this reason, she has invested a lot of time, effort, and dedication towards this goal, and she has strived to provide a stimulating, positive, and constructive experience for all group members.  Specifically, the principal investigator and each group member initially identified his/her career goals and assessed the developmental needs to achieve these goals.  During subsequent monthly meetings, they discussed the progress made toward the identified goals.  Besides these formal meetings, the principal investigator had additional frequent informal discussions with group members on guidance, career development resources, and professional opportunities meant to strengthen a meaningful mentoring relationship. \n\nSociety and the general public:\nStudents from middle schools and high schools in the surrounding Springfield and Ravenna school districts visited the principal investigator\u2019s laboratory and learned about physics in general, and superconductivity and magnetism in particular, through demonstrations and short lectures given by the group members. In this way, the middle school and high school students were exposed to a research environment and were given a flavor of the science done in the lab and the technology involved in doing it.  We note that these school districts contain schools that have particular needs with respect to physical and life sciences instruction and that 52% and 63%, respectively, of the children served by these school districts are from families with incomes below the poverty line.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/05/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carmen Almasan"
