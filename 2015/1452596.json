 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ryan Steele of the University of Utah is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division to develop new approaches to the computational simulation of chemical processes.   Such simulations currently exhibit the potential to unravel critical details of societally relevant chemistry challenges, including renewable energy.  They also, however, are impeded by computational cost hurdles which limit the applicability of these methods.  This research program seeks alternative approaches which dramatically extend the range of applicability of these methods and the development of new simulation methodology.  Specifically, this work will address the motion of molecules and the manner in which this motion dictates chemical reactivity. The computational tools developed in this project will be made available to the broader research community.  In concert with these developments, integrated education components of this program strive to improve the manner in which students and educators view chemistry -- both literally and conceptually -- by using newly developed simulation/visualization tools and pedagogy.  These education aims will facilitate a change in pedagogy, as well as increase access for underserved students and their educators.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe key proposed methodology -- and the unique aspect of the research in this funding period -- is a new algorithmic interface which marries ab initio electronic structure theory with sampling and on-the-fly dynamics.  This work seeks to exploit the inherent spatial and temporal separability of the inner workings of electronic structure methods for new, dynamics-specific simulations of large, reactive chemical systems.  Application to water oxidation complexes, where unique electronic structure and nuclear motion abound, will be enabled by this new methodology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research program was designed to improve the capabilities of computer simulations of molecules.  Such simulations have become important partners to chemistry experiments, and they complement laboratory-based measurements.  The guiding premise of the present research program was that known&mdash;and newly discovered&mdash;behavior of the inner-workings of molecules could be exploited for faster and more useful simulations.  In particular, the length and time scales of the electronic structure of molecules were used to craft new simulation techniques for chemical dynamics.  During the funding period, such concepts were proven to be successful and yielded several new algorithms and techniques.  These methods were integrated into a widely used quantum chemistry software package, and results were disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and presentations at national and international conferences.\n\nThese new methods were used to study the manner in which strong ions and radicals activated the oxidation of water for renewable-energy purposes.  Using molecular clusters as models of these hydration environments, partial and full ionization of water were studied.  These studies included (a) a survey of the thousands of cluster structures of ionized water and reactive, hydrated ions, (b) simulation and definitive interpretation of historically unexplained vibrational spectra, and (c) real-time and quantum dynamics of ionized water.  The main outcome was an atomic-level understanding the manner by which intact water is chemically activated to yield ionized products.\n\nAlong the way, these dynamics-focused concepts were extended to enhance simulations of vibrational spectroscopy (response of molecules to infrared radiation).  These new techniques exploited the locality of vibrational couplings for orders-of-magnitude acceleration of computational simulations.  They also enabled the simulation of spectra of ions for which modern experiments had recently been performed.\n\nThe broader impacts of this research include the development and dissemination of simulation methods for the general chemistry community, as well as a focus on the education-related CAREER components of this research program.  For the latter, elementary school science lessons were used, in addition to research training of high-school chemistry teachers and the development of a computational chemistry \"laboratory\" course.  This course has now been developed into online material for broader dissemination.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/24/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ryan P Steele"
