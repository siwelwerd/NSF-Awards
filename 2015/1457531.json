 "awd_abstract_narration": "Invasive species threaten the integrity of native ecosystems and cause billions of dollars in economic losses in the US annually. This long-term project will identify the mechanisms that allow some species to be invasive, and some communities to be invaded, while others are not. It is an exciting example of a public-scientist partnership in research and management, as the investigator works collaboratively with local and regional officials on the conservation of their natural areas, outreach to public visitors of these areas, and developing and assessing a virtual field trip that engages middle school students who are unable to visit the research site directly. The project will continue to provide training for undergraduate and graduate students, with a particular emphasis on recruiting students from groups under-represented in field ecology. \r\n\r\nThis award supports Phase II of a decadal project to understand the population- and community-level dynamics of invasion by garlic mustard. The investigator will collect vital rate data on seven focal species, including three native herbaceous perennials that are highly palatable to deer, two native herbaceous perennials unpalatable to deer, a native winter annual, and the highly invasive garlic mustard. A Life Table Response Experiment will include two fully crossed treatments: plots are either open or fenced to exclude deer, and plots divided between garlic mustard presence and its removal.  Demographic matrix projection analyses and Integral Projection Models analyses will be used to project population growth rates and the long-term fates of focal species under the deer and invader scenarios generated by the experiment. Demographic analyses will be complemented by experiments exploring the hypothesized mechanisms of invasion success. Results from Phase I of this project indicated that chemicals released by garlic mustard suppress physiological function and carbon storage of the focal natives by disrupting the native plant-mycorrhizal mutualism. In Phase II, additional data on the physiological status of plants the four treatments will be compared. Instantaneous photosynthetic and transpiration rates, stomatal conductance and fluorometric measurements of focal plants will provide insights into carbon stress as a mechanism of native decline and invader domination.",

In North America, human introductions of invasive plant species are rapidly and profoundly changing terrestrial environments and pose a unique set of basic scientific and applied management challenges. Likewise, heavy grazing associated with locally high densities of deer negatively affects biodiversity and community dynamics of native plant communities, timber production, agricultural and fruit tree crops, home gardens and landscaping, and alters critical ecosystem processes. This project explored forest invasion by testing hypotheses of how a plant invader and overabundant deer altered native plant performance within a temperate deciduous forest understory. The main field experiment focused on responses of a set of common, long-lived, native herbaceous perennial wildflowers. Growth, survival, flowering, seed production, and seed germination data were collected annually for the focal wildflower species in large, replicate long-term field experimental plots in Pennsylvania. In these plots, the noxious plant invader (garlic mustard, <em>Alliaria petiolata</em>, Brassicaceae) and an overabundant mammalian herbivore (white-tailed deer, <em>Odocoileus virginianus</em>, Cervidae) were either present at natural densities or removed via weeding or fencing, respectively, for nearly two decades.

This research found that when garlic mustard is present, its AITC is detectable in the soil and the abundance of the soil fungi that are beneficial to the native wildflowers declines significantly. Loss of soil fungi results in a disruption of the nutritional mutualism between the plant and fungal partners. Analyses of focal wildflowers in the presence of garlic mustard indicated they were stressed. Specifically, the ability of the focal native understory wildflowers to maintain normal physiological functions (e.g., photosynthesis, transpiration, etc.) relative to focal plants in plots without garlic mustard was lower.
