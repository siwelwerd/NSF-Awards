 "awd_abstract_narration": "This conference award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to University of Delaware is in support of a symposium titled \"Polymeric Biomaterials\" to be held in March 22-26, 2015 at the American Chemical Society Meeting in Denver, Colorado. This symposium would provide opportunity to bring together scientists working in design, synthesis, modification and characterization of polymeric biomaterials, and share their recent ideas and approaches in gaining insights into this multidisciplinary area. The participants of the symposium are expected to include leading scientists in the field, in addition to junior faculty members, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students. Furthermore, the size, structure and format of the conference would facilitate networking and developing future collaborations.\r\n\r\nThis symposium will cover recent advances in the design, synthesis, modification, and characterization of polymeric biomaterials that have the potential to improve human health and welfare. New synthetic strategies and characterization tools to prepare novel biopolymer systems that permit control of the biological interaction and response of these biomaterials will be presented at this meeting. The current dilemma in the field of polymeric biomaterials is that sophisticated chemical synthesis and fabrication processes, although scientifically intriguing, do not necessarily result in biomaterials with the desired stability and functional properties such as interaction with and viability of cells. The objectives of the symposium are: 1) to highlight recent advances in the design, synthesis and application of tailored polymeric materials for health and medicine; 2) to provide a platform for polymer scientists, materials scientists, and biologists to establish connections and exchange ideas; and 3) to facilitate opportunities for junior faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate as well as undergraduate students to present their most recently updated research results. The proposed symposium is expected to stimulate the development of novel biomaterials with enhanced functional properties and applications.",
