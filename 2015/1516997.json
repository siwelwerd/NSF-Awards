  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA central goal of cosmology is to understand the matter and energy\ncontents of the universe.  The most surprising cosmological discovery\nof recent decades is that the expansion of the universe is speeding\nup instead of slowing down, which implies that gravity over cosmic\nscales is repulsive rather than attractive.\n\nThe objective of this grant was to develop new methods for measuring\nthe clustering of dark matter in the universe, to help test theories\nfor the origin of this cosmic acceleration.  Because dark matter does\nnot emit light, we need to measure it indirectly.  The approach taken\nin our work is to measure the association between dark matter and\nvisible galaxies through \"weak gravitational lensing,\" a distortion of\nbackground galaxy images by the light-bending gravity of intervening\ndark matter.  This phenomenon has been measured in large cosmological\nsurveys.  We developed new methods to combine these measurements of\ngalaxy-dark matter associations with measurements of the clustering \nof the galaxies themselves, so that we can infer the clustering of\nthe dark matter.  Much of this work is based on supercomputer simulations,\nbut we interpret the results with paper-and-pencil equations to the\nextent that we can.\n\nThe most exciting applications of our techniques will come over the next\ncouple of years, with data sets that are now in hand but have not yet been\nfully analyzed.  The preliminary application of one of our methods\nto existing data already yields a tantalizing result.  The dark matter\nclustering that we infer from astronomical observations is lower than\nthe clustering predicted by the currently leading theory of cosmology,\na discrepancy of about 10 percent.  If this result holds up with future\ndata, it implies that there is some critical missing ingredient in our\ncurrent understanding, and it might eventually guide us to a fundamental \nchange in our reigning theory of gravity, known as General Relativity,\nwhich was proposed by Albert Einstein in 1915.\n\nSome of the broader impacts of this work have come through the PI's\nmany public lectures on different aspects of cosmology and astrophysics.\nThe most unusual of these lectures have been based on cosmologically\ninspired sculptures by the artist Josiah McElheny, which McElheny and\nthe PI designed over the course of a decade-long collaboration.\nThese sculptures give our theoretical and empirical understanding\nof the cosmos a stunning visual form, one that is informed by science\nand by philosophical, artistic, and political developments of the past\nthree centuries.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David H Weinberg"
