 "awd_abstract_narration": "How is the internet changing the ways that Americans think of themselves as individuals and interact as members of communities? While there has been considerable scientific research on this question, there has been far less attention paid to the experiences of people with disabilities.  This is unfortunate because the effects of these technologies may be more pronounced for them and therefore easier for us to observe and analyze. This project focuses on the experiences of people with disabilities in on-line, virtual worlds. In these three-dimensional, immersive online spaces, people with disabilities can appear as they choose and do things they may not be able to do in the physical world. The researchers also will study other dimensions of the on-line lives of people with disabilities, including interactions on social network sites, blogs, and e-commerce venues. The research will contribute to improving health care and social support for people with disabilities.\r\n\r\nThomas Boellstorff of the University of California, Irvine and Donna Davis of the University of Oregon, Eugene, will collaborate to explore: (a) how people with disabilities use digital media with regard to embodiment and social interaction; (b) how this changes self-understanding as disabled and affects physical-world experiences of disability; (c) what aspects of embodied online social interaction are linked to specific disabilities; (d) the role of digital making and the effect of differing platforms and devices. The research will involve a range of ethnographic methods conducted in online digital media, as well as interviews with a subset of people with disabilities provided with devices like 3D goggles. Virtual world interviews will be conducted with at least 80 individuals, and a smaller subset of intensive, ethnographic interviews will be conducted to address issues of how online embodiment is conceptualized. In addition to offering scholarly contributions to disability studies, science and technology studies, media studies, and cultural anthropology, this project explores the experiences of an underrepresented group, and offer insights into increasingly relevant public debates about the role of digital culture. The project's investigation of the insights of people with disabilities will help us better understand how new online technologies influence the relationship between the human body and technology, how we think about social interaction in light of these massive technological innovations, and how we think about the role of the internet in everyday life.",

This was an ethnographic study of disabled persons in the social virtual world Second Life. In this virtual world, people interact using animated 3D avatars. People often think virtual worlds are just a game, a &ldquo;cartoon&rdquo; that is merely a way to escape reality, or that virtual worlds attract people who don&rsquo;t have a &ldquo;real life.&rdquo; Additionally, people might wonder: how can you study people with a range of disabilities but not meet most of them in person? Some might even ask: how can studying avatars offer any meaningful insight into the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world?</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>But results from this research challenged these assumptions. First, it became clear that virtual worlds are not &ldquo;just a game.&rdquo; They are places where true and meaningful social interaction is happening. Second, the researchers were meeting these disabled persons &ldquo;in person.&rdquo; This is because meeting people online is a new kind of &ldquo;face-to-face,&rdquo; especially when avatars represent an embodied being. For some of these individuals, their online identity was as important to them as their physical identity. This was especially the case for the most marginalized, or for those who may be home-, room-, or even bed-bound by their disability. Using virtual worlds, these people can experience social and professional interactions with others around the world, and in those interactions they are not defined primarily by their ability or disability. Third, these disabled people made it clear in their words and deeds that what they were doing online was real, if by &ldquo;real&rdquo; we mean things like authentic, meaningful, and consequential. And finally, as virtual and augmented reality technologies are increasingly being utilized not only for entertainment, but in the workplace and for health care, this group of people illuminated issues of accessibility of these platforms that have important implications for their future design and implementation.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The economic, societal, and scientific impact of the research was thus beyond our wildest expectations. The internet is not going away, to put it mildly. It is transforming economies and societies worldwide, and particularly in the United States, where so much innovation around digital technology takes place. Including disabled people fully in society is of crucial importance, particularly as the population ages (many people acquire disabilities later in life). But this research shows how disability experience is, in fact, human experience, even when the human engages in social, creative and work life online. It points toward new possibilities for us all. In particular, the research showed how avatar bodies can shape self-identity, and how the virtual places in which those avatars exist play a key role in social interaction. This helps us avoid seeing the internet as one thing, and instead appreciate how virtual worlds, games, and social network sites (like Twitter and Facebook) differ. The research also showed how social researchers can use virtual place as a research tool, because about 30 disabled persons were given virtual land to build on for the duration of the project, and this brought new insights into their experiences and practices.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We live in a world where everything from friendship and commerce to security and truth itself is being radically reshaped by digital technologies.
