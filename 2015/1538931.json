 "awd_abstract_narration": "Irises originated in the Northern Hemisphere and consist of about 260 species that have colorful multidimensional flowers. This proposal focuses on understanding the evolution of a large group within Irises, a group that is morphologically diverse with plants ranging from tall to dwarf species.  The evolution of this group will be studied by sampling the morphological and biogeographical diversity within the focal group. In addition, relationships among Iris species will be assessed using genetic data. The evolution of important vegetative and floral characters will be examined as a result of clarifying the evolutionary relationships among Iris species. In addition, this project will conduct developmental studies to decipher the pattern of formation of the elaborate, tri-dimensional, flowers.\r\n\r\nThis group of plants are of economic importance and are commonly used in public and private gardens. In many regions of the world Iris species are rare in nature leading several nations to protect all species. This project will train graduate and undergraduate students; in addition an international student will be trained in molecular genetic techniques. Seminars on this research will be given to the general public and horticultural groups.",
