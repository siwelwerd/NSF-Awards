 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a critical need in this nation for well-educated, well-prepared STEM professionals. Ocean industries, in particular, are experiencing a severe shortage of skilled workers, with the demand for electronics technicians, engineers, and computer scientists at the top of their lists. This project seeks to address the demand for STEM professionals, with a focus on those with knowledge of ocean applications, by building the pipeline of students interested in and well-prepared for STEM careers. The typical customer of the proposed innovation is a middle or high school science/engineering/technology teacher looking for a creative, semester-long curriculum that integrates engineering, science, and applied math and is aligned with the Next Generation of Science Standards (NGSS).  It is believed these teachers would make up 70-80% of the customer base; the remainder would be elementary school teachers, informal educators, parents, and college and university educators (who are providers of K-12 education activities or professional development).\r\n\r\nThe proposed innovation is a comprehensive learning package that includes curriculum (e.g. a lesson and activity book) aligned with NGSS?s Engineering, Technology, and Applications of Science standards, an ROV (remotely operated vehicle) kit, and lab packs of resources (e.g. electronic components) for  middle school and high school. The team envisions these efforts to result in an e-book(s) that includes how-to videos and demonstrations; and perhaps a hard copy also.  The ROV kits are in the beta stage of development, and the team continues to make improvements based on customer feedback and own R&D. The curriculum is in a proof-of-principle stage; foundational learning outcomes have been defined, but more will be added.",

Not only do teachers want continuing professional development opportunities, they would also like national recognition for the professional development that they receive.  Most school districts have money for professional development; some are actively seeking programs that can help their teachers prepare for the NGSS.\n\nThrough I-Corps L we defined a vision for where we want to be as a business.  Our sales over the past 12 months come to roughly $200,000.  Our goal is to increase sales to $2.5 million/year over the next 5 years, while still maintaining the character of our student-run business &ndash; SeaMATE.  SeaMATE is our social enterprise that provides community college students with workplace experience while creating products and services that promote marine technical education. \n\nTo achieve this goal, over the next 2 years we will need to focus on and invest in the following: improving the online shopping experience, expanding our product line, developing a complement of online and in-person professional development, and expanding to new audiences.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/22/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Deidre Sullivan"
