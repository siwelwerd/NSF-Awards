 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymers find ubiquitous applications in modern civilization.  However, polymers are generally regarded as poor heat conductors, while many applications would benefit from polymer materials that are able to function as good heat conductors.  Recent studies have suggested polymer materials that have been significantly stretched could have substantially enhanced mechanical strength and heat conduction.  We therefore aim to study the mechanical and thermal properties of nanoscale fibers formed in a jet that induces significant stretching.  We expect that heat transport in these nanofibers may be profoundly enhanced compared to larger, unstretched versions of the same polymer.  We will study how the jet stretches the polymer molecules, and how the resulting molecular orientation in turn results in enhanced mechanical strength and heat conduction, which may eventually lead to exciting new polymer materials that are extremely strong, flexible, and good conductors of heat.  Such materials would enable a variety of applications, such as flexible electronics and displays, solar cells, and advanced structural materials integrated with high-power electronics, leading to significant future technological advancements.  The project has integrated research and educational components to train graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment, and to extend the impact to underrepresented minorities through collaboration between Vanderbilt and Fisk universities.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to correlate the manufacturing process conditions, structure, as well as mechanical and thermal properties of electrospun polymer nanofibers.  The approach is to integrate informed control of the electrospinning process, mechanical and thermal transport property measurement, thorough microstructural characterization, and theoretical analysis to achieve an in-depth understanding of how electrospinning parameters affect nanofiber microstructure, mechanical and thermal properties.  The structure and property characterization will be performed at an individual nanofiber level, thereby avoiding averaging over potential fiber heterogeneity.  Microstructure will be characterized using micro-Raman spectroscopy, a technique which is able to provide detailed information about molecular composition and orientation from a small sample volume.  Mechanical properties of individual nanofibers will be characterized using an atomic force microscope to perform a 3-point bend test.  Thermal properties of individual nanofibers will be measured using custom-built microdevices.  With an understanding of how electrospinning parameters affect microstructure, and the interplay between microstructure and mechanical/thermal properties, we will be able to optimize deposition parameters to achieve polymeric materials with tunable mechanical and thermal properties.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe work supported by this grant focused on investigating the effects of several electrospinning parameters on the thermal and mechanical properties of resulting nanofibers, with the goal of establishing process-structure-property relationships that will inform future design rules for high thermal conductivity polymer materials.  Inspired by prior work showing enhanced thermal conduction in ultra-drawn polyethylene nanofibers, we formed electrospun polyethylene nanofibers at varying electrospinning voltages.  We found that nanofibers formed at higher voltages (but the same tip-collector distance) exhibited enhanced molecular orientation and crystallinity (as revealed by Raman spectroscopy), as well as significantly enhanced thermal conductivity.  The maximum thermal conductivity we were able to achieve (using an electrospinning voltage of 45 kV) was 9.3 W m&minus;1 K&minus;1, over 20 times greater than typical bulk values for this material.  With an electrospinning system capable of operating at higher voltages, we believe it may be possible to further enhance the thermal conductivity. \n\nExcited by these results related to electrospinning voltage, we explored the effects of two other parameters related to electrospun polymeric nanofibers: polymer size (by varying molecular chain length) and polymer structure (by varying side group composition).  To investigate the effects of size, we electrospun nanofibers of polyethylene of various molecular weights, holding all other electrospinning parameters constant and roughly matching the viscosities of the electrospinning solutions.  We found that the measured thermal conductivity increases monotonically with molecular chain length, which can be explained by noting that energy transport along molecular chains is more efficient than between chains and thus a material composed of aligned longer chain molecules should be able to transport heat more efficiently.  Additionally, by comparing the measured thermal conductivity of vinyl polymer nanofibers with different side groups, we found that heat conduction is more effective when the side groups are either lighter or more symmetric.  These results are consistent with prior numerical modeling results showing that as the side group atomic mass increases, the acoustic phonons in the same frequency range contribute much less to thermal transport due to mismatch between the vibration modes of neighboring carbon atoms along the molecular chain. \n\nTo further enhance the thermal conductivity of electrospun nanofibers, we have begun to explore the effects of adding thermally conductive nanofillers (i.e. forming composite nanofibers) and of hot drawing the nanofibers post-deposition in order to further increase the molecular orientation.\n\nOverall, we have gained critical knowledge relating how the electrospinning process and composition of electrospun nanofibers can be tuned to achieve significantly enhanced thermal conductivity in the resulting materials.  These results will prove useful for future applications in which the benefits of employing polymeric materials must be paired with good heat conduction capability.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/25/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Leon M Bellan"
