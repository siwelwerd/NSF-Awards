 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for student authors from US Institutions to travel to ICML 2015.  The award will support roughly 40 students (who have authored accepted submissions) to travel to the conference and present their research.  ICML is one of the premier Machine Learning conferences in the world, and a highly competitive venue.  The student scholarships funded under this award creates opportunities for students to present their work to an international audience at a top conference --- a significant professional enhancement for graduate research students.  The award thus contributes to the education and training of the next generation of researchers and educatiors in the increasingly important area of Machine Learning.  \r\n\r\nSpecial attention is paid to broadening participation of students from groups traditionally underrepresented in Computer Science in general, and in Machine Learning in particular.  The selection of students to be funded is based on a selection committee review of their authorship and financial needs. The student scholarships are very important for encouraging student participation and shaping the future of the field. Special attention will be paid to broadening the participation of students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented in Computer Science in general and in Machine Learning research in particular, and students from institutions with limited Machine Learning expertise who would benefit from the opportunity to interact with researchers from around the world.",
