 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract ? Award Number 1505098 \r\n\r\nLivingstone College is completing the implementation of an HBCU-UP Broadening Participation Research in STEM Education project to examine the impact of the Advancing Interest and Motivation (AIM) model on student career interests, motivation, self-efficacy, career outcome expectations, and employment outcomes in STEM.  The PIs also propose a supplemental study using structural equation modeling and path analysis to study self-regulation and its influences on STEM career interests and progression. AIM is designed for Livingstone College juniors and seniors from the biology, mathematics, and computer information systems departments in collaboration with the Office of Career Services and STEM faculty. The research framework is based on social cognitive career theory. The research design will incorporate pre- and post-tests of students? career development orientations using quantitative surveys to measure the effectiveness of the career development program. The PIs will also employ a path model to examine the theoretical relationships explicated by social cognitive career theory.\r\n\r\nThe project will inform STEM teaching and career development intervention strategies. The findings could contribute to the current body of information regarding phenomena associated with STEM majors that do not pursue STEM careers, an important aspect to understand in trying to increase the representation of minorities in the STEM workforce.  \r\n\r\nThe proposal was evaluated following the merit review process in accordance with procedures and criteria stated in the NSF Grant Proposal Guide. On March 25-26, 2013, a review panel of STEM education and research experts reviewed the proposal based on National Science Board approved criteria as well as specific criteria stated in the program solicitation (NSF 13-516).",
