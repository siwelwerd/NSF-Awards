 "awd_abstract_narration": "This doctoral dissertation research project will examine how human development and activities affect carnivore populations and their persistence at multiple scales by identifying movement corridors for tiger populations in a human-modified landscape.  The decline in the global tiger population, the world's most endangered wild cat species, affects nearly every nation.  Activities that affect tigers are the trade and consumption of tiger-based products, tiger poaching, illegal logging, consumption of agricultural products grown on land that was previously tiger habitat, negligent and corrupt law enforcement, and inadequate funding to support law enforcement.  The rate of development is increasing globally, thus increasing the rate of habitat deforestation and fragmentation. As wildlife is restricted to smaller habitat fragments movement corridors between these fragments need to be maintained in order to permit continued dispersal of animals, thereby enhancing the persistence of wildlife populations.  This project will provide new insights regarding how movement corridors can be identified that connect different subpopulations of a specific species, thereby facilitating exchanges of genes among the different subpopulations and help preserve the genetic vitality of the species.  The project will demonstrate the utility of using graph theory and connectivity analyses to ascertain the extent of habitat connectivity for a species.  Although this project will focus on habitat connectivity of tigers in Sumatra, project approaches and findings will be applicable to wildlife in other habitats, such as pronghorn antelope, Florida panther, and Eastern gray wolf.  The project will help to identify habitat corridors needed to maintain robust metapopulations of endangered species, thereby assisting land managers and others to develop effective strategies that can preserve species while helping advance economically beneficial land uses.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\nThe doctoral student will employ analytic tools from genetics, ecology, and geography to advance understanding of human development impacts on tiger populations by pairing genetic-relatedness data with landscape ecological data and modeling.  Tiger DNA that was non-invasively gathered by collecting tiger fecal samples throughout a Sumatran landscape will be identified.  Genetic material will be analyzed to determine whether tigers in seemingly unconnected protected areas can breed together, thus indicating whether tigers cross multiuse landscapes between protected areas. Landscape modeling will be used to identify potential wildlife corridors, which are then validated by genetics to determine whether tigers actually use these corridors for movement, and especially if they breed after movement.  The student will identify which human-modified areas tigers can traverse using data provided from satellite collars, further validating how tigers navigate multiuse landscapes and also identifying \"tiger-friendly\" areas.  She will identify predicted future tiger movement corridors using landscape change modeling to identify threatened corridors in need of protection to ensure tiger persistence into the future.",

Indonesia recently passed Brazil in having the world&rsquo;s highest deforestation rate, largely due to the rise of the palm oil industry. Indonesia has a broad diversity of plants and animals, including endangered species such as the Sumatran tiger. While Riau Province, Sumatra, produces approximately 20% of the world&rsquo;s palm oil, tigers still inhabit parts of Riau, though their habitat and prey are understudied. Thus, in this research, we aimed to assess how tiger habitat has changed, how it will continue to change in the future, and provide recommendations to improve the landscape for tigers. We created the first land cover maps of Riau that have been verified with field data, and then we predicted land cover change from 2016 &ndash; 2050. We predict that by 2050, over 60% of forest in Riau will be lost, and all protected areas only provide slight protection. In addition to finishing the land cover prediction portion of this project, we worked closely with Eijkman Institute of Molecular Biology to extract and analyze DNA from 390 felid scat samples. Due to the difficult nature of working with degraded DNA, we have so far been unable to use this species-specific data in combination with our land cover data to create more refined species-specific habitat maps. However, this is the first study to collect scats from multiple felid species simultaneously throughout Riau, and we look forward to conducting further analyses with this newly obtained data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Throughout the course of this research project, we trained and employed more than 30 interns and technicians on how to properly collect felid scat and to use a GPS unit to collect land cover data. Without these funds, this would not have been possible. In the future, there will be significantly more technicians who have now been trained in the rigorous field methods required to collect scat. In addition, we were able to work closely with several technicians for longer time periods to train them both in scat collection, land cover data collection and how to extract purify DNA from scat in the lab at the Eijkman Institute of Molecular Biology. These technicians show promise in continuing in conservation biology or geospatial sciences to potentially become leaders in Sumatran conservation. Paid conservation research opportunities are not common in Riau, Sumatra, thus we were able to provide experience that many of our technicians may not have been able to take part in otherwise. In addition to the wider team working on this project, we worked closely with several young Sumatran women who were interested in conservation biology &ndash; one in the molecular biology lab and one in field team leadership. We provided them with training and beginning leadership roles throughout this project. Conservation biology is still heavily male-dominated in Indonesia, so the professional development we provided these women during this project was one of our major successes.</p>\n<p>This grant provided funding for co-PI Erin Poor to complete her PhD. We look forward to presenting all of our results to the Indonesian government in November 2018 and we hope they will integrate our recommendations into their landscape management plans. Tiger recovery in Sumatra is a complex, multi-faceted problem. It cannot be solved with one research project, but will be solved slowly over time, by dedicated individuals who work on seemingly small day-to-day tasks. We believe this research project will further future tiger conservation by providing maps for targeted habitat protection, informing future scat sampling methods, and training many future conservation biologists. This NSF-funded project is a brick in the wall of stopping the decline in tiger populations. While tiger recovery in Riau will be difficult, with education, dedication, persistence and intelligent planning, tigers may be able to persist in this unique ecosystem in the long-term.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/17/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Erin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Poor</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1536323/1536323_10382078_1537220240397_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1536323/1536323_10382078_1537220240397_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1536323/1536323_10382078_1537220240397_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Location of study area, and focal study protected areas.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Erin Poor</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Erin&nbsp;E&nbsp;Poor</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure1.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1536323/1536323_10382078_1537220313490_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1536323/1536323_10382078_1537220313490_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1536323/1536323_10382078_1537220313490_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Land cover for the larger central Sumatra study area (dotted black line, top left) and focal protected areas, Tesso Nilo National Park, Kerumutan Wildlife Reserve, Bukit Tigapuluh National Park and Rimbang Baling Wildlife Reserve from 2002 ?
