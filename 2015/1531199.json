 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) is the nation's premier facility to accelerate nuclei with the purpose of studying nuclear structure.  NSCL has developed world-unique new experimental capabilities with reaccelerated rare-isotope beams, ensuring a continued leadership role in rare-isotope physics worldwide. With the recent expansion of research capabilities at NSCL, demand for these beams to be used in nuclear physics experiments has never been higher. The instrument proposed here, called a Helium-Jet Ion Gas System (HJ-IGS) will allow for commensal running of two experiments simultaneously, each using different detector systems at NSCL, which will expand the number of experiments and hence help to meet the demand for experiments that increase our understanding of nuclei.\r\n\r\nHelium-Jet Ion Sources have been used for harvesting isotopes in the past, but the idea to use such a system to harvest some of the rarest isotopes available to researchers in a projectile fragmentation facility is novel. Rare isotopes that are bent out of the central beam path during the purification process of the primary rare-isotope beam are stopped and collected in a high-pressure cell filled with Helium saturated with aerosols to which the stopped isotopes will attach. With a high-pressure differential, the collected isotopes are quickly transported through a 40 meter-long capillary to an ion source that injects the isotopes, after purification, into a beam line that can feed one of several stations not used in the primary experiment. This allows two experiments to be performed at the same time: an experiment using a fast rare isotope beam directly produced in projectile fragmentation and an experiment with stopped or reaccelerated beams using the harvested, transported, ionized and purified isotopes in the HJ-IGS. State-of-the-art experiments that are in high demand in the fields of nuclear structure and nuclear astrophysics, as well as fundamental interactions and symmetries, and include such diverse techniques as high-precision mass measurements in atom traps, in-beam laser spectroscopy and polarization, nuclear decay spectroscopy, and low-energy reaction studies with an active-target time projection chamber.",

The production of rare isotopes, especially the ones that decay to more stable isotopes quickly, is difficult and costly. At the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU), rare isotopes are produced by impinging an intense beam of stable isotopes travelling at ~40% of the speed of light on a production target. A wide variety of rare isotopes are then produced through fragmentation of the incoming stable isotopes. By using a fragment separator for selecting rare isotopes of interest for a particular study, a beam of these isotopes is delivered to one of several experimental end stations.

Therefore, the cell can be inserted to stop the isotopes for the second experiment without disturbing those for the first experiment. Gas is continuously circulated through the cell and the gas is also saturated with aerosols. The rare isotopes stopped in the cell attach to the aerosols and are transported over a distance of about 70 feet through a thin tube.
