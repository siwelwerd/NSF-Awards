 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the supervision of Dr. Emily Jones (PI), William T. Taylor (co-PI) will analyze skeletal remains of ancient horses to shed light on the origins of horse herding and riding in eastern Eurasia. The use of the domestic horse for food and transport has been linked with major social, political, and economic changes to human societies, but its origins in prehistory are poorly understood. This project will address these questions through demographic study to identify ancient herding practices, morphological analyses to establish evidence for horseback riding and/or driving, and radiocarbon dating. This research will improve  understanding of the links between domestic horse use, ecology, and human behavior.  In addition, the project will fund the completion of Mr. Taylor's dissertation at the University of New Mexico, and will lead to the creation of an open-access 3D database of ancient horse remains to preserve these data for research and education. The work will be shared with the international community through talks and peer-reviewed manuscripts in both Mongolian and English. \r\n\r\nMr. Taylor's research will test predictions that horse-riding, herding societies developed in response to new ecological opportunities during the 2nd millennium BCE, centuries earlier than some existing models for East Asia suggest. By comparing ancient horses and modern specimens with known histories, the co-PI will characterize the impacts of bridling and riding on the equine skull, and using a 3D scanner, develop quantitative techniques for identifying horse transport in archaeological contexts. By estimating the age and sex of horse specimens buried at late Bronze Age stone monuments in Mongolia, Mr. Taylor will evaluate the possibility of ancient horse herding between 1300 and 700 BCE. With the aid of a portable 3D scanner, he will analyze these archaeological specimens for pathological changes, and use these data to assess the hypothesis that the horses were ridden or used to pull chariots.  Finally, using new and published radiocarbon dates, Mr. Taylor will produce a chronological model to link changes in ancient Mongolian horse use with key environmental and cultural developments in Eurasia. These complementary studies will help to develop explanatory models for the origins and spread of horse herding and riding, which can be applied to modern and ancient societies around the globe.",

Project results were shared with the general public through five peer-reviewed manuscripts (three in press, two in review at the time of report submission), three public lectures (including one TEDx talk in Mongolian language), several university lectures for Mongolian students at the National University of Mongolia, and three widely circulated online blogs (<em>National Geographic </em>and <em>The Guardian</em>). The dissertation produced a large body of 3D archaeological data from fragile skeletal specimens, which will be made publicly available and provide an invaluable resource for the purposes of research, education, and cultural heritage preservation (Figure 1). Project participants repackaged the entire archaeological horse collection at the National Museum of Mongolia, storing each fragile specimen in non-reactive foam packaging with clear English and Mongolian labeling, making this previously disorganized and inaccessible dataset available to other researchers from a variety of scientific disciplines (Figure 2). In cooperation with the American Center for Mongolia Studies, the co-PI trained ten Mongolian staff members in a ten-week intensive course on the use of English for Research and International Engagement, helping to build capacity for Mongolian cultural heritage workers and connect Mongolian scholars with the international public (Figure 3). Results of the project were incorporated in an exhibit at the National Museum of Mongolia from August-September 2015, entitled &ldquo;Mongolia&rsquo;s Horse Culture Heritage&rdquo; (Figure 4). In partnership with the U.S. Embassy in Mongolia, the co-PI produced an education video and interactive tablet exhibit. These exhibits help to share project results with the younger generation, encouraging youth to protect their cultural heritage, as well as understand the value of archaeological materials for scientific inquiry. &nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/28/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: William&nbsp;Taylor</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1522024/1522024_10353599_1482943294802_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1522024/1522024_10353599_1482943294802_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1522024/1522024_10353599_1482943294802_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">3D model of archaeological horse skull from Deer Stone-Khirigsuur complex, produced through this project</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">William Taylor</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">William&nbsp;Taylor</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1522024/1522024_10353599_1482943371228_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1522024/1522024_10353599_1482943371228_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1522024/1522024_10353599_1482943371228_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Repackaged and relableled archaeological horse collections at the National Museum of Mongolia</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">William Taylor</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">William&nbsp;Taylor</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1522024/1522024_10353599_1482943501786_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1522024/1522024_10353599_1482943501786_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1522024/1522024_10353599_1482943501786_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The co-PI instructing museum professionals as part of 10-week training course in \"English Language for Research and International Engagement\"</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Julia Clark</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">William&nbsp;Taylor</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1522024/1522024_10353599_1482943665467_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1522024/1522024_10353599_1482943665467_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1522024/1522024_10353599_1482943665467_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The co-PI with museum exhibit panel discussing project results, incorporated into \"Mongolia's Horse Culture Heritage\" at the National Museum of Mongolia, Summer/Fall 2015</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">J.
