 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to increase resilience to wildfire hazards by modeling and mapping community and ecosystem service vulnerability to wildfire. The hazards of wildfire have increased significantly over time as a function of communities expanding into more rural areas adjacent to the urban interface and the increasing prevalence of conditions for large and rapid wildfire growth. Both initial wildfire events and the post-fire floods and landslides that often follow them are considerable threats to the growing population in fire-prone environments, the infrastructure associated with that populace, and the ecosystem services it relies upon, such as clean water or an economic base such as timber or tourism. However, the manner in which other environmental factors, such as drought and bark beetle outbreaks in forests, contribute to wildfire spread and the potential for post-fire flooding is poorly understood and not currently modeled in an integrated way that supports policy development and community adaptation planning. This project focuses on the Pacific Northwest region to develop a fire component to the existing BioEarth model that will improve our understanding of factors that contribute to wildfires becoming disasters, and prioritizes stakeholder and involvement and public engagement to identify management actions that will increase adaptive capacity and overcome social and political barriers.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough periodic wildfires are important for a healthy ecosystem, a combination of biophysical and socioeconomic factors can turn a fire into a disaster, with negative impacts in socioecological contexts. These impacts can last for decades, and can include increased vulnerability to subsequent, cascading hazards such as flooding, landslides, and the potential for local to regional economic collapse. Increasing community resilience to these compounding, wildfire-related disasters requires specific attention to social, economic, political, and environmental dynamics at spatial scales ranging from local to national and at temporal scales ranging from minutes to multiple decades. There is a growing understanding of isolated interactions between fire, climate, ecosystem structure and function, forest management activities, and their impacts at multiple scales. The complex and dynamic coupling of these interactions into an integrated human-natural systems model that includes links to policy, resource management, and adaptive capacity, however, is poorly understood. This lack of synthesis limits wildfire resilience in the context of a changing global environment. The overarching goal of this project is to support policy and other decision-making processes at local, regional, and national scales to reduce the risk of wildfire becoming a disaster and increase community and ecological adaptive capacities. This will be done by 1) advancing the understanding of wildfire risk and associated impacts in the context of interactions between regional climate and other forest ecosystem perturbations (e.g., drought in future climates, insect outbreak, and a history of fire management) through new developments in integrated environmental modeling, 2) improving the ability to assess and predict vulnerability and resilience to wildfire using a scalable regional approach, and 3) coordinating with a stakeholder advisory group to develop a decision support system for providing spatially-explicit feasible actions to increase local, regional, and national wildfire resilience.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Recent fire seasons in the western United States have demonstrated the risks that wildfires pose not only to rural communities, but also to large towns and city suburbs. Several recent wildfires have caused disasters including the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise (California), the 2020 Babb Road Fire that destroyed Malden (Washington State), and the 2021-2022 Marshall Fire that destroyed more than a 1000 homes in Louisville and Superior (Colorado). The impact of these wildfire disasters is felt not only in evacuations and loss of homes and businesses, but in the tragic loss of human lives. In 2017, the California fire season led to 43 deaths and an estimated $10 billion in damages. However, the impacts of these wildfires are also felt long after the flames stop. These ?cascading consequences? include chronic health conditions due to poor air quality and the buildup of eroded sediment in rivers and reservoirs that impact water quality and increase slope instability and erosion. The future predictions in this region are for even longer fire seasons with more extreme fires and potentially more cascading consequences and disasters on communities. This project sought to help western United States communities better prepare for future wildfires through three broad goals: (1) improving the ability to model and map wildfire risk and impacts on ecosystems, (2) improving our understanding of the different ways to achieve fire adapted communities that can co-exist with fire, and (3) improving our understanding of what pre-emptive actions can be taken to improve the ability of communities and ecosystems to recover from the impacts of wildfires.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project team worked with representatives from small towns and large metropolitan cities. The selection of each site started with face-to-face meetings followed by a workshop where project researchers met with local leaders and key decision makers from each community. This allowed key relationships to be established early, simplifying the gathering of relevant data, and enabling continued feedback. The locations included Ketchum Idaho, the Cedar River Watershed near Seattle, and the Portland Water Bureau Bull Run Watershed. Additional communities across California, Washington State, Idaho, and Montana also benefited from the project. One tool advanced by the project team allowed municipal planners in Seattle and Portland to assess how different methods to manage fire affected lands also impacted drinking water supply systems. The project team also helped improve knowledge of how to achieve fire adapted communities. We showed how different communities evolve their views of wildfire risk and the different ways that communities respond to wildfires. One of the major outcomes of the project was informing a range of city planners on planning evacuation routes. We presented a ?blueprint? from which diverse communities can identify the steps they need to take to create a fire adapted community. We also presented a series of engineering and urban planning ideas on how communities can reduce risks of future fires and better co-exist with fires that occur, such as building subterranean shelters and burying power lines. The team also improved knowledge of how climate change, fire spread, and the impacts on forests from insects and fires were described within decision support tools. As part of this, the team started a new research area bridging the disciplines of plant physiology and fire behavior that we called pyroecophysiology. This research area explores how known amounts of heat from fire impacts tree growth and death. The team looked at 5 tree species important to the northwestern United States timber industry. As forest managers regularly use planned fires to reduce the future impact of uncontrollable wildfires, this information is useful as it tells them how much fire they can use without killing key timber species and allows them to get improved estimates of costs associated with salvage logging and replanting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of our research included over 100 publications and completing the education of over 20 master?s students and 7 doctoral students. The team also organized a workshop that brought together several international fire scientists. An outcome of this workshop was the recognition that a barrier to learning from past extreme wildfires was that there was no place to publish data about these fires. Workshop participants also observed that most journals wouldn?t publish papers about methods, models, or data. To address these needs, this workshop directly led to a new international science journal, called Fire. Although Fire only started in 2018, the journal has already been recognized as being in the top 20 percent of all internationally respected forestry journals. A key outcome of the project team via the journal Fire has been to improve recognition of women and other diverse leaders in fire science. In 2021, Fire became one of only a few scientific journals to require authors to demonstrate that they have permission from indigenous communities prior to publishing data derived from their land.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/05/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Alistair&nbsp;M&nbsp;Smith</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1520873/1520873_10380491_1641420108533_FireEarth_RegrowthSimulator--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1520873/1520873_10380491_1641420108533_FireEarth_RegrowthSimulator--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Incorporating ecosystem processes within scientific visualizations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1520873/1520873_10380491_1641420108533_FireEarth_RegrowthSimulator--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Incorporating ecosystem processes within scientific visualizations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Representing fire and ecosystem recovery under different management scenarios at the FireEarth field site near Ketchum Idaho.
