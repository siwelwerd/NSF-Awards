The workshop will consist of a two-day mini-course for graduate students and junior researchers, followed by a three day lecture series. The goal of the William Rowan Hamilton Geometry and Topology Workshop is to investigate  common themes and techniques in current research in geometry and topology and to support junior researchers interested in these areas.  This workshop will bring together leading researchers in the fields of three and four dimensional spaces with graduates students and junior researchers to investigate  questions at the forefront of research in these areas. The confluence of expertise from different areas will result in new collaborative projects, and in broadening the research horizons of the participants\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this year's workshop is to investigate common themes and techniques in the research of three and four-dimensional spaces. The two-day mini course will be on bridging classical three- and four-manifold theory given by Martin Scharlemann (Santa Barbara) and David Gay (Georgia). Major topics of this year's workshop include recent work related to the Schoenflies conjecture, the 4-dimensional smooth Poincare conjecture, and \"trisections\" of 4-manifolds.  \r\n \r\nThe workshop website will be located at http://www.hamilton.tcd.ie/events/gt/gt2015.htm",
