 "awd_abstract_narration": "Holistic chemical analysis of heterogeneous solid samples in complex matrixes such as aerosols, soils and sediments is very desirable in research and industry applications but difficult due to the limited available separation technology. Currently, academic researchers analyze their heterogeneous mixture of solids using sophisticated methods such as the solid state NMR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) to identify the forms of the Carbon (C), Nitrogen (N) and Sulfur (S) compounds. Those sophisticated methods are costly and not available to most researchers. Most researchers would settle their analytical needs by analyzing their sample with an elemental analyzer, which provides only the bulk C, N and S concentrations and little information about the chemical nature of the compounds. This team has developed the Multi-Element Scanning Thermal Analysis (MESTA) technology to solve this problem and successfully applied it to the direct analysis of aerosols with sensitivity, precision and accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe proposed technology, MESTA can characterize the thermochemical properties of compounds, in terms of their quantitative C, N, S and H thermograms, in a wide range of samples with no or little requirement of pretreatment. This relatively simple and novel technology fills a significant gap in the holistic (non-partial) chemical analysis of heterogeneous samples that are often encountered in industrial and academic research applications. For example, MESTA can quickly and cost-effectively determine the quantity and quality of petroleum end products from a crude oil sample and assess their polluting impurities to the environment (contents and forms of S and N compounds) in each product. MESTA can simplify the analysis of many solid environmental samples necessary for academic research of geo, soil and environmental sciences. It can do routine analysis of industrial samples for quality control and assurance. It is valuable in foods and food products quality control and inspection, in homeland security substance identification and characterization.",

MESTA has been successfully applied to the study of aerosols, sediments, biomass and many other environmental samples and proved to be a quick, sensitive, reproducible and cost-effective analytical tool. In this project, we tested the commercial potential of the MESTA. After attending the May 2015 Atlanta I-CORPS workshop and over 100 interviews of the clients, we realize that MESTA may have a great commercial potential in crude oil analysis because it can provide much faster and convenient services to the petroleum industry. We further pursuit collaboration with the SGS Crude Oil Analysis Laboratories to verify the MESTA technology in crude analysis applications. The results of the collaboration are quite promising (Figures 1, 2 and 3). They showed that</p>\n<ol>\n<li>MESTA can obtain similar information of the traditional crude distillation analysis and its following sulfur and nitrogen analyses in each distillation fractions in one shot. The duration of the MESTA procedure is less than one hour whereas that of the traditional procedure is 3-5 days. The cost of the MESTA procedure is less than a few hundred dollars whereas that of the traditional procedure is $5,000 - $8,000. The time and cost savings of the MESTA technology are obviously attractive to the petroleum industry. </li>\n<li>The commercial value of crude oil analysis is huge, estimated by us about $1 billion annually in the US alone. We realized, however, that it is difficult to break into the current market, which is occupied by four major analytical companies. Our current strategy is to collaborate with a major crude oil analytical laboratories (SGS) for a prove-of-concept project. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>After a brief collaboration with the SGS Laboratories, SGS showed great interests in the MESTA technology. We are in the steps of forming a company to forward this development.</p>\n<p>Our final presentation in the May 2015 Atlanta Workshop won the recognition of the instructors and mentors as they place us in the first place among the 21 teams participated (Figure 4).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/31/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Yuch-Ping&nbsp;Hsieh</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1530573/1530573_10358170_1472086384432_Figure-1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1530573/1530573_10358170_1472086384432_Figure-1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"C,N,S of Crude Oil DP15\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1530573/1530573_10358170_1472086384432_Figure-1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"C,N,S of Crude Oil DP15\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
