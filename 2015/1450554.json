 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the initial development of the US hub of Future Earth Secretariat. Future Earth seeks to harness the insights and capacity of the global scientific community, development professions, and stakeholders to address global scale problems. The Future Earth effort is based on the recognition that modern environmental problems cannot be solved by disciplinary science alone and rather requires the coordinated efforts of many disciplines working with stakeholders to meet today's societal challenges and to catalyze a transition to global sustainability. Future Earth seeks to advance a new way of doing science by directly emphasizing the co-design and co-production of knowledge with those who most need scientific information to make effective decisions to help manage a changing environment. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost the Future Earth Secretariat will serve the needs of stakeholders and scientists around the world.  The Future Earth program is organized around three major themes: Dynamic Planet; Global Development; and Transformations toward Sustainability. Under the auspices of these three themes, the Secretariat will support workshops and other efforts to foster the co-design of research to enhance transdisciplinary efforts to inform solutions and decision making. The secretariat will also develop programs and initiatives to educate the next generation of inter-disciplinary professionals on how to integrate global sustainability with human prosperity and will actively engage the public through an extensive communication and outreach effort.",

The challenges that Future Earth was established to tackle - from changing resource and land use, to urbanization and climate change, are global in scope, but regionally variable in both social and environmental dimensions. To address these challenges, the Future Earth secretariat was established by 5 countries, with a mandate to create a global network of national, regional, and global support structures for global change research. \n \nThis NSF award, titled \"Collaborative Research: Development of the U.S. Hub of the Future Earth Secretariat\" (NSF ID 1450554), covered the development period of the U.S. Hub of Future Earth, allowing the US to join with Canada, Sweden, France and Japan to jointly establish the distributed secretariat for Future Earth.\nIn the past 3 years, Future Earth has established national structures in over 20 countries, and regional partners, hubs and centers in Uruguay, Cyprus, Egypt, India, and Japan, with a southern Africa Regional Center opening in South Africa in the summer of 2018.  We have established 5 primary functions for the distributed secretariat, including Research Enabling (Led by the US Hub), Capacity Building (Led by the US Hub), Communications (Led by the Swedish and US  Hubs), Synthesis and Foresight ( Led by the Canadian and French Hubs), and Coordination (Led by the Canadian and Swedish Hubs).  As a part of these functions, the Future Earth secretariat  has provided support for 20 different core research projects associated with the previous Global Change Programs (IGBP, Diversitas and  IHDP), and worked with the communities associated with these projects to develop and incubate a set of Knowledge Action Networks serving to integrate researchers, practitioners and end-users around a core challenge (e.g. sustainable urbanization, ocean sustainability, and human and environmental health) and to align research production with knowledge needs of communities, nations, regions, and major international conventions such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals, UNFCCC, CBD, UNCCD, and Habitat III.\n\nThe Colorado Hub of Future Earth has made major contributions in Research Enabling, Capacity Building, Communications, and Coordination.
