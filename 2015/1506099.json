 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many natural phenomena geometric patterns arise that cannot be described by classical mathematical tools. Often these patterns have a self-similar or fractal nature. Examples include snowflakes and crystals, urban and plant growth, mountain ranges and coastlines, lightning bolts, or river networks.  This project intends to contribute to the development of analytic methods  that are useful  for the investigation of such geometric features  and their deeper understanding. The PI will involve his PhD students and other young researchers in this activity. This  will contribute to increasing  the  expertise in this area  and will help to maintain a scientific community that provides the necessary mathematical knowledge  for  progress in science and engineering. \r\n\r\nIn mathematics fractal or non-smooth spaces often arise from  dynamical systems as  limit sets of Kleinian groups or as Julia sets of rational maps. In this project the analysis and geometry of such  spaces will be explored  and new mathematical tools for their investigation be created. Specifically, the PI  intends  to study the relation between certain Sobolev-type functions  on  fairly general metric spaces and corresponding functions  on their hyperbolic fillings. In the second part of the project  this  will be applied to a relevant model case where such non-smooth spaces appear, namely the dynamics of Thurston maps.",
