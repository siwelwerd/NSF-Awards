 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\nA goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the body of knowledge about the importance and conduct of undergraduate and graduate research experiences in recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals. The connection of faculty to research and thereby the students to culturally and geographically relevant research is an important step in retaining students who are more likely to continue their studies and pursue advanced degrees. For those students entering the workforce directly from a tribal college it is equally important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce. \r\n\r\nLeech Lake Tribal College (LLTC) and University of Minnesota Duluth (UMD) will collaborate to develop an earth systems science major at the tribal college, establish an educational continuum that will permit LLTC students to earn a BS in tribal resource management from UMD, and develop an ecosystem network and research agenda between the two institutions that will result in workforce opportunities for LLTC students, as well as greater community engagement in ecological issues that impact the reservation.",
