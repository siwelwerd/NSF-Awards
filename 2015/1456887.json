 "awd_abstract_narration": "Future wireless networks, as represented by the 5G concept and associated set of future standards, are expected to meet a diverse range of new requirements, leverage technological and regulatory advancements, and overcome the spectrum scarcity challenges. However, the success of a new technology is not only determined by its technical strengths but also by an intricate interplay between the economic considerations of the consumers/users, competing service and content providers, and governing/regulating public agencies. This project explores new wireless spectrum and content sharing concepts from both technological and business perspectives for future 5G networks. The overall objective of this project is to investigate and develop fundamental technological and business aspects of new spectrum/content sharing for 5G networks, that potentially could lead to significant technical performance improvements as well as revolutionize future wireless markets and operators business. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of the research can be described around its four research thrusts: (i) new, potentially transformative, business models for future 5G markets, and in particular new business models for mobile operators, (ii) in-network dynamic spectrum and content sharing and pricing mechanisms under various possible future architectures that take into account the new business models and bridge the gap between technological and economic considerations, (iii) collaborative content distribution that could lead to win-win relationships for wireless stakeholders, and (iv) intelligent content caching for improved performance for different network and business scenarios. A unique aspect  of the research plan is that it stresses business and economic implications of various architectural choices, with formal models that capture technology performance as well as business/economic considerations. The research leverages the complementary expertise of the investigators to build a cohesive multi-disciplinary international team between the five PIs in the three institutions. It also leverages significant contacts with industry and start-ups to guide the research directions of the project as well as influence future technologies and markets.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this project include (1) the development of course projects that prepare students to understand the market/economic aspects of networking and the future architectural choices regarding content and spectrum sharing, (2) the development of a tutorial on this subject to be offered at summer schools and conferences, (3) K-12 outreach, (4) enhancement of student diversity and increase of number of women and under-represented groups in engineering, (5) technology transfer through collaboration with industry, and (6) development of dual-degree PhD programs.",
