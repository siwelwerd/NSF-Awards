 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hurricanes, through their strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges, cause much damage and loss of life worldwide. Recent disasters (e.g., Typhoon Haiyan in 2013; Hurricanes Sandy in 2012, Irene in 2011 and Katrina in 2005) underscore the significant vulnerability of the U.S. and the world to land-falling hurricanes. The impacts of these storms may worsen in coming decades because of rapid coastal development coupled with possibly increasing hurricane activity and sea level rise. This project is developing a new framework for assessing and managing hurricane risk based on fundamental physics. The framework will be applicable to all hurricane-afflicted coastal areas. We are carrying out case studies for the coastal areas in New York, New Jersey, North Carolina and Florida to assess and compare hurricane hazards in these areas, estimate how these hazards may evolve in the future, and develop engineering and policy strategies for coping with these hazards. This research involves several disciplines, including geosciences, engineering and architecture, and social, behavioral and economic sciences, and is helping to prepare next-generation of specialists in the fields of natural hazards. The results from this research will support the rebuilding and increased resiliency of coastal areas in the U.S. and around the world.  \r\n\r\nPhysics-based hurricane risk assessment is challenging, due to multi-scale features of the phenomena. This research is advancing hurricane and climate science, with the objective of fundamentally enhancing hurricane risk analysis. We are developing two independent hurricane climatology models to investigate how hurricane frequency, intensity, and size will evolve in a changing climate. We are applying observational analysis and numerical modeling to study hurricane wind, surge, and rainfall hazards, including their spatial and temporal structures, their interaction, and effects of the coast, land, extratropical transition, and changing climate. We are developing physics-based, observationally-evaluated, and computationally-efficient hazard models to assess joint hazard probabilities under various climate scenarios; we are also creating a multi-hazard model of wind and water vulnerability describing the compound impacts of hurricane hazards. Combining the improved estimation of the joint hazards and vulnerability, risk assessment can then be carried out to support advanced risk management from various perspectives. The risk management component of this project is focusing on the policies of the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program and engineering designs for coastal flood mitigation. These instruments are critical in mitigating hurricane risk and increasing coastal resiliency, and this project will develop them in the new context of changing climate.",

However, the increase in landfall intensity for the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf Coasts may be significantly smaller than the increase in the basin-wide intensity. 2) It investigated TC wind, surge, and rainfall hazards through observational and numerical analyses, revealing their spatial and temporal structures and interactions as well as effects of coast, land, extratropical transition (ET), and climate change. For example, analyses on TC rainfall showed that the striking increase of the frequency of ET storms is a key element of increased rainfall for the northeast U.S. under global warming, the increase of TC intensity and environmental water vapor together explain the TC rainfall rate increase, and urbanization has significantly contributed to Hurricane Harvey (2017) like extreme flood events. 3) It created a physics-based methodology to assess TC multi-hazard probabilities.

It also developed a coupled physical modeling framework to quantify compound flooding from storm surge and heavy rainfall during TC landfalls. 4) It investigated TC damage and impact and quantified vulnerability and risk. Damage surveys were performed after Hurricane Sandy (2012) and Irma (2017), which supported the development of vulnerability models relating house and community-level performances to surge and wave hazards. The spatial heterogeneities of TC flood risk along the U.S. Atlantic and Gulf coasts under the current and future climates were evaluated, and a flood damage allowance framework was created for calculating the flood protection levels needed to ensure that a given level of financial risk is maintained while accounting for deep uncertainties such as Antarctic ice sheet contributions to SLR.&nbsp;5) It developed new implementation policies for the U.S. National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), including a strategy to replace NFIP&rsquo;s grandfathering policy with risk-based premiums coupled with a means-tested voucher program to address affordability and cost-effective risk mitigation measures to improve resilience as well as a holistic approach to assessing community resilience in connection with the NFIP&rsquo;s Community Rating System (CRS). 6) It proposed a public infrastructure system at the watershed scale that combines coastal flood risk management with investment in ecological health and opportunities for public recreation.
