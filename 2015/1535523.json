 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant to Oak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) will provide travel funds for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in computer science to attend the Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) in 2015. The HFL brings together Laureates of the most prestigious awards in computer science and mathematics to spend a week interacting with 200 early career researchers. In addition to the scientific exchanges with the Laureates and each other, participants at the Forum gain a valuable global perspective on computer and mathematical sciences?early career researchers represented 47 countries at the 2014 Forum. Modeled on the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, the HLF provides graduate students and postdoctoral researchers with extraordinary access to a group of scientific role models through lectures, small group discussions, and casual conversations. Such experiences can have a profound impact on the development of an early career researcher. \r\n \r\nOak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) will recruit a highly qualified and diverse applicant pool for the Forum. There are many exceptionally promising early career researchers who have little or no opportunity to interact with the Laureates of the major prizes in the computer and mathematical sciences. The HLF is a unique opportunity for these individuals, one that can energize and steer future research. The recruitment and selection of participants will emphasize the potential benefits of the opportunity for the researchers, as well as the overall goal of ensuring a broadly inclusive group of participants. ORAU will provide logistical support both prior to and during the forum and also continue to perform an assessment of participant experiences to document the impact of the Forum.",
