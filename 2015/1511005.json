However, in spite of a large number of zeolitic imidazolate framework materials, only a few of these materials have been made into membranes. These membranes still do not offer the desired pore size for separation of some industrially important gas mixtures, such as ethylene and ethane.  This project will investigate synthesis of metal-organic framework membranes with gated-micropores of tailorable pore size by a new membrane surface modification method for separation of industrially important gas mixtures.  \r\n\r\nResearch will be conducted in this project to understand the post-synthesis modification of microporous metal-organic framework membranes by the membrane surface modification method, and to synthesize and characterize the modified metal-organic framework membranes for separations of small gas mixtures including that of ethylene/ethane. These studies will demonstrate a new membrane structure for gas separation and establish the foundation for the new post-synthesis modification method for synthesis of other microporous metal-organic framework membranes for separation of gas and liquid mixtures.  Successful synthesis of these microporous membranes will represent an important advance in membrane science because this will lead to the development of many other high performance membranes for separation of gas and liquid mixtures of a close molecular size. The project will also educate and train graduate, undergraduate and high school students, in particular, female and minority students, to become leaders in membrane science and separation technologies.",

High-quality  ZIF-8 membranes with better separation characteristics can be more reproducibly synthesize on mesorporous &gamma;-alumina modified &alpha;-alumina supports. ZIF-8 crystals and membranes are stable below 50oC, but  unstable at temperatures above 150oC due to carbonation reaction.  Membrane surface ligand exchange modification of ZIF-8 membrane with a bulkier ligand results in exchange of less than 2% of the smaller organic linker in ZIF-8 structure with the bulker ligand near the membrane surface.   This leads to a significant improvement in separation factor for the small hydrocarbon gas mixture (such as propylene/propane) with minimum or no decrease in the permeance of the selectively-permeating gas.  The work has gained better insight into synthesis and properties of ZIF-8 membranes and led to discovery of a new post-modification method for synthesis of high-performance ZIF-8 membranes for propylene/propane separation.\n\nThe membranes studied in this project offer several potential industrial applications, including separation of hydrogen from hydrocarbon components and propylene/propane separations.
