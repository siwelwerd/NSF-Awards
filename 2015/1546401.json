The main foci of the 2015 event are the following: the Elliott classification program for C*-algebras; Popa's deformation/rigidity program; subfactor theory; C*-algebras and dynamical systems. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
