 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines traditional methods of processing and preserving Arctic subsistence food products through the means of aging and fermentation.  In collaboration with resident experts of the Bering Strait region, the project team will conduct ethnographic fieldwork and develop a systemic framework for understanding the role of fermentation in Arctic societies and the multiple factors that affect the methods and processes of fermentation. Among those factors are interactions of the built environment and physical geography, household dynamics, and generational perspectives on diet and health. \r\n \r\nThe intellectual merit of the project involves utilizing the novel approach of exploring fermentation as a domain of local ecological knowledge. The project will advance research on the relationships between Arctic food preparation practices, public health, housing, and social/environmental conditions. This study will contribute to the momentum of the emergent interest in infrastructure within Arctic scholarship and across several fields of engineering and science. Broader impacts include student training and public outreach, and insights that may inform the development of architectural designs, construction materials, and community planning that function in greater cohesion with the cultural needs of the Arctic societies.",

Bringing together a diverse set of expertise in anthropology, marine biology, humanities, Indigenous scholarship, and coastal marine ecosystem studies, our research team, based at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, has developed this project at the request of the Chukchi, Yupik, and Inupiaq culture bearers, community-based educators, leaders, and active youth, interested in a co-production and exchange of knowledge that speaks to their region?s foodways, food security, and cuisines. The predominant research focus has been the methods of aging and fermentation used to prepare and preserve the products coming from the locally harvested plants, animals, fungi, and fish. We aimed to investigate the processes, technologies and infrastructure, social-cultural practices, human-environmental interactions, and adaptation to both social and environmental change as they connect to aging and fermentation ? a core component in the foodways of the maritime hunter and reindeer herder societies.

Recognized as biocultural processes, which through a timed exposure to a right set of conditions in an environment identified or created to serve the preparer?s aim, aging and fermentation are appreciated for their capacity to transform the sensory and physical properties of a substance to become food and material culture items, valued for the sensory, aesthetic, nutritional, and utilitarian qualities that fulfill one?s personal, cultural, and community needs. Thanks to this capacity, aging and fermentation link people and place through the interaction of local climate, terrain, built environment, cultural expression, and social-economic values that inform the cultural measures of food security, community vitality, and adoptive strength.
