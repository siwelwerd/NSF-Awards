 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to South Dakota State University to purchase an Illumina NextSeq500 nucleic acid sequencer and ancillary equipment to support research in the Life Sciences. The purchase of this instrumentation will contribute to the development of learning and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at SDSU as well as researchers in the State of South Dakota and the region. In addition the instrumentation will allow introducing the technology and its applications to students (7th-12th grade) participating in the Annual Eastern South Dakota Science Fair.\r\n\r\nThe purchase of this equipment will advance research projects in both plant and animal sciences and in cell biology. The sequencer will allow plant scientists to answer fundamental questions in plant development; how plants adapt to and interact within their environment.  Genetic scientists will make gains in food crops to ensure a safe, secure food supply.  Animal scientists will improve the nutrition of animals that are raised as food sources.  Cell biologists will apply the technology to study the basic mechanisms of all living things on a cellular level, laying a foundation of knowledge for scientist worldwide.   This knowledge gained with the use of this new equipment will lead to scientific advancements in health, nutrition and disease prevention in plants, animals and humans.",
