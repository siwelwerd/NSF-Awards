 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how melts are generated and focused across hundreds of kilometers through the upper mantle to the narrow mid-ocean ridge (MOR) axis is fundamental to understanding how Earth's ocean crust is formed and how elements and heat are exchanged between the interior of our planet and its surface. Significant advancements have been made in the use of computer models to investigate mantle melting and melt transport. However, the lack of complementary geophysical and geochemical data from the same area is a critical information gap that needs to be filled before progress can be made in refining present models. This research entails a multidisciplinary geophysical and geochemical program to map, sample, and analyze samples from the 8\u00b020'N Seamount Chain that extends 200 km westward from the East Pacific Rise Siqueiros ridge-transform intersection  in the Pacific Ocean.  Seamounts provide a unique opportunity to test hypotheses of melt distribution and source variation that occur away from spreading centers.  Melts that build these seamounts provide geochemical windows into the upper mantle. \r\n\r\nThe research includes an oceanographic cruise to map and sample the targeted region. This will be followed by geophysical data processing and petrographic, petrologic, and geochemical analyses of samples collected by both using ALVIN, a manned deep submersible, and dredging.  Goals of the research are to develop new, integrated models for upper lithosphere structure, deformation, and melt distribution at a fast-spreading center and investigate the dynamics of off-axis melting. The approach is interdisciplinary and includes analysis of geophysical and geochemical data and geodynamic modeling. Rock samples will be analyzed for all major and trace elements and radiogenic isotopes of Nd, Sr, and Pb will also be analyzed. Broader impacts of the project include creation of a marine geology curricular unit targeted at the middle school level and compliant with Next Generation Sciences Standards that have currently been adopted by 45 states. The project involves working closely with teachers and administrators of Pipkin Middle School, a nationally ranked Title I school that serves 580 students in the low-income center-city of Springfield, MO (poverty index of 78%). The teachers will work closely with the reserachers and both parties will jointly create the educational materials. Emphasis will be placed on inquiry learning and connecting fundamental science processes with current research. The pilot implementation will coincide with the proposed field program. The developed unit will be made broadly available via the web on curricular resource sites.",

The goal of this study is to provide constraints for melt generation and migration in the mantle adjacent to the well-studied East Pacific Rise (EPR). In November 2016 and December 2018, the OASIS Science Team mapped over 7000 km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;of seafloor, collecting 50-m resolution multibeam, magnetics data, and gravity data. Multibeam data were used to guide sampling and near-bottom data collection for 19 human-manned submarine dives using the&nbsp;<em>HOV Alvin</em>, 19 dredges to collect samples, and 16 dives using the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle&nbsp;<em>AUV Sentry</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>Shipboard geophysical data (gravity, magnetic, and bathymetric), ground truthing and sample collection with the HOV Alvin, and detailed mapping from the AUV Sentry were combined to investigate when the seamounts were emplaced and how they evolved (Figure 1).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Observations from HOV Alvin indicate significant hydrothermal activity along the 8 20'N Chain (Figure 2). Wayne seamount, located 150km from the East Pacific Rise volcanic mid-ocean ridge, has extensive hydrothermal deposits that were viewed along wide swaths of the Alvin dive, AL4849. Lava outcrops were predominantly pillows with thick manganese rinds. At the base of Hook ridge, 35 km from the EPR ridge axis, tube worm casings,&nbsp;<em>Tevnia jerichonana</em>, were discovered.&nbsp;<em>Tevnia jerichonana</em>&nbsp;are thought to be first colonizers based on findings from 9N (Moore et al., 2009; Luther et al., 2012). Ravaux et al. (2003) conducted experiments with tube worm chitin that suggest they will denigrate within 2.5 years in the deep marine environment.

Back on land analyses of ~300 basalt samples provided insight into the formation of the lavas from the&nbsp;8 20'N Chain. The analyses&nbsp;reveal a continuum of lava compositions spanning the full range of nearby East Pacific Rise mid-ocean ridge as well as all other seamount lava compositions collected in the northeast Pacific.

The stages of volcanism appear to coincide with regional plate motion reorganizations. Additionally, the seamounts appear to become larger in volume in time suggesting an increased melt production.
