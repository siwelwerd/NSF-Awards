See  https://www.nitrd.gov/csessp/.   Government agencies that fund and develop software for Computational Science & Engineering are concerned that planning for software pays attention mostly to the initial development of software and not for the operation, maintenance and ongoing sustainability.  Computational Science & Engineering software often demand decades of useful life, thus these factors are of utmost importance.  The productivity and sustainability issues impede the advancement of computation science and engineering, which is important to US competitiveness.  The workshop will involve a diverse set of participants from different sectors and regions and will pay attention to Inclusion of under-represented groups.",
