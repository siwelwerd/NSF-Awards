 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER plan aims to develop configurable nanostructures for gene delivery. Gene therapy\r\nultimately relies on corrected genes to be efficiently delivered across cell membranes and ultimately\r\nto the cell nucleus without exposing neighboring cells. This plan configures nanostructures to\r\ndeliver genes efficiently and specifically to the cell nucleus. In particular, asymmetric\r\nconfigurations, displaying unique optical properties, will be developed to optically penetrate\r\nmembranes, optically transport genes through the crowded intracellular space, and deliver genes\r\ndirectly to the nucleus. Efficient and specific delivery of corrected genes should lower required\r\ndosages and minimize unwanted side effects. This strategy also offers a new class of gene delivery\r\nsystems which can be optically removed post-delivery, eliminating potential side effects from the\r\ngene delivery system itself. As part of broader impacts and outreach activities, this plan aims to\r\nadvance awareness in nanotechnology, and to increase underrepresented participation in STEM.\r\nDrawing from this proposed research, laboratory course modules will be designed at the graduate\r\nlevel, research career series will be implemented at the undergraduate level, and nanotechnology\r\ncapstone workshops will be designed to engage K-12 students in STEM. These combined activities\r\nserve to form a framework integrating research, education and outreach over the PI's career.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER plan aims to address the challenge facing gene delivery systems to deliver genes\r\nefficiently and specifically to the cell nucleus. The proposed work will develop plasmonic\r\nnanoantenna architectures - consisting of asymmetrically configured nanoparticles - capable of\r\noptical transport, membrane penetration and nuclear gene release for efficient nuclear delivery. The\r\nintellectual merit of the proposed research lies in the configuration of plasmonic nanoantenna\r\narchitectures, displaying high degrees of asymmetry and coupled longitudinal modes, to spectrally\r\ndecouple the gradient force from the radiation pressure. Spectral decoupling of the gradient force\r\nfrom the radiation pressure allows, for the first time, optical forces at reasonable light irradiances,\r\nminimized photothermally induced Brownian motion, and multi-functional capabilities where\r\noptical transport is conducted at one wavelength and optical activation of gene release is conducted\r\nat another wavelength. The following tasks support the attainment of the research goal: (1) Identify\r\noperation conditions for optical transport of plasmonic nanoantenna architectures. (2) Assess\r\nwhether optical force penetration compared to optical destabilization improves penetration\r\nefficiency. (3) Investigate whether spatial modulation of gene release modifies resulting gene\r\nexpression. As part of broader impacts and outreach activities, this plan aims to advance awareness\r\nin nanotechnology and plasmonics at the K-12, undergraduate and graduate level, and to increase\r\nunderrepresented participation in STEM. The following tasks support the attainment of the\r\neducational goal: (1) Lead capstone workshops to expose K-12 students to nanotechnology. (2)\r\nImplement research career seminar series to educate undergraduate students interested in research\r\nas a career path. (3) Expand plasmonics graduate course curriculum to include laboratory modules.\r\nThese combined activities serve to form a framework integrating research, education and outreach\r\nover the PI's career.",
