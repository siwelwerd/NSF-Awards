Shorelines are dynamic places, both culturally and environmentally, and the project will explore this dynamism by employing earth, biological and social sciences to elucidate the linkages between human settlements and their coastline. Working on the coast, researchers must take into consideration a distinct range of geomorphological, hydrogeochemical, and ecological variables. When these variables are connected with archaeological data, the end result is a nuanced understanding that illuminates barriers and opportunities people faced as part of a dynamic coastal landscape over millennia. By focusing specifically on coastal settlements, this research adds a much needed dimension to the growing body of literature from various parts of the world that attempts to understand how the dynamic relations between cultural and environmental factors, at local and global scales, influenced the developmental trajectory of past human societies. The results of this research can serve as the foundation for a broader understanding of the interrelated variables that modern and future groups will have to contend with as they adapt to changing coastal regimes. The project has a long history of sharing its research with the local community and will make every effort to share pertinent research results with the broader public through popular media.\r\n\r\nOver the past three millennia, rising sea levels and fluctuating climatic regimes have dramatically transformed the physiographic characteristics of this drowning coastline, while Maya society witnessed the rise and fall of divine kings and the emergence of a market-based economy. By correlating multiple facets of the changing paleoenvironment with broader social and economic changes, the research team will be in a strong position to reveal the challenges faced, and opportunities pursued, by these coastal peoples as they adapted to their changing coastal landscape. The neighboring ancient Maya port sites of Vista Alegre and Conil are the focus of study. Located only 7 km apart, preliminary data indicate that human habitation along the coast was not continuous over the past three millennia, nor did the occupational histories at Conil and Vista Alegre mirror one another. This episodic settlement history provides tantalizing clues to the vulnerabilities and resilience of these coastal peoples. The project first aims to investigate what social and environmental factors conditioned the resilience and vulnerability of the inhabitants of Vista Alegre and Conil over the past 3000 years. It will do this by employing sediment coring, water salinity mapping, coastal ecological surveys, archaeological survey and excavations, and multi-proxy lab analyses (Loss on Ignition [LOI], \u00a6\u00c418Ocarb and \u00a6\u00c413Ccarb of bulk carbonate, grain size analysis, micropaleontology, and AMS radiocarbon dating). With these data collected, project members will be able to understand how these factors shifted through time and correlated with one another in order to examine how their interplay shaped past lifeways.",

The majority of the fieldwork for this project took place in 2016 and 2017 with lab analyses taking place in the US and Mexico from 2018 to the close of the project in 2021.  \n\nOver the past three millennia, rising sea levels and fluctuating climatic regimes have dramatically transformed the physiographic characteristics of this drowning coastline, while Maya society witnessed the rise and fall of divine kings and the emergence of a market-based economy. By correlating multiple facets of the changing paleoenvironment with broader social and economic changes, the research team is revealing the challenges faced, and opportunities pursued, by these coastal peoples as they adapted to their changing coastal landscape.  The story we are now able to tell, thanks to our NSF-funded research, is a more nuanced and complex one.  There is not a linear causality between environmental changes and social, political, and economic ones.  They operate on different scales, both temporally and spatially, and as such they map onto one another in complex ways.  Our research has set a solid foundation that hopefully we and others can build on going forward.\n\nA broad range of artifacts and ecofacts have been recovered from Vista Alegre and Conil.  In particular, there is a diverse array of types and varieties of pottery ranging from the Middle Preclassic period (c. 800/700 - 400 BC) to the Colonial period (16th - 17th century AD).  This is to be expected at coastal port sites and stands in sharp contrast to the limited diversity in the pottery assemblages of nearby inland sites.  In addition, we continued to recover large quantities of obsidian.  The Central Mexican obsidian, in particular, is telling of the dramatic realignment of Mesoamerican trade routes and economic systems that happened in the Terminal Classic and Early Postclassic periods (c. AD 1000) when Chichen Itza rose to regional prominence.  We also recovered a diverse array of shell artifacts, including some evidence of shell artifact production.  When combined with the robust zooarchaeological assemblage (c. 25,000 bones were analyzed, the majority of which were fish, along with over 6,000 marine shellfish), these data point to the distinct lifeways coastal peoples developed.\n\nIn terms of broader impacts, the project has supported the graduate research of students in the United States, Mexico, and Israel.  The project also has a long history of sharing its research with the local community and has made every effort to share pertinent research results with the broader public through popular media. Most significantly we have been working with the local community to establish a community museum.  These efforts have been delayed due to the Covid-19 global pandemic and disagreements over the proposed museum space by state and local governmental officials.  We are continuing to push forward on this front with local advocates, but the future of the museum remains uncertain.  Regardless, we will continue to share the results of our research with members of the local community and the broader public.\n\nIn addition, by focusing specifically on coastal settlements, this research has added a much-needed dimension to the growing body of literature from various parts of the world that attempts to understand how the dynamic relations between cultural and environmental factors, at local and global scales, influenced the developmental trajectory of past human societies. The results of this research serve as the foundation for a broader understanding of the interrelated variables that modern and future groups will have to contend with as they adapt to changing coastal regimes.\n\nPlease visit http://costaescondida.org for more information on the project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/15/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey B Glover"
