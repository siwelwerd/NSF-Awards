 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds a three year standard grant in the cross-directorate program of Cultivating Cultures for Ethical STEM.  Issues surrounding genetic engineering, biotechnology, and synthetic biology are contentious, especially when applied to food, the environment, and industrial applications for which direct human consent and medical benefits are not present. How researchers, developers, and policy-makers communicate about and reflect upon their work is of utmost importance to the fields of bioengineering.  This research fills an important niche by encouraging those involved in biotechnology innovation systems to reflect on the ethical dimensions of their work and what it means to innovate responsibly. At the same time, this research contributes to important comparative research on conceptions of responsible innovation across four types of institutions. Increased understanding about how participants within and across various professional contexts conceive of and frame the ethical dimensions of their work can assist with future cross-sector dialogue, and potentially conflict resolution.\r\n\r\nThe research employs a novel approach for comparative analyses of meanings of responsible innovation and ethics in bioengineering, while cultivating socially-responsible cultures of R&D among graduate students, faculty, and outside practitioners in genetic engineering and synthetic biology (bioengineering). It innovates in four key respects: 1) it focuses on bioengineering, specifically in areas in which engineering ethics programs have not routinely been applied, genetic engineering and synthetic biology; 2) it evaluates an example pedagogy of engaged scholarship, student facilitation of focus groups, for learning and cultivating ethical cultures; 3) it uses framings of responsible innovation and appreciative inquiry as key parts of the dialogue about ethical cultures in bioengineering; and 4) it compares meanings of responsible innovation across four sectors of bioengineering: government, academe, industry, and non-profit organizations. Twelve focus groups (three from each sector), pre- and post-surveys, and a values-mapping tool are being used for data collection. Example hypotheses tested include: 1) that participants within types of organizational communities conceptualize responsible innovation for bioengineering in similar ways sharing several secondary values as well as core values (tight coalitions); 2) participants across types of organizations differ in conceptions of responsible innovation, but share some policy core and secondary values (loose coalitions); and 3) interest in responsible innovation and ethics, on average, increase in both external-participants and internal-facilitators after the focus groups (versus pre-focus groups). The project promises to contribute to theory and methodology in Science and Technology Studies, science and technology policy, and ethics education, as well as serve as an example of the practice of \"engaged scholarship,\" by which the activities of academe meet the needs of external communities and vice versa.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIssues surrounding genetic engineering and biotechnology are contentious, especially in food, the environment, and industrial applications for which direct human consent and medical benefits are not present. This project filled an important niche by encouraging those involved in biotechnology innovation systems to reflect on the ethical dimensions of their work and what it means to responsibly innovate. At the same time, this project contributed to important comparative research on conceptions of responsible innovation across five types of institutions. Increased understanding about how participants within and across various professional contexts conceive of and frame the ethical dimensions of their work can assist with future cross-sector dialogue, and potentially conflict resolution.   The project also created a new model of training on ethics and responsible innovation for graduate students in order to foster thinking about responsible research and innovation (RRI) in the next generation of leaders.\n\nTraining\n\nTwenty graduate students (10 from underrepresented groups) from a variety of majors in social and natural sciences participated in a workshop focused on 1) genetic engineering, biotechnology and synthetic biology as complex socio-technological systems; 2) ethical frameworks, principles, and codes for grappling with ethical questions; 3) responsible innovation concepts and practices; 4) case studies of genetic engineering and biotechnology that illuminate ethical challenges for responsible innovation; and 5) the purposes and methods of focus group research.\n\nEvaluation of the training model showed its success in improving students' capacities for moderating difficult conversations about technology development, improving their confidence in interacting with stakeholders in communities of biotechnology, and increasing their knowledge and interest in ethics and responsible innovation.\n\nResearch\n\nAs a framework for governance, RRI has received increasing scholarly attention but has yet to be successfully integrated into U.S. biotechnology innovation.  To understand why, we analyzed the attitudes of over 100 biotechnology stakeholders towards principles and practices of RRI.  Focus groups and pre- and post-focus group surveys were used to measure and understand attitudes towards RRI across different stakeholder groups.\n\nOur findings suggest  that 1) all stakeholder groups showed neutral or slightly positive attitudes towards the core principles of RRI prior to the focus groups; 2) scholarly definitions of RRI presented at the focus groups seemed to have  a polarizing effect on stakeholders, particularly between industry and consumer groups; 3) with the exception of inclusion, stakeholder groups involved in innovation (industry, trade, and academe) showed more disagreement in implementation of RRI  than in general principles of RRI; 4) the greatest magnitude of disagreement occurred between industry and consumer groups and in the RRI principles of responsiveness and inclusion; 5) the general principle of anticipation showed the least difference among stakeholder groups, especially prior to the focus groups; however, industry strongly opposed the way anticipation was implemented (funding allocated to social impacts research); 6) government aligned more with consumer groups than other stakeholder groups and 7)  industry, trade orgs, and academe generally aligned in their distaste for inclusion and responsiveness.\n\nThe Advocacy Coalition Framework predicts that groups who agree at deeper core levels (policy core) will tend to agree more at all lower levels (secondary policy).  We did not see this in our study, in that general RRI principles were agreed upon more than specific policies to implement them.  Lawton and Rudd (2013) suggest that there can be agreement on secondary policy value (implementation of RRI in this study) in the face of disagreement on core policy values (the principles of RRI in this study) but that these are likely to be more transient partnerships.   Our results for RRI and biotechnology innovation seem to suggest a different situation that is perhaps more hopeful than not.  Because stakeholder groups agree on the general principles of RRI, if the right policy implementation and design are found, long-term partnerships among stakeholder groups to execute the biotech RRI vision could occur.\n\n       This study began to illuminate the challenges of implementing RRI in US biotechnology innovation systems from our analysis of the focus group conversations. Macro level barriers include the rigidity of funding structures and pace of innovation within an intensely competitive environment.  Meso level barriers include lack of institutional capacity for RRI (resources), risk of losing investors due to delays, and the possible public backlash if people know of controversial research projects that are in the making.  Micro level barriers include biases that experts and innovators have towards the public as not being able to understand biotechnology and therefore thinking that early inclusion of them will lead to poor decisions.  Also, many researchers in academe askew responsibility for RRI as basic researchers, thinking it doesn?t apply to their work.\n\nThis work suggests a need to ground RRI within the specific temporal and structural contexts of real innovation pathways for it to be embraced and succeed, yet it will be a delicate balance to do this while protecting the core principles of RRI.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/26/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jennifer Kuzma"
