This project will start with investigating fast IOSs in frog retinal slices. A retinal slice preparation exposes a cross-section of the retinal layers, and thus allow simultaneous recording of fast IOSs from the photoreceptors and post-photoreceptor neurons, with feasibility of concurrent electrophysiological recording of targeted retinal cells. This phase will test two hypotheses: 1) Fast IOSs correlated with early photoreceptor activities to light stimulation occurs immediately after the stimulus delivery; while fast IOSs associated with second- and third-order post-photoreceptor neurons may have a time delay relative to the stimulus. 2) Fast IOSs can be used to image oscillatory and spike neural activities generated by post-photoreceptor neurons. The second phase of this project is to explore simultaneous optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of photoreceptors and post-photoreceptor responses in the intact eye. In order to achieve this objective, an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) based optical coherence tomography (OCT) is proposed for pursuing vibration- and inertia-free optical dissection of retinal neural activities.",

As shown in Fig. 1, both 2-month and 1-year-old mice were measured. In 2-month-old mutant mice, time course and peak value of the stimulus-evoked IOS were significantly delayed (relative to stimulus onset) and reduced, respectively, compared to age matched WT mice. In 1-year-old mutant mice, stimulus-evoked IOS was totally absent. However, enhanced spontaneous IOS responses, which might reflect inner neural remodeling in diseased retina, were observed in both 2-month and 1-year-old mutant retinas.&nbsp; Our experiments demonstrate the potential of using IOS imaging for noninvasive and high resolution identification of disease-associated retinal dysfunctions.</p>\n<p>Ex vivo near infrared microscopy was used to investigate transient retinal phototropism (TRP) associated IOS response. Stimulus-evoked TRP has been predominantly observed in rod photoreceptors activated by oblique visible light stimulation. Dynamic confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography (OCT) have revealed rod outer segment (ROS) movement as the physical source of TRP. However, the physiological source of ROS movement is still not well understood. In this study, concurrent near-infrared imaging of TRP and electroretinogram (ERG) measurement of retinal electrophysiology revealed that ROS movement occurs before the onset of the ERG a-wave, which is known to reflect the hyperpolarization of retinal photoreceptors (Fig. 2). Moreover, substitution of normal superfusing medium with low-sodium medium reversibly blocked the photoreceptor ERG a-wave, but largely preserved the stimulus-evoked ROS movements. Our experimental results and theoretical analysis indicate that early, disc-based stages of the phototransduction cascade, which occur before the hyperpolarization of retinal photoreceptors, contribute to the TRP associated ROS movement.</p>\n<p>In vivo confocal IOS imaging of laser-injured frog eyes was used to demonstrate the potential of noninvasive identification of localized retinal dysfunctions associated with eye diseases. A rapid line-scan confocal ophthalmoscope was constructed to achieve in vivo confocal-IOS imaging of frog (Rana Pipiens) retinas at cellular resolution. In order to investigate the physiological mechanism of confocal-IOS, comparative in vivo IOS and ERG measurements were conducted using normal frog eyes activated by variable intensity stimuli. A dynamic spatiotemporal filtering algorithm was developed to reject the contamination of hemodynamic changes on fast IOS recording. Laser-injured frog eyes were employed to test the potential of confocal-IOS mapping of localized retinal dysfunctions. As shown in Fig. 3, IOS imaging of laser-injured frog eyes indicates that the confocal-IOS can unambiguously detect localized (30 &micro;m) functional lesions in the retina before a morphological abnormality is detectable.</p>\n<p>In vivo functional OCT of stimulus evoked IOS changes in both frog and mouse retinas was used to demonstrate physiological assessment of retinal rod and cone photoreceptors. By developing high spatiotemporal resolution OCT and applying an adaptive algorithm for IOS processing, we were able to record robust IOSs from single-pass measurements. Transient IOSs, which might reflect an early stage of light phototransduction, are consistently observed in the photoreceptor outer segment almost immediately (&lt;1 ms) after retinal stimulation (Fig. 4). Comparative studies of dark- and light-adapted retinas have demonstrated the feasibility of functional OCT mapping of rod and cone photoreceptors, promising a new method for early disease detection and improved treatment of diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and other eye diseases that can cause photoreceptor damage.</p>\n<p>Two PhD students finished their research training through this project, and successfully passed their dissertation defenses in 2014.
