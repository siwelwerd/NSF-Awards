 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spinal cord injuries can lead to complete leg paralysis, drastically limiting mobility and reducing quality of life. Significant progress has been made towards wearable exoskeletons that provide some ability to walk, but these require the use of crutches, which create unnatural loads on the wearer, as well as restricting use of the hands and arms. The objective of this research is to develop a lower body exoskeleton able to balance and walk without the use of crutches, thus allowing the wearers to interact with their environment and maintain proper posture. The resulting platform will improve the overall quality of life for those with spinal cord injury by granting them a level of mobility that is currently unachievable. \r\n\r\nThis work will apply methods advanced in the field of humanoid robots to the design of exoskeletons for functionally impaired persons. Specifically, the project will apply a method called whole-body control, which finds motions that resolve multiple motion objectives at once, to a lower body exoskeleton with 12 degrees of freedom, providing a range of movement similar to natural human locomotion, with the exception of ankle yaw. High fidelity torque control will be achieved using series elastic actuators to enable compliant locomotion of the wearer.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nIn this project, we developed a lower-body exoskeleton for individuals with spinal cord injuries and algorithms to allow humanoid robots and exoskeletons to walk more naturally.  Most exoskeletons for individuals with spinal cord injuries require the use of crutches, and only permit walking speeds that are about half as fast as normal human walking.  In this project, we conducted research to overcome both of these limitations: to make an exoskeleton that would be able to balance on its own, and thus not require crutches; and to enable the exoskeleton to walk with a gait pattern similar to normal human walking, at normal walking speeds.\nWe created a new exoskeleton design that could achieve these requirements, and designed new actuators to power it.  The exoskeleton is much more powerful than previous exoskeletons due to the requirement of moving at normal human walking speeds.  The hip and knee actuators, which are the strongest in the exoskeleton, have a power of more than 1100W and a continuous force of 4700N.  To achieve this, we used water cooling combined with two motors acting in parallel.  The actuators have a ballscrew with a titanium series spring and a force sensor.  For the other joints in the exoskeleton, we designed several variants of the actuator to provide the appropriate amounts of torque and speed.  \nWe also created new models of the actuator, and validated them experimentally on two test stands.  The actuator's series spring is made with a leaf spring topology, and previous models did not accurately predict the stiffness resulting when the actuator operated.  We also conducted detailed thermal modeling of the motor water cooling, determining how strongly we could power the actuators without them overheating.  Finally, we derived models of how the actuator interacted with a load it was pushing on, including the dynamics of the ballscrew.  These models matched our experiments very closely, and are useful for controlling robot or exoskeleton legs and for future actuator designs.\nTo power the actuators, we developed a low-level joint controller board, a new motor controller capable of powering two brushless motors with currents of more than 30 Amps continuously, and another board that reads in sensors.  The controller board can communicate over Ethercat to a computer, and runs low-level joint impedance controllers to make the exoskeleton joints move as commanded.  The motor controllers mount to the low-level controller board, measure the currents provided to the motors, and provide the desired currents.  The sensor board reads in forces from load cells in the actuators, reads the temperature from sensors on the motors, and reads in encoders on the motors and exoskeleton joints.\nWe also developed new algorithms to enable humanoid robots and exoskeletons to walk more similarly to normal human walking.  Humans walk with a heel-toe pattern, where we land on our heel, proceed to have our foot flat on the ground, and then lift up our heel as we push the leg off the ground.  Previous robots and exoskeletons almost exclusively have walked with their feet flat on the ground throughout each step.  We developed algorithms to enable robots to walk in a human-like pattern while maintaining their balance, as well as models of how humanoid robots and exoskeletons can balance.  We implemented and tested those on the ATLAS humanoid robot since our exoskeleton was still in progress at the time.  \nOverall, this project contributed to one PhD thesis, seven Master's theses, five conference papers, and two journal papers; several additional papers are forthcoming. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/16/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan Asbeck"
