With the conference site in Tokyo, Japan in 2015, it is expected to draw researchers from Japan, Korea, mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and other Asian countries, many of whom do not regularly attend the North American IEEE RFID conference.  Approximately 150 attendees with 30 paper presentations are expected.  The NSF funds will provide partial travel support for graduate students or post-doctoral researchers who are US citizens or permanent residents to attend IEEE RFID-TA 2015 and present their work at the conference.  The IEEE Counsel on RFID has already provided some base funding for a travel grants program for student attendees.  The NSF-sponsored travel grants program will be used as a topping grant, to be awarded competitively to US citizens or permanent residents that meet the existing travel grants program requirements.  The NSF grant will provide numerous benefits to early-career US researchers, who may not otherwise be able to attend, by providing them with international networking opportunity and brightening their future prospects.  Moreover, this conference has strong industry attendance, and will allow early-career researchers the opportunity to explore collaborations with industry.",
