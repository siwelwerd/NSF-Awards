 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the development of statistical tools for the analysis of complex data structures that arise with the use of modern technology.  In many applications, the observations naturally lie on a nonlinear space, such as a sphere, and it is important to study the temporal and spatial behavior of these processes.  The research will impact several data-rich applications including visual speech recognition, action/emotion recognition, and the analysis of medical images.  This project will use techniques from geometry, statistics, and computer science to develop algorithms and tools that can help practitioners derive much needed insight from these data.\r\n\r\nIn this research, a comprehensive framework for estimation, registration and analysis of manifold-valued processes is proposed. Functional data analysis in Euclidean spaces has been explored extensively in the literature.  In this project, the functions that are studied take values on nonlinear manifolds, rather than in vector spaces.  The observed data are noisy and discrete, and observed at random/arbitrary times.  Two main problems are investigated: the first involves estimation of smoothing trajectories using time-indexed points.  The second problem focuses on the development of a comprehensive framework for joint registration and analysis of multiple manifold-valued processes.   The approach takes into account the temporal variability, derives a rate-invariant metric, and generates statistical summaries (sample mean, covariance), which can be subsequently used for registering and modeling multiple trajectories.",
