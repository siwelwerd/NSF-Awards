 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will survey a new site in Ethiopia that may contain fossils and archaeological evidence of early human (hominin) ancestors around 5 to 6 million years ago. The site was previously identified as potentially fossil-bearing using satellite imagery data. A team of investigators with many combined years of paleontological and archaeological experience will survey a 100 square kilometer area to identify and document any fossils and artifacts and gather geological data. If new fossils and artifacts are found at this site, they could expand our understanding of the environmental and biological pressures that led to the evolution of key human adaptations like walking upright, stone tool use, and meat eating. The project will support science education, training, and conservation in the local community, and among US and Ethiopian students, researchers and the US public.\r\n\r\nThis project, submitted in response to the High-Risk Research in Biological Anthropology and Archaeology (HRRBAA) solicitation, is a two-week field survey of a previously unexplored area, known as Asale, in the Danakil Depression in the Afar Regional State, Ethiopia, to document the presence of paleontological and archeological remains. The investigators are a highly qualified group of paleoanthropologists with a long history of successful work in Ethiopia and in Africa more broadly. They have a strong familiarity with the Mio-Pleistocene fauna of the Afar region, paleoecological reconstruction, and isotopic geochemistry. They will assess the paleoanthropological potential of volcanic and sedimentary deposits with the goal of documenting earlier stages of human evolution and its context, specifically the Miocene-Pliocene boundary when hominins first appear in the fossil record. Data from the site may also provide information about the geographic distribution of taxa and paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The project supports science conservation efforts, and if the site contains hominin data, the larger ensuing project would support training of students and communication of findings to the general public through university scientific outreach programs. The project is jointly supported by the Biological Anthropology and Archaeology Programs at NSF.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur understanding of human evolution requires direct evidence of the remains and behaviors of our ancient ancestors.  These fossils and artifacts can inform us about the timing and context of the major events in our history, including our origins, the adoption of bipedal locomotion, reduction of the canine, and the rise in tool use and manufacture.  The Afar region of Ethiopia has produced significant fossils and artifacts that have greatly improved our knowledge of these events.  This high-risk project was to explore the north-central area of the Afar region for paleoanthropological materials to assess the potential for developing a long-term research project in the area.  In 2015, we focused our paleoanthropological and geological survey on an uplifted block (including a ridge known as Asale) located along the western margin of the Ethiopian Rift that appeared structurally similar to the Late Miocene-Early Pliocene-aged fossil-rich deposits of the more southerly located Gona and Middle Awash project areas.  With the permission of the governing administrators at the Authority for the Conservation of Cultural Heritage in Ethiopia, we were able to expand our survey throughout a much wider area in the Afar region that is paleoanthropologically poorly known.  Overall, this region has been and is still currently tectonically and volcanically active.  The many highpoints in the area are the remnants of ancient volcanic activity including a large volcanic center and serial basalt flows.  These areas lacked any evidence of sediments.  The project geologist sampled a number of these outcrops to better understand the timing and formation of these volcanics in service of reconstructing the Ethiopian Rift?s evolution.  The laterally extensive plains that cover and lap onto these volcanic prominences were fine silty sands associated with lower energy streams that were formed during the latest Pleistocene and Holocene.  The few non-human fossil remains that were discovered represented species still extant and present locally, including warthogs, and extant species no longer present locally such as alcelaphine bovids.  The survey also yielded a number of archeological remains primarily Late Stone Age obsidian blades and more recent ceramics.  None of the bones observed exhibited human-induced damage (cut-marks, percussion).  Only one very recent archeological site was discovered, and its age was probably hundreds rather than thousands of years old.   A spring was discovered in association with shells of the gastropod Melanoides tuberculata. These shells were exported and radiometrically dated to 9770+230 BP an age falling in the early part of the African Humid Period that was a time of increased rainfall across Africa that had raised the water table to ~2.5m above its current level and perhaps was central to the formation of the ancient plains and occupation by the humans. \n\n            We requested and received a no-cost extension to use the remaining funds to conduct a survey in 2016 of the area surrounding Mt. Galili in the Afar.  Previous research had indicated an age for the fossil-rich sediments of between 4.5-3.5 Ma.  Our goals were to locate paleontological localities and sample the fauna to better document the range of taxonomic diversity in service of better reconstructing the paleoenvironments of the area.  The focus of this paleoanthropological project was to collect hominins and in our short 13 day field season, five were discovered including Ardipithecus ramidus, possibly Australopithecus anamensis, two small taxonomically undiagnostic tooth fragments and a complete mandibular dentition that is currently unassigned.  One hundred and ninety-five fossils and several dozen artifacts were collected from 38 localities.  These included a diversity of species with about 25% of the total collections representing monkeys (primarily cercopiths) and including the biochronologically useful Anancus kenyensis (advanced), Loxodonta cf. adaurora, Notochoerus jaegeri (including a partial skeleton with skull), and No. euilus, among others.  The fossils were in good to excellent condition although some show evidence of fluvial transport.  Seventy-eight geological samples were collected and exported to provide better chronological control of the sediments. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott W Simpson"
