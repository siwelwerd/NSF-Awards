This conference brings together researchers in model theory, in difference and differential algebra, and in allied fields (such as algebraic dynamics) in which theorems from model theoretic algebra have been applied.  This workshop will foster research interactions and will provide an informal setting for graduate students and younger researchers to learn of the newest trends in this research area and interact with some of the most prominent researchers around the world.  \r\n\r\nIn particular, this project will provide financial support to a substantial number of graduate students and young researchers from the United States.  Differential algebraic geometry, differential Galois theory and, more recently, algebraic dynamics have benefited from the close interaction with model theory, especially the model theory of fields with operators.  The conference aims to catalyze further developments in this area.  Details about the conference may be found at http://scientific-events.weebly.com/1194.html .",
