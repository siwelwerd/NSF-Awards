 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the fundamental questions about human origins is how our hominin ancestors lived. This study uses a multidisciplinary approach (paleontology, paleoecology, comparative anatomy, experimental biology) to ask questions about how extinct populations of hominins behaved on their natural landscapes. Specifically, the investigators will analyze lower jaws (mandibles), among the most commonly represented parts of the skeleton in the early human fossil record, of modern great apes and two early species of extinct hominins (Autralopithecus), to understand how the structure of the mandible is related to changes in feeding behavior and diet. The research will provide new data about how changes in diet and feeding behavior transformed our anatomy across time, permitting more robust explanations of the processes by which we became human. Broader impacts will include undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training in the latest analytical techniques for fossil analyses; outreach to primary and secondary school science teachers and students using hands-on experiences and web-based content designed to enhance teaching and learning about human origins; and the production of a unique collection 3D data for modern apes and rare fossil specimens that will be available to the scientific community.\r\n\r\nMandibles are the most common element in the hominin fossil record after teeth; they are used to diagnose species, test phylogenetic hypotheses, and infer feeding behavior and diet. However, extensive theoretical and experimental work on extant primates has not clarified which aspects of variation in mandibular form are related to variation in the positions of the tooth row, jaw muscles and jaw joint, which are related to the mandible's resistance to internal forces, and how these relate to feeding behavior and diet. Furthermore, the classical consensus on the relationship between dentognathic morphology and diet in Plio-Pleistocene hominins - adaptation to processing mechanically resistant foods - has been challenged by recent inferences from dietary isotopes, occlusal microwear, and finite element modeling, which do not converge on a shared view of early hominin diets and feeding behavior. This lack of consensus is especially glaring in light of the rich fossil record of mandibles for the Australopithecus anamensis-A. afarensis lineage (4.2-3.0 Ma), which documents clear changes in dentognathic morphology and carbon-isotope signatures over time. The primary focus of the proposed research is an integrative investigation of how spatial and mechanical determinants of mandibular form track change in diet and feeding behavior in extant hominids (great apes and humans) and early Australopithecus.  The research is organized under three specific aims: 1. Quantifying and comparing the location, magnitude and nature of external and internal morphological variation in mandibles of extant (Homo, Pongo, Pan, and Gorilla) and fossil (A. anamensis, A. afarensis) hominids via computed tomography and geometric morphometrics; 2. Testing specific hypotheses about the biomechanical significance of variation in hominid mandibular morphology via finite-element models; and 3. Evaluating the extent to which spatial positioning of masticatory system components (tooth row, jaw joint, and muscle attachment points) explain variation in mandibular morphology across extant hominids and early Australopithecus. The project will provide new data on the structural and functional determinants of early hominin mandibular morphology, to help identify the factors that drove these morphological changes and allow tests of adaptive hypotheses about the early evolution of the genus.",

We used those scans to create virtual three dimensional (3D) replicas of these mandibles that show both the external and internal structure of the specimens. These virtual replicas have been placed in an online repository and will be made available for other researchers to use. This will allow researchers without the resources to visit the museums where these specimens are housed to study them, increasing the number of scientists that can contribute to understanding human evolutionary history. In addition, it reduces the number of individuals who need to handle the specimens, which decreases the likelihood that they will be damaged.</p>\n<p>Using these virtual replicas we documented variation in the shape of the mandible within and among great ape and human species. The results demonstrate that the mandibular shapes of these different species can be easily differentiated from one another and that we could identify which species a mandible comes from with over 95% accuracy. Since we typically find only parts of fossil mandibles, we also looked at whether we could identify a species from just one region of the mandible and discovered that we could with nearly 90% accuracy. This suggests that incomplete mandibles, which are relatively common in the human fossil record due to their relative durability, can be useful in differentiating fossil species from one another.</p>\n<p>Using biomechanical models called finite element analyses we also explored whether there were differences between the species in how much and what kind of strain is put on their mandibles during chewing. By combining this information with data on differences between these species in mandibular shape, we can determine the extent to which changes in the mandible during human evolution may be related to the changes in the strains placed on the mandible due to shifts in diet. We found that there were notable differences among the species in strain pattern at the symphysis (the region where the two sides of the mandible come together) of the mandible, suggesting that differences among species in symphyseal shape may be related to species differences in strain regimes. This is intriguing given the documented shift in the shape of the symphysis through time in early humans and suggests that differences in strain regimes may be an important force driving changes in early human mandible shape. Following this preliminary research we conducted a more detailed comparison of the mechanical behavior of the mandible of chimpanzees and macaques during chewing using finite element modelling. We found significant differences between the species in the extent to which the different parts of the mandible are strained during chewing. These results suggested that researchers should shift to chimpanzees from macaques as more suitable model for understanding fossil human mandible biomechanics. We will build on these results to conduct a broader comparative study of mandible mechanics in living and fossil great apes and humans using finite element modelling.</p>\n<p>We also explored other factors that could potentially influence mandible shape variation in great apes and humans. In a preliminary study we determined that the shape and size of the molar crown exhibits low and non-significant levels of covariation with the shape of the mandible. Covariation levels were found to be higher, but not significant, between the roots of the molars and the mandible. This suggests that mandibular shape variation is being driven by factors other than the molars that are housed by that jaw, although the size and shape of the roots may have a minor effect on the shape of the mandible.</p>\n<p>Using the virtual scans created during this study we compared variation in the mandibular shape to genetic variation and found that modern humans have an unusually high level of variation in mandible shape relative to their genetic diversity. Our preliminary hypothesis is that this is due to adaptations of modern human populations to different diets.</p>\n<p>Finally, we have made a number of methodological advances during the course of this project. We worked with the developers of the software program Checkpoint to design new protocols for rapidly merging microCT slices, segmenting the specimens, and reducing their size to create 3D models of mandibular specimens that data can easily be collected on. Given the time consuming nature of segmenting specimens this has substantially increased the speed of data collection. We have also worked with them to identify a method to collect data on the tooth roots and other internal structures on microCT scans which does not require the time consuming process of segmenting out those structures from the scans. A high quality video explaining these protocols has been recorded and will be uploaded to the Checkpoint website so that other researchers can use these protocols in the future.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/28/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Chris&nbsp;Robinson</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1515053/1515053_10370308_1635362103736_InternalmandibularstructureforNSF--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1515053/1515053_10370308_1635362103736_InternalmandibularstructureforNSF--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"microCT scan of chimpanzee lower jaw\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1515053/1515053_10370308_1635362103736_InternalmandibularstructureforNSF--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"microCT scan of chimpanzee lower jaw\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The image exhibits a chimpanzee 3D virtual lower jaw demonstrating that internal structures such as the roots are sufficiently visible for data collection.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chris Robinson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chris&nbsp;Robinson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">microCT scan of chimpanzee lower jaw</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1515053/1515053_10370308_1635362471787_GreatapevshumanforNSF--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1515053/1515053_10370308_1635362471787_GreatapevshumanforNSF--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Comparison of great ape and human mandibles\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1515053/1515053_10370308_1635362471787_GreatapevshumanforNSF--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Comparison of great ape and human mandibles\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image demonstrates how mandibular shapes among groups were compared with one another using a comparison between the average human mandible and the average great ape mandible as an example.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chris Robinson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chris&nbsp;Robinson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Comparison of great ape and human mandibles</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1515053/1515053_10370308_1635361945948_LandmarkpictureforNSF--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1515053/1515053_10370308_1635361945948_LandmarkpictureforNSF--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Data collected on mandible\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1515053/1515053_10370308_1635361945948_LandmarkpictureforNSF--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Data collected on mandible\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image depicts a three dimensional virtual gorilla mandible and the landmark data that were collected on it.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chris Robinson</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Chris&nbsp;Robinson</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Data collected on mandible</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
