 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports fundamental research to investigate online algorithmic methods for service systems.  Online algorithms are a fast, promising class of algorithms that make decisions adaptively but without pre-computing optimal future decisions.  Advances in online algorithms will bring current theory closer to being able to support the dynamic, information-intensive, and large-scale applications that are found in services today, such as multi-priority non-stationary make-to-order systems and web and mobile-based service-reservation systems.  On the modeling side, this award will enable the analysis of new features of service systems in important emerging applications. On the algorithmic side, this project will provide new tools to address existing theoretical gaps and open research problems. Performance analysis will be used to guide the investigation of robust and efficient algorithms that work well in practice.\r\n\r\nThis grant investigates several concrete features of service applications: (1) non-stationary arrival processes; (2) advance reservation of services; and (3) customer preferences. Traditional methods like queueing analysis can be limited in their ability to model these features of real applications, and to address non-stationary environments. Alternative methods that are tailor-made to handle both non-stationarity and modeling complexity, such as multi-stage stochastic dynamic programming, frequently suffer from the \"curse of dimensionality,\" which makes them intractable to solve. This project will create new models and online algorithms to address realistic features of service systems.  This grant will build on several core techniques. Balancing and sample-path analysis will be used to perform trade-offs under uncertainty. A new notion of distance function, which is related to potential functions, will be used to summarize high-dimensional state information and to evaluate the comparative performance of policies. Linear programming will be used to decompose complex dynamic problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems. A main contribution of this project is a theoretical performance guarantee that accompanies each algorithm. Theoretical insights along with extensive empirical studies on real data will be used to find high-quality practical policies. Although the focus of this project is on service systems, the tools investigated here will have immediate impact on other areas such as online resource allocation and revenue management.",
