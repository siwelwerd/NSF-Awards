 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Seth Brown of the University of Notre Dame is developing new types of catalysts to utilize oxygen to make new compounds and to remove hydrogen from existing compounds.  Catalysts are compounds that accelerate and direct reactions toward desirable products without themselves being consumed.   Many catalysts contain a metal atom and surrounding organic compounds bound to it, called ligands, and in most catalysts the reaction chemistry occurs on the metal atom.  Professor Brown is studying ways in which to make the ligand participate in the catalysis along with the metal atom or to perform all of the catalysis itself. The structural features of the catalysts and the mechanisms through which the chemical bonds are made or broken are being studied, and this information is being used to design new ligands that should perform better catalysis.  Because catalysis accounts for processes that total one third of the global gross domestic product and a majority of the commercial chemical products and chemical processes, the discovery of new or improved catalysts for organic reactions can have a great impact on economic development and growth.  The research team investigating these issues includes high school students, undergraduate students, and graduate students, with the aim of developing their technical and intellectual skills to prepare them appropriately for further training and careers in science or engineering.\r\n\r\nProfessor Brown is preparing new multidentate redox-active ligands to create environments where \"nonclassical\" redox reactions can take place.  One target is oxygen atom transfer or dioxygen activation in which bonds to oxygen will be formed at the metal center, but redox events will take place at the ligands.  A key design element is the use of high coordination numbers, which may stabilize small bite angle intermediates such as peroxo complexes and allow the assembly of enough ligands around the metal to marshal up to four electrons at a single site.  A second class of reactions being explored is based on concerted, purely ligand-centered 1,2-dehydrogenations of substrates.  These can be carried out even by coordinatively saturated metal complexes, which may lead to greater catalyst lifetimes.  The scope of such reactions, and the possibility that orbital symmetry constraints will steer the selectivity of such reactions, are being explored.  Novel catalysis mechanisms often open up new selectivity pathways, and understanding what electronic and structural features make the reactions more efficient may lead to improved catalysts with impact in the use or production of chemicals and chemical fuels.  A series of educational materials are being developed to help bring introductory students up to speed on practical approaches to chemical kinetics, allowing students to be intellectually engaged with the work at an early stage in their studies.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhen fuels react with oxygen to release energy, electrons are transferred between atoms in the process of making and breaking chemical bonds.  Because chemical bonds have two electrons each, in order for this process to be efficient, the individual steps in the reaction have to involve transfers of pairs of electrons.  In contrast, electrochemical processes, such as those involved in batteries or fuel cells, must ultimately feed electrons one at a time through an external wire.  Thus, an optimal catalyst for a fuel cell must be able to achieve the difficult task of translating between the two-electron chemistry needed for efficient reactions of the fuel and the one-electron chemistry needed for efficient generation of electrical power.\n\nIn studies carried out by graduate and undergraduate students, we explored the fundamental issues of this integration between one- and two-electron chemistry by examining metal complexes containing two organic groups, so-called iminoxolenes, that are each capable of one-electron chemistry.  These compounds were known to have relatively strong interactions between the two iminoxolenes, and we both quantified the strength of these interactions and showed how it was possible to tune that strength by changing the identity of the metal or the details of how the two organic groups are linked to the metal.  We observed that these compounds are able to participate in one of the fundamental reactions involved in fuel chemistry, namely the transfer of a single hydrogen atom, a process involving one-electron chemistry.  Even in cases where the two-electron reaction involving removal of two hydrogen atoms simultaneously is the more efficient pathway for both the substrate that reacts and the metal complex with which it is reacting, careful mechanistic studies indicate that the actual pathway involves successive, one-at-a-time abstractions of individual hydrogen atoms.  We did observe novel reactions of one of the organic groups where this hydrogen transfer is part of a two-electron process, but these studies illuminate the significant barriers that exist that impede the cooperation of two separate one-electron reagents.\n\nWe also investigated the abilities of the iminoxolene ligands to interact with metals in order to affect reactivity of other groups such as oxygen atoms bonded to those metals.  By examining both the three-dimensional structures of the compounds and their physical properties, we found a general phenomenon:  that the organic groups engage in strong and specific bonding interactions with the metal centers that influence the metals' reactivity.  This contrasts with the prevailing views of these ligands as acting principally as reservoirs for holding or releasing electrons to the metal centers.  The details of the bonding combine to create often counterintuitive patterns of reactivity.  For example, in compounds that deliver an oxygen atom to an organic substrate, the net result is a flow of electrons toward the metal center.  Surprsingly, the iminoxolene groups, rather than taking some of this new electron density away from the metal center, actually donate more electrons to the metal!  This ?backwards? behavior leads to unusual selectivity in reactions of these compounds and may enable the generation of reactive metal-containing groups that cannot be accessed with more conventional supporting groups on the metal.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Seth N Brown"
