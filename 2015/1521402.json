 "awd_abstract_narration": "This STTR Phase I project addresses the need to give engineering students hands-on experience with reliable and robust fluid dynamics analysis software to develop the intuition and exposure that will be required when they graduate.  Accurate fluid dynamics analysis is crucial in many disciplines to support product design.  Unfortunately, current software is not conducive to the classroom environment, or use by non-experts, due to the level of expertise required and the computational cost.  The proposed effort addresses these issues using an innovative approach to implement true \"push button\" software that is easy to setup and robust enough for classroom use, yet is accurate enough for reliable predictions.  The software will be augmented by multi-media learning tools that will provide just-in-time guidance.  This research is transformative in the field of engineering fluid dynamics, particularly in the context of improved science and engineering education.  Unlike other disciplines, the governing equations do not lend themselves to solution methods readily implemented by students; similarly current software is hindered by a substantial learning curve and pre-requisite knowledge.  This research has the potential to remove this barrier.  The software and learning tools developed will have application across all engineering and science disciplines related to fluid motion.  \r\n\r\nAccurate fluid dynamics analysis is crucial for many industries to support design and life-cycle analysis, and there is a strong need to give engineering students hands-on experience and training with reliable and robust Computational Fluid Dynamics methods so that they can develop the intuition that will be required when they graduate.  Unfortunately, contemporary software is not conducive to the classroom environment or use by non-expert engineers due to the computational costs and level of expertise required.  The proposed effort directly addresses these issues by implementing true \"push button\" software that is easy to setup and robust enough for classroom use, yet is accurate enough for reliable predictions in the teaching, research and industrial environments to provide a platform for students to explore innovative and transformative analysis and design.  The ease-of-use offered by the proposed software would finally enable Computational Fluid Dynamics to be brought into the undergraduate engineering classroom, planned in Phase I, and would appeal directly to areas of the commercial market that are not served by current offerings.  In Phase I the proposed software will be adapted for the academic environment, and a joint undergraduate and graduate engineering course that uses the software will be developed and taught.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nAccurate fluid dynamics analysis is crucial for many industries to support design and life-cycle analysis; consequently many engineering firms utilize Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) prediction software daily.

Unfortunately, contemporary CFD software is not conducive to the classroom environment, or use by non-expert engineers, due to the level of expertise required and costs associated with undertaking predictions.
