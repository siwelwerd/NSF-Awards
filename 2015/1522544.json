The theme of the workshop is \"Tropical Cyclone Operations & Research: Setting the Future Course\". Topics include: snapshots of tropical cyclone R&D; federal numerical modeling initiatives; transitioning research to operations; tropical cyclone model development and technology transfer; observations and observing strategies satellite, aircraft reconnaissance, unmanned aircraft systems, upper-ocean observations/profiles; improvements in tropical cyclone forecast and warning products and services; and social science applications to the tropical cyclone forecast and warning notification problem. The Tropical Cyclone Research Forum is sponsored by NSF/Physical and Dynamic Meteorology Program, NOAA/Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, and the Office of Naval Research.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit: \r\nAt the Tropical Cyclone Research Forum, representatives from the academic research community, industry and Federal agencies will have the opportunity to discuss the latest research on Tropical Cyclone activity and forecasting such as:\r\n1.\tReview of the 2014 hurricane/typhoon season from both an operations and reconnaissance perspective.\r\n2.\tThe Research Priorities of the Operational Centers\r\n3.\tObservations and Observing Strategies\r\n4.\tTropical Cyclone Model Development and Technology Transfer\r\n5.\tTransitioning Research to Operations\r\n6.\tAdvances in Tropical Cyclone Forecast and Warning Products and Services\r\n7.\tApplications of Social Science Research Results/Demonstration Projects\r\n\r\nBroader impacts: \r\nThe workshop is important to society because it brings together the academic research community, industry, Federal agencies and other user communities such as emergency management, to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season and make improvements to the United States hurricane forecasting and warning program.",
