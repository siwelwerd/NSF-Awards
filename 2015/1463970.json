The research team has extensive experience in using observational constrained approaches as well as in undertaking simulations using a suite of physical models. \r\n\r\nThe following scientific questions will be addressed: What dynamical processes are responsible for the evolution of  initial structures into a particular type of ENSO event? Are there physical mechanisms that can explain the stochastic forcing of these initial structures? How do initial structures and stochastic forcing throughout the evolution of a particular event affect the predictability of a particular type of ENSO event? How important - and how predictable - are changes in mean state conditions versus changes in stochastic forcing in influencing long-term variations in the statistics of different types of ENSO events?",
