 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an award to study asteroid belts and debris disks orbiting white dwarfs in order to better understand the general nature of planetary systems. White dwarfs are very dense stellar remnants produced at the end of a low-mass star's life, and composed mainly of electron-degenerate matter. Any debris disk or planetary system orbiting a white dwarf is thought to have survived from an earlier disk that formed around the progenitor star.  Existing theoretical understanding will be applied to these new unique circumstances to learn more about the properties of planetary systems around evolved intermediate-mass stars. The PI and his team will model the fragmentation and destruction of asteroid bodies within the debris disks, and will derive predicted observational signatures that can be compared to existing observations of white dwarf debris disks.  The PI will train and mentor a graduate student in research, involve undergraduate students in research, and develop movies for the general public illustrating the physics of planets around white dwarfs.\r\n\r\nGlobal time-dependent models for the evolution of both gaseous and solid debris disks around white dwarfs will be developed and compared with observations.  The team will also explore the origin of eccentric distortions in the disks of metallic gas, and the condensation of metallic gas onto the solid particles.  They will also explore possible role of electromagnetic effects on the disk evolution.",

This project was guided by recent exciting discoveries of  various signatures of planetary material around the white dwarfs, that must have survived through the post-main sequence evolution stage of the central star. These discoveries include (1) pollution of the white dwarf atmospheres with heavy elements (\"metals\"), (2) compact  debris disks composed of particles, which reprocess starlight and emit  in the infrared, accessible to Spitzer, as well as (3) compact gaseous  discs spatially overlapping with particulate disks in many systems.  These observed components show rich and yet unexplained dynamics, study  of which was one of the proposal's goals. In particular, the majority of  gaseous disks around the white dwarfs exhibit signatures of  non-axisymmetric features - eccentric distortions and spiral arms -  which evolve in time on year-long intervals.</p>\n<p>Moreover, recent discovery of semi-regular transit events around  WD1145 by the Kepler mission provided direct evidence for the picture of  tidal disruption of the planetary objects by the white dwarfs,  resulting in the formation of the observed disks. How such tidal  disruptions operate in the case of solid objects was one of the  questions addressed in this proposal.</p>\n<p>Finally, some additional goals emerged as the project was in  progress. In October 2017 Pan-STARRS survey detected the first  interstellar minor object - 'Oumuamua - passing through the Solar System  on a hyperbolic orbit. A number of reasons indicate that the origin of  this object may be linked to tidal disruptions of the planetary objects  by the white dwarfs, as we show in our work.</p>\n</div>\n<p>As a result of carrying out the proposed research program, we developed a theory for explaining the observed precession of gaseous debris  disks has been developed, including the effects of pressure-driven  precession as well as the general relativistic precession. Characteristic precession  timescales have been linked to other observables of the disks (inner  radii) and shown to broadly agree with observations (Fig. 1). Also, a framework for computing the potential of an apsidally-aligned,  eccentric disk has been developed, for arbitrary radial profiles of the  disk eccentricity and mass distribution (Fig. 2). Results of this work allow one  to understand the conditions under which an eccentric disk (gaseous or particulate) around a white dwarf can  coherently precess under its own self-gravity alone. We also numerically explored the dynamical effect of the spiral arms (inferred to be present in some systems) evolving into shocks on the  underlying disk in which the arms propagate.</p>\n<p>We identified the key features of the tidal disruption of solid objects  (planetoids) by analogy with stellar tidal disruption  events by the supermassive black holes. Important role of the  collisional fragmentation caused by vertical compression of the debris  in shaping the spectrum of fragments has been identified. We have also sketched the overall picture of how the highly eccentric debris resulting from the disruption event circularizes to produced the observed compact debris disks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have persuasively linked the origin of the interstellar minor object 'Oumuamua to tidal  disruption events of planetoids by the white dwarfs (Fig. 3). This production  channel explains many surprising features of this newly discovered object - its unusual  shape, size, mass budget in the Galaxy, and so on. Also, strong arguments have been advanced to suggest that the anomalous  acceleration of 'Oumuamua cannot be caused by its cometary activity,  rendering the cometary interpretation unlikely (Fig. 4). As a byproduct of this  study, a direct connection between the rate of spin evolution and &nbsp;the non-gravitational acceleration has been established observationally for the Solar System comets (Fig. 5).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Results of this project have been presented in several conferences and colloquia/seminars and documented in several publications. Some of them led to press reports in popular science outlets such as Sky &amp; Telescope, Quanta, AAS Nova. An important broader impct of this project was training of the young generation of scientists, including women in STEM fields.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</dd></dl><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/15/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Roman&nbsp;R&nbsp;Rafikov</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1551130/1551130_10330851_1547573153472_freq_period--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1551130/1551130_10330851_1547573153472_freq_period--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 1: Precession frequency/period\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1551130/1551130_10330851_1547573153472_freq_period--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 1: Precession frequency/period\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Mode precession frequency, (top), and precession period, (bottom), for a gaseous disk around the white dwarf.
