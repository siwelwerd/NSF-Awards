 "awd_abstract_narration": "To understand how humans organize and relay information, linguists need to know what linguistic structures are possible in human language.  Yet many languages that can tell us more about potential linguistic structures are no longer being spoken as fluent older speakers are not being replaced by younger speakers, thus making the loss of linguistic and cultural knowledge irreversible.  The Documenting Endangered Languages Program supports proposals, including those that create innovative software, to facilitate the efficient, rapid, and accurate digital capture of endangered language data so that this knowledge can be collected, analyzed, and made available for speakers and scientists in perpetuity.\r\n\r\nWith a three-year award Raphael Finkel of the University of Kentucky and Daniel Kaufmann of the Endangered Language Alliance will create software that allows for the rapid refinement of transcription and translation of endangered language data.   The team will test their software on data collected on two languages -- Purhepecha, an isolate spoken in Mexico, and Koda, a Munda language spoken in Bangladesh and India. \r\n\r\nA central product of language documentation projects is the annotated corpus, a collection of language samples with accompanying analytic notes on specific features such as the sounds and word and sentence structure of the language.  Kaufman and Finkel will write software that will provide web-based access to the corpus and make it possible for linguists and the speaker-community to search, browse, and edit the corpus. These additional participatory annotations will enrich and refine the corpus in ways and at a rate not previously possible.  Thus, in addition to providing valuable data on two under-described languages, the results of this project have the potential of dramatically changing the quality of language documentation products.  Data from these projects will be available at the Archive of the Indigenous languages of Latin America and the Endangered Languages Archive and Repository. The resulting software will be distributed through SourceForge.",

In addition, the grant funded three fieldwork projects alongside the software on Wakhi (an Indo-Iranian language of the Pamir region), Koda (a Munda language of India and Bangladesh) and P&rsquo;urhepecha (a language isolate of Mexico). The grant trained native speakers of these languages in recording, transcribing, translating, analyzing morphology, and other aspects of language documentation. For the Wakhi project, nearly the entire body of texts collected by previous linguists has been encoded, interlinearized and translated into English for the first time. For all languages, the project has made significant amounts of new elicited, written, and naturalistic materials available for the first time. The online software, available at <a href=\"https://www.kratylos.org\">www.kratylos.org</a>, can be used freely by all for corpus creation through uploading (privately or publicly) lexical databases, interlinear glossed text, or annotation files, with or without corresponding audio-visual media.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Kratylos improves on the query power of current field-based corpus tools by allowing regular-expression and Boolean searches over multiple tiers of interlinear glossed text. It also allows easy export of examples in a variety of formats. Kratylos is thus ideally suited for linguists who want to make syntactic generalizations over morphologically parsed field data. It is also useful for creating large phonological corpora from collections of time-aligned annotations (in Praat or ELAN) together with original media.<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Among other contributions, Kratylos has been used to uncover patterns of code-mixing in Koda (Finkel, Kaufman &amp; Shamim submitted, Kaufman &amp; Shamim in prep) and Wakhi (Perlin, Kaufman, Borjian &amp; Khujamyorova accepted) as well as to investigate Wakhi word order (Kaufman &amp; Finkel 2018) and cross-dialectal case and agreement patterns (Kaufman in prep).<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Kratylos has also facilitated online querying and browsing time-aligned annotations in archival deposits (incorporated with permission from several archives) for both linguists and non-linguists. It automatically creates video subtitles from ELAN files and presents them together with media. In addition to incorporated archival materials and other contributions, the program hosted at <a href=\"https://www.kratylos.org\">www.kratylos.org</a> currently contains all the text-based documentation sponsored by the current grant as well as that from other projects carried out by researchers at the Endangered Language Alliance.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Finally, the grant supported graduate students producing the first substantive descriptive work on Koda (Shamim 2020), an MA thesis on P&rsquo;urhepecha phonology (Camacho Cervantes 2018), and an ongoing dissertation on Iranic languages (Barry in prep).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/07/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Daniel&nbsp;Kaufman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
