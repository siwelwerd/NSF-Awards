Development of a national innovation strategy to advance a research and development for critical infrastructure resilience involves collaborative effort across the federal agencies, universities, and industry owners and operators, as critical infrastructure resilience involves energy production and distribution transportation, manufacturing and many other sectors, that are key elements for national security and the economy. The National Workshop on Resilience Research (NWRR) will gather leading researchers from academic, government and private institutions to advance a strategy to accelerate integrated efforts for developing near-ready-for-proof-of-concept technologies and applications for critical infrastructure systems. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will include a poster session for NSF Resilient Interdependent Processes and Systems (RIPS) program awardees. It will provide a venue for CRISP/RIPS program awardees to interact with each other and promote cross-fertilization of ideas. The workshop will also identify policy and economic incentives that can overcome current barriers to widespread deployment and development of technologies to address resiliency of infrastructure systems. The workshop participants will gain valuable experience from the interactions between industry, academic and federal agency participants.",
