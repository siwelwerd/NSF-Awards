 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the research program is to study the chemistry of proteins from thermophilic organisms. Thermophiles are microorganisms that live in places that are very hot and are often under very high pressure, such as deep-sea thermal vents. The program will investigate how these proteins can function at such extreme conditions, which could unfold or prevent the activity of proteins from organisms that grow under more hospitable conditions. This would allow insight into strategies that proteins use to stabilize their structure while remaining chemically active. In particular, the program will examine a class of enzymes (protein catalysts that facilitate chemical reactions) called inteins. Inteins interrupt other proteins, and must promote their own removal so that the interrupted proteins can function. Learning how this reaction is regulated may suggest roles for the splicing reaction and potentially new ways in which gene expression can be controlled. Inteins, and thermophilic enzymes more broadly, both have useful biotechnology applications, and a deeper understanding of structure and function will improve these tools. The broader impact of the program includes the development of the next generation of scientists and leaders in STEM, through direct training of undergraduate research students, through outreach to the youngest scientists in the Worcester community, and through increasing access to scientific research for under-represented groups both in the Worcester student community and with Holy Cross first year students.\r\n\r\nThe research program seeks to understand the mechanism of protein splicing, a post-translational modification catalyzed by an intein. It will study unresolved questions about the catalytic mechanism at atomic-level resolution using both X-ray crystallography and NMR structure and dynamics experiments coupled with biochemical techniques. It will use a biophysical model peptide system, integrated with computational techniques, to investigate side chain cyclization coupled to peptide bond cleavage. It will examine how the structure of thermophilic inteins influences their activity and conformational flexibility, and investigate the physiological role of splicing. In addition, the program will have significant impact on our understanding of how enzymes catalyze multi-step reactions at a single active site and how thermophilic enzymes balance activity and stability through protein dynamics.",

Extremophiles are organisms that live in environments that are inhospitable to most organisms, including halophiles, which live under conditions of very high salt concentration, and thermophiles, which live in very hot water, often at high pressure in the deep sea. We are interested in how the proteins in these organisms are able to fold and function under these conditions. Our model protein is an intein, which is a protein that interrupts other proteins, and must be excised by a process called protein splicing for the flanking protein to be active. (See Figure 1.) We are interested in the mechanism of protein splicing and how the intein catalyzes that mechanism. (See Figure 2.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One major discovery was that the two inteins in the extreme halophile <em>Halobacterium salinarum</em> require high salt concentrations to splice, as opposed to highly sequence-related inteins from thermophiles. We published this work in the journal <em>Biochemistry</em> with student co-authors. (See Figure 3.) In order to learn if the salt-dependent regulation of these inteins plays a regulatory role for the organism, we collaborated with Professor Thane Papke at the University of Connecticut to cure the organism of its inteins, and to determine if an intein-less transgenic <em>H. salinarum </em>is at a competitive advantage or disadvantage to the native organism; this work is ongoing in our labs. We have collaborated with Professor Uri Gophna at Tel Aviv University to study the activity of an intein from the halophile <em>Haloferax volcanii</em>, and have observed that mutations to an intein region distant from the active site can significantly influence salt-dependent splicing. We also have learned that multiple inteins in the same protein in <em>Haloquadratum walsbyi</em> can splice at different salt concentrations, opening the possibility of alternative splicing products.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We made discoveries about the structure and function of inteins. In collaboration with Professor Chunyu Wang at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, we used pressure-dependent NMR to learn how the activity of a mutant intein changed as a function of a change in the volume of empty space in the protein, which led to a publication in <em>Biochemistry</em>.&nbsp; We have subsequently studied the pressure dependence of the activity of two inteins in our lab, and have interesting initial results that suggest that pressure may increase the activity of some thermophilic inteins. &nbsp;Another publication in <em>Biochemistry</em> from my lab, with multiple undergraduate co-authors, shows how an intein from the extreme thermophile <em>Pyrococcus abyssi</em> can retain partial activity at low pH, despite mutation of its active site residues, by promoting an aspartic acid effect. (See Figure 4.) A student co-authored paper in <em>FEBS Letters</em> showed how the third step of protein splicing, which involves the cyclization of the amino acids asparagine or glutamine, can be catalyzed and how inteins can prevent unproductive side reactions when individual steps are slowed or accelerated. (See Figure 5.)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This work was done by undergraduate students at Holy Cross. My lab provided 22 student research positions over four summers to 19 students, including three non-Holy Cross students who were part of the Worcester Pipeline collaborative for under-represented students interested in careers in STEM. My students also worked in the school year for credit, and presented 24 posters at the student competition and general sessions at national meetings of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. We had eight participants and four student mentors in the lab for the First-year Research Advancement Program (FRAP), which I cofounded with a biology colleague in 2014 to give first-year research opportunities to academically promising students who belong to groups who traditionally do not persist in STEM, including first generation students, low income students, and under-represented minority students. We have found that FRAP participants are more likely to major in chemistry or biology than a matched non-participant group. (See Figure 6 for a photo of the 2019 graduating FRAP students as first-years with their mentors and right before graduation.)
