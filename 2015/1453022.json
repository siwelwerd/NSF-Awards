 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on how neural activity in relatively simple invertebrates encodes information about an odorant?s identity and intensity, in a manner that is robust to variations in the intensities and background contexts in which sensory stimuli can be encountered. Electrophysiological, computational and behavioral approaches are combined in this effort to determine the basic principles of olfactory information processing. The identified biological olfaction principles will also lead to development of novel signal-processing algorithms for artificial olfaction, i.e. for electronic noses used in many non-invasive chemical-sensing applications.\r\n\r\nThe technical goals of the project are to determine how response dynamics at the single neuron and population levels maintain/alter olfactory invariance and examine correlations between physiology and odor-driven behavior. An integrative approach will take advantage of the rich repertoire of genetic tools available in the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) to study single neuron dynamics, and combine it with multi-unit electrophysiological approaches that are well established in locusts (Schistocerca americana) to examine neural circuit dynamics. The biological data will be used to develop experimentally constrained models of olfactory signal processing to gain mechanistic insights and facilitate development of bio-inspired algorithms for an electronic nose.  This research will reveal how dynamic patterns of neural activity allow the olfactory system to represent odorants in a background- and concentration-invariant manner. Examination of the interactions between an external stimulus and intrinsic neural dynamics is also expected to inform a better general understanding of dynamical neuronal networks. Data and analytical approaches obtained from the proposed work will be used to develop new neural engineering modules for undergraduate and graduate courses and thereby enhance the existing biomedical engineering curriculum. Furthermore, a K-12 teachers professional development workshop: ?Where biology meets engineering? will be created to provide middle- and high-school teachers with content and tools to offer their students a meaningful exposure to the interdisciplinary nature of science education.",

This feat of pattern recognition that is still difficult to accomplish in artificial chemical sensing systems is routinely performed by most biological sensory systems. How is this capability achieved? We systematically investigated this issue using the relatively simpler invertebrate olfactory system.</p>\n<p>To achieve our goals, we developed an integrative strategy that took advantage of multi-unit electrophysiological approaches that are well established in locusts (<em>Schistocerca americana</em>) and the rich repertoire of genetic and imaging tools available in fruit fly (<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>). In addition, we developed quantitative behavioral assays to constrain our interpretation of the relevance of neural response features identified in our studies. I have summarized a few key findings from our investigations below.</p>\n<p><strong>Sensing and un-sensing a stimulus:</strong> It is well known that all sensory stimuli evoke spiking responses that are patterned across neurons and time. We found that responses elicited by odorants did not terminate after their cessation. Notably, we found two distinct sets of neurons were activated, one during the stimulus presentation (i.e., ON response) and the other after stimulus cessation (i.e., OFF response). Both ON and OFF neural responses contained information about the stimulus identity and intensity. Furthermore, the ON and OFF responses also differed in their ability to recruit recurrent inhibition, entrain field-potential oscillations, and more importantly in their relevance to behavior. While ON responses were good indicators of behavioral response initiation, the OFF responses were better indicators of when that behavioral response ended. Notably, we found that a strikingly similar information representation strategy was also used in the fruit fly olfactory system and the marmoset auditory cortex.</p>\n<p><strong>A computational logic for olfaction: </strong>&nbsp;We found that the neural responses evoked by an odorant were not stable, but varied depending on what other stimuli were encountered in the recent past. We found that the perturbations to odor-evoked neural responses were not random but allowed the olfactory neural network to enhance the uniqueness or novelty of the stimulus. Nevertheless, this adaptive strategy to encode information about the odorant identity could lead to challenges in robustly recognizing that odorant. We found that there existed a simple approach to decode information distributed in varying subsets of neurons (i.e. flexible decoding). An example of the flexible decoding approach is a very simple linear logical classifier: OR-of-ANDs (disjunction of conjunctions). Our results indeed confirm that the predictions made using an OR-of-ANDs logical classifier do precisely match with the quantitative behavioral responses evoked by odorants.</p>\n<p>We found that adapting the simple logical decoding approach by incorporating activity of ON neurons (i.e., &lsquo;evidence/case for&rsquo;)&nbsp; and suppression response in OFF neurons (i.e., &lsquo;evidence/case against&rsquo;) enhanced the recognition performance. Surprisingly, this integrative scheme was found to be sufficient to allow odorant recognition independent of several perturbations that are likely to be encountered while sensing in natural conditions.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Bioinspired methods for artificial olfaction:</strong> In artificial olfaction, our earlier work in this area focused on sensor material development and characterization (electronic, optical and, biological transducers), designing and optimizing array-based solutions for chemical sensing problems including homeland security and medical diagnostics. Using an approach inspired by how odorants are robustly recognized in the olfactory system (i.e., the OR-of-ANDs approach), we identified biomarkers in exhaled breath that could help diagnose malaria in children infected with those parasites. Furthermore, borrowing approaches used to characterize neural responses in sensory neuroscience, we developed an approach to characterize a chemical sensor&rsquo;s response that allowed robust and invariant recognition of an odorant for extended periods of operation. More recently, we developed methods to monitor neural responses in moving and behaving insects that could be exploited to develop bio-hybrid sensing technologies that potentially can exploit the sophisticated sense of smell in insects. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Dissemination of Scientific Results:</strong> Our results have been continually disseminated to the scientific community at large through publications in top-tier neuroscience or inter-disciplinary journals.
