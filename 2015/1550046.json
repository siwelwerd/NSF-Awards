 "awd_abstract_narration": "This workshop proposal focuses on helping faculty, instructors, advising and student affairs staff, and other higher education administrators from 2-year and 4-year Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) to gain greater understanding of the factors that most often contribute to Hispanic students' academic success and retention at these institutional types. Efforts to improve engineering educational outcomes among Hispanic students, especially at 2-year and 4-year HSIs, are a national priority. There is a tremendous need for the STEM workforce, especially in engineering, to be reflected of the nation's population. Current data suggest that progress is slow. The proposed workshop offers important research-based information that aims to improve college outcomes for Hispanic students by increasing higher education professionals' awareness, knowledge, and skill level with working with this student group.  Targeting faculty, instructors, advising and student affairs staff, and other higher education administrators from 2-year and 4-year HSIs, it offers great potential to yield important diversity and broaden participation outcomes in engineering.\r\n\r\nThe project proposes to recruit engineering faculty, instructors, advising and student affairs staff, and other higher education administrators from 2-year and 4-year HSIs to attend the workshop. This project will support their attendance to a preconference of Mid Years Engineering Experience. A variety of formats is proposed to deliver the professional development content (e.g., workshop style with questions and answers, panel discussions, and networking activities). A website will be used to broadly disseminate the content from the workshop.",

Several studies show two-year (2Y) college students represent 42% of undergraduate enrollment and are historically over-represented in populations underrepresented in engineering (NSF, 2014; Ogilvie, 2014; Sullivan, 2012). Recruiting and retaining 2Y students has been discussed as an avenue to increase STEM numbers. Students who start in 2Ys can face significant challenges resulting in large differences between numbers expecting to transfer versus the number who do (Bradburn, 2001, Horn, 2009, Kuh, 2006). One study revealed after six semesters of attending a 2Y, &ldquo;just 9 percent [of Hispanic students] had reached a set of criteria to be ready to transfer to a 4Y, and just one-third had met at least one of these criteria&rdquo; (Hagedorn and Lester, 2006).</p>\n<p>As shown in Figure 1 (HACU, 2015), 35.2% of undergraduate students in Texas are Hispanic. In addition, there are 75 Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) plus 47 emerging HSIs. Therefore, there is a need to better understand factors leading to improved retention of students at 2Ys, barriers preventing transfer, and strategies to improve graduation rates. The HSI Pre-conference on Retention and Transition brought experts together to discuss recent research and expose attendees to promising programs and efforts. Additionally, attendees of the pre-conference had the opportunity to join the international Mid-Years Engineering Experience Conference (MYEEC) immediately following. Throughout the MYEEC, topic/papers on diversity and challenges faced by 2Y institutions were integrated to educate and share possible solutions.</p>\n<p>At the time of the grant proposal (Summer 2015), there were 49 HSIs in Texas who were members of the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities (HACU, 2015).&nbsp; Of those, 22 were represented at the pre-conference in March 2016.&nbsp; A motivation for the proposal as well as a focus of the pre-conference was the Texas A&amp;M-Chevron Engineering Academies (Academies) where each site is a designated HSI (Perez, 2016; Cortez, 2015).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Texas A&amp;M-Chevron Engineering Academies</strong></p>\n<p>In 2013, over 17.5 million students were enrolled in US academic institutions with over 6 million in 2Ys. Texas ranked 2<sup>nd</sup> nationally in both 2Y and 4Y enrollment (Digest of Education Statistics, 2015). Texas leads the nation with over 78% (45% national average) of 4Y graduates having been enrolled at 2Ys (NSCRC, 2012). There are several ways for students to lose credit and increase time to graduation, including &ldquo;student swirl&rdquo; (back-and-forth enrollment), &ldquo;double-dipping&rdquo; (concurrent enrollment), vertical transfer (from 2Y to 4Y), and lateral transfer (from 4Y to 4Y) (Borden, 2004; Shealy, Brawner, Mobley, &amp; Layton, 2013).</p>\n<p>The Academies are a transition partnership built on an <em>intentional</em> <em>co-enrollment</em> program for students pursuing an engineering degree at Texas A&amp;M University &ndash; College Station (TAMU), thus recognizing, embracing, and supporting student swirl, vertical transfer, and double-dipping. The Academies focus on co-enrollment enabling students to take courses directly aligned with engineering at TAMU to increase graduation (ABET, 2013, Bradburn, Hurst, &amp; Peng, 2001, Johnson &amp; Muse, 2012, Kuh, 2006). While at the 2Y partner, students take courses taught by TAMU engineering faculty resulting in a TAMU transcript. This unique co-enrollment allows students to remain close to home without loss of time when completing an engineering degree from TAMU. Figure 2 depicts the transition partnership and reduced time-to-degree for students beginning at a 2Y partner.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>HSI Pre-conference Summary</strong></p>\n<p>In all, 54 faculty, staff, and administrators from 26 different 2Ys and 4Ys achieved pre-conference goals: gain a better understanding of factors contributing to student success and facilitate transition from 2Y to 4Y. The conference also provided opportunities to learn about successful strategies for retaining HSI students, hear from Hispanic/Latino students who have made the transition, and meet individuals from other HSI 2Ys and 4Ys.</p>\n<p>Attendees had the opportunity to compete for three \"HSI Excellence in Retention and Transition\" awards. Each $1,500 institution award recognized promising practices for unique retention and/or transition programs at the 2Y. In addition to being recognized during the Pre-conference, each recipient also presented during MYEEC, which allowed further conversations on HSI student success.</p>\n<p>The Pre-conference was kicked-off with a keynote from Regent Elaine Mendoza, President and CEO of Conceptual MindWorks and current Board of Regent of the TAMU System.&nbsp; A mini-workshop was presented by Dr. Sally Andrade, President of Andrade &amp; Associates.&nbsp; In addition, participants heard from panels including: students who had successfully transitioned, four HSI TAMU System schools, and representatives of the Academies. Forty-three individuals attended the Pre-conference and MYEEC. &nbsp;The MYEEC had a total of 90 individuals attend with 102 unique individuals attending one or the other event. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Pre-conference and MYEEC attendance was supported by a National Science Foundation grant (EEC - 15-50046).&nbsp; Childcare options were available to all attendees.&nbsp; <a href=\"http://myeec.org/HSI/HSIBody.htm\">http://myeec.org/HSI/HSIBody.htm</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/12/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Teri&nbsp;Reed</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1550046/1550046_10396359_1492011131204_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1550046/1550046_10396359_1492011131204_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2.
