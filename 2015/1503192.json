 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations to successfully complete high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  \r\n\r\nHoward University, lead institution for the Washington-Baltimore-Hampton Roads Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (WBHR-LSAMP) consists of a consortium of seven Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the Washington, DC, Maryland and Virginia region and six regional community colleges.  The alliance aims to continue strengthening retention of commuity college student transfer to four-year STEM degree programs and increasing the competitiveness of STEM students for graduate studies.  International research experiences for both undergraduate and graduate students in STEM programs will be emphasized. Project results will be disseminated and will incorporate social media strategies through the alliance website. Successful practices for student transfers and faculty mentoring will be also be included in the website. Scholarly publications in refereed scientific journals and presentations at STEM conferences will   be another venue for dissemination of results.\r\n  \r\nOver the next five years, the WBHR alliance will increase the number of historically underrepresented students who will complete STEM baccalaureate degrees by 25%, and the number of students entering STEM graduate programs by 30%.  The alliance will also continue to sustain and institutionalize successful retention practices. Evaluation and assessment metrics will address graduation rates, efficiency and effectiveness of program implementation, and measurable or sustainable goals. Implementation will include summer and academic research activities, facilitating transfer to four-year STEM degree programs and successful completion and fulfillment of STEM baccalaureate degree requirements. In preparation for graduate school entry, students will receive Graduate Research Examination (GRE) preparations and STEM professional development activities that include international research experiences.",
