 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Broadening Participation. The fellowship supports a research and training plan in a host laboratory for the Fellow, and a plan to broaden participation of groups under-represented in science. The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Jonathan B. Koch is \"Invasion biology, population genomics, and adaptive evolution of spotted wing Drosophila (Drosophila suzukii).\" The host institution is the University of Hawaii at Hilo (UHH), and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Donald Price. The Fellow will also collaborate on his research and training plan with Dr. Peter Follett of the USDA-ARS Daniel K. Inouye U.S. Pacific Basin Agricultural Research Center.\r\n\r\nBiological invaders are a global problem when they become agricultural pests with both enormous economic as well as ecological impacts. Within a few generations of establishment some non-native species have been found to persist and adapt to novel environments, exhibit increased growth rates, and acquire behavioral traits that promote their invasion success. Drosophila suzukii (SWD) is such an invader.   It is a world-wide agricultural pest and has also emerged as a model species to study the evolution of invasiveness. The fellowship research identifies the evolutionary mechanisms that have enabled SWD to invade and adapt to the mosaic of ecosystems found in Hawaii. Activities include a survey of SWD populations throughout the major Hawaiian Islands and genome sequencing.  Elucidating the mechanisms that drive a biological invasion increases fundamental understanding of the genetic processes that promote the persistence of immigrant species and may promise approaches to mitigate the invasion.  \r\n\r\nTraining goals include gaining experise in evolutionary biology, population genomics, and bioinformatics as well as career advancement activities.  Educational outreach includes serving as a role model and mentor to graduate and undergraduate students and developing a K-6 curriculum addressing basic concepts in ecology, evolution, and conservation. The curriculum is intended for local Hawaii schools and freely available through the UHH NSF PRISM website. Public outreach includes producing a short documentary on the SWD invasion in Hawaii with GoPro technology, to be available on social media.",
