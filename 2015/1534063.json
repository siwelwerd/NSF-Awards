 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project is to demonstrate a low cost, environmentally friendly co-extrusion fabrication method for producing high surface area micro- and nanofiber based nonwoven fuel filter sheets.  The micro-/nanofiber nonwoven structures are fabricated from two different hydrophilic and hydrophobic polymers in a melt co-extrusion and subsequent exfoliation processing step.  The resulting porous filtration media sheets have been shown to possess superior strength, tailorable pore sizes, and fuel filtration efficiency on par with currently utilized commercial fuel filter products.  These accomplishments signify a path forward to a highly scalable manufacturing process for producing low cost thermoplastic filter products in addressing the increasingly stringent EPA regulation of ppm level water contaminant. The reduced manufacturing process complexity in melt co-extrusion is estimated to provide up to 60% reduced production costs when scaled to commercial production quantities. Additionally, a significant environmental impact will be realized through adoption of this novel production technology over competitive processes owing to its ?greener? solvent-free manufacturing aspects that eliminates the annual need for millions of gallons of organic solvents and supporting reclamation equipment currently utilized by the filtration industry in creating elctrospun and wet-laid composite nonwoven filtration media.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this Phase II research project are to fabricate nano/micro scale nonwoven fibrous filter mats for fuel filters via a novel melt co-extrusion approach, with high fuel/water filtration efficiency and superior mechanical properties, in a commercially relevant production scale, towards addressing the stringent EPA 2010 filtration regulations and its upcoming revisions in 2015. The first generation filter prototypes fabricated in Phase I STTR program exhibited up to a ten-fold increase in surface area, up to a two-fold increase in porosity and up to a six-fold the deformation strength of the commercial filters. The coextruded microporous filter fiber size distribution was comparable to a commercial melt-blown process sample and superior to the leading wet-laid technology samples. Preliminary filtration efficiency experiments on the coextruded micro-fiber filtration media prototypes exhibited 60 to greater than 80 % separation of water from ultra-low sulfur diesel as compared to 80 % water separation using commercial filter under same testing conditions. The commercial interest for the new multilayered, coextruded filtration media processing technique is centered on identification of new filtration media film polymer materials, achieving nano-sized pore distributions for improved filtration efficiency and achieving scale-up production cost savings through the improved filter film processing technique.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA new approach to manufacturing porous filter media for a water/fuel separator device were development and successfully demonstrated improved filtration rates in a commercially relevant prototype device.  Utilizing a polymer coextrusion and two-dimensional multiplication processing technique, bundled fiber-films comprised of thousands of nano/micro fibrous structures were produced on a continuous pilot scale.  Subsequent fiber-film exposure to hydrofracturing roll-to-roll processing resulted in the creation of porous micro- and/or nanofiber composite polymer products.  NSF Phase II STTR program efforts were centered around technology development areas to: (1) increase manufacturable sizes of fiber films from laboratory to commercial device relevant scales, (2) mature manufacturing process technology to achieve product performance and uniformity similar or better than a commercial fuel filter separator product in terms of pore size, surface areas, mechanical media strength, and water/fuel separation ability.  Additional efforts under the Phase II STTR program included an effort by Case Western Reserve University to extend processing capabilities of the 2D layered coextrusion approach to produce filters comprised of fibers with dimensions approaching 100 nanometers and vary the hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the two polymer material filters for future product customization.  Results of the Phase II STTR program achieved the main development goal of expanding the materials manufacturing technology to produce high quality layered polyamide-6 (PA6) polypropylene (PP) filter materials up to 15? feet in length that were converted into a full-size fuel/water filter prototype which was tested to have 4X better separation efficiency as compared to a commercial product.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Ponting"
