 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs). Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects. There are few examples of research that demonstrates causal impacts of professional development on teachers' knowledge and practice and student learning. This study will examine the impact of the Learning and Teaching Geometry (LTG) professional development for secondary mathematics teachers on the teachers' knowledge and classroom instruction, as well as on their students' learning. As the nation invests vast resources in the professional development of teachers to meet new curriculum and instruction challenges, exploring the efficacy of professional development is important to understand how best to direct those resources. \r\n\r\nUsing a cluster randomized design, the project will sample from 132 teachers (66 per condition) from 28 middle and high schools to participate in a 2-year implementation of the LTG professional development, facilitated by highly trained facilitators to study the efficacy of the materials. The project will monitor the fiedity of implementation of the LTG using a professional development session logging tool and Facilitator Interview Protocol. Outcome measures include measures of teacher knowledge, teaching practice, and student learning of geometry. Analyses will include two- and three-level hierarchical linear models to estimate the effects of participation in the LTG professional development and growth over time.",

Across four measures of teacher knowledge, a significant effect of the LTG PD program was found on 16% of the content subscales (including congruence transformations, dilation, similarity, and geometry), suggesting that the participating teachers increased their knowledge in several of the focal content areas. However, the fact that the findings are not particularly robust across measures suggests that teachers\u2019 knowledge gains may not be generalizable across mathematics contexts or instruments and/or the program may not have a particularly strong impact on teachers\u2019 knowledge. \nClassroom practice. Compared to the impacts on teacher knowledge, impacts of the LTG PD on classroom practice were considerably more robust and pervasive. Importantly, the teachers\u2019 instructional improvements were not limited to a single content area or to only the geometric content covered by the LTG PD, meaning that the program can support teachers\u2019 ability to make widespread changes in practice across grades and topics. Further, these changes occurred despite the lack of larger gains in knowledge, and despite the fact that the content focus of the PD was relatively narrow in scope. Moreover, teachers\u2019 sustained their implementation of these improved practices for a year during which they received no further PD as part of this study. \nStudent knowledge. Although both treatment and control groups of students made similar gains in most of the content areas measured, participating in the LTG PD was directly related to student learning of congruence transformations. Given that an understanding of congruence transformations is generally considered foundational for learning dilation, it is promising that students of the treatment teachers exhibited the most growth in this challenging area of geometry.\nIntellectual merit. As teachers improve their own knowledge and instructional strategies, they can support students to gain a deeper understanding of transformations-based geometry, which strongly connects to other critical domains including proportional reasoning, slope, and linear functions.

Context-based effects should be expected at least to some degree given that learning occurs within communities comprised of individuals with different backgrounds and prior experiences. \nBroader impacts. The results of this efficacy study of the LTG PD have broad implications for research on the design and implementation of programs to support teacher learning. Teachers\u2019 participation in the LTG PD intervention supported critical gains in both knowledge and practice, with particularly large gains in instructional practice. Most researchers in the field theorize that knowledge gains precede practice gains. In our study, teachers in Location A exhibited more knowledge gains, whereas teachers\u2019 in Location B improved their instructional quality in more domains. The fact that some teachers made substantial gains in practice without showing similarly robust gains in knowledge warrants further investigation.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jennifer K Jacobs"
