 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this research is to better understand the connection between mid-latitude clouds and dynamics in observations. The reasons for why the such linkages are well-represented in some global climate models but not in others will be studied. The implications of these processes on model climate sensitivity and future climate projections will also be examined. In the first part of the project, observed and model cloud radiative properties will be composited with respect to the centers of cyclones and anticyclones over the mid-latitude oceans of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, to examine in the sectors of weather systems linked to model biases and uncertainties in future climate projections. \r\n\r\nIn the second part of the project, idealized model experiments will be performed using two versions of the Community Atmosphere Model with very different representations of Southern Ocean cloud radiative properties. In both model versions, quadrupled carbon dioxide experiments will be run with the radiative properties of the clouds enabled and disabled, in order to explore the role of varying cloud-radiative effects in governing the response of the Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude jet to increased greenhouse gas forcing. By better understanding cloud-radiative-dynamical connections in observations and how they are misrepresented in models, the proposed project not only can improve theoretical knowledge of the role of clouds in the climate system, but also can provide additional constraints on cloud parameterizations that will help to reduce uncertainty in future model projections.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany computer models show that, when the jet stream at midlatitudes shifts poleward, clouds change in such a way to create a positive (warming) feedback on Earth's surface temperature.  However, this effect is not as clearly seen in satellite observations, suggesting that it may be overestimated in models.  This project investigated the underlying physical processes responsible for this potential feedback, as correcting any model biases is likely to improve the accuracy of future climate projections.  The project's research found that the midlatitude clouds in many models are too sensitive to upward and downward motion and not sensitive enough to horizontal and vertical temperature variations above the ocean surface.  These biases are most pronounced in the warm sector of extratropical low-pressure systems and in the center of extratropical high-pressure systems.\n\nRecent studies have also shown that biases in clouds not only affect temperature, but they can also affect the representation of weather systems.  New idealized model simulations performed as part of this project showed that, if clouds are not properly represented, they can introduce small biases in the number, strength, and lifetime of the low-pressure systems that drive much of the precipitation at midlatitudes.  Consequently, improving the representation of clouds in computer models may help to provide more accurate future projections of midlatitude weather systems. \n\nFinally, the project also explored the relationship between the jet stream position and globally averaged surface temperature.  Future changes in atmospheric wind patterns, such as the jet stream, are often assumed to scale with global temperature, meaning that if the magnitude of global temperature change is known, future changes in wind patterns can be better estimated.  However, this project's research showed that some aspects of atmospheric wind patterns respond more directly to changes in atmospheric composition than the global temperature, meaning that existing theories tying changes in atmospheric winds to increasing temperature are inadequate to explain all aspects of future changes in the winds.\n\nIn terms of broader impacts, efforts to improve the accuracy of climate prediction models will ultimately improve the reliability of future climate projections and thus improve the information provided to stakeholders and policy makers to prepare for future climate change.  The project also contributed to the mentoring and training of two graduate students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/07/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin M Grise"
