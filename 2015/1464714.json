 "awd_abstract_narration": "Significance and importance of the project.  Nucleation of earthquakes on tectonic-scale faults in the Earth?s crust is controlled, remarkably, by frictional processes that originate at micro- and nano-scale contacts between fault surfaces. The earthquake cycle is typically studied via computer models incorporating any of everal empirical friction laws. Such models reproduce a rich variety of observed earthquake phenomena, despite the fact that the friction laws upon which they are founded lack a physical basis. Stated simply, the identities of the physical mechanisms that occur at nanoscale contacts between the fault materials are unknown.  Without a sound physical basis, the researchers are severely limited in our abilities to reliably extrapolate existing friction laws from laboratory measurements to natural systems, and ultimately to reliably predict approaching earthquakes. That the friction laws lack a physical basis largely reflects the difficulty of isolating and studying processes that occur at nanoscale fault contacts.  In this transformative study, the researchers will employ cutting-edge methods of materials science, principally atomic force microscopy, nanoindentation, and microindentation, to isolate the frictional mechanisms that occur in experiments on rocks and on faults in nature. Using these methods, the researchers will isolate the frictional mechanisms occurring at a single contact on a fault surface, rather than measure the integrated behaviors of many contacts at once (as in laboratory experiments on rocks).  The researchers aim to use this ?bottom-up? approach to establish a robust, physics-based foundation for existing friction laws and to proscribe their limits of applicability. The research may ultimately allow them to determine whether they are able to detect accelerating creep on faults days to hours prior to an earthquake, which would save many lives and mitigate damages to human infrastructures. From the perspective of the scientific disciplines of solid mechanics and materials science, insights gained by identifying and connecting frictional behavior across many length scales have potential application well beyond geophysics, for example, in many engineered systems, including silicon-based micromechanical devices. \r\n\r\nTechnical description. The overarching goals of the proposed research are to isolate and identify the physical mechanisms that occur at the nanoscale asperity contacts which comprise macroscopic frictional interfaces.  More specifically, the researchers seek to answer arguably the most fundamental question regarding existing rate- and state-variable friction laws as they pertain to the earthquake cycle ? What is the physical mechanism(s) that gives rise to the observed time dependence of friction?  The frictional stability of an interface ? i.e., whether friction decreases or increases with increasing slip rate, and therefore whether an earthquake can nucleate or not, respectively ? depends critically on the magnitude of the time dependence of friction, otherwise known as frictional ?ageing?.  In our previous work, they established that a canonical observation from friction experiments on rocks and other engineering materials ? that friction increases linearly with the log of the time of stationary contact ? can be amply explained quantitatively by either 1) creep of contacts at sufficiently high contact stresses (Goldsby et al., J. Mater. Res., 2004) or 2) increased adhesive strength of contacts (stronger chemical bonding) in the absence of contact creep (Li et al., Nature, 2012). Explanation 2 is based on our atomic force microscopy (AFM) friction tests on single nanoscale silica-silica contacts (Li et al., Nature, 2012). Intriguingly, the magnitude of ageing in the AFM tests is far larger than in laboratory friction experiments on rocks, by up to a factor of 100. This discrepancy is readily explained by a contact mechanics model allowing for inhomogeneous slip on a multi-asperity interface (Li et al., Nature, 2012). In addition, microindentation experiments and complementary friction experiments on quartz at low (2.2) pH and neutral (7) pH reveal no difference in indentation size between tests at either pH, no ageing in rock friction tests at pH 2.2, but strong ageing at pH 7.  These observations strongly suggest that ageing is due to time-dependent adhesion rather than contact creep, a conclusion that runs counter to the prevailing wisdom. However, further work is required to determine if there are conditions where both mechanisms can occur. In this new work, more sophisticated experiments will allow us to discriminate between plastic deformation and adhesion effects on frictional ageing. The researchers will employ AFM, interfacial force microscopy, nanoindentation, microindentation, and rock friction experiments to investigate the influences of water, temperature, and chemical environment (namely, pH) on asperity creep and adhesion. The researchers will also employ sophisticated in situ nanoindentation in the transmission electron microscope to study, in real time, plastic deformation and changes in chemical bonding using high resolution imaging, electron diffraction, electron energy loss spectroscopy, and energy dispersive spectroscopy.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit - Friction is the force of resistance to sliding two objects against each other. Friction is a beneficial aspect of everyday life - think of the friction between tires and the road that allows cars to be steered and stopped, or the friction between shoes and the sidewalk that allows us to walk without falling down.  Deep within the Earth, earthquakes result from changes in the amount of friction on faults (cracks) in the Earth's crust, the outermost, relatively cold and therefore brittle skin of the Earth. Laboratory friction experiments on rocks allow Earth scientists to study their friction in a controlled manner. A simple system of equations has been developed that describes the friction observed in laboratory experiments on rocks (and other materials).  These equations are often used in mathematical models of earthquakes; however, the equations, while useful, are not well understood, making it difficult to apply them with confidence to earthquakes.\n\nIn this study, we have used new methods to study the friction of rocks in laboratory experiments.  In particular, we have used state-of-the-art techniques, such as atomic force microscopy and nanoindentation, to study friction of rocks at very small scales &ndash; i.e., one-millionth to one-billionth of a meter.  Because the opposing surfaces of a fault only touch at such microscopic or smaller spots, friction is determined by the processes that occur at these small scales. Thus, the occurrence of earthquakes, which can happen over scales of hundreds of kilometers, is ultimately determined by processes occurring at very small scales.\n\nUsing the atomic force microscope, we demonstrated that the equations described above, with appropriate modification, can also describe the friction that occurs at the scale of nanometers.  More importantly, we have linked the observed changes in friction as we vary the sliding speed and the time of contact in the atomic force microscope to a specific process, namely chemical bonding that occurs at the tiny spots of contact on faults. Our experimental findings are also supported by molecular simulations by CoPI Szlufarska.\n\nUsing the nanoindenter, we have also shed light on the process that leads to the time dependence of friction, whereby friction increases with the time that two rocks in contact are held stationary.  In a nanoindenter, a tiny diamond indenter tip is pressed into a mineral with a controlled amount of force on the tip.  The high force concentrated over a tiny contact causes the mineral to deform, and thus the strength of the mineral to be determined.  Our experiments show that there is no change in the strength of the mineral quartz with changes in the humidity around the sample.  This behavior contrasts with friction experiments on quartz rocks, which show that changing the humidity yields dramatic changes in friction.  Our study shows that such changes in friction cannot result from changes in the strength of minerals on a fault surface, challenging the prevailing view held for nearly 50 years.\n\nTaken together, our study, using these new experimental techniques, has shown that the formation of strong chemical bonds at contact spots on a fault produces the observed friction behavior.  Thus, we have begun to radically change the conventional wisdom for the friction laws used to understand the occurrence of earthquakes.\n\nBroader Impacts - This project supported the training of four graduate students, two at the University of Pennsylvania and two at the University of Wisconsin.  The results of this study were incorporated in coursework taught by the PI and the CoPIs at Penn and Wisconsin, and were disseminated in lectures by the principal investigators at various universities and at scientific meetings.  Our results were also broadly disseminated in high-impact journals, such as Physical Review Letters.  Due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of the work, the project also exposed tribologists and materials scientists (Co-PIs Carpick, Szlufarska, and their students) to the earthquake problem, and provided valuable training for geophysicists Goldsby (PI) and his student Chris Thom in atomic force microscopy and nanoindentation mechanics.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/14/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David L Goldsby"
