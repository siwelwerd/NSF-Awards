 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recruitment and retention of underrepresented students in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) is a national priority. A growing body of evidence suggests that involving undergraduates in communities of scholars and in research can play an important role in motivating students from underrepresented populations to become involved in science. This project will develop multiple mathematical pathways (Mathways) to expand the pool of students who participate in collaborative mathematics research and instruction, by connecting two successful programs at the University of Illinois: the Merit Program for Emerging Scholars and the Illinois Geometry Lab (IGL).  The Merit Program has a strong record of building communities of scholars, especially from underrepresented populations, who successfully complete introductory mathematics courses including calculus.  The project will recruit students from the Merit Program into the Illinois Geometry Lab, a community for undergraduate research and outreach in mathematics.\r\n\r\nMathways will serve as a national model for increasing the pipeline of STEM-engaged students, in particular students from underrepresented minority groups. Mathways has three main components: the participation of Merit students in IGL research projects, mentored by NSF-supported Mathways postdocs; the creation of a Mathways summer camp in which these research students will serve as mentors for 8th and 9th grade students participating in guided-self-discovery projects; and an independent evaluation and assessment of these activities.",
