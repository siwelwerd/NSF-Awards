 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Washington State University Vancouver (WSUV), located in Vancouver, WA, will support the training of 8 students for 9 weeks during each summer from 2015-2017, within the School of the Environment.  The scientific themes are landscape ecology and ecosystem dynamics, contrasting terrestrial and aquatic systems within the Columbia River Basin (CRB).  The CRB extends across Washington state and serves as a 'living laboratory' within which to explore how biotic and abiotic factors shape ecosystem form and function. Each summer experience is designed to engage undergraduates in high-quality research and improve skills in scientific inquiry and communication, promote collaboration and the responsible conduct of research, and provide meaningful professional development and social opportunities.  The WSUV REU site is targeted specifically toward talented undergraduates who are 'place bound' within the Vancouver, WA/Portland, OR metropolitan area, and attend one of the region's 4-year and 2-year colleges.  This REU site also considers applicants from across the US, and works with every accepted student to secure summer housing.  Students who have completed at least one year of undergraduate study may apply online through the WSUV REU website noted below.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 24 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences.  More specifically, this REU project promotes participation of highly qualified undergraduate students who are typically excluded from immersive summer research experiences due only to their inability to leave home for extended periods. \r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) is used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://vancouver.wsu.edu/reu or by contacting the PI (Dr. Gretchen Rollwagen-Bollens, rollboll@vancouver.wsu.edu).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n      Our Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) project, entitled Landscape Ecology and Ecosystem Dynamics of the Columbia River Basin: Integrating Terrestrial and Aquatic Perspectives, was active from 2015 ? 2018 on the Vancouver, WA, campus of Washington State University (WSU).  Geographically, the Columbia River Basin (CRB) is the wide and varied expanse of land in the Pacific Northwest that encompasses the watershed of the Columbia River - one of the largest river systems in North America.  The CRB extends across 7 US states and two provinces in Canada, and narrows on its west side into a more narrow basin surrounding the Columbia River as it carves its way across the state of Washington, from the rolling hills of the Palouse covered with winter wheat and alfalfa in the east, through the Cascade Mountains and the iconic Columbia Gorge, toward the US west coast and into a large estuary, where it releases enormous amounts of freshwater into the coastal ocean.  From a cultural, social, economic and political perspective the CRB encompasses an equally rich and varied history of confluence - the intersection of tribal cultures with European settlers and rapid technological changes expanding the economic base from primarily agricultural to thriving industries driven by the cheap energy and irrigation potential of the river itself.\n\n      In our REU project, we built upon the unique position of Washington State University, with campuses located on either side of the state, and faculty in the WSU School of the Environment whose internationally-recognized research is focused on the natural history, ecosystems and landscape dynamics of the CRB.  We based our REU project on the Vancouver, WA, campus of WSU, located in southwest Washington state and directly on the lower Columbia River, that served as the base for numerous field research experiences for undergraduates in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats in the CRB.  The Ecosystem Ecology and Landscape Dynamics REU project at WSU Vancouver engaged primarily non-traditional (e.g. community college, veteran, older, first generation) and under-represented minority (URM) undergraduates from the Vancouver, WA-Portland, OR region in scientific research that increased our understanding of how abiotic vs. biotic drivers differentially impact the dynamics of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in the CRB.
