 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stable governance in developing countries, especially in nascent democracies with long histories of authoritarian rule, is a national security interest of the United States. While rule of law is considered a hallmark of stable governance, it is often lacking in these regions. Over the past half-century, American efforts to build democratic rule of law in developing countries have encountered limited successes and repeated failures. This project aims to uncover the origins of undemocratic legal systems in the developing world and why they are so resistant to reform during transitions to more democratic governance by focusing on the institutional choices made by governments during key periods of authoritarian consolidation. During the early years of dictatorship, some dictators confer legal authority to the formal judiciary, while others choose to erect ad hoc legal forums. These decisions have lasting legacies in determining the locus of judicial authority in developing countries, which ultimately affects how justice operates and who it ultimately serves. This has further implications for the protection of human rights under dictatorship. For American policymakers, identifying the stakeholders in authoritarian legal systems is thus an imperative first step towards creating effectively targeted reforms and building democratic rule of law abroad.\r\n\r\nTo understand how authoritarian legal systems in developing countries have emerged and evolved over time, this project utilizes mixed-methods analysis that combines both qualitative process-tracing techniques and statistical analysis. Original data will be gathered from British and American archives containing records on the political and legal development of developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. Archival research will leverage a variety of underutilized historical documents -- including party documents, official correspondences, judicial registers, court rulings, and memoires -- to understand how legal institutional design emerged and evolved across a large portion of the developing world. Using process-tracing techniques, case studies of countries such as Malawi, Kenya, and Burma will provide insight into how legal and authoritarian power was structured in the postcolonial period, and also examine how early legal decisions had lasting legacies that persist until today. Archival data will also be instrumental in creating an original cross-national dataset of cases that have been adjudicated in a variety of legal forums. This dataset, covering the period from independence to the modern day, will help identify generalizable patterns of legal decision-making across countries and over time. \r\n\r\nThis research project contributes to the understanding of authoritarian legal systems and the consolidation of dictatorships across a large portion of the developing world. It will deepen theoretical and empirical understanding of these themes in three important ways. First, it will help identify how despotic power can have long-lasting effects on the design and operation of legal institutions, even after the transition to democracy. Second, it will draw attention to the political effects of legal institutions in countries of Sub-Saharan-Africa and Southeast Asia, regions that have become critical economic and diplomatic partners of the United States. Third, it will provide new data on legal design from a critical period of nation-building in developing countries that can be employed for other studies extending beyond the scope of this project. This data will be made publicly available upon publication of the findings.",
