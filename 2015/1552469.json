 "awd_abstract_narration": "This exploratory research will study the development of NASA's mission to Jupiter's moon Europa, in order to understand how large, complex, cyber-human systems get started; how their team members develop and then implement a shared vision for their system given heterogeneous backgrounds and collaborative experiences; and what role these activities play in future science and technology outcomes. The Europa robot space probe will repeatedly scan this icy moon that may possess subsurface lakes comparable to those in Antarctica, using nine distinct computerized instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, a magnetometer, and a thermal instrument.  While no hardware or software for the Europa mission yet exists, over the period of the research members of the planetary science community will engage in a frenzy of mission activity to turn their plans for space exploration into tangible technologies, building the cyber-human system that will enable their collaborative mission to the Jupiter system. This is a rare opportunity to observe a highly innovative cyber-human team forming for the first time, before their system is constructed, as they ask the questions and articulate the values that will establish the core elements of their eventual information system. \r\n \r\nFour elements of this cyber-human system will be studied during their formation: the question of integration (of science, hardware and software), the question of data management (how to balance expertise and sharing), the question of heritage (individuals with multiple mission heritages and different institutions), and the question of trajectory (how decisions early in the project affect activity downstream). Findings will prove crucial to our understanding of how a group dynamic becomes established that ultimately affects the developed information system from the ground up especially in the case of a long-lived system. The project will also contribute to our understanding of data management and standards-setting in scientific groups, and presents an unusual opportunity to engage ethnographically with a community with an interest in how cyber-human systems research might inform their work. Findings about data management, integration, and long-livedness that can take into account the nested, overlapping, and co-extensive nature of these collaborations will go further to support upcoming collaborations at NASA and beyond.",
