 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award is to acquire a microwave vector network analyzer that will serve to continue building research capacity in the engineering and physics departments at San Francisco State University (SFSU) and to expand faculty and student research opportunities. The requested instrument will be used for high-frequency characterization that is essential for establishing robust, experimentally-driven research programs at the forefront of materials, device and circuit research.  Combined with the probe station, it is a key addition to SFSU's Advanced Integrated Circuit (IC) Testing Center. Specific research programs that will be supported include: wireless sensing, high-speed integrated circuits and systems, nano-scale devices, photonic gap structures and nano-materials.  The instrument will provide investigators at SFSU the platform to collaborate on long-awaited research focused on wireless implant, spin-transfer torch memory, memristor based circuit and photonic bandgap operating in the microwave range.  The instrument will be used for characterizing wireless sensors and implants for health-centric cyber physical system development, and spin-transfer torch and memristor based circuits for the next generation memory and computing systems.  It will provide investigators at SFSU the urgently needed tool to collaborate with industries that specialize in microwave equipment and components to continue building nationally-known student training programs. \r\n\r\nInstrument acquisition will enhance research capacity at one of the nation's most ethnically and culturally diverse universities (63% non-white; 32% underrepresented minorities) that is a vibrant public university of engagement, opportunity and scholarly activity. It will advance the research careers of investigators at SFSU by bridging the gap between theoretical modeling and experimental validation. The instrument will provide a vehicle for reaching out to the broader scientific community and partner with emerging leaders in the basic scientific and applied medical research community to enable the development of innovative technologies driven by new needs.  It will add a research focus to the already strong teaching program, and position the engineering and physics departments to emerge as leaders in developing premier national education programs. Enabled by the state-of-the-art microwave measurement tool, students will engage in cutting-edge research, thereby getting a head start when applying for competitive positions in industry or Ph.D. programs. The instrument will be integrated into the existing undergraduate and graduate engineering and physics curricula. Tutorials and manuals on microwave measurement theories and practices using the proposed instrument will be shared with SFSU students as well as the larger community via online publications. Instrument acquisition will strengthen already-established programs with local community colleges and provide their students unparalleled opportunities to conduct summer research. Overall, the instrument will pave the way to increase diversity while training the next generation of a highly skilled engineering and physics workforce.",
