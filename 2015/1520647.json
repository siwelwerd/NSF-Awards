 "awd_abstract_narration": "Melt segregation in a deforming partially molten rock ? An experimental investigation of the consequences of viscous anisotropy Kohlstedt - \r\n\r\nExtraction of melt from mantle rocks composed of solid grains plus 1 or 2% melt results in eruption of magma at Earth?s surface. This process controls the chemical and physical evolution of our planet. Since processes occurring at great depths are not directly observable, much of our understanding of the dynamics of partially molten regions of Earth?s interior relies on numerical/computer models of the behavior of partially molten rocks. The starting point for models of a mechanically weak melt in a strong but deformable rock is known as two-phase flow theory. Application of this theory to large-scale processes occurring far below Earth?s surface requires equations describing the viscosity (strength) and the rate at which melt flows through a rock. An important test of the validity of models used to describe the interactions of deformation, melt distribution, and melt migration in the mantle is their ability to explain phenomena observed in laboratory experiments on partially molten rocks.\r\n\r\nA fundamental breakthrough in the theory describing the dynamics of partially molten rocks occurred with the publication of three fundamental papers in 2009. These papers explored the implications of anisotropic viscosity (i.e., the directional dependence of the strength of a rock) on melt distribution during deformation. It was hypothesized that viscosity (strength) should be anisotropic because pockets of melt become aligned during deformation. Based on this anisotropic grain-scale melt distribution, it was predicted that melt-rich bands should develop in deforming rocks, consistent with previously experimental observations. This analysis also predicted that solid and melt should segregate from regions of low stress to regions of high stress. Our recent experiments, in fact, demonstrated this behavior in partially molten samples deformed in torsion in our laboratory. A key aspect of our research is a synergistic collaboration with scientists at the University of Oxford (computer models) and Tokyo (theory). Through our cooperative efforts, models based on two-phase flow theory will be tested against experimental observations in order to advance our understanding of how melt flows in Earth?s mantle. While agreement between theory and experiment is clearly important, discrepancies represent an avenue for progress in refining theory. Discrepancies between theoretical prediction and experimental observation represent an opportunity to refine our understanding of the grain-scale mechanics of partially molten rocks. Thus, well-designed experiments with detailed analysis of melt distribution, melt segregation, and mechanical properties are essential. A unique aspect of this research is our involvement in STEM outreach in Mexico though ?Clubes de ciencia M\u00e9xico?, an organization of science outreach and mentoring for high school and undergraduate students in Mexico. The science clubs are one-week long, very interactive workshops designed to initiate students to science and research; special focus is given to scientific reasoning and ethics. A recent workshop on ?How do rocks flow?? illustrated the necessity of experimental studies for understanding our planet?s evolution. Outreach will continue through a website and outreach workshops, using our current experimental investigations to explain the implications of experimental research for understanding large-scale dynamics of our planet.",

That is, viscosity is not isotropic, rather it is highly anisotropic.  This anisotropic behavior results from the anisotropic distribution of melt that develops during deformation of the rock.  It was hypothesized that viscosity should be anisotropic because pockets of melt become aligned during deformation.  Basically, if melt pockets align east-west, then the viscosity will be smaller in that direction than in the north-south direction.  Furthermore, this analysis predicted that melt should segregate from regions within the rock that are experience a low stress to regions under a high stress. \n\n We tested this hypothesis, and thus a fundamental prediction of two-phase flow theory, with newly designed experiments.  Our recent high-temperature, high-pressure laboratory experiments demonstrated this exact behavior in partially molten samples deformed in torsion and in partially molten samples extruded through a narrow pipe.

The science clubs are one-week long, very interactive workshops designed to initiate students to science and research; special focus is given to scientific reasoning and ethics.  Dr. Alejandra Quintanilla Terminel helped organize and lead a recent workshop on \"How do rocks flow?\".   With her expertise in experimental studies of rock deformation research, Alejandra illustrated the necessity of experimental studies for understanding our planet?s evolution.  This step is very important because, for many students, it is difficult to understand how experiments carried out in a laboratory on a small sample over a relatively short (geologically speaking) time can have anything to say about the behavior of a huge planet with high mountains, deep oceans, and erupting volcanoes.  Thus, it is critical to use results from our experimental investigations to explain the implications of experimental research for understanding large-scale dynamical and chemical behavior of our planet.\n\nAnother part of our Broader Impacts is the important training of the next generation of scientists and citizens.  In specific, one postdoctoral researcher, Dr. Alejandra Quintanilla Terminel, developed skills that helped position her for her current position in outreach at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  Two undergraduates also worked on this research project.  Although their assignments were supportive in nature (e.g., preparing samples for experiments), they were immersed in the day-to-day activities in a research lab.  Such experiences not only build skills but also expose students to scientific thinking and hypothesis testing.  For some students, the result is graduate school, while for others, it makes clear that working for a consulting company or a government agency is a better choice.  In both cases, students leave as informed citizens with a deeper insight into the importance of scientific research.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/18/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David L Kohlstedt"
