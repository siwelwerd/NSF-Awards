The main objective of the conference is to bring together leading experts in the separate but related fields of differential geometry, geometric analysis and algebraic geometry, to present recent results and future directions of research in the field. The conference is organized in conjunction with the 30th Shanks Lecture Series. Professor S-T. Yau (Harvard University) will deliver the 2014 Shanks Lecture. The conference will attract mathematicians from underrepresented groups as well as graduate students and young researchers who will greatly benefit from the wide spectrum of topics to be presented at the conference.\r\n\r\nKahler geometry is an area with deep roots and very rapid and diverse advances. Remarkable progress has been made recently in different directions such as the study of Kahler-Einstein metrics on Fano manifolds, and complete Calabi-Yau manifolds with prescribed asymptotical behavior. Another very active area of research concerns the study of extremal Kahler metrics and their link with algebraic-geometric notions of stability on polarized manifolds.  The topics of the presentations include, but are not limited to, the following areas: Kahler-Einstein metrics, complete Calabi-Yau manifolds with prescribed asymptotical behavior, extremal Kahler metrics, moduli space of Kahler metrics, Kahler Ricci flow, Hermitian manifolds.  More details about the conference, as well as the list of speakers, are available at the conference website, at: \r\nhttp://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/kahlergeometry",
