 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) Program collaborative research award will develop an integrated design-manufacture framework by coupling topology optimization design methods with additive manufacturing processes. Topology optimization is a systematic, computational tool for designing high performance devices and components.  Topology-optimized designs, however, are often geometrically complex and thus difficult, if not impossible, to fabricate with traditional manufacturing processes. Additive manufacturing is arising as a potential means for overcoming this obstacle, as its layer-wise fabrication approach enables the creation of geometrically complex components without negatively affecting production cost or throughput. However, despite this natural synergy, additive manufacturing and topology optimization approaches have not yet been integrated into a comprehensive design-manufacture framework. Without this integration, topology-optimized designs may be incompatible with additive manufacturing and require tedious and potentially deleterious post-process alterations to conform to manufacturing restrictions.  The primary goal of this research is thus to optimize parts for as-built conditions by (i) identifying, characterizing, and understanding the aspects of an additive manufacturing process that impose constraints on part geometry and (ii) advancing topology optimization methods to incorporate these constraints. Thus the work will substantially improve both the efficiency of the engineering design process and the efficacy of the resultant engineered artifacts.  The integrated design-manufacture optimization capability will be of considerable benefit to a broad range of industries, including automotive, agricultural, and aerospace where (for example) the realization of lightweight large-scale components could lead to substantial energy savings. The multidisciplinary research team will also create integrated educational modules and provide research opportunities for underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nAs manufacturing constraints are specific to each additive manufacturing process, the research team will focus on designing components to be manufactured via the 3D sand printing process in which metal parts are made by casting molten metal into 3D printed sand molds.  The team will identify, characterize, and quantify the aspects of this additive manufacturing and metal casting process chain that impose constraints on component geometry and mathematically incorporate these constraints into the topology optimization method.  The topology optimization approach will have roots in projection-based algorithms where manufacturing design variables are coupled to the physical and analysis spaces to naturally achieve manufacturability. Maintaining rigor in the design framework will facilitate extension to other&#8232;materials and additive manufacturing processes.  The team will design, fabricate, and experimentally test an engineered component for a case-study (provided by the industrial partner) to validate the developed design-manufacture framework.",

The layer-based fabrication approach of Additive Manufacturing (AM) enables the creation of such complex topologies and thus provides an avenue towards realizing TO designed structures. Despite this natural synergy, AM and TO approaches have not yet been integrated into a comprehensive design-manufacture framework. Virginia Tech?s primary research goals were to address this gap by (i) identifying, characterizing, and understanding aspects of AM processes that impose constraints on part geometry and (ii) pass these constraints to collaborators at Johns Hopkins University for incorporation into advanced TO methodologies. Working with the GOALI partner, ExOne, the research team scoped the project to focus on the 3D sand printing (3DSP) process, in which sand molds are additively manufactured via binder jetting to fabricate complex metal castings (Figure 1).</p>\n<p>The research team explored each distinct phase of the 3DSP process ? printing, part cleaning, and metal casting - to identify potential sources of constraints on (i) part feature resolution and (ii) part complexity. It was determined that the critical constraints limiting a user?s ability to cast small features is dependent on the ability to (i) efficiently clean unbound powder from the printed mold and (ii) effectively cast metal through small intricate channels.&nbsp; Standardized test specimen geometries were designed, fabricated and analyzed to quantify and understand the resolution constraints imposed by each phase of the fabrication process. It was discovered that the diameter of a channel is most significant; the minimum diameter that can be cleaned consistently is 3mm. In addition, non-linear, blind channels (i.e., curved channels with only one exit) proved to be challenging to depowder. Violating these design constraints resulted in parts with internal voids and incomplete features where the unbound sand blocked the flow of metal during casting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As this identified constraint severely limits the geometries and cellular topologies able to made via the 3DSP process, the research team explored methodologies for segmenting designs into modular mold segments that are printed separately and then assembled prior to casting. By leveraging the previously identified process constraints, a designer is able to identify strategic parting planes that transform blind channels into segments that can be easily depowdered. &nbsp;With this approach, previously inaccessible cellular lattice topologies (e.g., kelvin foam) have been successfully fabricated (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>The team also sought to gain an understanding of the process/property relationships of metal castings that result from printed sand molds. It was determined that molds made via the 3DSP process and those made by traditional no-bake sand forming techniques yielded statistically equivalent results in three of the five tests performed: dendrite arm spacing, porosity, and tensile strength. They differed in hardness and density. These differences are attributed to better control of sand distribution in 3DSP sand molds, sub-surface pores affecting low hardness values in no-bake castings, and error associated in small relative mean differences for density measurements.</p>\n<p>A team of senior-level mechanical engineering students applied the resulting design guidelines and material performance measurements in the (re)design of two aerospace components provided by an aerospace industrial partner (and customer of the GOALI partner). Through using the identified process constraints, the team was able to increase the fill rate of the aerospace components (Figure 3). In addition, the student team presented design guidelines for both the 3DSP process and the additive-assisted investment casting process to the aerospace industrial partner to guide its future implementation of these manufacturing technologies.</p>\n<p>To further expand the properties of structures made via the 3DSP process, and thus to expand the ?constraints? imposed by the process, the team also investigated a novel process chain in which tensegrity behavior is introduced into fabricated structures by embedding a continuous fiber-reinforcement into the structure. Novel process chains for creating fiber-reinforced cellular structures were created that leveraged both the 3DSP and investment casting processes (Figure 4). A design and computational analysis approach for specifying critical dimensions, and predicting mechanical performance, of fiber-reinforced cellular structures was created. Experimental analysis revealed that the resulting reinforced structures exhibit tensegrity behavior, and as a result, demonstrate improved specific stiffness and strength to similar structures without reinforcing fibers (Figure 5). The resulting structures could find application in any application requiring low mass and high stiffness, including infrastructure, automotive, and aerospace components.</p>\n<p>In addition to traditional peer-reviewed publications, results from this research were disseminated broadly via online webinars and invited talks at industry conferences and meetings. The team also led numerous laboratory tours and STEM-related outreach events to better prepare the future workforce for careers in engineering design and manufacturing. In addition to these K-12 focused events, over 280 undergraduate and graduate students were exposed to the results of this research in the PIs? courses related to additive manufacturing and metal casting.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/21/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christopher&nbsp;B&nbsp;Williams</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1462089/1462089_10364596_1566385023434_3DSP-lattice--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1462089/1462089_10364596_1566385023434_3DSP-lattice--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"3D Sand Printing Process\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1462089/1462089_10364596_1566385023434_3DSP-lattice--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"3D Sand Printing Process\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1. 3D Sand Printing Process overview: (left to right) Digital design of desired structure; Inversion of design to create mold; binder jetting of sand mold design; resultant metal casting</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Christopher Williams</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christopher&nbsp;B&nbsp;Williams</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">3D Sand Printing Process</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1462089/1462089_10364596_1566385326386_3DSP-Modular_KelvinFoam--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1462089/1462089_10364596_1566385326386_3DSP-Modular_KelvinFoam--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Modular 3DSP of Kelvin Foam lattice\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1462089/1462089_10364596_1566385326386_3DSP-Modular_KelvinFoam--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Modular 3DSP of Kelvin Foam lattice\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">By selectively segmenting mold topology using the identified design constraints, it is possible to create complex structures.
