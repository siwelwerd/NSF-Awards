 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Daniel J. Mindiola and co-workers from the University of Pennsylvania, to explore the role of group 4 and 5 transition metals, mainly base metals of low cost, to develop reagents that can activate and transform abundant hydrocarbon resources, present in natural gas and shale gas, into value-added products such as olefins and amines. The research will focus on the use of less toxic and earth abundant transition metals for the development of new catalytic cycles that can activate and use these volatile hydrocarbons for C-C and C-N bond forming reactions. The Mindiola group has developed systems that are capable of transforming alkanes such as ethane and propane (present in natural gas and shale gas) into their respective olefins ethylene and propene at room temperature using titanium reagents. In addition to being actively involved with underrepresented organizations, Professor Mindiola and his group prepare short video clips of key segments during the synthesis of organometallic reagents in an effort to develop more user-friendly approaches to the teaching of organometallic synthesis.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to activate and transform methane and C2-C8 linear hydrocarbons to olefins and involves the preparation of reactive complexes possessing metal-carbon multiple bonds, specifically with metal ions such as Ti, V, and Nb supported by robust pincer or aryloxide ligands. These reactive moieties are tested with various carbine or nitrene hydrogen acceptors sources to render these transformations cyclic or catalytic. The low-temperature transfer dehydrogenation of volatile alkanes, especially the ones which are not useful as liquid fuels, is being explored. The PI and his group disseminate information broadly about the chemical uses of shale gas, as well as Fischer-Tropsch and steam-cracking reactions.",
