 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of New Mexico, New Mexico State University, and New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology are working together to deliver regional workshops in support of statewide planning for research networking. This collaborative effort by New Mexico\u00eds research universities educates, encourages adoption, and provides on-site technical expertise to implement advanced networking and cyberinfrastructure (CI) to enhance and support STEM research and education at small, remote colleges and universities in New Mexico.  Invitations to attend workshops are extended to institutions of higher education in adjacent regions of Arizona and Texas who share similar demographics, topography, and challenges; and to State of New Mexico Economic Development Department, the New Mexico regional Councils of Governments, the New Mexico Department of Information Technology, and other departments of city, county and state government because, in New Mexico's rural areas, municipal governments and tribal entities are instrumental in bringing broadband into underserved areas.\r\n\r\nThe essential partnership between educational entities, research entities, and state and local governments ensures the cost-effective build-out of advanced networking in this underserved region, enabling researchers located in remote communities to thrive, and improving education (including distance education) in a state where many students are the first in their families to attend college.",

The terrain is mountainous desert, checker-boarded with isolated, tiny communities and sovereign tribal lands. The population density averages 17 people per square mile versus the national average of 87.  The last-mile build out of high-speed networks in desert or mountainous terrain has been prohibitively expensive.  Due to scarce, contested and often unavailable resources (e.g. existing but inaccessible dark fiber) and to local and state politics, much of the remaining required broadband build out in New Mexico is stalled or gridlocked.  Collaborative planning and resource allocation leads to more sustainable and affordable long-term solutions.\n\nDuring the duration of this award, six regional workshops were held at the following locations: Northern New Mexico College in Espanola, NM; Eastern New Mexico University in Portales, NM; Western New Mexico University in Silver City, NM; New Mexico Highlands University in Las Vegas, NM; Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, AZ, focused on the Navajo Nation (Arizona portion); and at UNM in Albuquerque, NM, focused on the Navajo Nation (New Mexico portion) and the Central New Mexico Tribes and Pueblos.  Two capstone sessions were held at the 2016 and 2017 occurrences of the annual New Mexico Technology in Education (NMTiE) conference in Albuquerque, NM.\n\nInvitations to attend the workshops were extended to community colleges, K-12 districts in New Mexico, and institutions of higher education in adjacent regions of Arizona and Texas serving minority and Native American constituencies.  In addition, invitations were extended to the State of New Mexico Economic Development Department, the New Mexico regional Councils of Governments, the New Mexico Department of Information Technology (DoIT), and other members of city, country, tribal and state government in order to build enduring bridges between all stakeholders and to promote broadband-related economic development.  In New Mexico's rural areas, municipal governments and tribal entities are instrumental in bringing broadband into underserved areas.\n\nEach regional workshop included three components: \n\nThe scientific research component addressed using the network as an instrument of science, with faculty presentations on how the network has impacted their research.\nThe networking and technical component encompassed information on Science DMZ design and implementation, IPv6, network interactions with high-performance computing data transfer nodes, and end-to-end performance measurement and enhancement based on the PerfSONAR framework.\nThe implications of enhanced connectivity for city, county, tribal and state government, and the local university with the goal of establishing regional planning 'teams' at these workshops to advocate for coordinated and shared local connectivity and to help promote economic development, is the third component.\n\n\nThe panelists and attendees for each workshop included faculty, staff and students from higher education; economic development and planning staff from local, regional, tribal, and national government including K-12; and interested representatives from private industry and healthcare.  These workshops fostered unprecedented engagement of researchers, educators, and community stakeholders in the broadband discussion.  As a direct result of the groundwork laid by this planning grant in year one, a Navajo Nation Cyberinfrastructure Team was formed on the Nation, and is led by several panelists from the NAU workshop.
