 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project is aligned with revolutionizing the metal casting industry by demonstrating a novel rapid and versatile investment casting system.  This all inclusive unit is based on a hybrid microwave heating technology which permits direct irradiation of the casting mold and metal melt, which results in low energy consumption and tight control of the melting/casting processes.  This revolutionary system will permit any size business to design and fabricate low volume metal parts, with complex geometries of any metal composition (from low-temperature metals to high-temperature superalloys).  By coupling this technology with 3D polymer printing technology to form the mold core, near-net shaped parts with complex geometries may go from computer design to a casted part in a matter of a few days (compared to the typical multi-week delivery for traditional investment casting).  These attributes address many of the current needs of the modern commercial market, which requires rapid turnaround of new products with shorter product development time. In addition, the future of advanced manufacturing in the US will be dependent upon small businesses responding to the market with small quantity, but high-value and high-quality parts.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project will be based on the investigation of a furnace design which will utilize microwave energy to rapidly melt high-temperature metal alloys for the casting of complex parts within an investment casting process.  The investigation will also focus on early thermal steps within the investment casting process, in order to reduce processing time and energy consumption, and thus lead to a savings in cost and emissions.   Microwave heating has been demonstrated for a variety of food products and inorganic powders, but there are little to no reports on the use of microwave energy to melt and cast metals, especially high-temperature alloys such as Ni- and Ti-based alloys.  This work will investigate this novel melting technology.  The work will show the relation between the method of microwave coupling, level of superheating, and hybrid quenching technique (through selective microwave coupling within the investment mold) on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the resultant metal parts.  This information will lead to the design of a final microwave-based metal melter/caster, which will provide businesses (from small machine shops to larger foundries) the ability to rapidly cast a variety of complex-shaped, low- and high-temperature alloys in the same unit.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this NSF Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project, Hadron Technologies Inc. (HTI), in collaboration with researchers at West Virginia University, demonstrated a microwave-based melting and casting technology that would revolutionize metal casting.  This system is currently known as the NextCast system.\n\n \n\nThe aim of the program was to further demonstrate a method for efficiently melting and casting metals, which include lower melting metals (such as Al and Mg) and high-temperature alloys (such as Ni- and Ti-alloys) in a microwave furnace.  In addition, the project sought to analyze methods to increase the efficiency of processing investment casting molds.  The time and cost limitations for investment casting primarily revolve around the wax pattern fabrication, core removal, and shell sintering.  The melt formation and pouring is also a slow process, but to a lesser extent than the previous steps.  In this work, a 3D printing technology was used to quickly fabricate polymer preforms (without the need for dies), and then the microwave technology was used to rapidly burnout the polymer core from the ceramic shell.  The rapid nature of microwave heating permitted quick removal of the core structure, where a typical heating autoclave was required.  In addition, methods for increasing the temperature using microwaves were studied in order to densify the shell, which would remove another step in the processing of investment casting molds.  In the end, the microwave system was used to melt and pour aluminum into ~0.75 L investment casting mold, and these final steps were completed in &lt;15 min using &lt;1.5 kW.\n\n \n\nThe program successfully achieved the following:\n\n1)     Demonstrated that our proprietary crucible design was capable of coupling to 2.45 GHz microwave frequency and could be repeatedly heated up to 1700&deg;C within the microwave furnace.  This work included the investigation of the numerous compositions and microstructures required, and the fabrication of the ceramic containers to fit into the given microwave system.\n\n2)     Demonstrated a crucible design that permits a precise metal pour within the microwave furnace at temperatures up to 1700&deg;C.\n\n3)     Demonstrated (for the first time in literature or patents) the melting of both a Ni-alloy and Ti-alloy using a microwave furnace (with heating rates reaching up to 100 &deg;C/min).\n\n4)     Demonstrated a method for forming complex investment casting molds using a 3D printer; the core structure, sprue and runners could be fabricated out of the polylactic acid polymer (PLA) polymer.\n\n5)     Demonstrated a method of modifying the ceramic shell structure of the investment mold in order to permit the removal of the PLA core structure using microwave energy.\n\n6)     Demonstrated the melting and pouring of an aluminum melt into an investment mold using a microwave furnace.  This included the separate melting and controlled pouring of the metal into the investment mold without breaking of atmosphere.\n\n \n\nTo conclude, the above achievements brought the technology very close to the final functioning prototype and complete rapid investment casting vision.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stanley Morrow"
