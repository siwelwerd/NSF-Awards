 "awd_abstract_narration": "Under the supervision of Dr. Takeshi Inomata, Marijke Stoll will explore the intersections between formalized competitive interaction, sociopolitical conflict, and public architecture among Prehispanic societies in southeastern Mexico. Such interaction through for example sporting events can serve valuable social functions which extend well beyond viewer entertainment. They provide a forum to consolidate and strengthen cultural affiliation and integrate broad and often diverse groups of individuals within a regional or national framework. Such regional based competition was integral to community and regional politics among ancient societies. Archaeology as a discipline is well-placed to investigate the social role of sports in the distant past. \r\n\r\nThe Prehispanic ballgame was an important ritualized sport and shared cultural tradition that was played throughout much of ancient Mexico. It was played in large masonry ballcourts, unique structures that were constructed for this single purpose. As a special category of public architecture, ballcourts would have distinguished communities from each other. How ballcourts were distributed across the social landscape was significant - where a ballcourt was emplaced within public space would express the importance of the ballgame to political and daily life. By measuring the centrality of the ballcourt and how accessible it was, it is possible to infer their sociopolitical function at the local and regional levels. \r\n\r\nThe research assesses the degree to which the ballgame was interwoven with local community politics in the Nejapa region of Oaxaca, Mexico. During the dynamic Postclassic (AD 1000 - 1521), a time of internal population expansion, settlement reorganization, and outside pressure from expanding imperial armies, several communities in Nejapa constructed multiple ballcourts. This suggests that residents of Nejapa may have used the ballgame to integrate different social strata, highlight social differences, and resolve or heighten intra- and intercommunity conflicts. The research will test the hypothesis that the ballgame was a key tool used by both local elites and different communities in Nejapa through site reconnaissance, topographical mapping, and geospatial analysis of ballcourt placement and distribution. Specifically, the project focuses on two broad questions. First, how central was the ballcourt to community social organization and who would have been the intended audience for ballgames and other ritual activities performed in and around the court? Second, does the distribution of ballcourts overlap with the distribution of complex civic centers in Nejapa? Systematic study of the ballcourts in Nejapa at the local and regional scales enhances understanding of how a competitive sport became an important sociopolitical institution in Mesoamerica. \r\n\r\nAs the first in-depth study of the ballcourts in Nejapa, this project will be conducted in collaboration with area communities with the goal of documenting, recording and preserving the local cultural heritage for future generations to come. Study results will be disseminated through publications and presentations at scholarly venues, official reports for the Mexican government, and a project website targeted at broader audiences. Data from Nejapa will be added to a much larger geodatabase on ballcourts in Oaxaca that will improve the availability of information as well as permit further statistical and geospatial analyses for future research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Ballcourt Archaeological Project of Nejapa/Tavela focuses on exploring the intersections between competitive sports, community relationships, and public architecture among Prehispanic societies in southeastern Mexico.  Sports played as important of a role in ancient local and global politics as they do in today\u00c6s world.  Competitive games both integrate and divide people.  The Prehispanic ballgame was a competitive sport and shared cultural tradition that was played throughout much of ancient Mexico in large masonry ballcourts, unique structures that were like the football stadiums of their time.  How ballcourts were distributed across the social landscape can inform us about the political relationships between communities.\n\nOver the course of the field project from May to August, 2015, I revisited each site in the Nejapa region where a ballcourt had been documented, save for three mountain sites that could not be reached due to danger from fires and summer storms.  In total, ten ballcourts were mapped using a Sokkia Total Station, which allowed me to capture as accurately as possible the spatial dimensions of each court without excavation.  At each site we followed specific procedures for mapping: 1) we cleaned the ballcourts and surrounding area, removing any vegetation that obscured our ability to map and photograph; 2) during and after cleaning we set up the total station and began mapping, focusing on one section of the structure at a time; and 3), we carefully recorded the site context, including each court\u00c6s location within the settlement and the dimensions of other structures nearby.\nCurrently, the data has been processed and analysis is ongoing.  Preliminary results from this field season have already revealed several interesting patterns related to ballcourt design and distribution.  First, there appears to be a preferred central alley playing length (avg. 33 meters) and architectural orientation (north-south along the central axis).  Second, the majority of the courts are found at prominent locations near rivers, with expansive views towards the valley floor or other important sites.  Further analysis should demonstrate other patterns as well as dissimilarities in the ballcourts individually and as a group.  As the data is analyzed, the information will be entered into a Microsoft Access database I have created.  This database will be linked to the ArcGIS mapping software for dynamic spatial analysis.  The integrated geodatabase will help reveal how internal and external community politics were mediated through the ballgames, ceremonies, and feasting events that occurred in and around the ballcourt.  In total, the final results will be used to assess the degree to which the ballgame was interwoven with local community politics in the Nejapa region.\nThe database serves a two-fold purpose.  Aside from the storage and analysis of the Nejapa data, I will also be using the database to enter all information currently available on documented ballcourts in Oaxaca state-wide.

During the project season I spoke with both local officials and private land owners about preserving these important structures for the future.  Several land owners made pledges to maintain the courts and protect them from further destruction.  The local officials in Santa Ana Tavela even discussed placing signs around the ballcourt at Lachixoba, which due to its location close to the town dump is vulnerable to destruction.\n\nAt this date, some initial study res..."
