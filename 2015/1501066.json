Some of the specific topics that will be discussed at the event are the following: analysis and geometry of high-dimensional data sets; compressive sensing; diffusion geometry; frame and wavelet theory; homogeneous spaces; interpolation spaces; phase retrieval; Radon transforms; sampling theory; sigma-delta quantization; signal and image processing; symmetric spaces and Paley-Wiener spaces; time-frequency analysis; visualization and learning theory. The list of featured speakers includes Peter Casazza, Ronald Coifman, Palle Jorgensen, Adam Koranyi, Michael Lacey, Mauro Maggioni, and Elias Stein. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
