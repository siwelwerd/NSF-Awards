 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding societal stigma is foundational to the science of social psychology. In an era of historically high obesity prevalence rates, one of the most pervasive and socially acceptable forms of societal stigma is weight stigma. What happens to an individual who experiences such stigma? The proposed research will examine a comprehensive trio of consequences: increases in psychological stress, increases in comfort eating, and increases in cortisol, a stress hormone that itself can cause eating and fat storage. One crucial implication of this research is that these consequences could hinder weight loss efforts, or even result in weight gain - thereby sustaining the originally stigmatized condition. The proposed research will test this premise, and investigate weight outcomes as they relate to experiencing weight stigma. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research by A. Janet Tomiyama (University of California, Los Angeles; UCLA) will investigate the consequences of weight stigma in daily life, as well as across the timespan of one year. In the first study, overweight and obese participants will use a specially developed text-messaging platform to report real-life instances of weight stigma as they experience them in daily life. They will then provide cortisol samples and report on their eating behaviors. Over the course of one year, the second study will test whether experiences of weight stigma are followed by increases in stress and cortisol, whether those increases in turn predict unsuccessful weight loss efforts or weight gain, and finally whether those weight outcomes are followed by ever more experiences of weight stigma. This research will be conducted while promoting an educational objective of bringing research to populations underexposed to science. The education plan is deeply integrated with the research plan, and involves underrepresented minority undergraduate students at UCLA and 2-year/community colleges. Using evidence-based teaching and mentoring practices, an intensive summer program will provide dual training in scientific skills and career development.",

In this project, we examined how weight stigma unfolds in everyday life and over time, and examined potential negative consequences of it. We found that when people experience weight stigma they eat 45% more than if they hadn&rsquo;t experienced weight stigma. This was particularly true for men, which is important new information given that the field has predominantly focused on weight stigma in women. Our findings indicate that a vicious cycle might be at work, where people who experience weight stigma eat more, which could over time lead to weight gain, putting people at ever higher risk for experiencing weight stigma &ndash; a process captured in the theoretical work completed in this project called the Cyclic OBesity/WEight-Based Stigma model, or the COBWEBS model. We also advanced knowledge in that we now have a rich understanding of what weight stigma looks like in everyday life. People reported weight stigma from many different sources, like strangers, romantic partners, family members, friends, co-workers, acquaintances, media, healthcare providers, service workers, and self-directed stigma. Examples of weight stigma included, &ldquo;Was getting out of my seat on the bus and the woman sitting next to me called me fat and told me I was taking up too much room&rdquo; and &ldquo;I was at the doctor office and of course I was told I need to lose weight, as if I'm not trying.&rdquo; This award contained an education component, where we involved underrepresented minority students at UCLA and local community colleges in the research, and engaged in career development and training so that they would be prepared for a career in research. The data we collected on these education activities indicated that the program was successful. For example, the most common response to the importance of &ldquo;Making a theoretical contribution to science\" was \"Essential\" across the cohorts, and many of the community college students are now involved in research after transferring to 4-year colleges. Thus, this project contributed to broader impacts through training underrepresented minority students in science.
