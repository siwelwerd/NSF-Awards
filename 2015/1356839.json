 "awd_abstract_narration": "Axial Seamount is an active submarine volcano on the Juan de Fuca Ridge in the NE Pacific that erupted in 1998 and 2011. This recent activity provides access to study the dynamic interactions between seafloor volcanism, hydrothermal venting, and biological responses. Axial is the first and only site in the world where a volcanic deformation cycle has been documented on the seafloor and it will soon have operating sensors and real-time data transmission as part of the Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI). Being able to forecast possible future magmatic activity based on recent seafloor deformation, and associated inferences on magma injection, may help guide OOI science planning.\r\n\r\nContinued monitoring of seafloor depth changes will document vertical deformation associated with magmatic inflation/deflation at Axial Seamount. A combination of Bottom Pressure Recorders, which provide continuous data, and campaign-style reoccupation of existing benchmarks will quantify behavior on timescales both long (years) and short (minutes-hrs). Two eruptions have been partially documented since 1998 but measurements of the pre-eruption inflation period are not complete. Since Axial is in what is interpreted to be the re-inflation stage now, following a 2011 eruption, the opportunity to complete characterization of the cycle exists. This geodetic fieldwork will take place in 2015 and 2017, with student participation and provision of seafloor imagery for use in Science on a Sphere exhibits.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUndersea volcano may provide clues to terrestrial eruptions\n\nAxial Seamount, located some 300 miles off the Oregon Coast, has become one of the most intensely studied volcanoes on Earth &ndash; and it may provide clues to better understanding how and when terrestrial volcanoes erupt.  The results of research supported by the National Science Foundation reveal the workings of the most active undersea volcano in the northeast Pacific Ocean, which erupted in 1998, 2011 and 2015 &ndash; the latter of which was forecast seven months in advance by researchers from Oregon State University, NOAA?s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory, and the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. \n\nThe key to the researchers? forecast was a gradual inflation of the seafloor created by intruding magma, noted William Chadwick, an Oregon State volcanologist.  \"We?re beginning to really understand how this volcano works and some of these lessons can be applied to other volcanoes in a general way,\" Chadwick said. \"During its eruptions, Axial?s seafloor drops suddenly by about eight feet, and then over the next several years it gradually rises back up. When it re-inflates to a certain level, the volcano is almost ready to erupt again.  Axial inflates and deflates like a balloon, except it?s filling with magma instead of air.\"\n\nChadwick said that since the 2015 eruption, the volcano has regained more than half of the eight feet of deflation it lost during the 2015 eruption due to post-eruption re-inflation.  \"Now we?ll just have to watch and see how fast it builds back up,\" Chadwick said. \"We?ll be trying to forecast the next eruption again, but right now it?s a little too early to tell.\"\n\nChadwick calls Axial Seamount a \"great natural laboratory\" because it is close to land, has a simple structure and is frequently active, yet not a hazard to people.  \"Ironically, in some ways we can learn more about how volcanoes work by studying them underwater because subsurface seismic imaging works better in the oceans,\" Chadwick said. Previous seismic data at Axial Seamount helped the researchers interpret the monitoring data collected during the 2015 eruption.\n\nThe researchers also have benefited from the Ocean Observatories Initiative, a National Science Foundation-funded program to study the world?s oceans that includes the Cabled Array, a network of sensors that records data and sends it to shore in real-time.  Part of the Cabled Array extends out to Axial Seamount allowing researchers to track earthquakes and vertical movements of the seafloor at the volcano from their office computers.\n\nBefore the next eruption, scientists expect that the number of earthquakes per day will continue to increase and the seafloor will continue rising until the pressure in the shallow magma reservoir reaches a critical level.  When that happens the magma breaks out of the reservoir to erupt at the surface.  The scientists will be carefully tracking the monitoring data to try to forecast when that will occur.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William W Chadwick"
