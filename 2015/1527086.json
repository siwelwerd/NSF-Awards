 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are many applications in business and end-user applications where user tracking is part of the core functionality or feature set. However, user tracking can intrude on user privacy and even may lead to online crimes. Recent research has shown that tracking companies have started using advanced web tracking techniques that are more subtle and less transparent than traditional online tracking. The ever increasing adoption of mobile devices further exacerbates the tracking problem since these mobile devices are saturated with personal information while the details of mobile-specific tracking techniques are largely unknown.  \r\n\r\nThe project seeks a deeper understanding of the existing and potential technical capabilities and limitations of tracking, and the trade-offs between tracking and privacy.  The project will conduct a systematic study of techniques and technologies that are used for tracking web users, starting with new variations of traditional tracking methods and proceeding to advanced and stealthy users and device fingerprinting. The research will involve both in-depth analysis and large-scale measurement studies. The gained knowledge will inform security and privacy research communities of the technical capabilities and limits posed by the next generation of user tracking on mobile devices, paying particular attention to the under-researched area of stateless tracking.",
