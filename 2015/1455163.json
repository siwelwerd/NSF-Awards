 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Ryan A. Altman of the Department of Medicinal Chemistry at The University of Kansas is developing new reagents and metal-catlyzed strategies for generating fluorinated substructures that are found in a variety of therapeutics, biological probes, agrichemicals and polymeric materials. The research advances fundamental knowledge at the intersection of organometallic and organofluorine chemistries, providing synthetic chemists with new and environmentally benign reagents and catalyst systems for preparing compounds that would otherwise be challenging to access. The proposed research provides hands-on training in synthetic organofluorine and organometallic chemistries for undergraduate and graduate students. Dr. Altman is developing integrative teaching of basic chemical science for professional-track pharmacy students particularly through a unique experimental course that stresses the significance of basic scientific developments within the context of clinical pharmacy.\r\n\r\nThe research project addresses the development of catalytic decarboxylation (conversion of carboxylates to alkyl metal species through extrusion of carbon dioxide) as a method for converting alpha,alpha-difluorocarboxylates  into fluororalkyl-substituted organometal intermediates. Decarboxylative metallation is an efficient strategy for the formation of synthetically useful fluoroalkyl organometallic intermediates partly because the process uses inexpensive and readily available carboxylic acids, and derivatives thereof. Using these fluoroalkyl organometallic intermediates, this project explores several synthetically useful coupling reactions to generate trifluoromethanes and difluoroalkyl ketones. Mechanistic studies provide factors (e.g. steric and electronic effects, coordinating ability) that control the rates and efficiency of decarboxylative metallation, and provide insight to improve the transformations.",
