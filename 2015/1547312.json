 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wireless traffic volume is expected to expand tremendously in the next few years. Sustaining this growing trend will require high spectrum efficiency. In the meantime, energy efficiency has become another essential requirement for future wireless networks. Furthermore, as video content delivery over wireless networks is expected to escalate fast, how to support these energy and bandwidth consuming video applications with high Quality of Experience is becoming a very challenging issue in future wireless networks. Inspired by recent advances in wireless technologies and challenges, the proposed research aims to develop Quality of Experience aware spectrum efficient and energy efficient radio resource access schemes in next generation wireless networks with densely deployed underlay devices. The proposed research project and activities have significant potentials to enhancing access to the radio spectrum and wireless services. The project will investigate a new wireless network paradigm to meet the ever increasing new devices, wireless traffic demand, and to address the needs on global environmental protection. The proposed research will also improve Quality of Experience for wireless videos, which will be the dominant wireless traffic in the coming years. \r\n\r\nThis project will identify unique technical challenges in wireless networks with densely deployed underlay devices and explore new solutions to research problems, including distributed opportunistic spectrum access schemes to achieve high spectrum efficiency, optimum energy efficiency schemes and energy and spectrum efficiency tradeoffs, and Quality of Experience aware spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency in wireless networks with densely deployed underlay devices. Theoretical analysis and performance evaluation for novel radio spectrum access schemes in wireless networks with densely deployed underlay devices will be obtained. Simulation and performance evaluation tools will be developed and shared with the broader scientific research and engineering community. The proposed research will significantly advance the understanding in the field of radio spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency as well as Quality of Experience for video applications for emerging wireless networks with densely deployed underlay devices, which are expected to play a key role in the modem society to meet the future wireless capacity explosion and energy consumption escalation. The project will give both undergraduate and graduate students direct simulation modeling experience as well as research opportunities in designing and developing new wireless technologies. With an emphasis on integrating research and education, curriculum development and improvement, and diversity and outreach, PIs are committed on the continuous achievement on educating and training students, especially female students and students from under-represented groups, and prepare them for the workforces of future wireless telecommunications industry and society.",
