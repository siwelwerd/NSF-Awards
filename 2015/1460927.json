 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal extends the highly successful Injury Science Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) with the long-term objective of developing a diverse, internationally competitive, and globally engaged science and engineering workforce with a focus on pediatric injury prevention. The REU Site will conduct fundamental research on the causes and consequences of injury in youth and translational research to apply this scientific foundation into evidence-based prevention products, programs, policy, and interventions. Noting a dearth of funding for research training in injury prevention as a major barrier to the development of the field of injury prevention research, the National Academies called for increased injury prevention research training opportunities. This site will train a cadre of talented interns to help to ensure the growth, innovation, and continuity of the field to reduce injuries and death in youth. The comprehensive training will prepare diverse, internationally-competitive, and globally-engaged leaders in science and engineering. Their research findings will inform interventions to reduce injuries and deaths in youth. \r\n\r\nThe REU program will offer a 10-week intensive summer research experience for a total of 33 interns over a three year period (8 interns per year funded by the NSF plus 3 interns funded by CHOP and Drexel) which includes: 1) individual research projects with a faculty mentor, 2) ethics training, 3) intern meetings, 4) seminars, 5) field trips, 6) student presentations, and 7) career guidance, networking opportunities, and mentorship.  Recruitment will focus on interns from schools with limited STEM opportunities. Disciplines that will be targeted include engineering, behavioral science, population science, and statistics. Training will draw upon the multi-disciplinary expertise of a NSF I/UCRC and an internationally recognized research organization, the Center for Injury Research and Prevention. The site includes faculty and resources from the University of Pennsylvania and Drexel University. REU interns will gain rigorous research experience, learning the value of interdisciplinary work and applying research results to real world prevention.",

However, as noted by the National Academies, a dearth of funding for research training in injury prevention remains a major barrier to the development of this field.  Therefore, the Injury Science Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site aims to overcome with barrier by assisting the nation in developing diverse, internationally competitive, and globally-engaged leaders of a science and engineering workforce with a focus on pediatric injury prevention.\n\nFor over two decades, the world-renowned Center for Injury Research and Prevention (CIRP), a Center of Emphasis at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) Research Institute, has provided a unique research and training site for the next generation of scientists and engineers who, through rigorous scholarship, address the leading risk of injuries to children, youth and young adults: concussion, traffic crashes, and violence.  Since 2011, CIRP has been honored to include as part of its training program the National Science Foundation Injury Science REU Site.

Twenty-two (67%) of REU interns remained working on their research project after completion of the internships, culminating in 5 peer-reviewed manuscripts and 17 conference presentations involving Injury Science REU interns to date.  Alumni of the Injury Science REU Site have also gone on to pursue graduate degrees and research careers.  Of our 25 REU interns who have since graduated from their undergraduate institutions, 33% are in or have completed Master's programs, 21% are or have completed in PhD programs; and 55% are in or have completed additional research positions.  Six alumni have returned to CHOP or one of its affiliated universities to pursue a graduate degree or research career.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Flaura K Winston"
