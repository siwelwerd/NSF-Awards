It will feature talks by world experts, encourage new collaborations, and serve as an excellent opportunity for junior participants to learn and meet experts in the mathematical field of non-Archimedean geometry. The senior speakers have been chosen on the basis of their research credentials, but also for being superior expositors with a dedication to the development of younger generations of researchers and teachers in mathematics. There will also be several junior speakers, and an opportunity for Ph.D. students and postdocs to present their work in a poster session. A strong effort will be made to have a diverse group of speakers and participants.\r\n\r\nThere have been numerous recent advances in non-Archimedean geometry, and these techniques have also seen new and sometimes unexpected applications.

It will bring together leading experts in various fields where non-Archimedean geometry or analysis play an important role, and establish connections between these fields. Among the themes represented at the conference will be Berkovich spaces, tropical geometry, dynamical systems, and p-adic Hodge theory.",
