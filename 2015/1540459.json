 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gastrointestinal parasites represent one of the major drivers of global disease burden, particularly neglected tropical diseases, with nearly 800 million infected worldwide. In the U.S., for example, parasitic infections are known to disproportionately affect impoverished and under-represented minority populations, and preliminary estimates suggest potentially hundreds of thousands of individuals are infected, making it one of the top health disparities in the U.S. The investigators will conduct basic research on how genetic variation confers gastrointestinal parasite infection resistance or susceptibility in a primate species. The results of this study will provide a more complete understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie disease susceptibility, which is fundamental to the development of more effective prevention and treatment strategies for infectious diseases. The scientific value of this project will be further amplified through the creation and implementation of an educational module in disease genetics developed to engage Oregon middle-school students traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe specific goals of this project are to identify regulatory genetic variants in immune genes that are associated with parasite infection in the red colobus monkey, and demonstrate that those variants have a causal relationship with infection intensity through their effects on gene expression. DNA variant/infection associations will be determined through a combination of DNA sequencing and classical parasitological approaches. The ability of regulatory variants to drive differential gene expression will then be tested in-vitro using bioluminescent reporter assays in multiple cell lines. Predictions based on cell experiments will then be tested in-vivo using RNA-seq. This study will advance our understanding of the evolution of immunity to pathogens and provide a comprehensive, mechanistic, explanation for observed genotype-parasite infection intensity associations.",

Previous work by us and our collaborators established the Ugandan red colobus monkey (<em>Piliocolobus tephroscoles</em>) population at Kibale National Park (Western Uganda) as harboring zoonotic pathogens that cause disease in humans. For this funded research, we studied red colobus genetics/genomics in conjunction with two of these pathogens (whipworm and simian immunodeficiency virus) to better understand 1) the role of gene expression in regulating infection and health outcomes in this species, and 2) how evolution has affected the presence of these pathogens in this species. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The first pathogen we studied was the gastrointestinal parasite <em>Trichuris</em>, commonly known as whipworm. When transmitted into humans, this parasite can cause trichuriasis, which is a neglected tropical disease that affects over 400 million people worldwide. We demonstrated that DNA variants in the regulatory region for the <em>MHCDQA1</em> gene are associated with whipworm infection in red colobus, these variants are functional in driving gene expression, and these variants are maintained in the population through natural selection. The second pathogen we studied was simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). While many African primates are known to tolerate this virus without adverse health outcomes, some strains have jumped into human populations and are the direct source of human immumodeficiency virus and the AIDS pandemic. We demonstrated that red colobus monkeys are among the primates able to tolerate this virus as they do not show dramatic differences across expression of immune genes when infected. However, there existed a small set of genes that were expressed at different levels between SIV-infected and SIV-uninfected individuals, including an immunosuppressive gene (<em>CD101</em>) previously unidentified in this context. This result provides a candidate gene for future study in relation to immunodeficiency virus tolerance and suggests that tolerance of SIV infection may have evolved in a species-specific manner involving gene regulation across African primates. This research thus established novel connections between evolution, the expression of certain genes, and zoonotic pathogen tolerance in a wild primate.

Secondly, we have been able to effectively use this research for education and outreach purposes, specifically to train various undergraduate and graduate students in genetics/genomics, teach genetics/genomics to undergraduate Anthropology students, and educate the broader public on genetics/genomics. For example, 1) this research was the basis for an outreach exercise employed in the University of Oregon SPICE (Science Program to Inspire Creativity and Excellence) summer camp for young women, reaching 120 middle and high school aged women from diverse backgrounds over the past three years. The mission of SPICE is to create a learning environment where middle school and high school girls can thrive in STEM. As part of the SPICE camp, we developed a ?Forensics in the Forest? exercise which required camp participants to identify chimpanzee skeletal remains found in the forest through anatomy and DNA barcoding.
