 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is a collaboration between mathematical researchers at five universities, including young mathematicians at the early stages of their careers, who are joining forces to tackle fundamental problems at the confluence of mathematical logic, algebra, and computer science. The overall goal is to deepen understanding about how to recognize the complexity of certain types of computational problems. The project focuses on a suite of mathematical problems whose solutions will yield new information about the complexity of Constraint Satisfaction Problems. These problems (CSP's) include scheduling problems, resource allocation problems, and problems reducible to solving systems of linear equations. CSP's are theoretically solvable, but some are not solvable efficiently. The research will be aimed at identifying a clear boundary between the tractable and intractable cases, and at providing efficient algorithms for solutions in the tractable cases. Many fundamental problems in mathematics and computer science can be formulated as CSP's, and progress here would have both practical and theoretical significance. A second component of the project investigates classical computational problems in algebra in order to determine whether they are algorithmically solvable. A third component of the project is the further development of the software UACalc, which is a proof assistant developed to handle computations involving algebraic structures.\r\n\r\nThe researchers shall work to decide the truth of the CSP Dichotomy Conjecture of Feder and Vardi, which states that every Constraint Satisfaction Problem with a finite template is solvable in polynomial time or is NP complete. They will further develop the algebraic approach to CSP's by refining knowledge about relations compatible with weak idempotent Maltsev conditions and about algebras with finitely related clones. A second goal of the project concerns the computable recognition of properties of finite algebras connected with the varieties they generate, such as whether a finite algebra with a finite residual bound is finitely axiomatizable, or whether a finite algebra can serve as the algebra of character values for a natural duality. One of the more tangible accomplishments of this project will be a broadening and strengthening of the applicability of the UACalc software. The agenda for this part of the project includes parallelizing the important subroutines, building in conjecture-testing and search features, adding further algorithms, and further developing the community of users and contributors.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nTwo proofs of the CSP-dichomoty conjecture supplied by researchers in my\nfield  of universal algebra in 2016 marked a major milestone in the  development of this field, not least because it is one of just a few  achievements of research in this field that is bound to find  applications in a broad range of human activities especially whereever  computers and their algorithms are involved (virtually everywhere).\n\nIn  September 2016 and August 2017, this grant supported weeklong  conferences at Vanderbilt attended by nearly all the personnel of this  grant (from the five universities involved) and numerous other  researchers, at which Andrei Bulatove (from Simon Fraser University,  Vancouver) and Dmitri Zhuk from Moscow State University) began to  explain their very long and complicated proofs of CSP-dichotomy.   Resolving the dichotomy conjecture was, at least for me, the major goal  of this project.   Working with others,\nsince 2005, I had made  substantial contributions to the algebraic approach to CSP-dichotomy,  and was working on it when the solution was announced.  A theory of the  fine structure of finite algebraic systems developed by me in the 1980's  played a central role in all this work, and in the solution, but in the  end, this chapter of our project was finished by Bulatov and Zhuk  before we got off the ground.\n\nThe solution provides a definitive  test for the tractability by computer algorithm of any Constraint  Satisfaction Problem and a general scheme for producing the software  (algorithm) to solve the problem reliably in polynomial time.  The  condition for tractability is the existence of a four-variable operation  over the universe of the template of the problem, that satisfies two  equations, w(xyzz)=w(yzxy) and w(xxxx)=x, and respects all the relations  of the template structure.  \n\nFor three years, the grant supplied  funds to bring the researchers in the projects, and some others working  on the same or parallel problems, together for workshop conferences.   We held one or two conferences a year between September 2015 and August  2018---at Vanderbilt, and Hawaii, and Colorado.   At Vanderbilt, there  was a final year of \"no-cost extension\"\nto spend leftover funds,  which brought a string of researchers to Vanderbilt in groups of 2 -- 4  at a time for periods of up to a week.  Besides McKenzie, and some of  his collaborators from around the world, the grant provided\nconference travel funds and summer research salaries to two Postdoctoral mathematicians, Matthew Moore and Andrew Moorhead.\n\nMoore  and Moorhead had recently obtained PhD's with Keith Kearnes at  Colorado.  I think the best results of all the grant work were obtained  by Kearnes (with Agnes Szendrei and Ross Willard) who showed that every  finite algebra with a \"difference term\" that generates a variety with a  finite residual bound, must possess a finitely axiomatizable equational  theory;\n\n....  by Moore who\ncompleted a very complex proof that  the problem of determining of a finite algebra whether its clone of  operations is the polymorphism\nclone of a relational structure  consisting of a finite set and finitely many relations, is absolutely  undecidable (no algorithm can exist);\n\n\n.... by Moorhead who  found that the existence of a Taylor term for a finite algebra is  defined by a property of \"hypercongruences over that algebra';\n\n....   and by Moore, McKenzie and Alexandr Kazda who proved that every  congruence distributive equationally defined class of algebras (i.e., a  Birkhoff variety) has directed Jonsson terms.  These are all results  motivated by abstract questions about abstract objects far from everyday  reality.\n\nBut it was my work on problems of this kind,  motivated solely by some inherent attraction in the problems,  that  resulted in tame congruence theory, a major step on the way to  CSP-dichotomy and many other good things. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/12/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ralph N Mckenzie"
