Reflecting rapidly changing polar cyberinfrastructure needs, the project also will establish a task force, of knowlegeable users, that will provide guidance concerning the future sustainability of Antarctic meteorological and climate data sharing and cyber-infrastructure needs. This concerted effort represents the USAP's meteorological contribution to the NSF's Geosciences Directorate broader Earth Cube program. \r\n\r\nEducational outreach efforts also extends into the classroom. This outreach efforts aim to demonstrate the use of Antarctic meteorological datasets to spur interest in high latitude weather, and to improve student learning in STEM subject areas. Together  with formal education, the project will continue to be invovled with a broader outreach to the general public.",
