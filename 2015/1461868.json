The goal of this project is to associate genome-wide diversity to functional plant phenotypes using high-throughput phenotyping under field conditions and new analytical tools in balsam poplar, Populus balsamifera, a keystone tree species. This project will provide cross-disciplinary training in the latest techniques in ecological genomics, remote sensing, and spatial modeling to undergraduate and graduate students. Minority and first-generation undergraduate students will be recruited through partnerships with Frostburg State University's McNair Program and other organizations. Public outreach to rural communities will be conducted through a multi-faceted science program centered on engaging the public in the science of genomics, plant phenology, and climate change, in collaboration with the National Phenology Network (www.usanpn.org/). \r\n\r\nThis project will develop and integrate tools from genomics, remote sensing, and geospatial modeling to study the genetic basis of climate adaptation in Populus balsamifera, balsam poplar. Sampling will be focused on balsam poplar's southern range edge in order to study the physiological adaptations of populations to the warmest, earliest onset growing seasons within its geographic range. Genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data will be generated for 600 poplar genotypes and used to perform genome scans for local adaptation and association mapping for phenology, growth, and water use efficiency traits. Regions of the genome associated with climate adaptation will be used to predict field performance using an independent sample of genotypes and an innovative remote sensing approach to measure phenology. New spatial analytical methods will be developed to characterize the associations between genomic variation and environmental gradients of climate and growing season length, and to visualize the landscape surface of adaptive variation under both current and projected climates. Genomic sequence data will be publically available through NCBI's sequence read archive and DOE's Knowledgebase. SNP genotypes, phenotypic traits, and remotely sensed phenology data will be publically accessible through Data DRYAD (www.datadryad.org). A software package in landscape genomics will be developed for the R project for statistical computing, and publically accessible through the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN: http://cran.r-project.org/). Finally, new germplasm and associated genomic and phenotypic results will be available upon request.",

Forest products (lumber, pulp, paper) provide billions of dollars in economic revenue to the United States and Canada yearly, and are especially important to rural communities in North America. Our research on environmental adaptation in <em>Populus</em>, a key genus of trees in the forest products industry, was designed to address the problem of how trees from different climate zones are genetically adapted to their local growing conditions, and how this knowledge can be used to make predictions about the productivy of trees under novel climate conditions.

Our findings support a very strong effect of genetically-based \"local adaptation\" to climate, that is, a relationship between the performance of a sample and how similar it's current planting climate resembles the climate under which its ancestors evolved over multiple generations. The presence of strong local adaptation to climate means that as trees experience a change in climate, either because of temporal changes in atmospheric conditions, or from moving material to new geographic locations for the establishment of plantations, they may experience a loss of productivity (e.g., biomass, biofuels, and related forest products) that could be predicted utilizing our approaches.</p>\n<p>In support of this research, we have refined and developed several new computational tools and technologies that have enabled the development of predictive models of forest tree growth as a function of genes and environment.
