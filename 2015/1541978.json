The symposium will focus on all aspects of lake and reservoir management, including:\r\n\r\nWater may prove to be the most critical natural resource impacting human and ecosystem health. There is mounting evidence that the condition of water supplies in many regions of the world, including the United States, is worsening. With rapid economic growth taking place, there are challenging problems occurring in many water supply reservoirs.  This support will be used to develop a balanced array of presentations from US scientists and engineers.\r\n\r\nThis symposium will address: 1) instrumentation and techniques for water quality monitoring; 2) in-situ control strategies to remove nutrients and contaminants, and to diminish the release of greenhouse gases; 3) best practices for the management of cyanobacteria and algae; 4) in-reservoir water quality management strategies; 5) evaluating reservoirs as barriers to or as sources of pathogens; 6) understanding the impacts of climate change; 7) employing hydrodynamic and water quality models to facilitate understanding and optimize operations; and, 8) actively integrating reservoir management and water treatment. While keynote speakers will be from around the world, this proposed project will fund US participants to the conference.",
