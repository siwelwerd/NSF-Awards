Although these countries have historically had little diversity, recently they have experienced significant demographic change through international migration. The incorporation of diverse immigrant groups into Nordic societies presents a number of interesting challenges for the principle of universalism. This project, which trains a graduate student to conduct rigorous social scientific research in the areas of international migration and political sociology, analyzes the forces that have created universalist social democracies that are strikingly different from those of the past. Moreover, it investigates whether increased migration has undermined universalism.\r\n\r\nThe dissertation project will investigate country-to-country trends in international migration and some consequences of these trends in three steps. First, the research uses quantitative panel techniques on an extended sample representing all welfare state types to test whether migration follows a welfare magnet pattern, where migrants are disproportionately drawn to the generous welfare institutions of the Nordic social democracies, as some researchers have suggested. Second, the project offers a contemporary approach to international migration by tracing the institutional and social influences on migration flows within a context of increased global connectedness, going beyond conventional macro-structural explanations. In particular, the study considers destination countries' ties and commitment to an international society that seeks to aid refugees. It also considers social connectedness and exchange factors, like the sending of remittance monies and the increased use of communication technologies in an understudied context - migrants' origin countries. Third, the study turns to multilevel quantitative analyses of individual-level survey data to examine whether increasing migration levels and diversity in a region or country are associated with a decline in individual social trust and support for state welfare programs.",

This dissertation examines international migration as both a source and consequence of social forces in an increasingly globalized world. It focuses on migration to the universalist welfare states of Nordic Europe, which have transformed from largely homogenous societies to ones that are ethnically, racially, and religiously diverse. At question is how migration is shaped by Nordic destinations and immigrant origins and whether universalism can endure the sociocultural transformations that accompany new immigrant populations. This dissertation contributes to the international migration literature by identifying factors that go beyond the economic, demographic, and geographic influences known to shape migration. I use a unique bilateral migration dataset to test the welfare magnet hypothesis, which suggests that generous welfare attracts migrants, for the most robust welfare states in the world and representatives of other welfare types. I find virtually no evidence for a welfare magnet hypothesis and instead find that institutionalized commitments to equality and international human rights shape Nordic migration. In addition to destination characteristics, I fill a gap in current knowledge on migration flows by examining factors specific to immigrants&rsquo; origin countries. I conduct a series of novel analyses, first globally, by World-Systems regions, and finally for Nordic migration with a focus on the origin. I find that South-North migration is driven by World-Systemic influence like capital penetration, whereas South-South migration is more strongly associated with connectedness factors like socially-transmitted remittances. Nordic-bound migration is distinct from typical South-North migration as it is not significantly tied to capital movement and is instead influenced more by destination characteristics. Across all types, origin conflict is a significant predictor of international mobility. Finally, I analyze what migration-led diversity means for the bases of universalism by examining individual-level social trust and welfare support across 17 European societies. I draw from theories of ethnic boundary making, citizenship, and nationalism to show that while ethnic diversity often impacts social cohesion directly, particularly welfare support, much of its effects are shaped by histories of conquest and conflict.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/29/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Aaron&nbsp;J&nbsp;Ponce</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
