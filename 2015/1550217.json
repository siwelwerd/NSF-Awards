There are currently no standards for the specific impacts that should be assessed when making investment decisions.  This lack of uniformity inhibits comparisons between programs and weakens the value of these evaluations in providing actionable information.  This s project seeks to advance knowledge within the science of science policy community by identifying a core set of metrics that can be used to evaluate Federal R&D programs. \r\n\r\nThis project will create a comprehensive set of potential metrics that may be relevant when evaluating the outcomes, impacts, and innovations that result from an R&D program. The research will use RAND?s ExpertLens, an online modified Delphi system, to elicit opinions from a diverse set of Federal stakeholders and academic researchers on the usefulness of the identified metrics. This process will provide information on the most valuable metrics for evaluating a diverse set of R&D programs\r\n",
