 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental changes related to global temperature may accelerate over time and impact where species occur on the earth. As a result, species may become exposed to new enemies, including parasites, pathogens, and predators. Some of these enemies are of particular interest to humans because they occur in large numbers as pests with commercial and ecological impacts. Ecologists have increasingly stressed the importance of predators and parasites in keeping host populations in check and providing other vital services in ecosystems. Thus, understanding how changing climate impacts the relationship between parasites and hosts has broad implications. This research will have direct consequences on issues of national importance, including: medicine (parasites of humans, disease vectors), veterinary science (parasites of pets, livestock), and food safety and biosecurity (parasites, pathogens and pests in agriculture, aquaculture, livestock). With increasingly numerous reports of plants and animals appearing in new places, it is timely to examine their potential impacts in those places. This symposium will provide such an examination.  \r\n\r\nThe objective of the symposium is to bring together researchers working on a wide variety of natural enemies to exchange knowledge on how aspects of global change (e.g., warming, sea level rise, ocean acidification, altered precipitation) may alter the distribution and interactions of pests, parasites, and host species. Most previous work has overlooked impacts of global change on interactions between species that have not previously encountered one another. Speakers are diverse in terms of career development (doctoral students to senior researchers) and diversity (women and traditionally underrepresented groups). The symposium will include researchers working on parasites and pests in terrestrial, marine and freshwater ecosystems. An important outcome of this symposium will be an edited volume and a broad, new foundation for accurately modeling and predicting ecological impacts resulting from co-occurring shifts in the distributions of pathogens, parasites, and hosts.",

Some of these parasites and pests are of special interest to humans, as they occur in large numbers with commercial, ecological and medical implications. Climate change may cause some parasites to become more restricted in range and their hosts could experience release from negative impacts, causing cascading effects potentially across ecosystems. Likewise, a wide variety of pests, including those of agricultural and aquacultural importance, may experience temperature-induced habitat alterations that have the potential to cause significant harm. With increasingly numerous reports on changes in the geographic range of parasites, pathogens and pests, it was timely to bring together researchers working on these organisms and foster a better understanding of how alterations in climate conditions may impact host/parasite relationships. The speakers represented a wide range in terms of career development and diversity, and met the goal of promoting exchange of knowledge between researchers across various career stages (including students) and across diverse fields of research.
