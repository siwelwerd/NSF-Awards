 "awd_abstract_narration": "Collaborative Research: Endowing nonlinear optical devices with unprecedented robustness: overcoming fabrication disorder by \"topological protection\" against parasitic scattering\r\n\r\nNon-technical section of abstract:\r\n\r\nTechnology based on controlling and manipulating light affects our lives in countless ways: from the optical fibers that enable ultrafast internet speeds, laser manufacturing of automobiles, to solar cells that provide clean energy - optical devices are ubiquitous.  Very often, the performance of a given device is limited by fabrication imperfections: random defects that cause unwanted scattering of light, which impedes its flow and adds unwanted noise.  Investigators Rechtsman and Chen will demonstrate a method to completely suppress such scattering: so-called \"photonic topological protection\" of light beams.  This concept, borrowed from solid-state physics (in which the goal was to protect electronic current from scattering) has already been demonstrated to work, and offers the possibility of endowing a wide class of devices with unprecedented robustness.  In order to test these concepts in the lab, the investigators will fabricate waveguide arrays (a series of \"wires\" for light that together form a desired device) embedded in a type of glass that is particularly useful for so-called \"nonlinear\" optical devices.  With proper design of the waveguide array, suppression of scattering will be demonstrated in multiple different devices. The implications to optical devices are clear: increased device efficiencies or cheaper fabrication costs (or both).  Moreover, the authors expect their work to \"shed light\" on the general wave phenomenon of topological protection against scattering in many contexts, including acoustic waves, microwaves, optical waves, and even electron waves.  \r\n\r\nTechnical section of abstract:\r\n\r\nThe field of \"topological insulators\" has captivated condensed matter physics for ten years, due to these materials' universal properties, and striking applications in spintronics and quantum computing.  It was recently demonstrated that their key property -\"topological protection\" against scattering by disorder- could be achieved with photons in waveguide arrays with engineered linear dispersion properties to preserve edge modes. \r\n\r\n This proposal will explore the nonlinear optical properties of Photonic Topological Insulators (PTIs). Through the fabrication of high quality PTI waveguide arrays in nonlinear optical substrates such as chalcogenide glass, this research project will explore a nonlinear properties of edge modes and their potential applications. Since PTIs have a fundamentally different dispersion, a novel understanding of nonlinear optics in these structures is bound to yield new scientific knowledge and device applications, which will be of great interest to a highly cross-disciplinary set of intellectual communities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe activities of this project are: (1) theoretical work to analytically and numerically model nonlinear effects (i.e., modulation instability and solitons) in photonic topological systems; (2) fabrication (laser-written photonic crystal-type structures) in chalcogenide glass, which has a high nonlinear response; (3) characterizing the structures by injecting high-peak-power near-infrared light and observing spatial diffraction patterns.  \r\n\r\nThe collaboration between PI and co-PI with complementary expertise will enable the success of the proposed project from theoretical studies to device fabrication to characterization.  If successful, photonic topological protection can potentially be used to dramatically improve the performance of optical devices such as multiplexing systems, all-optical switches and beam-shaping systems - and indeed any optical application limited by fabrication disorder.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\n \n\n?Topological insulators? are new materials that have highly distinct properties as compared to ordinary insulators.  They don?t allow for electrical current to be conducted through the material bulk, but rather only on the edges and surfaces.  Furthermore, electrons that make up the flow of current are highly resistant to scattering by parasitic disorder.  As a result, such systems can be very robust to imperfections.  In fact, because of this robustness, the quantum Hall effect (a topological phenomenon) has been used to redefine the fundamental units of nature, including the kilogram1,2. \n\n \n\nUp until about a decade ago, topological physics had only been exploited in electronic devices.  In 2008, Haldane and Raghu proposed3 that it could also be applied in photonics, not just electronics.  In other words, it could be used in complex devices that manipulate the flow of light, rather than just materials that control the flow of electrons.  This resulted in the field of topological photonics: the exploration of how the flow of photons could be protected via these non-scattering states.  In this project, a collaboration between the groups of Kevin Chen at the University of Pittsburgh and Mikael Rechtsman of Penn State University, we explored a wide range of effects involving the topological protection of photons, from both the theoretical and experimental point of view.      \n\nTo list several examples:\n\n-       We demonstrated that ?Weyl points? (topologically protected point degeneracies) could be realized in the optical frequency regime4. \n\n-       We demonstrated topologically protected ?corner modes?5 that could act as a design principle for photonic crystal fibers with enhanced nonlinear effects.\n\n-       We demonstrated that we could probe four-dimensional quantum Hall physics6 using photonics.\n\n \n\nBeyond these, we were able to propose, design, and implement a range of different optical devices that could be useful in various photonic technologies, including in laser cavity design, complex fiber design, and beyond. \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\n \n\nThe advent of topological protection can have implications for many photonic technologies.  To take several examples from this project, the zero-dimensional protected modes that we demonstrated can potentially be used to make more reliable photonic crystal fibers, used in medical imaging.  Systems with Weyl points can be used to design laser cavities with higher output power, which can potentially be used in industries ranging from telecommunications to manufacturing.  We expect that topological protection will make future optical (and other wave-based) devices more robust to disorder, and thus more inexpensive, compact, and efficient. \n\n \n\nWe have made a continual effort to train undergraduate students in research as part of this project.  A total of six undergraduate students performed associated research, including three female undergraduates in the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program.  We have consistently encouraged our undergraduates in their pursuit of careers in science; in fact, three of the six are currently pursuing Ph.D. degrees in either mathematics or physics, and two are in the midst of applying at the time of writing.  Outreach activities have included presentations in student groups (such as the Optical Society of America student chapter and the Society of Physics Students at Penn State), as well as involvement in Penn State?s ?STEM Open House? program, aimed toward the recruitment of graduate students from underrepresented groups.  The goal has been and continues to be the training of new scientists ? from all backgrounds ? at the cutting edge of optical science research. \n\n \n\n1.
