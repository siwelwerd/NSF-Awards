 "awd_abstract_narration": "A complete understanding of the internal structure of protons, neutrons and other strongly interacting subatomic particles remains elusive. Although Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), the relevant part of the Standard Model of particle physics, is an established theoretical framework, it is extremely difficult to perform calculations for phenomena that extend over large distances such as the size of the proton. Lattice-QCD, a numerical  first-principles technique that relies heavily on high-performance computational resources, is able to calculate accurately only certain properties of particles such as protons and neutrons. For other properties, researchers rely on physically well-motived phenomenological models. In this broader context, the investigator and his students will develop and apply improved QCD models to study the distribution of constituent quarks and gluons in subatomic particles, such as pions, kaons, and protons. These efforts provide theoretical support to ongoing experimental efforts at the Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. Graduate students involved in this research will be trained in theoretical nuclear physics and will have the opportunity to work on research problems at the forefront of nuclear science, thereby receiving training that prepares them for entering the much-needed workforce in the nuclear science arena. \r\n\r\nThe Dyson-Schwinger equations approach to nonperturbative model building in QCD preserves the short distance renormalization group behavior of QCD, while modeling in the infrared domain is guided by an empirical approach that preserves the dynamical chiral symmetry breaking known to generate at least 98% of the mass of visible stable matter in the universe. This approach is checked against established results of Lattice-QCD and is used to extend and complement Lattice-QCD for domains where lattice results are not presently available. This work will analyze and interpret experimental results about the quark and gluon structure of sub-atomic particles and elastic and transition form factors. This project will also develop an improved practical method for solving the QCD bound state equation for excited state mesons and will explore the limitations of a recently proposed approximate approach to parton distributions for Lattice-QCD.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This research addresses mechanisms underlying hadron physics in terms of the confined quarks and gluons described by the relevant part of the Standard Model, namely the  field theory called Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).   To complement the steady progress of lattice-QCD for hadron physics, continuum-QCD  models and methods can identify dominant mechanisms and develop physical intuition.  The continuum approach we employ is well suited to describe hadron properties that are accessed through high energy scattering processes.  Examples include electromagnetic form factors and parton distribution functions.  The principal tool is nonperturbative QCD modeling  based on the Dyson-Schwinger equations which are the fundamental equations of motion of field theory.  Theoretical work of this type informs and motivates a portfolio of fundamental physics programs at  the Jefferson Laboratory at Newport News Virginia (JLab) and other sub-atomic physics laboratories across the world.    \nNew formulations and computational algorithms are being used to greatly enlarge the domain of applicability of the approach.  Specific  physics issues addressed in this research program include the elastic and transition form factors of hadrons for a complete range of momentum transfer, the light-front projections of hadron wave functions to obtain their parton distribution amplitudes,  and the parton distribution functions of hadrons occurring in deep inelastic scattering.\nBroader impacts of the program include the cross-fertilization of nuclear and particle physics, a return on the investment in the experimental facilities at JLab and RHIC, and integration of research and education through  the research training of graduate students.  The interactions of graduate students with scientists who are prominent nationally and internationally is a contribution to the nation's infrastructure for research and education.    The PI used examples from this research program to illustrate key elements of core graduate classes in Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Chromodynamics for Nuclear and Particle Physics.   The PI and a theory colleague coordinated a seminar series for graduate students and postdoctoral associates to discuss and present aspects of QCD and field theory that underly this research program.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/14/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter C Tandy"
