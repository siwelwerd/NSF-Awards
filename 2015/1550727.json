 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in science, are underpinned by matching individual scientists and engineers to jobs within science-based organizations. Mobility between jobs ensures optimal matches between individuals and jobs. However, the existing literature is largely silent on how individual characteristics pose as barriers to mobility. This project explores gender differences in the mobility patterns and earnings of U.S. scientists. The goal of this pilot project is to investigate how family-related mobility constraints, particularly those related to marital and child-rearing status, explain a considerable share of the earnings disparity.  The results are important for policy aimed at increasing participation in the sciences and enabling individuals to realizing a full return on their and society's investment in scientific human capital. \r\n\r\nUsing the restricted access data-files in the National Science Foundation's Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), this project uses econometric techniques to understand in STEM education efforts of potential selection effects that may cause men and women of similar ability and preferences to sort into different science and engineering fields and labor force. This project adopts an integrative framework that analyses the interplay of gender, family status, mobility and earnings for scientists and engineers.\r\n",

Analyzing 9 panels of data collected from 1993 to 2010 on 49,335 scientists in the fields of science and engineering, we find that the gender gap is about 20% wider in academia than in industry. This wider academic gender gap in earnings cannot be explained by cohort composition of male and female scientists. Nor can we explain the phenomenon by the trailing spouse argument--that married women scientists optimize their (male) spouse career and earnings outcomes. Our analyses also ruled out the sorting of scientists by motivation at career entry or exit, difference in mobility opportunities between industry and academia, or difference in the degree of occupational segregation between the two sections. Rather, the data appear to link the wider gender gap in earnings faced by academic scientists with the rigid tenure evaluation system in academia. The academic gender gap is non-existent before the 7th year of professional age but widens in periods after the 7th year, particularly for women living with children. In contrast, there is no such 7th-year shift in the pattern of the gender gap among industrial scientists. The finding offers the basis for viewing gender gap difference between academia and industry from an institutional perspective and for policy-makers to design intervention accordingly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/27/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Waverly&nbsp;W&nbsp;Ding</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
