Recent studies infer a reduction of the AABW component from reduced volume of AABW entering global deep ocean basins around the Antarctic continent. It is important to obtain better estimates of AABW production rate in its source areas, and to investigate whether the global overturning circulation is slowing-down. \r\nThe project will continue fieldwork with CTD/LADCP surveys including 2 yearly repeat sections, mooring recoveries and deployments.  Seasonal-interannual variability of CDW intrusion, dense shelf water accumulation and export as well as overflow from the Prydz Bay shelf will also be observed.   \r\nThe Prydz Bay- Amery Ice Shelf region has been suggested as a key AABW production site. USAP access to this remote region of the Antarctic continent is challenging. The project will involve fieldwork to be carried out with Danish and Chinese collaboration aboard the Chinese research vessel, Xue Long. \r\n\r\nA high-resolution regional ocean-sea ice coupled model will be developed to allow time and space continuous three-dimensional ocean state estimation. Both in-situ and remote sensing observations along with the modeling simulation results will be used to investigate\r\n(i) the local atmosphere-ocean-sea ice interaction and shelf processes that produce dense shelf water and \r\n(ii) the dynamic processes that control the shelf water export.",

Recent studies infer a reduction of AABW production from reduced volume of AABW in global deep basins during recent decades. It is important to obtain better estimates of AABW production rate at its source areas to investigate whether the overturning circulation is slowing-down at the bottom branch. The Prydz Bay region has been suggested as a key AABW production site. However great uncertainties remain as to the volume of dense shelf water and how they are exported.

These water masses are often studied using the water mass transformation framework, in which surface fluxes of freshwater and heat are used to compute the rate that one water mass is transformed into another. This transformation rate, as it is known, is nearly always computed as a function of density. However, density alone cannot be used to distinguish water masses because waters of different compositions can have the same density. We reviewed prior studies and demonstrated how they conflate surface waters with subsurface water masses. To reconcile this problem, we used the Southern Ocean model reanalysis to illustrate a pair of complimentary techniques for understanding water mass transformation: computing transformations as a function of potential temperature and salinity, rather than density, and comparing these transformations to a census of the Southern Ocean water masses. We found that Circumpolar Deep Water is usually insulated from the sea surface and is thus not typically transformed by surface fluxes into upper and lower branches, as is commonly believed. We also demonstrated that Subantarctic Mode Water and Antarctic Intermediate Water are formed by density gain in the vicinity of the Subantarctic Front.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/13/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ruoying&nbsp;He</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1443491/1443491_10361706_1636859757260_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1443491/1443491_10361706_1636859757260_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Model domain\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1443491/1443491_10361706_1636859757260_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Model domain\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(A) Circumpolar domain.
