  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nThis project achieved the goal of deepening our understanding of holonomic D-modules and singularities on three different fronts: through the study of Bernstein-Sato polynomials, by computing monodromy of the Mirabolic Harish-Chandra D-module, and by defining a generalization of the period integral map for Hodge D-modules.  We also sought to extend the impact of this work beyond the immediate research community by organizing a learning seminar for graduate students at Northeastern and MIT, by drawing a connection to applications in physics, and by organizing a colloquium style seminar designed to encourage collaboration between mathematicians in different areas.  \n\n \nSystems of partial differential equations (PDEs) are the primary language used by physics to study various natural phenomena such as the movement of several particles interacting due to an attractive or repulsive force.   Holonomic D-modules give an algebraic approach to linear PDEs which is well-suited to understanding the symmetries and singularities of these systems. Singularities are places where the values of solutions go to infinity or change abruptly.  Holonomic D-modules are thus well-positioned to connect many different areas of mathematics: representation theory, algebraic geometric, integrable systems, Hodge theory, and symplectic geometry. \n\n \nIn a joint works with Asilata Bapat, The strong topological monodromy conjecture for Weyl hyperplane arrangements and The Bernstein-Sato b-function of the Vandermonde determinant, we prove several results about the Bernstein-Sato polynomials of certain holonomic D-modules associated to hyperplane arrangements.  A hyperplane arrangement is the intersection of many n-1-dimensional planes in n-dimensional-space.  Various arrangements come about naturally when studying braids, configuration spaces, and reflection groups and are of interest to algebraic geometers, topologists, and representation theorists.  One main goal is to develop invariants which can tell apart different arrangements through measurements of how complicated or singular the intersections of planes are.  There is a way to attach to each such arrangement a holonomic D-module and, from that, to compute an invariant, the Bernstein-Sato polynomial.  We compute an upper bound on the Bernstein-Sato polynomial of arrangements coming from Weyl groups.  We also prove a conjectured relationship between the Bernstien-Sato polynomial and another invariant, the topological zeta function. \n\n \nTogether with Valerio Toledano Laredo, we compute the monodromy of a local system coming the mirabolic Harish-Chandra D-module (in Monodromy of the mirabolic Harish-Chandra D -module).  The mirabolic Harish-Chandra D-module is a D-module associated to two different differential equations from physics, the Calogero-Moser system and the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations.   Loosely, computing monodromy means constructing solutions for the differential equation and understanding the evolution of these solutions near singularities of the system.  Our result extends work of Opdam, Heckmann, and Cherednik to compute monodromy for parameters for which it was not previously known.  We do this by using the relationship between the mirabolic Harish-Chandra D-module and representation theory of double affine Hecke algebras.  This allows us to introduce a set of difference operators, which are like differential operators but for discrete instead of continuous differences, which interact with the differential equation and allow us to relate solutions at unknown parameters to solutions at known ones.\n\n \nWorking with Laure Flapan and Xiaolei Zhao, we show, in Period integrals and Hodge modules, how the period integral map of Hodge theory can be extended to singular varieties using Hodge D-modules.  Hodge theory seeks to understand the geometry of spaces called complex algebraic varieties by investigating how the complex structure interacts with the cohomology classes of the space.  This interaction is recorded using a tool called the Hodge filtration.  A useful approach is to study complex algebraic varieties in smoothly varying families and track how the Hodge filtration varies as we move through the family.  This is called a variation of Hodge structure and can be described using a period integral map.  The limitation of this approach is that it is restricted to describing varieties which have no singularities.  We use Saito?s theory of Hodge D-modules to define a period integral map which is defined not just on smooth varieties, but also on ones with singularities.  We prove that our map generalizes the one defined in the smooth case.\n\n \nWe have undertaken to expand the audience for these research activities beyond the immediate research community.
