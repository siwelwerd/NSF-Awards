 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Linfield College to support biochemical research with undergraduate students in the chemistry and biology departments with the acquisition of a fast purification liquid chromatography (FPLC) system. A research-grade FPLC system will support cross-disciplinary research and training for a diverse group of undergraduate students, especially in the research areas of mitochondrial transcription protein interactions and protein folding patterns. This cutting edge instrument will strengthen the already robust molecular and cellular biology facilities and encourage the recruitment and retention of high quality faculty teacher-scholars, including those from underrepresented groups. The FPLC instrument will also allow for the development of a research-intensive biochemistry course that has at its core fundamental research into the structure and function of proteins. Thus, acquisition of a FPLC system will allow the chemistry and biology departments to support the education and training of students from biology, chemistry, and biochemistry and molecular biology majors in courses and participate in independent research and summer research as part of Linfield's Student-Faculty Collaborative Research Program.\r\n\r\nThis project has two research areas: 1) understanding regulatory mechanisms of mitochondrial transcription, and 2) investigating how distinct protein folding patterns may affect cellular function. Protein purification is essential to the methods of this project, and the FPLC system from this award will allow for the reproducible purification of the proteins of interest. Specifically, this includes mitochondrial proteins involved in transcription which are then used in an in vitro transcription assay, and conformational variants of the cortactin protein analyzed for functionality in an actin polymerization assay. Multiple methods of protein purification chromatography will be used including anion exchange chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, and metal ion affinity chromatography.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF-MRI award has funded the purchase of an AKTA pure 25M fast purification liquid chromatography (FPLC) system for interdisciplinary undergraduate research and teaching in the field of biochemistry at Linfield College.  This instrument has met specific objectives of the award by facilitating research aimed at determining the role of mitochondrial localized ligand activated transcription factors in the direct regulation of mitochondrial transcription.  The broader impact of the FPLC system is the education and training of students from biology, chemistry, and biochemistry and molecular biology majors; as well as those students who participate in student-faculty collaborative research at Linfield College.\n\nSpecifically, the instrument has been integrated into laboratory courses in the field of biochemistry, giving students hands-on training in the use of modern research instrumentation.  Experiments include the separation of proteins by size exclusion chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography, as well as independent protein purification projects.  Linfield students are learning to use an instrument that is commonly found in research and industrial labs across a broad range of fields.  The instrument is an important asset to the college because this type of interdisciplinary training is beneficial in students? education and for their careers after Linfield College.\n\nOne of the major activities of the instrument is its use by undergraduate research students in the high-quality purification of ligand-activated transcription factor proteins to investigate their ability to bind to mitochondrial DNA and affect mitochondrial transcription.  The three proteins of interest to-date, which have been identified as being localized to both mitochondria and the nucleus, are the human thyroid hormone alpha receptor, the human retinoid x receptor alpha, and the human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.  Characterizing mitochondrial transcription processes and regulation by transcription factors found in both the nucleus and mitochondria will have significant implications on the nuclear-mitochondrial regulatory circuit and on overall cellular function.  The results of research activities from this project have been disseminated through undergraduate student poster presentations at a number of local, regional, and national conferences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Megan Bestwick"
