 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF CNIC proposal #1444214\r\nUS-Belgium Workshop: Atomic Switch Networks for Neuromorphic Reservoir Computing\r\n\r\nPart 1:\r\nThe human brain outperforms digital computers in a number of tasks such as image, motion tracking and sound recognition and decision making in complex and often noisy and error prone environments. Digital computers are by their nature poorly-suited for tasks such as autonomous control (navigation, robotics), pattern recognition (speech, vision) or prediction (weather, financial markets). A biologically inspired approach to computing, called Reservoir Computing (RC), on the other hand, has demonstrated the potential to perform complex tasks efficiently. To perform RC, a newly developed hardware platform called the Atomic Switch Network (ASN) uses nanotechnology to create billions of synthetic synapses wired up in a fashion similar to that of the neocortex in the human brain. The implementation of a functioning RC-ASN system requires the collaborative expertise from recognized world leaders in RC methods at Ghent University, Belgium and the UCLA team who have developed the ASN device. UCLA has proposed a participant-driven workshop involving invited lectures, hands-on tutorials with hardware and software and breakout discussions with the goal to accelerate realization of this new form of computers system. This workshop will provide international research opportunities to 5 US students and early career researchers, while also promoting team-building skills, student-driven collaboration, and cultural exchange. By combining concepts from nanoscience, neuroscience, and machine learning, this proposal seeks to leverage the collective expertise of all parties to advance this next-generation cognitive technology. The successful outcomes of this research will also benefit the BRAIN Initiative, which is a priority research area of the U.S.\r\n  \r\nPart 2:\r\nAtomic Switch Networks (ASN) are a unique class of biologically inspired computing architectures designed to produce a complex, dynamical system through the collective interactions of functional nanoscale materials. These self-organized devices retain the intrinsic memory capacity of their component resistive switching elements while generating a class of emergent behaviors commonly associated with biological cognition. Their capacity for non-linear transformation of input information, which is processed and stored in a distributed fashion, generates patterns of dynamic spatiotemporal activity that can be used as the basis for a computational platform. Recent efforts to model, simulate, and measure the operational dynamics of ASNs toward hardware implementation of reservoir computing (RC), a burgeoning field that investigates the computational aptitude of complex biologically inspired systems to address problems in which data is constantly changing, incomplete, or subject to errors, indicate the necessity to establish a collaboration with experts in the field of machine learning. The combined expertise of proposed workshop participants will focus on a critical assessment of how to best utilize ASN devices to overcome current operational limits on real-time signal processing in the RC paradigm such as speed, network density, and scalability. Beyond lectures and discussion sections, tutorial workshops delivered by participants from the US and EU will be utilized to disseminate/demonstrate the current status of (1) modeling/simulation of ASNs, (2) physical implementations of ASNs, and (3) physical implementations of other hardware systems (memristors, optoelectronics, etc.). Targeted outcomes include identification of specific areas for near-term collaboration and follow-on funding within existing Core programs at the NSF.  This new collaboration will provide a tremendous opportunity to explore the best-case scenario resulting from the world's leading RC research with a potentially groundbreaking platform for hardware-based RC to contribute to novel approaches in real-time information processing and computation.",

While engineering achievements have produced dramatic improvements in the performance of computational CMOS, a gap remains between the potential to generate, model, and analyze artificial computing architectures which \"learn\" through experience and our ability to meaningfully harness their operational characteristics.

This diverse, multi-generational group of researchers provided complementary expertise in experiment, simulation, and analysis of electronic devices to draw new connections and explore potential research endeavors toward the development of future cognitive technologies using non-conventional hardware. The workshop format employed a blend of invited topical lectures, hands-on tutorials, breakout sessions, facility tours, and social events integrated using a participant-driven framework designed to advance scientific knowledge by enabling experts in the U.S. and EU to combine complementary talents and share resources in areas of strong mutual interest.

The group identified six major topic for discussions: (1) the brain &amp; computation, (2) challenges and opportunities for future computing, (3) reservoir computing basics, (4) training, learning &amp; adaptation, (5) materials and devices, and (6) architectures &amp; algorithms. Each topic formed the basis for extensive discussion and identified three areas which were further explored by graduate student participants in a breakout session format: (1) theory and application of reservoir computing, (2) new devices for reservoir computing, and (3) designing a new future for computing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The workshop participants identified four major challenges that must be addressed moving forward: (1) clearly demonstrate the power efficiency of reservoir computing methods with respect to traditional CMOS or deep learning implementations using specific tasks and applicable metrics, (2) identify applications (classes of problems) that specifically leverage the power of RC methods such as functionality in low-power, limited-connectivity environments, (3) develop design methodologies where tasks can be mapped to reservoir designs such as networks and hierarchies, and (4) integrate RC methods with other computing frameworks.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To address these challenges, the participating Institutions agreed to pursue a set of targeted action items defined to maintain momentum from the workshop and foster future collaborations.

UCLA and Ghent University have initiated an effort to further develop the simulation of memristive reservoirs for non-liner information processing. UCLA and Portland State University have initiated an effort to implement the novel sparse coding algorithms developed by PSU using the atomic switch network hardware developed at UCLA.
