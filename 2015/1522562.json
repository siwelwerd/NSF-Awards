 "awd_abstract_narration": "The James and Oasis de los Osos Reserves encompass an elevation gradient that extends from mixed conifer woodlands at 5400 ft and to the Coachella Valley in the northwestern corner of the Colorado Desert at 200 ft above sea level. A component of intellectual merit derives from the longevity of prior research. Without preserving historic baseline data and continuing to monitor these sites, the long term effects of climate change and disturbed environment cannot be understood. Faculty, graduate students, STEM teachers, governmental agencies and Idyllwild community leaders, collaborate to provide classroom instruction and communication with nonscientists and the public. The goal is to share with the general public an increased understanding of ecological science, including its findings, applications and pursuit of new discoveries. The proposed strategic plan will guide integration of research, teaching and outreach while preserving the unique natural resources and scientific legacy of the James and Oasis de los Osos. \r\n  \r\nThis planning activity will develop a 5 year plan for the James San Jacinto Mountains and Oasis de los Osos Reserves, two of 39 Reserves in the University of California Natural Reserve system. The strategic plan will devise steps to increase research, training and educational outreach activities while minimizing the impact of those activities on the Reserves. The overarching goal is to maximize understanding and stewardship of the unique desert-to-mountain ecotone through scientific research and education of teachers, students and the general public. Recent improvements in reserve facilities and changes in personnel and use patterns at the James and Oasis de los Osos Reserves require new vision and strategic plan on order to address the needs of current and future stakeholders. These circumstances have created a need to seek external expertise to help identify additional infrastructural improvements necessary to support the increased overnight capacity; suggest programmatic directions that will take advantage of the new facilities and will complement and enhance existing academic programs and databases; and define appropriate development of Oasis de los Osos to allow increased use without compromising the environment.",
