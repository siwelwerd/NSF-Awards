 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overarching goal of this project is to help the tribal communities of Upper Kuskokwim region take the lead in assessing and responding to the environmental changes that are coming with warming climate and thawing permafrost. Alaska?s land, water, plants, wildlife, and seasons are undergoing a great upheaval, and its people, especially the tribal communities living in remote villages are directly and severely impacted by these changes. The project will help build the tribal capacity to monitor changes in local climate and permafrost by providing the Tribes the scientific knowledge and skills necessary to acquire, analyze, and interpret scientific data through training and education. The project will establish local climate and permafrost observation system and map land cover and permafrost in the Upper Kuskokwim region. It will also develop a geo-hazard map for the region to facilitate safe subsistence and recreational practices and land use.\r\nThe specific objectives of this project are to 1) engage traditionally-underserved tribal communities of the Upper Kuskokwim region in permafrost and climate change research, 2) build community capacity to monitor changes in local climate and permafrost, 3) model the state and distribution of near-surface permafrost, and 4) develop a geo-hazard map. The high-resolution land cover, permafrost, and geo-hazard maps will serve the communities? need to identify sites experiencing rapid changes and could be hazardous. The land cover map will serve as a baseline map to detect future changes in land cover. The modeled permafrost maps of current and future decades will help identify sites where permafrost degradation will likely be severe if the climate continues to warm. \r\nThe project will offer the traditionally-underserved tribal communities of the Upper Kuskokwim region and the Tribal Council an opportunity to engage in climate research. It will provide them the motivation, resources, climate science knowledge and skills to study the impact of climate change on their tribal way of life and environment. The data, knowledge, and skills gained through this project will benefit the tribal communities in adaptive management of subsistence resources, implementation of safe land use practices, and planning for the future. The scientific community will also benefit hugely by having an improved understanding of permafrost dynamics, access to field data and maps from this understudied remote part of Alaska. In addition, the project will provide outreach and workshops on climate change to the community members in Nikolai and to all students and teachers in Iditarod Areas School District through the Distance Learning Center facility in Fairbanks, Alaska.",

Based on a comparison of results of surveys conducted in the village of Nikolai (Interior Alaska) and Kotzebue (North-West of Alaska) we confirmed our hypothesis that people living in the areas with different permafrost distribution have different concerns related to ongoing natural changes. Members of communities located within the discontinuous permafrost zone (Interior Alaska) have more problems with indirect ecological consequences of climate changes, such as area drought, decreasing of forest productivity and changes in water bodies and wetlands freeze up, while people living in the zone of continuous permafrost (North Slope) are more concern about changes of permafrost itself such us melting of ground ice which results in ground surface collapse and infrastructure damages, increasing of permafrost temperature that reducing abilities of usage of permafrost cellars as food storage.&nbsp;To help build community capacity to monitor changes in the soil environment, we established community-operated ground temperature observation networks at the vicinities of participating settlements. At the village of Nikolai network includes 7 observation points, at the village of Telida &ndash; 13 and at the city of Kotzebue &ndash; 4.&nbsp;Also, we created a land cover map for a 400 km2 area surrounding the Telida village from SPOT orthorectified satellite image (2.5 m pixel size). During the field visit, we performed preliminary survey within different ecotypes at Nikolai village to determine the presence of permafrost within an upper meter of soil as well as conducted more detail research at Telida village including both measurements of thaw depth and soil sampling within each land cover class to assess and improve the accuracy of the land cover map, and to collect soil samples. The results of these surveys will be integrated with the land cover map to create a soil map. The soil map is an essential input for modeling near-surface permafrost distribution.Based on our modeling results and field observations we understand that permafrost existence around Telida village is completely controlled by the local ecological conditions i.e. permafrost is present in specific ecotype settings such as low ericaceous shrub and black spruce ecotype. Any change in ecotypes caused by either natural process (e.g. wildfires) or human activity (e.g. clearing of forest, disturbing surface drainage) will lead to faster permafrost thawing and significant surface disturbances. Degradation of near-surface permafrost will also result in drier soil and eventually affect vegetation productivity and make forests prone to wildfires. Results of our ground temperature observations show that in the Upper Kuskokwim region permafrost is actively thawing now. At the 7 of 11 observation points, which are underlined by permafrost active (seasonally thawed) layer did not freeze up completely during the winters of 2017-18 and 2018-19. This process might initiate the formation of new wetlands at the areas with ice-rich permafrost (mostly at the low topography levels) or serious drought of the topsoil layer at the hills.&nbsp;Outreach activities We conducted one open house meeting in the village of Nikolai and provided two public lectures about permafrost, climate changes, and it significance for Alaskan local comunities in the city of Kotzebue.
