 "awd_abstract_narration": "Temperature is a fundamental variable controlling many processes in polar systems, but surprisingly few attempts to synthesize the effects of temperature on the growth of single-celled organisms called phytoplankton have been made.  Because phytoplankton are the base of all marine food webs, they play an essential role in the ocean's ecology.  Many global models use a simple relationship that extrapolate the effects of temperature on phytoplankton growth derived from warmer waters to polar temperatures, but this introduces substantial uncertainties in the models' results. This project will investigate the effects of temperature on growth at the low temperatures encountered in polar systems.  Furthermore, given the potential oceanic changes expected in the future, it will allow much more accurate predictions of future responses to this change. The project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. The project will involve a graduate student in the fieldwork and undergraduates in research activities at the home institution. Results from the work will be incorporated into a new undergraduate course and the researchers will involve the public through general lectures and other outreach activities. \r\n\r\nTemperature is a fundamental variable in all ecosystems, and is the single most important delimiting feature of polar systems.  It is also likely to be influenced by climate change; indeed, some (but not all) regions in the Antarctic have experienced significant atmospheric warming in the past half century.  Despite the clear and profound influence of temperature of biological systems, nearly all models use a temperature-growth rate formulation derived from warmer temperatures.  Modeled estimates of phytoplankton photosynthesis may underestimate these rates by up to 60% if the growth rate is underestimated by this temperature-phytoplankton growth relationship. If so, this could have profound impacts on regional and global models of the impacts of temperature change on oceanic productivity. To address this uncertainty, this project will quantify the phytoplankton maximum growth rate-temperature relationship at temperatures encountered in the Antarctic (less than 4 degrees C).  Phytoplankton isolated from Antarctic waters will be used in experiments designed to assess the maximum growth rates of a number of types of phytoplankton that occur in the Antarctic. Temperature perturbation experiments will be performed to assess the response of Antarctic phytoplankton to a range of temperatures after having been acclimated to increased temperatures during growth.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was designed to assess the impacts of temperature on phytoplankton growth in polar oceans.  Phytoplankton &ndash; single celled photosynthetic organisms that live in the surface of the ocean &ndash; are the base of all marine food webs.  Any changes in the environment can result in changes in their rate of growth and accumulation, as well as changes in the types of organisms in the population.  Indirect effects of the changes in phytoplankton are numerous: changes in the rate of removal in carbon to depth, changes in the ability of herbivorous organisms to feed on them, alteration of the rate of carbon dioxide removal from the surface layer and atmosphere, and others. \n\nPolar regions are experiencing, or will experience, changes in the temperature of surface waters.  These changes can be large-scale, or restricted to selected regions, but in general the trend in past decades has shown polar waters to be increasing in temperature.  While some studies have suggested that such changes will increase phytoplankton growth and photosynthesis, it is uncertain how uniform this change might be, and even if it will occur.  Studies on the effects of temperature on phytoplankton growth have not concentrated on those temperatures found in polar waters (from -1.85 to 4&deg;C), so substantial uncertainty exists as to the effects of temperature increases in polar waters on phytoplankton growth.  Given that these systems have evolved over long time periods to cold temperatures, it is feasible that a series of negative ecological changes might occur simply due to the effects of increased temperatures on phytoplankton.  Given the rate of changes in recent decades, understanding the quantitative response of phytoplankton to temperature is essential to a prediction of the impacts of climate change.\n\nWe conducted experiments in which phytoplankton were exposed to a range of temperatures and their growth quantified.  A total of eight species were used that were representative of polar oceans.  Our results have shown that growth of polar phytoplankton is indeed temperature dependent.  That is, growth increased in many species as temperatures were increased from -1.5 to 4&deg;C.  However, the rates of growth were surprisingly low among all species assessed.  It is possible that growth at low temperatures has indeed been overestimated historically, but it is also possible that the acclimations that phytoplankton undergo in culture obscure the changes that can be attributed solely to temperature.  These low absolute rates also are in contrast to some field studies that have estimated growth rates, but are similar to others that have focused solely on the effects of temperature.  We also found considerable variations among species tested, with some species growing \"as expected\" &ndash; that is, growing faster with small temperature increases &ndash; while others were unable to grow at selected temperatures.  Knowledge of where the species tested were isolated did not correlate with their response.  These variations suggest that a response to temperature increases among phytoplankton species will not be uniform, and individual responses may be as important as population responses. \n\nPolar waters have a large number of species, and it is often difficult &ndash; and risky - to extrapolate from cultured forms to those that are living in situ.  Most polar systems are not only changing with regard to temperature, but also are changing with regard to nutrient concentrations, light availability, turbulence in the surface layer of the ocean, and losses due to herbivorous organisms.  Isolating the effects of temperature is a first step in understanding how phytoplankton respond to such changes, but understanding the full impacts of changing environments requires experiments that were beyond the scope of this project.  Our results provide some initial insights into the role of temperature on phytoplankton growth, but are no way the \"final answer\".  A complete assessment of environmental changes is required to fully understand and predict the future changes of phytoplankton in polar regions.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/25/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Walker O Smith"
