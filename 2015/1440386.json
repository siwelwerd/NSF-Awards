 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern biology is in the midst of profound change, owing in part to the convergence of ideas from the mathematical sciences with those in the biological and life sciences.  It is a national goal to accelerate this convergence and it is the role of the Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI) to help with this acceleration.  Common principles in mathematics, statistics, and computational science are helping scientific understanding in fields as diverse as neuroscience, epidemiology, ecology, genomics, physiology, and cancer, among many others.  MBI supports these interactions through robust postdoctoral fellow and early career research and training programs and through a workshop program that brings together interdisciplinary researchers in the mathematical and life sciences.\r\n\r\nMBI has four principal goals.  (1) To foster innovation in the application of mathematical, statistical, and computational methods in the resolution of significant problems in the biosciences.  (2) To foster the development of new areas in the mathematical sciences motivated by important questions in the biosciences.  (3) To engage mathematical and biological scientists in these pursuits.  (4) To expand the community of scholars in mathematical biosciences through education, training, and support of students, postdoctoral fellows, and researchers.   MBI will achieve these goals through its extensive and distributed postdoctoral fellow program based on co-mentoring by researchers in both the mathematical and biological sciences; through its early career training program that enables tenure-track but untenured researchers to participate in MBI programming for an extended period; through its robust interdisciplinary workshop programs; and through its long-term visitor program.",
