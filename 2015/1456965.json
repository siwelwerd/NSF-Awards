 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of this project is to elucidate how serial order is coded by the brain.  If you were to read this sentence aloud, you would utter a precise, ordered sequence of over 50 distinct vocal sounds in less than 10 seconds.  How does the brain store the individual sounds of speech and then coordinate the production of these sounds in a meaningful order so quickly?  A similar question could be asked about the pianist performing a Mozart sonata, the songs of birds, or the mating dances of insects.  How the brain stores these elaborate sequences of behavior remains unknown.  Using the songbird zebra finch, a model organism that learns meaningful sequences of vocal sounds like humans do, the interdisciplinary research team will test the hypothesis that the brain encodes and stores sequences of behavior through two separate mechanisms that operate in parallel: one coding mechanism for the sequence of vocal sounds and one for the vocal sounds themselves.  Given the diversity of animal species that display elaborate, meaningful sequences of behavior, the findings will influence understanding across a broad array of organisms, including humans.  The research plan coordinates the activity of a faculty research team from four different disciplines (Neuroanatomy, Neurophysiology, Mathematics, and Statistics) and will provide students with a unique interdisciplinary training opportunity and environment.  \r\n\r\nObserved in nearly all animal forms (and exemplified by human speech) serial order in behavior consists of learning to organize a set of elemental gestural units into a purposeful sequence of action. Adult male zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) produce a highly quantifiable example of serial order in behavior (birdsong).  Moreover, a premotor cortical region (HVC, proper name) is known to encode a consolidated premotor trace of song. Although consisting of similar cell types, the medial and lateral portions of HVC are hypothesized to encode the sequence (medial HVC) and syllables (lateral HVC) of song in parallel. The research team will test whether these two dimensions of song are encoded by physiological differences in 1) afferent input to medial and lateral HVC, or 2) the intrinsic network properties of medial and lateral HVC (or a combination of 1 and 2). However, parallel encoding of serial order in behavior should be hierarchical, with traces for sequence in a supervisory position over traces for elemental gestural units. The team will also test whether efferent axons emanating from medial and lateral HVC interact in a hierarchical fashion within vocal-motor cortex. Results will elucidate a network architecture for serial order in behavior and provide a computational platform to understand how learning new sequences shapes such memory architectures.",
