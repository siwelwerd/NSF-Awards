 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) and Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) programs, Emory University will acquire a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer. This instrumentation will advance research activities spanning the fields of synthetic organic chemistry, catalysis and new methodology development, natural products and materials characterization, inorganic chemistry, biomolecular chemistry, and the integration of spectroscopic information with theoretical studies. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out modern research. This instrument will also be an integral component in training undergraduate and graduate students. It will advance the teaching and research training mission of the department by providing hands-on NMR experience in applying advanced NMR topics covered in core academic and supplemental summer courses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research in areas such as (a) studying natural product synthesis; (b) studying reactivity, catalysis and synthetic strategy, to drive pharmaceutical and materials innovation; (c) developing stereoselective methods and their applications in total synthesis and drug discovery; (d) discovering reactions with a particular aim to apply to transition metal chemistry; (e) understanding signaling pathways involved in human health and disease; (f) exploring functional and well-defined macromolecular structures with various applications; (g) studying polyoxometalate (POM) complexes and POM-based materials, and their uses as catalysts; (h) developing synthetic methods in contexts ranging from selective activation and functionalization of traditionally inert starting materials; (i) developing small molecular radiotracers for positron emission tomography; (i) studying antimicrobial principles in medicinal plants; and (j) discovering therapeutic agents and the structural basis for their interactions with target proteins.",
