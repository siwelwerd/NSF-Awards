 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lakes and rivers are part of the terrestrial landscape, but their contributions to the terrestrial greenhouse gas (GHG) balance have typically not been explicitly included in global GHG budgets.  CO2 is the dominant GHG, however CH4 is a more potent long-lived atmospheric GHG, and viewed to account for up to 20-30% of the global warming effect. Atmospheric CH4 levels are on the rise again after a hiatus of several years, yet attributing this rise to specific changes in sources/sinks has so far proved elusive. Accurately predicting how freshwater contributions to the global CH4 budget may be altered by changes to environmental conditions requires a better mechanistic understanding of all the biological processes that form CH4.  Research in this project has the potential to contribute to a paradigm shift in our understanding of biological CH4 production. To date, this microbiological activity has been known to be a strictly anaerobic process, yet recent scientific literature has described CH4 synthesis in oxygen saturated aquatic environments. This phenomenon was also observed in Yellowstone Lake, a pristine lake that is largely protected from anthropogenic inputs and thus represents an aquatic system that is natural in composition and function. The research component of this award will focus on identifying the biological basis for CH4 synthesis in an oxic environment, and promises to provide novel contributions to the field of microbial ecology as well as an enhanced understanding of CH4 cycling in the biosphere. This project is collaborative, where both principal investigators will provide state-of-the-art technical guidance to a postdoctoral scholar (human resource development) who will gain experience in both field and lab activities. These students will be recruited from underrepresented groups from the state of Montana (Native Americans). The investigators will continue their broader impacts efforts by reaching out public media and K-12 school teachers.\r\n\r\nCH4 is a biogenic gas that is an important component of global carbon cycling.  While viewed to be produced strictly by methanogens, it nevertheless is found at supersaturating concentrations in oxic marine and freshwaters.  Known as the \"methane paradox\" this has been the focus of significant efforts aimed at understanding its biological basis.  Generation by methanogens in benthic environments and aerobic metabolism of methylated compounds may contribute at some level, but cannot account for the bulk of this CH4.   Rather, recent reports point to methanogens in oxygen saturated environments, and even more paradoxically, the involvement of oxygenic phototrophs.  The preliminary efforts by the investigators on Yellowstone Lake are consistent with these novel observations and imply methanogenesis under oxygen saturating conditions.  This proposed research aims to unveil the biology that underlies the paradoxical formation of the pelagic methane enriched zone (PMEZ) in O2 saturated water column of Yellowstone Lake by 1) characterization of methane distribution and cycling rates, and identification of the C substrate involved in methanogenesis; and 2) isolation and characterization of the organisms involved. Research funded by this award promises to shed considerable light on the identity of the underlying biology, interesting microbial synergistic relations and contribute to a more complete understanding of carbon cycling in aquatic environments.",
