 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide funds to acquire a compact Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) to support a new collaborative Geobiology Research Group, consisting of current and new faculty in Biology and Geosciences. This group's mission is to facilitate cross-disciplinary research, with the primary goal of training undergraduate researchers. Geobiology is a rapidly-growing research area that focuses on the interaction of microorganisms with their mineral environment, and SEM is a critical tool to study both organisms and mineral analysis. The SEM to be acquired is a new compact but full-featured, low-cost instrument that is well suited as a cross-disciplinary microscope for a primarily-undergraduate institution. \r\n\r\nThe instrument will be used to characterize both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbes, minerals produced by microbial activity, and the geochemical and microstructural attributes of fossil biosignatures and host rock lithology. Designed for simplicity and ease of maintenance, this compact, research-grade SEM is ideal for an institution focused on fostering independent undergraduate research projects to explore both the current and past evolution of microbes and their environment.",

This group?s mission is to facilitate cross-disciplinary research, with the primary goal of training undergraduate researchers.\n\nThe Tescan VEGA3 is a new compact but full-featured, low-cost (&lt;$200K) instrument that is well suited as a cross-disciplinary microscope for a primarily-undergraduate institution. The instrument scans in several modes (secondary electron, back-scattered electron) and both low and high vacuum.    This particular model was chosen based on reviews from researchers at other institutions (e.g., US Geological Survey, UC Los Angeles), low-maintenance cost, and ease of use.  CSU Chico does not currently have significant analytical capabilities and is in the developmental stage of infrastructure so this SEM is an excellent gateway for expanding research capabilities at the institution.\n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nThe microscope will be primarily used to develop collaborative projects, primarily in geobiology.  At the time of this final report, we are still finalizing protocols and fine-tuning the machine but several projects have already started.  One M.S. project under the supervision of P.I. E. Nuester is investigating the mercury uptake in roots in an estuary and the preliminary results were presented at a university-wide research symposium.  P.I. Shapiro has used the instrument to categorize amphibole minerals in a study assessing the alteration of biosignatures.  A colleague in Chemistry has been using the instrument with undergraduate research students this summer to investigate thin films.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThe major impact of this grant has been the furthering research in the exciting field of geobiology at a primarily undergraduate institution.  The P.I.s have each developed new research projects and most involve undergraduate researchers; the others, graduate students.  Therefore, we see the purchase of the Tescan as both a chance to engage in cutting-edge research and also in training the next generation of researchers.  It is our goal to submit several significant funding proposals based on the ability to incorporate the SEM into the research program.  Currently, a proposal is being submitted to NSF-EAR-IF for the purchase of an ICP-MS involving PIs J. Nuester and Shapiro.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Russell Shapiro"
