 "awd_abstract_narration": "Fifty undergraduate students (10 per year for five years) will be recruited to participate in a 10-week summer residential research experience in Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. Their research will include understanding and prediction of weather, climate, and air pollution. Established partnerships with a network of minority-serving undergraduate institutions will be used to ensure that participating students are recruited from a broad range of demographics representing the US population, including groups that have previously been underrepresented in meteorology and atmospheric science. \r\n\r\nREU participants will go through the full research process of choosing a topic, developing a research idea, conducting a literature review, writing a final report, and giving a presentation in a conference setting. The culmination of the summer research experience is a symposium where REU participants will present a scientific poster and give an oral presentation on their summer research projects. By the conclusion of the summer research program participants will be well prepared to conduct scientific research, have a deeper understanding of the graduate school experience. Through the REU Site, students will establish a network of individuals and mentors, who will not only be future resources, but mentors who will play an important role in the development of participants as scientists.",

Forty-six participants completed the surveys. Analysis was conducted on open-ended survey questions using quantitative content analysis (Krippendorff, 2012), which focuses on the manifest meaning of each response. Means and standard deviations were calculated for each pre- and post-REU survey response, and significant differences were determined using a paired, two-tailed Student&rsquo;s t-test.

The alumni of the program have followed a variety of career tracks after participating in our REU program.

The most striking increases in confidence and knowledge occurred in their understanding what everyday research work is like (p &lt; 0.0001), preparing a scientific poster (p &lt; 0.0001), programming or coding with computers (p &lt; 0.0001), analyzing data for patterns (p &lt; 0.0001), and figuring out the next step in a research project (p &lt; 0.0001).
