The theme of the BME XIX conference is Engineering Next Generation Solutions, and it will be organized under the auspices of the Engineering Conferences International (ECI), a not-for-profit global engineering conferences program.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the conference will be on research at the cutting-edge of biotechnology including synthetic biology, biomolecular design, the nano-bio interface, biofuels, metabolic engineering, biomolecular networks, and stem cell differentiation in combination with core areas of Biochemical Engineering. In addition, workshops  will address how the biochemical engineering community can develop technologies that respond to global threats like Ebola, and how Biochemical Engineering Education might change in the future  in response to the needs of industry for a workforce trained in specific areas.\r\n\r\nThe conference is co-sponsered by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division and by the Synthetic and Systems Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology.",
