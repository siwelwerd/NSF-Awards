 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: Biological physics of DNA bending\r\n\r\nDNA is one of the essential molecules of life, carrying the genetic information of a cell.  The mechanical properties of DNA are related to the ability of different protein complexes to bind to DNA, and control gene expression and DNA repair.  Understanding DNA mechanics, especially at short length scales, ends up being more complicated than the mechanics of more classic materials such as an elastic rod, given the double-helical nature and inhomogeneous building blocks of DNA.  This research will produce physical insights that will advance our understanding of the relationship between DNA mechanics and several important DNA-related biological processes. In this project, the PI will investigate how sharp DNA bending promotes tight packaging of the genome, local defects in the double helix, and protein transport between DNA sites, all features that have implications on gene expression and DNA repair.  The PI will train undergraduates in his lab and offer scientific demonstrations to K-12 students.  \r\n\r\nDespite the current atomistic-level knowledge of DNA structure, conformational changes and fluctuations of DNA at short length scales are not trivial to understand. Especially, spontaneous looping of DNA is highly sensitive to sequence, intrinsic curvature, and length scale. In this project, the PI will investigate how biophysics of spontaneous DNA looping impacts DNA-protein interactions. In the first aim, the PI will measure stability of small DNA loops as a function of nucleosome preference. This aim will address whether the sequence rule of nucleosome formation can be better understood from DNA mechanics in the strong bending regime. In the second aim, the PI will measure stability of small DNA loops with and without highly meltable regions. This aim will address whether strong DNA bending can enhance local melting of duplex DNA. In the third aim, the PI will measure association and dissociation kinetics of DNA binding proteins in various DNA constructs. This aim will address whether DNA looping can facilitate protein transfer. The PI will use single-molecule fluorescence techniques and coarse-grained DNA models to conduct this research.",

In pursuit of this goal, specific aims were proposed to measure the sequence dependence of DNA bending stiffness, to measure temperature dependence of DNA looping, to measure bending stiffnesses of base pair mismatches, and to measure the effect of DNA looping on DNA target search by proteins. For the first three aims, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) was used to monitor the loop formation of ~100-bp DNA with sticky ends, and for the last aim, Protein Induced Fluorescence Enhancement (PIFE) was used to monitor DNA site recognition by a protein. We compared the looping rate between AT-rich sequences and GC-rich sequences, but failed to observe a systematic difference between the two groups. The temperature dependence of the looping rate between the two groups was also similar, ruling out the idea that local melting of base pairs can contribute to fast loop formation. Finally, we investigated whether spontaneous DNA looping can mediate transfer of proteins over long distances and accelerate their target search, but found such effect to be negligible. Although most of the hypothesis-driven research returned negative results, the project had several intellectual merits: (1) We observed a noticeable correlation between the looping and unlooping rates of different sequences, which led to the demonstration of the cooperative kinking mechanism in small DNA loops; (2) We learned that the bending stiffness of a mismatch is likely to vary as a function of bending angle; (3) We found that DNA looping is highly anisotropic, favoring directions that are compatible with the intrinsic curvature of the DNA; and (4) We showed that the FRET-looping assay can be used to probe the direction and magnitude of the intrinsic curvature, which can aid in our understanding of nucleosome positioning signal in the future. For the broader impact, we proposed to create an entropic force simulator based on subwoofer-driven beads and a bead-chain. In this simulator, the subwoofer mechanically agitates beads inside a small container, which then collides with a bead chain whose one end is fixed to the wall of the container. With this device, we were hoping to demonstrate how random collisions between beads and the bead chain can result in a unidirectional pulling force on the bead chain. However, the compact subwoofer we tested was not able to sustain the power output required to generate ample collisions inside the container. In the future, we plan to improve the device performance with a more powerful subwoofer and test two-dimensional analogs of this device that offer a higher collision frequency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/16/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Harold&nbsp;Kim</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
