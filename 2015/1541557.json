 "awd_abstract_narration": "The world is crawling with insects, many of which play crucial roles as pollinators, prey, mutualists, and critical components of ecosystem health. Despite their significance, insects remain understudied, imposing major limitations on our understanding of the patterns and processes in insect ecology and evolution. Butterflies are the exception, however, thanks to the efforts of centuries of collectors and enthusiasts who have appreciated their beauty and fascinating biology. More is known about their morphology, species distributions, behavior, and larval resources than any other insect group. However, this information needs to be synthesized, placed in an evolutionary context, and made available for research. This project will achieve these two goals by reconstructing the evolutionary history of the approximately 18,800 described species and assembling a database of biological information about each species using field guides, social media, collections, and other sources. All of this information will be made available to the public via a website with the goal of catalyzing synthetic research and comparative studies. In addition to public outreach and education, the members of the research team will train graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in systematics and bioinformatics.\r\n\r\nThis project will produce a set of online tools and databases for comparative studies of butterflies. At the heart of the project is the assembly of a molecular phylogeny incorporating all known butterfly species. A hierarchical approach will be used to reconstruct butterfly relationships. To create a robust backbone phylogeny, approximately 500 loci will be captured from a single exemplar species from within each of the ~1,800 genera using anchored enrichment prior to sequencing. Genetic data from public databases and from our own sequencing efforts will then be collected to include remaining known species and complete the phylogeny. Model-based inference will examine the complexity of speciation, extinction, biogeography, and trait evolution. Existing locality data will be assembled from museum collections, inventories, citizen science monitoring networks, and expert knowledge to model species distributions using the integrative Map of Life framework. Species trait data have already been assembled for some groups and regions, but this project will create a consistent, harmonized trait database while also closing major gaps to create a globally comprehensive compilation of trait data on species life history, interactions, ecology, and distributions. All of these data layers will be made available through the Map of Life online platform, thus delivering community vetted and curated data and tools to catalyze comparative research.",

Research has focused on butterflies in part because of the wealth of biological information available for many taxa. Variation in wing colors and patterns have been studied as signals for sexual selection and communication, including mimicry, adaptive polymorphism, and speciation. Species limits, higher classification, species distributions, larval host plants, behavior, and interspecific symbionts are known better for butterflies than for any other insect group. Butterflies also frequently act as proxies for other insects when assessing the effects of climate change and habitat destruction as they are typically the only invertebrate taxon with sufficiently detailed information that it is possible to identify and track their distribution and abundance over time.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this wealth of information about butterflies has been scattered in hundreds of regional field guides and other sources varying in quality and information content. We compiled life history data about each species from disparate sources into a single, accessible database, and at the same time, created a highly resolved phylogeny to serve as a framework for understanding the evolution of different traits including larval host use, biogeography, and mimicry. To facilitate aggregation of species trait data we built an integrative online platform that serves as a central library of data sources and database of information about each species. This is now freely accessible to the world-wide community of researchers as well as to the public.</p>\n<p>Our phylogenetic analyses of butterflies have succeeded in providing a robust framework for further comparative research.&nbsp;We first generated a backbone tribal-level phylogeny based on DNA data from 352 loci from 207 species representing all families and subfamilies and 98% of the tribes. This demonstrated the utility of our cost-effective and efficient ?anchored hybrid enrichment? approach in gathering informative genome-wide DNA sequence data even from dried museum specimens with degraded DNA. We then extended our approach to a genus-level analysis&nbsp;that sampled&nbsp;2,268 species representing&nbsp;<em>ca</em>. 90% of all described butterfly genera. This study&nbsp;dated the&nbsp;origin of the butterflies as a whole to the Late Cretaceous, ~100 million years ago (Ma), and&nbsp;of their seven major extant families to the Late Cretaceous - Early Paleogene boundary (~79-63 Ma). Multiple analyses indicated that&nbsp;a Fabaceae-feeding ancestor arose in the Northern Hemisphere, contrary to prior evidence suggesting a Gondwanan origin. After most extant lineages dispersed across Beringia, they spread throughout the equatorial tropics in the Early Cenozoic.&nbsp;Butterfly diversification largely followed radiation of their main host plant lineages, suggesting that plants provided a template facilitating diversification of adapted species as ecological opportunities arose. Our final exploration of the species-level phylogeny&nbsp;contains exemplars of&nbsp;&gt;10,000 species, and a full analysis is expected by the end of 2022. These strongly supported, well-sampled systematic studies have highlighted many non-monophyletic tribes and genera that will be split and re-described.</p>\n<p>In addition to these papers about the systematics of butterflies as a whole, our multi-investigator team has published more than 20 additional papers on the evolution of different groups within the butterflies. For our database of life history and trait data, we scanned and databased information from over 100 field guides and online sources. We compiled approximately 150,000 host plant records for &gt;7,000 butterfly species and formatted this information as a computable spreadsheet in which both insect and plant taxonomies have been standardized. In addition, we created species checklists for every country in the world. These large-scale efforts are being published as open-access data papers so that others can be aware of and easily access the information we have gathered, vetted, and standardized.</p>\n<p>Our large-scale data accumulation and analyses were made possible through the establishment of the global ButterflyNet network comprising &gt;60 male and female butterfly scientists from <em>ca.</em> 28 countries in the Global North and the Global South on every habitable continent (butterflynet.org). ButterflyNet has provided training for 6 postdoctoral fellows, 4 of whom are women and one of whom is Black, as well as numerous graduate students and assistants.
