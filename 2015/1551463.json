 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will conduct a study of the outcomes achieved by teams in the National Science Foundation Innovation Corps for Learning Program (NSF I-Corps L) and will analyze the specific activities found to be successful in helping educational innovations achieve wider use and impact. NSF's Innovation Corps for Learning Program takes discoveries and promising practices from education research and development and provides support to help achieve broader adoption of these STEM education and learning innovations. I-Corps L teams receive support in the form of mentoring and funding to accelerate scaling of educational innovations in a sustainable manner. This project will examine the results from I-Corps L and determine if and how the participating team members apply what they learned through I-Corps L.  This work will identify and monitor the outcomes of participation in I-Corps L on the scaling up educational innovations of the team as well as the professional development of the team members.  The project will seek to identify the key features and pathways in the educational systems which are most useful to I-Corps L teams in successfully scaling up and sustaining their STEM education-related innovations. This study will provide a better understanding of the long-term outcomes achieved by the I-Corps L program.  This information will be useful in helping other educational innovations to achieve greater impact. \r\n\r\nThis project will document the longitudinal outcomes of the three I-Corps L cohorts trained in 2015 and early 2016 and will create a greater understanding of the conditions that are responsible for their relative success. The investigation will be guided by two main questions. First, what are the outcomes of participation in I-Corps L on the teams' innovations, the team members' personal and professional development? Second, what are the key features of and pathways within the ecosystems in which I-Corps L team members seek to successfully scale and sustain their STEM education-related innovations?   Through surveys and interviews with participants, experts and education entrepreneurs the project will document the intermediate and long-term outcomes of participation in I-Corps L on the teams' innovations and on team members' personal and professional development and the factors associated with the I-Corps L process; and identify and define the key features and pathways in the ecosystem(s) in which I-Corps L team members seek to successfully scale and sustain their STEM education-related innovations.  Results will include a set of recommendations and observations to support future research and evaluation of NSF education programs including I-Corps L and recommendations for NSF's role and policies directed to scaling STEM educational innovations.  This study will become part of an emerging body of literature around educational related entrepreneurial studies in STEM.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nI-Corps&trade; L (ICL) is a spin-off of the nationally recognized I-Corps&trade; course designed to foster commercialization of grant-funded projects.  ICL is specifically targeted at STEM education-related innovations.  The purpose of this research project was to document and understand the outcomes of participation in ICL on the teams? innovations, institutions, and members.  It also sought to study the entrepreneurial ecosystems in which ICL team members seek to sustain and scale their innovations. \n\nTo address these questions, a rich longitudinal data set comprised of surveys given across three years was compiled.  ICL team members and mentors were asked about the status of their innovations, the individual impacts of ICL, and the challenges and barriers that they faced.  This survey-based data set was supplemented by a set of interviews with ICL team members.  This mixed-methods approach allowed for both a comprehensive view of all the ICL teams, as well as qualitative perspective that was critical in understanding the complexities surrounding this entrepreneurial ecosystem.\n\nDespite substantial variation in the status of the team?s innovation before ICL, less than a year after ICL most teams were still active, and up to two years after the training about three-quarters of the teams could be considered active.  Most teams remained in an academic setting.  The teams reported that the primary barriers they faced were related to a lack of financial and human resources support.\n\nA critical finding that emerged from the study regards the motivations of the PI and EL going into ICL.  In contrast to the canonical I-Corps&trade; program, they are generally not looking to sustain and scale their innovation outside of their current profession.  As a result, the impacts of ICL on the individual were mostly seen through participants developing entrepreneurial mindsets, and applying this type of thinking in their day-to-day work.  Most PIs were faculty, and they were reluctant to change their career paths to pursue their innovation full-time.  In some situations, this led to institutions incorporating intellectual property issues into their policies.\n\nThe mentors that participated in ICL were not vastly more experienced than the team members.  In fact, many mentors took on the duties of a PI or EL, effectively acting as another team member.  While there were some who did adhere to a more conventional mentor role, some also balanced being both a team member and a mentor.\n\nDespite the limitations of studying the ecosystem, several critical insights emerged from these data.  Firstly, sustaining versus scaling is an important distinction for ICL participants. To many PIs we interviewed, sustaining an innovation is not seen as a pre-condition of scaling. Making an innovation self-sustaining was a worthy goal.  Achieving perpetual benefits of an initially grant-funded program without having to write other grants or be limited to three-year funding cycles was a desired outcome, one rarely achieved by grantees. Secondly, whether teams seek to simply sustain their innovation beyond grant funding or whether they seek to scale broadly, ICL was a valued as a stepping stone to success.  This study revealed significant shifts in the attitudes and behaviors of ICL participants, whose entrepreneurial alter-egos have blossomed as a result of exposure to program concepts and customer discovery. Most participant comments about ICL were extremely positive; PIs spoke about how the experience has changed how they think about designing education-related products, programs, and/or services. The program changed their thinking about what they do and how they do it, causing many to apply an entrepreneurial mindset to their research that sparked them to continue developing their innovations beyond initial grant funding.   Lastly, ICL training is a necessary but insufficient vehicle by which to promote either sustaining or scaling of NSF innovations. Both in spite of and because of the transformation towards an entrepreneurial mindset, some PIs felt let down by NSF due to lack of follow-up support after ICL.\n\nFrom these results, several recommendations for the ICL program were derived.  Firstly, there may be value for ICL in expanding the training to go beyond customer discovery, and introduce more advanced components of scaling an innovation, such as gathering evidence for BMC viability through sales and follow-on grants, as well as navigating issues within host institutions.  Furthermore, the mentor and EL roles could be shifted to embrace an EL that fully takes advantage of the opportunities provided by the innovation since PIs are less inclined to leave their positions, and a team of highly-skilled mentors could work across the teams.  It also is critical to more deeply engage institutions in ICL, and support dialogue between teams and their hosts in order to develop a mutual understanding of what support is both needed and available.  Finally, the NSF could foster further innovation in the educational ecosystem through a program that parallels SBIR and STTR through an Education Innovation Research program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/04/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip J Weilerstein"
