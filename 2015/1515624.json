 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research to characterize the sound from fumaroles to advance the understanding of sound produced from volcanic processes. Fumaroles are vents in active volcanic environments that issue steam and other volatiles (i.e. carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, etc.) at temperatures greater than 100\u00b0C. Pressurized gas jetting out of fumaroles also produces sound waves. Fumarole acoustics and degassing can inform us about current and future volcanic activity, as changes in the acoustics and volcanic emissions can be precursors to larger volcanic eruptions. Volcanic jet noise is a direct measure of the pressure fluctuations produced during an eruption and can provide information on the eruption column itself. Jet noise is produced by sustained, momentum-driven fluid flow through a nozzle, such as that of a jet engine, while volcanic jet noise is a sustained acoustic signal produced from the volcanic jet during sustained eruptions. In the latter, the nozzle is the vent of the volcano. Acoustics of laboratory jet engine noise reveals a relationship between the jet noise and the jet?s physical characteristics (velocity, diameter, mass flux, etc.). However, this relationship is still poorly understood for volcanic jets and volcanic jet noise. The research will be conducted under the mentorship of Dr. Takahiro Ohkura and Dr. Akihiko Yokoo of the Aso Volcanological Laboratory at Kyoto University. \r\n\r\nOne of the goals of the volcano acoustics community is to quantitatively relate sound from volcanic jets back to the eruption itself, but due to the complexities of volcanic jets and field environments this goal has been elusive, thus additional data are needed. This project aims to advance our understanding of volcanic jets and eruption columns by investigating the jet noise produced by fumarolic activity, and then disseminate this information to various volcano observatories and the general scientific community. We will deploy two arrays of infrasound microphones with some collocated with seismometers, at Aso Volcano, Japan to observe and characterize fumarole acoustics and determine their seismo-acoustic signature. Forward Looking Infrared Radiometer (FLIR) cameras will also be used to observe gas emission dynamics, as gases are invisible to the human eye. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",

The acoustic signals recorded from recent, 2006 and 2008, subplinian to plinian eruptions at Tungurahua volcano, Ecuador are highly similar to those produced by the momentum-driven fluid flow through a nozzle from a human-made jet or rocket, but at lower frequencies.

Herein lies our interest in volcanic jet noise produced by momentum-driven flow of gas, ash and particles from the volcanic vent. Our goal is to relate the acoustic signal produced by volcanic jetting to the jet&rsquo;s physical parameters. One challenge in volcanic jet noise research is the equations derived from human-made jet noise studies do not hold for the volcanic case. This is due to the complexities of volcanoes such as the presence of particles (e.g. ash and larger rocks) in the flow and non-circular, ever-changing vent shape. In turn, the volcanic jet noise community seeks to derive equations relating volcanic jets to their acoustic signal. Another challenge in this pursuit is acoustic observation. First, the sound from jet flow does not radiate equally in all directions; it changes as you move in an arc from down stream to up stream of the flow. This makes it necessary to observe a volcanic jet at many different angles along that arc, but thus far our microphones are limited to ground surface deployment.
