The objectives of the workshop are to evaluate accomplishments of the past in the two countries and to move forward in identifying collaborative projects in changing environment. During the past five years there have been progress in wind hazard research in both countries, namely computational wind engineering in Japan and experimental research facilities in the U.S. This workshop is critical because researchers of the two countries can learn from the complementary research subject areas of the wind hazard.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will be held at Yokohama National University in Japan during the month of May 2016. Twelve to fifteen persons will be invited from the U.S. researchers and equal number from Japan to participate in the workshop. The proceedings of the workshop will be open to other interested individuals. The program of three days will include brief presentations, panel discussions, and one-half day visit to a site of implementation of wind engineering. Engineering and scientific practices can be improved through international exchanges of technical data/information, researchers and research equipment.",

This joint U.S.-Japan workshop on Windstorm Hazard Reduction of Critical Infrastructure was intended to provide an opportunity to a group of experts in wind engineering research and practice in the U.S. and Japan to discuss the current state of the art in windstorm hazard reduction of critical infrastructure (e.g. bridges, buildings, power lines, communication towers) and to develop strategies and collaborative efforts that will benefit both countries. This sixth workshop, co-organized by Yokohama National University, Japan and Iowa State University, USA, builds upon five previously held U.S.-Japan Workshops on wind engineering as part of the UJNR (or U.S.-Japan Cooperative Program on Natural Resources) Panel on Wind and Seismic Effects in Hawaii, U.S. in October 1997, Tsukuba, Japan in May 1999, Seattle, U.S. in October 2002, Tsukuba, Japan in July 2006 and Chicago, U.S. in July 2010. This workshop was timely because of the new developments and progress made in the past five years in both countries, notably, Japan in Computational Wind Engineering (CWE) and U.S. in establishing NSF-NHERI experimental facilities for wind engineering, and new researchers entering the wind engineering research arena in both the countries.</p>\n<p>The specific objectives of this workshop were to a) critically evaluate previous collaborative research efforts and accomplishments and strategies, (b) identify ongoing research and practice, (c) identify new challenges for reduction of high wind disasters which both countries have experienced in recent years, and develop and implement strategic planning that will benefit both the countries, (d) identify new projects for collaborative research, (e) visit one selected site in Japan that is relevant to natural hazards.

The workshop brought together academicians/engineers and scientists from two countries from 12 universities in the US and 13 universities/institutes in Japan to discuss the state of the art in a specific field of wind engineering and discuss collaborative activities that will benefit both the countries. The workshop provided an opportunity to 3 women researchers from the underrepresented minority group and 4 young researchers including a woman from the US to engage in discussions with senior researchers from both countries and experience an international event. The one-day study tour included a visit to the Honjo Bosaikan (Honjo Life Safety Learning Center) and Tokyo Sky Tree (world&rsquo;s tallest tower) in Tokyo where participants learned about life-safety measures during natural disasters such as fire, earthquake and hurricane and wind- and earthquake-resistant design of the world&rsquo;s tallest tower. The technical papers were presented orally? 17 by the U.S.-side and 10 by the Japan-side. These papers were organized into eight sessions: Bridges/Cables/Transportation Infrastructure I and II? PBD (Performance Based Design) of Structures I and II? Buildings? Experimental/ Computational Wind Engineering? Non-synoptic Wind Hazards I and II. The workshop participants were divided under four groups for discussion: Group A: Non-synoptic Wind Hazards, Group B: Wind Effects on Bridges, Cables and Transportation Infrastructure, Group C: PBD of Structures and Building Aerodynamics and Group D: Experimental and Computational Wind Engineering. These group efforts and discussions have resulted in reports that outline past accomplishment and future collaborative activities between the participants of the two countries. The results of this project are documented in the proceedings of the workshop which include 27 technical papers presented at the workshop, 4 reports from the group discussions, proposed topics for future collaborative US-Japan research activities and a summary of past activities from the five US-Japan Workshops held earlier.
