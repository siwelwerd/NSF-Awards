 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will establish  a new virtual institute for promoting and sustaining cognitive wireless networking related research and education collaborations between the U.S. and South Africa. A major emphasis is on the investigation of the fundamental challenges related to low cost, reliable wireless broadband access technologies for traditionally underserved areas using dynamic spectrum access/sharing/management techniques that exploit spectrum (e.g., T.V.) white spaces (WS). By providing an umbrella that gathers the knowledge learned from past collaboration experiences, enhances ongoing projects through cross-fertilization, and spurs new projects through virtual and physical meetings and activities, this project will enhance the capability in absorbing research knowledge from other global players on the forefront of research, and will increase the potential for the development of transformative research ideas. It will also act as a meeting place where individuals from all the stakeholders can locate possible partners, make announcements, and share ideas related to wireless research, including industry organizations, federal agencies, government laboratories and academic institutions. The focus of the institute is on dynamic spectrum access and related technologies, which is a topic of national priority to both countries, and will benefit from collaborative international science research activities.\r\n\r\nThe virtual institute will provide an environment for creative international collaboration that will leverage the synergies and resources for research and education in the two countries in order to accelerate the rate of development of research innovations and the development of talent and work-force capable of excelling in the a new highly interconnected world. The technical focus of the institute, wireless spectrum efficiency, intellectually aligns along the interests of researchers in the two countries, as well as the countries national priorities. The institute employs a number of activities including: (a) a web portal that provides services and content to participants, (b) physical and virtual PI meetings, (c) physical and virtual student investigator meetings, (d) yearly summer schools and (e) graduate student exchange.",
