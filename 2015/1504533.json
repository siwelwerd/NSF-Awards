 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will bring together results from several years of observations of the surge of the Bering-Bagley Glacier System in Alaska BBGS surge and experiments with a finite-element model in order to enhance knowledge of the dynamic within processes in a complex glacier system during a surge..  The Bering-Bagley Glacier System in Alaska is the largest surge-type glacier on Earth and the largest glacier system outside of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.  Project results will increase knowledge about the processes that occur during glacial accelerations in Alaska and in the outlet glaciers of the Greenland Ice Sheet, thereby helping to reduce uncertainty in predictions of sea-level rise.  The project will provide education and training opportunities for a graduate student and for three undergraduate students from interdisciplinary and diverse backgrounds.  The project also will result in the development of education units for direct use in Alaska and Colorado high schools and a web-based curricular unit for schools elsewhere that focuses on the Bering Glacier surges and the surge phenomenon in general.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding fast-flowing glaciers and accelerations in ice flow is critical to understanding changes in the cryosphere as well as changes in sea level.  Glacial acceleration is the main source of uncertainty in assessment of sea-level rise in the current realm of climatic warming.  Surging is the least-studies of the four types of glacial accelerations.  Because they suddenly accelerate and advance in a quasi-cyclic and unpredictable manner, surging glaciers are a counterpoint to the seemingly omnipresent retreat in the cryosphere.  The current surge of the Bering-Bagley Glacier System provides a rare opportunity to observe and analyze a surge of a large and complex glacier system.  This project will include observation, data analysis, data parameterization, and comparison of results from data analysis and model-based numerical experiments.  The investigators will analyze data collected during several years of airborne campaigns conducted by the research team together with airborne and satellite laser altimeter and image data from NASA, European Space Agency and commercial satellites and radar data of subglacial topography.  The investigators continue their efforts to bring together Earth observations, remote sensing, and numerical modeling.  They will apply an automated classification system they previously developed to identify physical parameters from images of crevasse fields.  The rapid changes in ice flow during the characteristically different phases of the surge, which often lasts several years although with regionally different slow-downs and accelerations, are manifest in complex crevasse patterns.  Derived physical parameters relate directly to deformation and other variables of ice dynamics that are hard to retrieve otherwise but necessary for physical modeling.  The image-based classification method is expected to be generally applicable in other areas of environmental and spatial sciences, remote sensing-data analysis, geography, geology, and geophysics.",

Glacial acceleration is the main source of uncertainty&nbsp; in assessment of sea-level rise in the current realm of climatic warming, as established in the 5th Assessment Report of the&nbsp; Intergovernmental Panel for Climate and Cryosphere (IPCC 2013). Surging is one of only four types of glacial accelerations and the one that has seen the least amount of research. In that they suddenly accelerate to typically 100-200 times their normal velocity and advance in a quasi-cyclic and unpredictable patter, surge-type glaciers are a counterpoint to the seemingly omnipresent retreat in the cryosphere.&nbsp; The 2011-2013 surge of the Bering-Bagley Glacier System in Alaska (BBGS), the largest surge-type glacier on Earth and the largest glacier system outside of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets, has provided a rare opportunity to observe and analyze a surge of a large and complex glacier system. <br /><br />Intellectual Merit. The project has taken an approach of (1) observation, (2) data analysis, (3) data parameterization and (4) comparison of results from data analysis and numerical experiments (``modeling\") of ice dynamics. This research brings together results from several years of observations of the BBGS surge and experiments with a finite-element model to understand processes in a complex glacier system during a surge.&nbsp; The rapid acceleration leads to heavy crevassing and this project has taken an innovative approach in utilizing the shape and distribution of crevasses of different types as the centerpiece of both data analysis (airborne and satellite observations) and 4-dimensional numerical modeling of the complex ice dynamics that changes as the surge progresses in several characteristic phases. The acceleration during a surge complicates many of the traditional glaciological methods used to investigate glacier dynamics. An automated classification system was developed, integrating concepts from spatial statistics (specific parameters for solving this and similar problems of image analysis) and machine learning (neural networks) and applied (Figure 1). The most important result is a link between observations and modeling, using crevassing as a means of investigation. Data stem from airborne campaigns conducted by the research team and airborne and satellite laser altimeter and image data from NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA)&nbsp; and commercial satellites (WorldView (Maxar, formerly DigitalGlobe), LandSat, CryoSat-2, ICESat-2 airborne predecessor data). A new model of the surge process was developed (Figure 2) and results from the model match those from observations, evaluated using crevasse characteristics (Figure 3). Essential new model capabilities are a new sliding law and insights in englacial hydrological processes, key to understanding the physical processes of acceleration. The shape of the glacier bed is found to be an important constraint. Together, these most recent findings give answers to questions that have been open in glaciology for a number of decades and only seen partial solutions so far: What makes a glacier a surge glacier? What causes and what initiates surges, and what controls their progression throughout the surge cycle (throughout the different surge phases). Since surges are the least understood form of glacial acceleration and glacial acceleration is the largest source of uncertainty (or one of two) in Sea-Level-Rise (SLR) assessment, this work advances understanding of ice dynamics and reduces uncertainty in SLR assessment. <br /><br />Broader impacts. (1) Methodologically, the project has opened the path to new connections between Earth Sciences and Cyberinfrastructure. The image-based classification method is generally applicable in other areas of environmental and spatial sciences, remote sensing-data analysis, geography, geology and geophysics. (2) The surge is a catastrophe in a physical system that causes an environmental catastrophe in the Bering Glacier foreland and, through interaction with the ocean, in the Gulf of Alaska region. The surge changes balance in the ecological system (forestry, animal habitat, Salmon cycle) and has consequences for humanity and economy (Native/ subsistence fishing and commercial fishing, the main industry in the region) and potential danger through sudden presence of icebergs in shipping lanes. This necessitates monitoring and understanding the Bering Glacier surge. Moreover, understanding rapid glacial advance in the Arctic in general is important for understanding the role of the changing cryosphere in the Arctic System, especially as climatic warming increases and tendentially leads to more cases of glacial acceleration and break-up. (3) The project has had a strong education-and-outreach component, including interdisciplinary training of graduate and undergraduate students and&nbsp; Research Experience for Undergraduates participants from diverse backgrounds in geophysics, mathematics, computer science and engineering, several of who have had the opportunity to experience a glacier surge first-hand while assisting with airborne data collection over a surge glacier (funded by related projects of the advisor). Other components are teaching units for high-school students in rural Alaska and in Colorado and a web-based unit on&nbsp; Bering Glacier surges and the surge phenomenon in general (http://ecee.colorado.edu/BeringBagley/#/).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/26/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ute&nbsp;C&nbsp;Herzfeld</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1504533/1504533_10379074_1593121206478_fig1_bering_wv_class--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1504533/1504533_10379074_1593121206478_fig1_bering_wv_class--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Result of automated connectionist-geostatistical surface classification\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1504533/1504533_10379074_1593121206478_fig1_bering_wv_class--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Result of automated connectionist-geostatistical surface classification\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Result of automated connectionist-geostatistical surface classification.(Left) WorldView Satellite image (MAXAR WorldView-1, 20110507_211732).
