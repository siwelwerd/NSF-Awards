 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a wide range of beneficial and practical applications of accelerators and particle physics including medical diagnostic instrumentation, cancer therapy, monitoring of nuclear waste proliferation, computing, and many more. Optimizing an accelerator's operational parameters is a complex problem, yet critical to achieve robust performance and to increase the number of circulating particles. Computer models will be developed in this project to investigate the possible configurations, set specifications, and estimate the system performance. Algorithms will also be created to operate the accelerator as efficiently as possible, thus increasing the discovery potential in accelerator experiments.  Student participation is an integral part of this project. The students will benefit from participating in cutting-edge research and having access to SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory and the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. They will develop scientific programming and modeling skills, learn how to create and validate simulations, conduct measurements, and be involved with operations of complex accelerator systems. All of these experiences will be a realistic introduction to graduate work, and/or work in advanced industry in one of the many areas in which accelerators play a key role.\r\n\r\nInnovative developments in a broad range of subfields of accelerator physics and technology will be required to achieve the beam specifications for the next generation accelerators. There are two major objectives in this project. First, a general model of the interaction between the next generation radio frequency (RF) system and the particle beam dynamics will be generated, which can be applied to future particle colliders and light sources. Second, this general model will be validated through application to a particular particle accelerator. The simulations of the next generation RF and low level radio frequency (LLRF) systems will be developed as block systems in the computer program Simulink. The simulation defining parameters and the initial conditions will be set in Matlab. Multi-particle simulations will also be developed in Python. The validation of models developed during this project will be done using the Large Hadron Collider crab cavity system, located at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland.   The validation process will involve conducting proof of principle simulations, investigating the LLRF-beam dynamics interaction, studying the LLRF implementation, examining detrimental effects, and developing control algorithms; thus expanding the deliverables of this project. This project will have a significant impact on advancing knowledge in accelerator physics. The knowledge and expertise developed will be directly applicable to future particle colliders and light sources.",
