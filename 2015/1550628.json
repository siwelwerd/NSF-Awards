 "awd_abstract_narration": "Knowing where animals choose to spend their time and why they may have chosen those areas is fundamental to conserving our nation's wildlife. For decades, ecologists have been studying animal movement behaviors using radio-telemetry and more recently global positioning systems (GPS). GPS technology has recently advanced such that many smaller animals can now be accurately and intensively tracked.  Additionally, the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) has begun collecting detailed environmental data at sites throughout North America. The NEON platform and new GPS technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to merge highly accurate animal movement data with equally accurate environmental data to better understand how animals interact with their environment and predict how they may do so into the future.  In this project, researchers propose to use the southeastern fox squirrel (Sciurus niger) as a model for demonstrating how linking NEON and animal movement data can transform wildlife research by allowing scientists to obtain a detailed look into how animals are influenced by, and interact with their environment. Researchers hope to use lessons learned from this project to provide guidance for broader implementation of these technologies across NEON sites, ultimately increasing the capacity of scientists to better understand how organisms interact with their environment. Additionally, the researchers plan to share information and develop educational tools (e.g., web sites showing southeastern fox squirrel movements, videos of simulated animal movement paths, classroom presentations of tools and techniques, etc.) for use in public school systems via local science education initiatives. \r\n\r\nInvestigators will affix small GPS receivers to southeastern fox squirrels to monitor fine-scaled spatiotemporal movements at NEON sites in southwestern Georgia and central Florida. Environmental data will be obtained from NEON for each of these sites.  Fox squirrel locations and movements will be modeled as functions of predictor variables obtained from NEON. These efforts will provide an example of linking highly accurate spatial data to address how animals move and interact with their environment at fine scales and across broad areas. The goals of the project are to provide:  (1) proof of concept, (2) assessment of the current NEON data collection schedule relative to animal movements, and (3) suggestions for implementation of high-resolution animal movement studies across NEON domains. Researchers will archive data associated with this project at the University of Florida where it will be available for public access and use.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe study of animal movement using tracking devices, such as radio transmitters, is relatively new but has provided much insight regarding how much area is needed by individual animals, what vegetation characteristics provide habitat for a given species, when an animal is active, and a host of other animal behaviors.  During the past two decades, technological breakthroughs ultimately benefited commercial animal tracking devices, and currently available GPS tracking systems allow researchers to collect frequent and spatially accurate animal location data. \n\nThese modern tracking systems have enhanced the study of animal movements and can provide much information about a given animal even in the absence of environmental information.  For example, researchers can determine when an animal is active, how fast it is moving, whether or not it is territorial, and can even infer more specific behaviors such as foraging or resting.   However, much more can be learned when movement data are integrated with environmental data.  Unfortunately, collection and processing of high-resolution environmental data can be daunting.  As a result, studies linking animal movement to environmental variables may be limited with regard to the availability of environmental variables.\n\nThe National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON; www.neonscienc.org), funded by the National Science Foundation, provides an ecological monitoring platform consisting of 81 sites throughout the United States. This network collects very precise and accurate environmental data.  Importantly, these data are free and available to the public.\n\nOur work combined data available via the NEON platform with animal movement data collected on southeastern fox squirrels.  Fox squirrels were used as a model species for this work because of their size; they were large enough to carry a GPS collar without undue burden and small enough to allow us to evaluate some of the smaller, commercially available tracking devices.  Further, their home ranges were such that we could evaluate small-scale habitat selection within heterogeneous landscapes. \n\nOur results suggest that increased frequency of sampling associated with GPS transmitters provides additional information above that attainable through other forms of tracking.  The increased sampling frequency and spatial accuracy of GPS locations provided superior data relative to that available using more traditional metrics, and linking these data to the environmental data provided by NEON provided an opportunity to evaluate environmental conditions experienced by the animal during the time the animal was being tracked.  We suggest that continued miniaturization of animal tracking devices and the integration of animal movement data with environmental data available using the NEON platform will increase our understanding of how animals perceive and react to their environment. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/07/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Larry M Conner"
