The workshop will provide a unique opportunity to gather scientists with a broad range of specialized expertise to reflect on both the big picture and the details at every level of searches for extrasolar planets using the Doppler Radial Velocity technique.  Succeeding in this effort will require significant improvements to spectrometer capabilities in order to detect the very small gravitational pulls of such small planets on their host stars. The workshop will document the established state of the art Doppler precision from various facilities, assess different spectrometer designs and the scientific analysis for recent results, and discuss methods for assessing the statistical significance of weak detections.",
