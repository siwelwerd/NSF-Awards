 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid advances in technology now enable simultaneous access to both telephony and Internet services from smart phone devices that people carry with them at all times. Although this convergence of telephony with the Internet offers many benefits, it also provides cyber criminals the ability to develop increasingly sophisticated attacks that combine resources from both the telephony and Internet channels. For instance, text messages containing Internet links can direct unsuspecting users to malicious websites, inexpensive or free voice services can be used to carry out phone fraud campaigns, and caller-ID spoofing and autodialing services can be used to make calls to launch large-scale attacks that are difficult to detect and trace. Such attacks often remain undetected for long periods of time, thus undermining the higher level of trust that has traditionally been associated with the telephony channel.\r\n\r\nThis project explores a ground-truth driven approach to study and understand cross-channel attacks that make use of both the Internet and telephony channels. A key goal is to expose any overlap in tactics and infrastructure used in cross-channel attacks with the extensively observed and studied Internet-only threats. Several data sources of cross-channel abuse are used in this study, including crowd-sourced intelligence and telephone-honeypot data. Much of the currently available telephony abuse information is unstructured and its accuracy or completeness is not known. The researchers are mining multiple sources of abuse information and introduce new methods to better understand, detect, and track attacks that are carried out across the telephony and Internet channels. The effectiveness of correlating threat intelligence available from each of these channels to improve defenses for both is also investigated. By studying the properties of the malicious infrastructure that facilitates cross-channel attacks, this project will enable both researchers and operational communities to gain increased situational awareness and develop techniques for mitigating and defending against this new class of threats.",

For example, threats like spam robocalls and voice phishing have degraded trust in telephony to such a degree that people no longer pick up their phone when it rings. At the same time, online crime is leveraging the phone channel in scams like fake technical support, which have cost US citizens millions of dollars. This project explored a data-driven research approach to better understand cross-channel threats that span both telephony and the Internet.

It demonstrated that combined intelligence from both the phone and online channels can be used together to identify malicious online infrastructure that supports abuse in each channel. For example, by analyzing over 8 million SMS spam messages, it was found that online infrastructure utilized by such spam messages rarely appears on traditional domain and IP backlists but can be identified with cross-channel threat intelligence. This can allow better defenses against scams that are carried out with SMS messages. Other work demonstrated how online abuse techniques such as search engine optimization and malicious advertisements are exploited to get unsuspecting users to call phone numbers controlled by malicious actors. Again, by leveraging the information available on both channels, such threats can be mitigated by developing more effective blacklists.\n\nRobocalls, which can be made at scale with very low cost, are a serious problem for everyone, with billions of such calls made each month. First, this research studied how to automatically enrich caller ID blacklists by using large telephone provider datasets, phone honeypot data, crowdsourced online abuse complaints, and by developing a privacy-preserving way to collect spam phone call records in a crowd-sourced way from participating smartphones. However, while these approaches can help to mitigate some phone spam campaigns, phone number blacklists are fundamentally limited in their efficacy by the increasingly widespread use of caller ID spoofing. To address this evolving threat, the project explored a novel approach where an automated phone assistant interacts with a caller like a human assistant. This agent leverages advances in artificial intelligence by using a number of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to distinguish robocalls from real humans.
