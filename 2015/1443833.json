 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n\r\n\r\nThis award supports the Board on International Scientific Organizations (BISO) of the National Academies of Science (NAS), which functions as the U.S. National Committee to the International Council for Science (ICSU) and serves as the focal point for ICSU-related activities in the United States. It manages U.S. membership in ICSU and has oversight of many of the national committees that serve as liaisons to unions, committees and programs federated under the ICSU umbrella. BISO's primary goal is to support effective U.S. participation and strong leadership in the ICSU network in response to growing needs in international science and technology. \r\n\r\nICSU, a non-governmental organization, plans and coordinates interdisciplinary research to address major issues in science and society; advocates for freedom in the conduct of science; promotes equitable access to scientific data and information; and facilitates science education and capacity building.  \r\n\r\nThis award also provides dues payment to the Pacific Science Association (PSA).  PSA is an interdisciplinary regional organization within ICSU whose goal is to advance science and technology in support of sustainable development in the Pacific region.  Based in Honolulu, Hawaii, PSA has a long history of linking scientists in the U.S. with their counterparts on the Pacific?s rim and islands.\r\n\r\nThis two-year award will enable BISO to continue to manage U.S. participation in ICSU. The award provides costs associated with the support and management of the U.S. National Committee to ICSU and organizational activities of adhering U.S. committees representing the diverse disciplines that participate in ICSU activities.",

Two of the major goals of this project were to coordinate U.S. involvement in ICSU and the Pacific Science Association, and to provide visa assistance to the U.S. and international scientific community through the International Visitors Office.\n\nSCIENTIFIC MERIT\n\nICSU is a non-governmental organization created to advance, serve, and enable science throughout the world.  With both national members and scientific union members, ICSU addresses important international issues related to science.  PSA is an affiliate of ICSU and a regional non-governmental, scholarly organization that advances interdisciplinary science, technology, and sustainable development in the Pacific region.  Membership in both these organizations involves paying annual dues; actively participating in governance activities and organization initiatives; and promoting an engaged U.S. community.  Specific actions related to membership in ICSU and PSA are as follows: \n\nIn 2015, the BISO Board was restructured.
