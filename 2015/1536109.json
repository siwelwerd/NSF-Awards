 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is funding to support a doctoral consortium (workshop) of approximately 12 promising graduate students from U.S. institutions of higher learning along with distinguished research faculty mentors, to be held in conjunction with the Eighth International Conference on Pervasive Technologies Related to Assistive Environments (PETRA 2015), which will take place July 1-3 on the island of Corfu, Greece.  The PETRA mission is to promote interdisciplinary research on ways to use pervasive ambient intelligent environments to improve the quality of life and enhance human performance with greater capabilities; it is the only annual conference that brings together theoreticians and practitioners from a wide variety of disciplines to focus on the application of pervasive technologies to assistive environments. Outcomes of this conference have a broad impact in diverse application areas such as manufacturing, transportation, energy systems, security and safety, robotics, healthcare, biomedicine, environment and conservation.  PETRA brings together very different types of technologies to also address important social and healthcare issues for sensitive populations, such as the elderly, persons suffering from chronic conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Cerebral Palsy, and other disabilities or traumas.  The PETRA proceedings are published by the ACM digital library, and the authors of the best papers are invited to submit to special journal issues after the end of the conference.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://www.petrae.org.  The PETRA 2015 Doctoral Consortium will bring together some of the best students, researchers and practitioners in relevant fields, and will thereby afford the younger participants a unique opportunity to gain wider exposure for their innovative ideas while also receiving reinforcement for the importance and value of conducting research with societal impact.  The workshop will allow the junior participants to create a social network both among themselves and with senior colleagues.  The organizing committee will make a concerted effort to attract participants who are women, members of under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities; to further assure diversity, NSF funds will be used to support no more than 2 student participants from any one institution, and if 2 students are supported, one of them must be a minority or person with disability.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the day-long Doctoral Consortium are to increase the exposure and visibility of the participants' work within the community, to help establish a sense of community among this next generation of researchers, and to help foster their research efforts by providing substantive feedback and guidance in a supportive and interactive environment from a group of senior researchers.  Student participants will be drawn from diverse communities including computer science, engineering, psychology, social science, neuroscience, human-computer interaction, cognitive science and communication.  They will make formal 20-minute presentations of their work and will receive feedback from a faculty panel; the feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  The workshop faculty members will bring a wide spectrum of expertise, and provide student mentoring and coordination.  Doctoral Consortium attendees will be asked to create and maintain a \"digital workbook\" where along with their work they include feedback on papers they attended and observations that they gathered (e.g., through meetings and discussions with conference speakers and other participants) that will apply to and impact their work.  Short papers on the participants' work will be published in the conference proceedings, and a summary report on the event will be posted on the conference website.",
