 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Hugh R Sharp, a 146 foot Regional research vessel operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. \r\n\r\nThe R/V Hugh R Sharp is a state-of-the-art, coastal research vessel that is owned and operated by the University of Delaware. The vessel can carry fourteen to twenty scientists on cruises up to eighteen days in duration, and supports projects from all disciplines of oceanography. The vessel is a regional asset, serving researchers from many institutions throughout the mid-Atlantic. The vessel typically operates in the coastal waters from Long Island, New York, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as well as the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. Projects occasionally require the vessel to work as far north as the Gulf of Maine, as far south as Florida, and as far offshore as Bermuda. In 2014, the R/V Hugh R Sharp completed 193 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 25% of the total sailing schedule (49 days). In 2015, R/V Hugh R Sharp is scheduled for 200 days with NSF days accounting for 17% (34 days) of the total sailing schedule.\r\n\r\nOceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\tNetwork Time Clock\t$8,736\t\r\n\tUPS Replacement\t$10,240\t\r\n\tKongsberg HiPAP Tracking System\t$341,924\t\r\n\tRed Box High Capacity Data Storage\t$17,781\t\r\n\t$378,681\t\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",
