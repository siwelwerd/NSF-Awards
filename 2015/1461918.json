 "awd_abstract_narration": "This INSPIRE (Integrated NSF Support Promoting Interdisciplinary Research and Education) project is jointly funded by the Division of Astronomical Sciences in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences, by the Geospace Section of the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences in the Directorate for Geosciences, by the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences, and by the Office of International and Integrative Activities.  Currently, more than 1800 confirmed planetary systems beyond our solar system (i.e. extrasolar planets or exoplanets) have been discovered through ground and space-based astronomical techniques, with an additional 3600 candidate systems yet to be confirmed.  These recent discoveries have resulted in dramatic growth in research related to the study of exoplanets with the ultimate objective being the discovery and characterization of habitable Earth-sized systems.  The primary goal of this project is to improve our understanding of the interactions between stars and their planets, in particular the role of magnetic fields, to ultimately provide information on the habitability of exoplanet systems.  The project's objectives are particularly well-matched to the interdisciplinary goals of the INSPIRE program.  First, the project will attack a problem of significance to a broad scientific community, namely the characterization and identification of habitable exoplanets.  Second, this research will provide an improved understanding of the Sun's interaction with the planets of our solar system.  Furthermore, this project has potential for significant societal impact with regards to the search for life elsewhere in the Universe.\r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary project will apply techniques and methods drawn from the space physics community to the traditionally astrophysical research area of exoplanets. The project team has significant expertise in computational modeling of the magnetospheres of rocky planets like the Earth and gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn.  They will combine their magnetospheric code with available magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) models of the heliosphere in order to model interactions of the solar wind with planetary magnetospheres.  A key aspect of the project is to apply these combined models to a much broader class of star-planet interactions by scaling the models to simulate a wide range of stellar parameters.  Once the star-planet interactions are modeled, then given varying levels of stellar activity and planetary magnetospheric characteristics, the models will be used predict radio emission for a wide range of systems.   These predictions can then be used to target specific systems for further observation and characterization as to their potential habitability.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nINSPIRE: Modeling the Interactions between Stars and Planets\n\nNew planets are now being discovered routinely around other stars with some recently detected planets close to Earth-sized and lying in the assumed habitable zones of their parent stars. Habitability is not viable around a magnetically active star without the protection of a substantial planetary magnetic field.  Understanding the possible habitability of such planets, therefore, requires a deeper knowledge of how the stars and planets interact and, in particular, what role magnetic fields play in this interaction.  In this work, we preformed a targeted approach to exploring star-planet magnetic interactions utilizing our knowledge of the Sun\u2019s interactions with the Earth as a calibration point.  \n\nThe major results of this work have shown that applying our deep understanding of how the Sun and Earth interact magnetically is crucial to assessing a planet's potential for habitability.  Current planetary detections have a observational bias towards M dwarf stars, starts significantly smaller and cooler that our Sun.  As a result, any planets in the star's habitable zone, the region where the temperatures are such that liquid water is possible on the planetary surface, orbit sufficiently close that the stellar activity is critical in determining the conditions on the planet.  Our results hvae shown that most of the habitable zone planets detected lie within a magnetically defined zone, known as the Alfven surface.  Planets lying within this region will be magnetically connected to the star and such such inhospitable to life.\n\nAnother key factor in understanding how the planet responds to the energetic input from the star is the strength of any planetary magnetic field.  Our simulations have shown that the complex dynamics of the electrical current systems in the planetary ionosphere can provide a strong component to the star-side magnetic field providing additional pressure to support the magnetosphere against the stellar wind.  Additionally, we have been able to simulate the expected radio emission from the interaction of the solar wind with the planetary magnetosphere suggesting that major magnetic stroms on some exoplanets may be strong enough to have a detectable radio signal.\n\nFuture work will explore under what conditions a detactable radio signal might occur to help inform observations which will be important in our atttempts to characterize the magnetic field of the exoplanet.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Alexander"
