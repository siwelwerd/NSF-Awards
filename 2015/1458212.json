 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an established need in the United States to increase significantly the number of American scientists with interdisciplinary training.  This NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Lee University in Tennessee (TN) will support 35 scholars as they complete undergraduate degrees in mathematics, biology, chemistry, or biochemistry.  Students will participate in an enhanced curriculum designed to immerse them in a cohesive STEM community.  Through a sophomore and junior year seminar course, students will be provided with an abundance of resources including intensive faculty mentoring, formalized peer-to-peer interactions, career services, and service learning opportunities.  An Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis course will expose scholars to interdisciplinary research before their senior year.\r\n\r\nThe institution has identified \"uncertainty about career paths\" as a barrier to retention in STEM.  This project addresses this issue by establishing a range of career-related experiences (interdisciplinary group projects with real-world applications, undergraduate research collaborations with the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Labs, and an early course on experimental methods) and enhanced career services with internship and job shadowing opportunities.  As a capstone experience, mathematics and science majors will be partnered for collaborative projects designed to lead science majors to a deeper understanding mathematical application and validation and to introduce mathematics majors to scientific experimentation and data analysis.  Evaluation efforts will address the quality, effectiveness, and impact of the project on key stakeholders.  Formative evaluation will focus on student and mentor satisfaction with academic and social supports (surveys and focus groups) and academic progress.  Summative evaluation will consist of an analysis of lessons learned from all aspects of the project.  Dissemination to regional stake holders will occur through meetings of the Southeast TN STEM Innovation Hub (K-12) and the Cleveland Associated Industries.  Project results will be presented at disciplinary meetings (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics and American Chemical Society among others) and the Appalachian College Association (ACA) Annual Summit.  This active dissemination effort is expected to add to the knowledge base about design and implementation of successful recruitment and retention strategies for STEM majors.",

According to our student surveys, this has significantly improved our mentoring interactions and has now produced a culture of mentoring.  In addition, there was an increase in summer research and internships in cohort 3 compared with cohort 2.  We believe that this is due to their exposure to the seminar speakers and sessions on REUs that raise the awareness of the students to research opportunities.  Therefore, we feel that the iMASS program has begun to be recognized by our students as an enriching opportunity and this has helped with the success of this program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sherry Kasper"
