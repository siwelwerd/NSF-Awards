 "awd_abstract_narration": "The majority of our knowledge of the astronomical world is derived from the emission, absorption,\r\nand scattering of electromagnetic radiation from atoms and molecules. The astronomical observations\r\nof atomic and molecular spectra including transition energies, intensities, and light polarization\r\ncomplemented with laboratory experiments and theoretical calculations are essential in the study of\r\nstellar atmospheres. The goal of this CNIC proposal is to catalyze an international interdisciplinary\r\ncollaboration between the group of Prof. Ludwik Adamowicz, at the Department of Chemistry\r\nand Biochemistry, the University of Arizona (USA) and Prof. Jow-Tsong Shy, at the Department\r\nof Physics, the National Tsing Hua University (Taiwan) on performing very accurate experimental\r\nand theoretical studies of the rovibrational (rovib) spectra of small hydrogen-containing molecules\r\nand clusters. These systems constitute a significant portion of the mass of the universe and are\r\nkey to the interstellar chemistry. The goal of this collaborative is to characterize and assign the\r\nrovibrational spectra of the studied molecular systems. The obtained data can be very helpful in\r\nidentifying spectral lines recorded by telescopes and assigning these lines to particular molecules and\r\nclusters. As a result, knowledge will be gained about the compositions of various domains in the\r\nuniverse and about chemistry occurring there.\r\n\r\nThis collaboration brings together groups with very different research profiles. The Taiwan\r\ngroup has been concerned with high-precision experimental spectroscopy studies of small neutral and\r\ncharged molecular systems. The theoretical-chemistry Arizona group has been involved in development\r\nand application of very accurate quantum-mechanical methods for calculating spectra of small atoms\r\nand molecules. Both groups are accomplished in their respective fields. In this project, the theory\r\nand the experiment will be combined in elucidation of the spectra of molecules and clusters involving\r\nhydrogen and its isotopes. The studies are very fundamental in nature and as such they are well\r\nsuited for NSF funding.",
