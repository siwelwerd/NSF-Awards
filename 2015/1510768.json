Many kinds of cells are capable of generating their own propulsion in liquids. In their natural habitats and in engineered systems, swimming cells have to navigate through complex microstructures in response to various chemical signals from food sources and other organisms. The investigators will use a combination of theory, numerical simulation, and experiments to examine the relative importance of fluid flows, boundary structures and chemical stimuli on the locomotion of individual cells and collections of cells. The results will be applicable to ecological processes and diverse technologies, including bioreactors, bioremediation, and preservation of clean water.  Local high-school students will be recruited to participate in the project.\r\n\r\nSwimming cells and synthetic self-propelled particles comprise an emerging class of active suspensions, whose transport properties can differ significantly from those of passive scalars and particulate flows.  The effects of suspension microstructure and flow on cell transport in porous media will be investigated for dilute and dense suspensions of various cells that span canonical swimming styles and body shapes.  Microfluidic devices will be designed to create well-controlled environments that simulate natural flow conditions and chemical gradients in a porous medium.  High-speed video microscopy of microbial suspensions will provide a statistical characterization of large cell ensembles as well as a mechanistic cell-scale view of the flagellar and hydrodynamic interactions mediating large-scale behaviors. The effects of porous media structure on the transport coefficients of chemotaxing cells in chemical gradients will also be examined. Continuum and particle-based models will be implemented numerically and results will be systematically validated against experiments to establish a quantitative, predictive framework for active cell transport in porous media flows.",

Swimming cells, including bacteria, sperm, and plankton, play essential roles in process ranging from biogeochemical cycles and the food web&nbsp; in the marine sediment and soil to engineering applications in enhanced oil recovery and bioreactors. Pathogenic bacteria spread disease through groundwater flows, and flow near confined surfaces can guide sperm motility for reproduction.

Theory and numerical simulations confirm that the observed cell density patterns are a results of the alignment of the elongated bacterial body shape to the fluid flow. In particular, regions of the flow that experience strong stretching incur high cell accumulation. In addition to driving the formation filamentous cell concentration patterns, the flow also strongly enhances the dispersal properties of the cells in direction of the flow. The coupling between fluid flow, cell shape, and self propulsion illustrates a stark difference between the well-established transport of passive particles versus actively swimming cells. These results may also be extended to unsteady turbulent flows, such as those found in the ocean, where predicting cell transport is both challenging and important to large-scale bio-oceanography modeling. The observed filamentous cell distributions may inform our understanding of microbial function in the human microbiome and in biofilm formation. Harnessing the novel properties of these microbial flows could also inspire new applications in water filtration and bioremediation.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Guided by the experiments, we developed a generic mathematical framework that allows us to predict the flows of bacterial and other microbial suspensions through complex porous structures.

Furthermore, we showed that a slightly modified version of this theory can replicate key aspects of the synchronization phenomena observed in recent experiments that studied the flows in complex slime-mold flow networks.
