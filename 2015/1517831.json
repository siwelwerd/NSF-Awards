 "awd_abstract_narration": "Precisely how galaxies initially form and how they change throughout their lifetimes are among the least understood problems in astrophysics, and understanding the formation and life cycle of galaxies is key to developing the broadest astronomical perspective on how the Universe evolved to its present state.  Many projects are centered on unraveling these mysteries.  This project is focused on understanding the circumgalactic medium (CGM) to uncover its role in the life cycle of galaxies.\r\n\r\nPI Churchill will expand his previous Broader Impact program based upon his course \"Into the Final Frontier.\"  This course links students to Space Port America and the growing aerospace and tourism industry rapidly growing in Las Cruces, New Mexico.  Special emphasis is placed on forging STEM related opportunities for minority students, which comprise 45% of New Mexico State's student population.  Two graduate students will be supported in New Mexico.  PI Charlton plans to transform her successful science fiction, interactive, web astronomy course into a video game to teach K--12 students, while achieving STEM astronomy standards for the state of Pennsylvania. This project will support two pre-selected skilled and talented students to construct the game and integrate it into local schools.  One graduate student will be supported in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe CGM is understood through observations and analysis of absorption lines in the spectra of quasars.  However, being blind to the actual properties of the absorbing gas, present day analysis methods are uncalibrated.  That is, our cumulative knowledge of the CGM and its role in galaxy evolution is based upon a host of implicit and explicit assumptions that remain untested or quantified.  Using the Eulerian hydrodynamic N-body cosmological simulation code hydroART, the team will use the quasar absorption line technique, coupled with direct analysis of the simulations, to study highly-detailed simulated galaxies with various star formation and feedback physical models. The galaxies will range in viral halo mass from 10.5 < log(M/Msun) < 12.5 and in redshift from z ~ 0-3.  The team aims to address these questions: (1) What is the relationship between the gas phase structures in and surrounding galaxies and the physical model for star formation and stellar feedback?  (2) How well do models that yield galaxies matching global galaxy properties also match the observed properties of the gaseous reservoirs?  (3) How does the CGM regulate the baryon cycle and galaxy evolution?  (4) Do current analysis methods of absorption lines yield inferred gas properties (metallicities, spatial-kinematics distributions, gas phases, and gas reservoir masses) that are consistent with the gas being probed in the simulations?  (5) What are the quantitative relationships between inferred gas properties from observational analysis and the gas actually giving rise to the absorption?  (6) What are the implications and how do they change our understanding of the baryon cycle and galaxy evolution?",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGalaxy evolution can be studied by observing the absorption lines produced in the spectra of background quasars by gas clouds along the line of sight through galaxies and their surrounding circumgalactic medium.  It is important to study the absorption in may different chemical elements, including metals and hydrogen lines, in order to derive the physical condtions (densities, temperatures, metal content) of the gas.  This requires spectra that cover a large wavelength range, both from large ground-based telescopes such as the Very Large Telescope and the Keck Telescope and from the ultraviolet coverage afforded by the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nThis study dissected the absorption lines seen at different positions/velocities along lines of sight through various galaxies.  It was determined that the properties of the gas can vary quite a lot as one passes through the galaxy. For example, some clouds of gas in the same galaxy environment may have metal content as high as that of our Sun, while others might have metal content less than 1% as high as that of our Sun.  This indicates that different processes are at work at different locations through the galaxy.\n\nFor practical reasons large studies that compare the gas properties to the star formation rate, orientation and location of the host galaxy often average together properties along the sightline.  For example, this work compared the metal content of gas to whether the gas was located along the minor or major axis of a galaxy.  It would have been expected that the minor axis would have high metallicity gas due to origin in outflows driven by star formation activity.  Similarly, gas along the major axis might have low metallicity because it is pristine gas flowing into the galaxy along filaments.  However, no such trends between metallicity of the gas and orientation of the galaxy were found.  This is because the properties of the gas were averaged together along the whole sightline while the gas along the sightline has complex origins.\n\nMethods were developed to more feasibly derive detailed properties of the multiple phases of gas seen in absorption through a typical galaxy, so that global studies can take this into account.\n\nA graduate student was supported through this project for most of his Ph.D. research.  The project also supported an undergraduate student who is now a graduate student.\n\nThe broader impact of this work is primarily the development and improvement of a basic astronomy video game, which has a special focus on intuitive communication of spectroscopy to non-science students, and also has modules on the history of the universe and galaxy evolution.  This game is used by thousands of students in the PI's course, but is also now going to be marketed to larger audiences through a company formed by the PI and colleagues.  The company, AstroVenture, will also develop additional educational astronomy software to be used to educate the public and to teach K-12 students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jane C Charlton"
