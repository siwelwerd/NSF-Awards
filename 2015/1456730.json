 "awd_abstract_narration": "Social interactions, social networks, and individual behavior are highly likely to influence infectious disease spread in humans and other social organisms, but the extent to which disease transmission is affected by these factors remains poorly known. This project capitalizes on a readily manipulated host-parasite interaction to elucidate these effects and therefore has significant societal benefits. The recent outbreak of Ebola and the continued emergence of new infectious diseases underscore the importance of understanding how disease transmission is affected by behavior and social networks.  Established contacts with diverse agencies and non-governmental organizations will allow the investigators to share their results to inform the fields of both human and wildlife health. A series of national and international workshops will allow the investigators to disseminate their novel experimental and modeling methods. A code-free, graphical simulation platform is under development that will allow students at all levels to investigate how individual behavior, movement, interspecific interactions, and resource availability affect disease spread. This platform will be taught to individuals with no computer coding experience through workshops, and simpler versions of this platform will be developed for use in secondary school classes. Postdoctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students will be trained in rigorous field and modeling research, with clear plans to recruit students from under-served groups. The research leverages a strong international collaboration between US and Australian researchers, and is jointly supported by NSF's International Science and Engineering Office.\r\n\r\nThe project takes advantage of a well-studied lizard-tick system to examine how spatial and temporal variation in the ecological and social environments interact with individual differences in host behavioral type to influence individual host movements, host social networks and parasite transmission. While these conceptual links are individually simplistic, each link and their interactions present complexities that require new experimental and modeling approaches. Field research will use habitat surveys to quantify the location of lizard resources and refuges and will track all lizards in a study site to document their movements, space-use, social interactions, and their behavioral tendencies. Sampling will also quantify the number of ticks carried by each lizard. These studies will be complemented by a unique experiment that adds genetically distinct ticks to free-ranging lizards. The experiment will quantify individual differences among lizard hosts in parasite resistance, the relative ability of individuals with different behavioral tendencies to serve as conduits for spreading experimentally-released parasites, and the extent to which increased parasite loads alter host behavior, movement patterns and social interactions.  Empirical results will be integrated in  Bayesian statistical models and individual-based simulation models to test the role of behavioral mechanisms in explaining parasite loads and transmission.  The models will then be used to examine how environmental changes such as shifts in land use regimes or climate alterations will influence host-parasite dynamics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPI: Andrew Sih\n\nUnderstanding mechanisms that explain patterns of parasite (including disease) spread and why some host individuals end up with more parasites than others is a major topic of interest that is more compelling than ever during the current global pandemic.  Our project developed a general framework for explaining variation in parasite spread and then tested this framework with data and experiments on a population of free-moving lizards in the wild.  For parasites that are transmitted by social contact (including diseases like covid 19), understanding the social network is a key way to understand patterns of parasite spread for individuals and for the population.  Individuals that have more social contacts with a larger number of other individuals are more likely to both pick up parasites and to transmit them to others.  Super-well connected individuals can be particularly important as ?super-spreaders?.  Why do some have more social contacts than others?  For ecologists, this variation can be explained by the individuals? ?movement ecology? ? how much do they move around?  Where do they go?  Do they tend to go to the same places as others (e.g., places with more food or good hiding places)?  Are they attracted to others or do they tend to avoid others (are they more versus less sociable)?  And at yet a deeper level, how do the individuals? ?behavioral type? (e.g., boldness, aggressiveness, sociability) explain their movement patterns that underlie the social network connections that explain parasite transmission? \n\nWhile this framework plausibly applies to humans, in order to be able to do experiments (described later), we chose to work on the sleepy lizard in South Australia?  Why those animals?  Because they have an ideal blend of characteristics that make it possible to get the necessary data relatively easily.  They are abundant (about 50 or more per square kilometer), and large enough (about 800 grams) to carry GPS units that allow us to track their locations continuously.  They move around enough to be interesting, but are slow enough to be easily captured.  They have home range locations that are stable even over multiple years.  The location of their favorite foods and preferred hiding spots can be easily mapped.  And, they have parasites ? ticks and gut microbes.  For this study, we focused on their ticks. \n\nWe GPS tracked all 70 adult lizards at our field site each year during their entire active season, and recaptured each every 2 weeks to assess their tick loads.  We also assayed each individual?s boldness and aggressiveness 3 times per year.  The GPS tracking generated millions of location data points.  Analyses revealed that individuals exhibited consistent ?behavioral types? where some were consistently more (versus less) aggressive or more (versus less) bold, and these behavioral tendencies were consistent over several years.  Also, some individuals consistently had larger home ranges, while others had small home ranges (year after year), and some showed a consistent tendency to stay in the same location, while others consistently shifted their home range centers to new places (but still within our study site) from year to year.  Bolder lizards tended to cover larger areas, but more interestingly, unaggressive animals showed a stronger tendency to be attracted to places with more food and better refuge where they would likely encounter other unaggressive lizards.  Aggressive lizards were more indiscriminate about where there was more food or better cover. These trends explained a significant amount of the variation in social network connectivity ? in particular, how often these lizards appeared to sleep overnight near another lizard.  Animals that shared overnight refuge more often with others tended to have more ticks. \n\nIn one year, we added food trays in some locations to see which lizards would quickly find the new food sources and shift their space use, and perhaps social networks.  In two other years, we added genetically distinct lines of ticks to 30 of the lizards to examine how those lizards? behavioral type and social network influenced the spread of those ticks.  Analyses are ongoing for those two experiments.\n\nThis grant also allowed us to garner a small, accompanying NSF grant for studying parallel issues about behavior, social networks and parasites (fleas) in ground squirrels at a site in the hills near Walnut Creek, California that is frequently visited by humans. \n\nOverall, this project included collaboration with several Australian scientists, with Professor Jenn Smith at Mills College (for the squirrel project) and trained 8 PhD students and postdoctoral associates along with numerous undergraduates.
