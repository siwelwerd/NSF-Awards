The project, GBTrans, will utilize existing infrastructure and development. Broader impacts of the work include research training of one graduate student and two undergrads, and outreach to high-school students and their teachers to enhance the research experience as part of the NSF-funded \"Pulsar Search Collaboratory\" which is run by researchers at NRAO and WVU.\r\n\r\nGBTrans will also perform extensive searches for giant pulses from known radio pulsars, and will provide constraints on the statistics of the brightest such pulses. An important capability of the instrument is its full-polarization recording, which will identify the polarization properties of FRBs and perhaps even their rotation measures.",

The project, named GBTrans, is a collaboration between researchers at West Virginia University (WVU, lead institution), Virginia Tech (VT) and NRAO (now, GBO).  GBTrans leveraged a recently-commisioned internally-funded real-time dispersed pulse detection back end for the 20-m instrument, developed by VT.  The system has been operational essentially full-time since January 2016, resulting in about 9 months of nearly continuous searching for FRBs to date.  During this time we have detected roughly 10 candidates per day, but with no compelling detections from the approximately 50% of candidates scrutinized so far.  This implies a somewhat lower rate than the expected 0.5/month, however the sensitivity of the 20-m instrument has varied considerably over the project duration and a final determination of implied rates is pending an ongoing analysis of this variability.  During the same period we conducted about 350 hours of targeted observations of the GPs of pulsars B0531+21 and B1937+21, resulting in 10s of thousands of confirmed detections.  Analysis of these detections is ongoing, and the results are certain to be interesting since this set of detections is probing the previously-unexplored bright tail of the pulse amplitude distribution, and also because our data are fully polarimetric.  The system continues to observe and data analysis continues under the still-active grant of the PI institution (WVU).   VT continues to provide both operational and technical support, including participation in proposals to co-observe with instruments in other wavebands, including SWIFT. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven W Ellingson"
