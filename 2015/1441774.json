 "awd_abstract_narration": "Changes in the upper atmosphere and in its ionized part (ionosphere) can be detrimental to human activities. They can affect satellite drag, which in turn affects satellite lifetimes. Short term changes can lead the formation of storm-enhanced densities, rising atmospheric bubbles, solar flare-induced ionization enhancements, and propagating atmospheric holes and plasma patches. These upper atmospheric disturbances have adverse effects on GPS navigation systems, power grids, over-the-horizon radar systems, and High Frequency (HF) communications used by the military, emergency responders, and airlines. This research is focused on elucidating the physics that governs these processes, leading to improved specification and forecast models, and better mitigation strategies for adverse upper atmosphere weather disturbances. Space 'climate' studies will involve the use of long-duration radar and satellite datasets and model studies to determine the reasons for long-term upper atmosphere changes. \r\nThe primary goals of this research are to study the effects that various plasma and neutral gas transport processes have on the ionosphere-thermosphere system, and to study coupling mechanisms that are relevant to the near-Earth space environment. The research involves an extensive use of data from NSF-funded and other ground-based facilities and satellites, including data from Incoherent Scatter Radars [Arecibo, Millstone Hill, Poker Flat (PFISR), Resolute Bay (RISR) and EISCAT], SuperDARN radars, ionosondes, and satellites (DMSP, ACE and SDO). The research will be conducted with the aid of high-resolution, global-scale, physics-based models of the ionosphere, thermosphere, and electrodynamics. The project will focus on long-term ionospheric changes and observation and modeling of the space-atmosphere interaction region.",

A better understanding of the creation and evolution of these features will lead to improved specifications and forecasts of upper atmosphere-ionosphere weather.

We generated a new high-resolution dataset of ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements. The data files for the TEC mapping were downloaded from the Madrigal web server at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the years 2009 to 2018. To optimize the usefulness of the data in the context of our project to study ionospheric density patches in the polar region, it was necessary to re-cast the raw data into a form that consists of TEC maps in a rectangular grid in magnetic coordinates of 105 x 105 elements, covering the high-latitude ionosphere. The 105 x 105 grids are at a time cadence of 5 minutes. The number of files per year is 105,120. The entire dataset, consisting of more than one million data files has been stored on the publicly accessible Digital Commons server at Utah State University (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.26078/a7g8-5m30)\">https://doi.org/10.26078/a7g8-5m30)</a> for use by the scientific community.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;2. We found that some long-held beliefs about ionospheric plasma patches and Tongues of Ionization (TOI; Figure) are not supported by our new database of ionospheric TEC maps (Item 1). Before our work all studies involving patches and TOI were based on data covering a limited area, such as radar observations from fixed locations. In contrast, we were able to look at the issue with continuous data coverage of the entire polar region over a period of years, via the ionospheric TEC maps (Item 1).&nbsp; This has put us in a position to correct certain views on the subject that have long been considered to be common knowledge, but which are in fact wrong.

Numerous studies have been conducted of polar cap plasma patches in the northern hemisphere, but in contrast, a relatively small number of studies have been devoted to plasma patches in the southern hemisphere. We believe that satellite-based patch searchers have led some researchers to draw conclusions that are incorrect. In particular, we found that the southern hemisphere plasma patch occurrence is very similar to that of the northern hemisphere with a half-year offset, plus an offset in universal time of approximately 12 hours. This was further supported by running our physics-based ionospheric model for both hemispheres and applying the same patch-to-background technique.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;4. Our study of the variability of the auroral oval as seen in the ionospheric TEC maps indicates that the source of this variability is most likely variations in the neutral wind in the upper atmosphere.

Specifically, measurements of ion and electron precipitation, plasma velocity and density, as well as derived field-aligned currents from satellite polar passes were examined.
