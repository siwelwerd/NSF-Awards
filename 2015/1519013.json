The meeting in the first year of the award will be held on September 25-26, 2015, on the campus of Kansas State University, with the conference moving to the University of Kansas in Fall 2016 and returning to Kansas State in Fall 2017.\r\n\r\nThe Fall 2015 event will be the thirteenth edition of the Prairie Analysis Seminar, an annual regional conference serving the Midwest that has over the years showcased a wide range of topics in analysis. The featured speakers at the 2015 meeting will be David Kinderlehrer and Rob McCann. The format for the conference provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work",
