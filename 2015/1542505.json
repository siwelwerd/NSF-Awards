 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe aim of this proposal is to design and study novel materials from sugar-derived natural resources that would have special molecular architectures and properties.  Such properties would include tunable, temperature-responsive behavior in water solutions.  The materials will consist of different types of polymers linked together (\"block copolymers\") whose two components can have different molecular architectures, molecular lengths, chemical structures, etc.  The effects of all these parameters will be investigated on the self-assembly of these molecules and on the structure-property relationships of the resulting materials.  The major outcomes of this research effort may lead to new paradigms for polymer design, synthesis, and self-assembly through the use of highly abundant natural resources.   Additionally, the project includes a major focus on educational and outreach activities. The team of investigators will collaborate with the Institute for School Partnership of Washington University to develop outreach and education activities for underrepresented and underprivileged students in the St. Louis community.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY:\r\n\r\nThe long-term research goal of this project is to enable technologies for the design and synthesis of high-performance and renewable polymeric materials that exploit various sugars produced by lignocellulosic cell-wall carbohydrate depolymerization. Sugars obtained from lignocellulose represent an abundant and renewable feedstock that potentially could reduce reliance on petroleum-based resources. To this end, the PIs will design and synthesize renewable sugar-derived block copolymers (BCP) that exhibit tunable temperature-responsive behavior in aqueous solution.  Specific aims will involve developing tailorable BCPs from designer, sugar-derived, and stereo-specific monomers through controlled polymerization; then examining the self-assembly and structure-property relationships associated with the design of solution-assembled amphiphilic BCPs for tunable and temperature-responsive solution applications.  Design parameters to be explored include: pendant topological structure (i.e., linear vs. branched sugar derivative); pendant chemical structure (i.e., hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity); block volume fractions and compositions; and overall molecular weight. The project is integrated with a strong educational and outreach component aimed at broadening participation of underrepresented groups.",
