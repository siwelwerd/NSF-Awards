 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will be to provide a new source of no-cost, pollution-free office paper. Despite advances in electronic displays society still uses tons of paper.  Printing and copying remain ubiquitous.  In 2013 the United States consumed 3.6 million tons of office copy paper, which according to the EPA?s Waste Reduction Model (WARM) added the equivalent of 28.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.  However, paper copies are only needed temporarily and most of that 3.6 million tons of paper is discarded or recycled within a few days.  A reputed survey found that 21% of hardcopies are discarded the same day they are made.  With the technology of Self-Erasing Inkjet Ink, the paper used for temporary hardcopies reverts to a blank sheet and can be re-used like new paper.  In all subsequent uses the paper is pollution-free.  For every 1% of the inkjet ink market captured by self-erasing ink, carbon emissions are reduced by 17 thousand metric tons per year, thereby supporting national goals of reducing pollution, conserving resources, and fighting climate change.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project lies in the development of a novel self-erasing ink for inkjet printing and photocopying.  The water-based ink derives its color from an acid-base indicator which is dark blue in an alkaline solution but otherwise colorless.  The ink is alkaline so it is colored when printed.  After printing the ink begins to self-erase due to a neutralization reaction with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  When the reaction is completed the ink is colorless and the paper appears as new.  The project will leverage existing, unmodified inkjet printer/copiers and ink cartridges.  This project will address remaining technical challenges in making the ink compatible with existing printers which were not designed for this type of ink chemistry.  Specifically the project will determine how to ensure the ink does not clog the inkjet nozzles between infrequent printing sessions.  The additives used for this purpose in conventional inks are not necessarily compatible with self-erasing ink chemistry and new ways to prevent clogging will be developed during the project.   The anticipated results from this effort will be an ink that approximates the print quality and reliability of conventional ink but also self-erases.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of the Phase I SBIR grant was to support proof of concept research for a novel self-erasing inkjet ink.  The unique chemistry of this ink made it prone to clogging the nozzles of the inkjet printers which caused poor print quality.  The clogging was particularly likely to occur after a printer sat idle for several days without a flow of ink to keep the nozzles from becoming obstructed by dried ink.  With the SBIR support the ink was reformulated to address the clogging issue so that printers could still print quality images after not having been used for at least 7 days.  This was an important milestone in advancing the ink towards commercialization.\n\nSelf-erasing ink enables printer paper to essentially recycle itself.  It is intended for printing drafts and reading materials that do not need to be kept permanently.  Most printed paper is used for only a short time because documents are now stored digitally rather than in filing cabinets.  After use, papers printed with self-erasing ink are set aside to erase instead of going into the recycling bin.  The ink erases itself resulting in blank paper again.  The technology provides free paper, at zero cost to the environment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/22/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carl Yee"
