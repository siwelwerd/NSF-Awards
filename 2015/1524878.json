 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is an institutional transformation project. It continues work initiated under a planning grant from an earlier NSF program.  The project supports a commitment by this university to increasing substantially the use of evidence-based teaching for foundational STEM courses.  With this project, the core STEM Departments and the University's administration plan to fully utilize evidence-based teaching methods in lower division courses and study the impact on student achievement.  The implementation of this plan allows a test of impact on a student body that is disproportionately non-traditional (50%) and comprised of many underrepresented minority students (25%). Non-traditional and minority students represent an increasing demographic nationwide and their needs must be addressed in order to meet the goal of increasing the number of STEM degree recipients. Heretofore, evidence-based teaching methods have been studied much more extensively on campuses with traditional student populations. The planning grant supported a self-assessment by STEM faculty instructors of their teaching, aided by peer-mentor-led learning communities and departmental conversations on teaching reforms. It initiated a set of pilot interventions in foundational STEM courses in core STEM departments, using professional development workshops to support faculty engagement with the initiative.  A recently completed university-wide strategic planning process pinpointed the importance of adopting evidence-based teaching methods to improve student success.  This team is well-positioned to move to scale in developing evidenced-based teaching approaches for its STEM courses, with priority given to the 26 foundational classes. \r\n\r\nThe program supported by this grant will allow departments to compete for course transformation grants. Successful projects will be provided resources in the form of a pedagogical post-doc and faculty professional development stipends to assist them in reformulating the class from a lecture-based curriculum to one dominated by active-engagement methods. Faculty involved in the concurrent projects will comprise a learning community to discuss issues relating to the implementation of evidence-based teaching and their reflections on student learning. Longitudinal tracking will follow students through to graduation, to assess the impact on academic and career trajectories of the students enrolled in the transformed courses.  A large part of the present project pertains to data collection and assessment of project efforts. These data will be documented and shared to ensure that other institutions can learn from this institutional transformation effort. Through this program, students will experience engaged learning, and faculty, post-doctoral fellows, and graduate students will be trained in modern evidence-based teaching methods. These students and fellows will be able to bring their training and experiences to other institutions and serve to build a national pool of experienced teachers using engaging and effective teaching methods.",

The project had multiple goals, including funding teams to reform teaching in critical and often large STEM courses, funding undergraduate learning assistants for large science and engineering courses, training the next generation of educators, and collaboration with a local community college in education and training. The focus was on implementation and training in evidence-based teaching methods, which are teaching methods that have been validated through multiple studies. These typically involve engaged and active learning, such as group work, peer mentoring, and flipped classroom approaches. Over the course of the program, we funded 15 faculty teams, directly affecting over 5,500 students during the lifetime of the grant, but with impact far beyond the grant's end, as the new teaching approaches became a permanent feature of the affected courses. We also trained over 200 undergraduate learning assistants (LAs) to assist in large STEM courses and facilitate group learning approaches. The LA program has served courses enrolling over 25,000 students over its 7 year lifetime and is also ongoing. Through these efforts we saw large reductions (5-40%) in failure rates in critical biology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, physics, public health, and psychology courses. The program also had a significant impact on improving and instituting training programs for graduate teaching assistants (GTAs) in the biological sciences, mathematics and physics. In collaboration with Henry Ford College in Dearborn, Michigan, we instituted a collaborative course in mathematics training for elementary school teachers. This program enabled students to easily transfer to Wayne State University and provided participants with a challenging and solid foundation in elementary mathematics pedagogy. The grant also had a significant and permanent impact on the teaching infrastructure of the university, including the creation of STEM Commons, an open space where students, learning assistants, GTAs and faculty meet for office hours or informal learning activities. We were also involved in the planning of a new STEM teaching building and the design of the included classrooms, which enable active flexible active learning approaches.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/27/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Peter&nbsp;M&nbsp;Hoffmann</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1524878/1524878_10398650_1643218445944_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1524878/1524878_10398650_1643218445944_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"STEM Commons\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1524878/1524878_10398650_1643218445944_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"STEM Commons\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students organize into study groups in STEM Commons under the leadership of a learning assistant.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Karen Myhr</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Peter&nbsp;M&nbsp;Hoffmann</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">STEM Commons</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1524878/1524878_10398650_1643218511396_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1524878/1524878_10398650_1643218511396_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"STEM LA program\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1524878/1524878_10398650_1643218511396_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"STEM LA program\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Conceptual overview of the synergy created through the STEM LA program.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Karen Myhr</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Peter&nbsp;M&nbsp;Hoffmann</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">STEM LA program</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
