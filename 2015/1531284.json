 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric fine particle organic aerosol (OA) is a known factor in human respiratory and cardio-vascular health and is also a source of  uncertainty in climate change, though direct and indirect effects. It is also known that a very large fraction (80-90%) of the submicron (PM1) particle mass arrives via condensation, and that OA evolves to that state in a dynamic cycle of oxidation, condensation, evaporation, and further chemical transformation.  A factor limiting our understanding of the reaction paths is that many of these compounds are extremely sticky (surface active), presenting a challenge to their handling and subsequent analysis. Recently developed instrumentation, specifically gas-phase chemical ionization atmospheric pressure interface time-of flight-mass spectrometry (CI-APCI-TOFMS), offers the promise of dynamically analyzing, both in laboratory and field studies, condensable organic compounds before they either reach particle size, and after they react and volatilize.\r\n\r\nThe instrument will be deployed principally in the Carnegie Mellon (CMU) Air Quality Laboratory to support organic aerosol research  experiments. The lab is a shared facility run by a team of CMU investigators with an established history of collaborative research and equipment sharing. The instrument is also field-deployable by design, allowing improved research into new aerosol particle formation. CI-API-TOFMS data may thus inform local, state and national regulatory and policy decisions, ultimately to the public benefit.",

This mode is known as Filter for Gases and Aerosols (FIGAERO). The instrument has three inlets for different modes of ion-molecule chemical ionization in front of a long time of flight mass spectrometer with a resolving power of approximately 8000, meaning that an ion with a charge to mass ratio of 80 would be resolved to within 1/100 of an atomic mass unit. The instrument also has very high ion transmission efficiency and can measure some molecules in the atmosphere at levels as low as one molecule per 1 quadrillion in air.</p>\n<p><br />The primary application of this instrument so far has been as a vital element of collaborative experiments at the CLOUD facility in CERN (pictured), which focuses on the physics and chemistry responsible for new-particle formation and growth in the atmosphere. During CLOUD experiment the CMU team has operated the instrument using the FIGAERO inlet and focused largely on particle composition measurement. For the ultra pure conditions of CLOUD we are able to measure the composition of particles as small as 5 nm diameter just after nucleation events. The instrument has participated in the CLOUD 12 and CLOUD 13 campaigns in Fall 2017 and Fall 2018 (pictured). In each case there were four major focus areas: marine nucleation involving iodine species; multi component nucleation involving biogenic organics, sulfuric acid, and bases such as ammonia; urban nucleation involving oxidation of aromatic molecules, sulfuric acid, and bases such as amines and ammonia; and nucleation involving nitric acid vapors. Temperatures ranged from -50 C to + 25 C.</p>\n<p><br />During the marine runs the CMU team operated the FIGAERO using Br- as the reagent ion in order to measure iodine containing species. These observations confirmed the importance of iodic acid in iodine nucleation. Temperature dependent measurements of particle composition in multicomponent runs with only oxidation products of alpha-pinene confirmed that the vapor-pressure distribution of the newly formed particles is completely consistent with the inferred vapor pressure distribution based on gas-phase measurements using a complementary set of mass spectrometers as well as particle growth modeled by the CMU team. The gas-phase and growth observations were reported in PNAS in 2018, and the FIGAERO particle composition measurements complete the mass balance and confirm that gas-phase formation of condensible vapors is the dominant process driving nucleation and condensational growth of the particles (as opposed to particle-phase chemistry).</p>\n<p><br />Observations during CLOUD-12 urban runs suggested that nitric acid may play an important role in rapid growth under urban conditions, and CLOUD-13 FIGAREO observations confirm this so-called \"explosive growth\" constituting almost entirely nitric acid condensation at temperatures below -5C, at concentrations found in heavily polluted urban areas worldwide. At sufficiently low temperature, nitric acid alone can also drive nucleation and not just growth, but even very low levels of sulfuric acid substantially enhance the nucleation (though not the growth). This explosive growth may be a key element responsible for the surprisingly high survival probability of nucleation events observed in urban settings with very high particle coagulation sinks. It is likely to substantially alter our understanding of urban (winter time) nucleation, and the CMU team is preparing a letter to Nature reporting these results.</p>\n<p><br />The FIGAERO instrument procured with MRI funding has thus been an indispensable part of advancing our understanding of atmospheric new-particle formation and growth, which is one of the leading uncertainties in our ability to calculate the aerosol indirect forcing on climate. The FIGAERO observations have confirmed and complemented existing gas-phase measurements for both marine and boreal-forest conditions, and revealed an entirely new chemical pathway for urban conditions.
