 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the increasing popularity of Web applications and users' deep involvement in the Web, search engines face great challenges with a new degree of complexity. For instance, location-based services collect more complex contextual information such as geo-locations, season, time and temperature. Users' search activities have become more complex and usually task-based generating a variety of feedback and engagement signals such as clicks, mouse movements, eye tracking results, and query reformulations.\u00a0 Moreover, search is not only an individual user's personalized activity, but also activities shared by many users with similar information needs. Search engines are presented with the richest types of information and the largest amount of data ever and the complexity of the available information is tremendous. This demands that search engines be upgraded from retrieval systems that basically look for documents for single queries to decision engines that can pick the best choices for information seeking tasks. Through disseminating research results in papers and tools, the project will make three types of broad impact. First, the techniques developed in this project will benefit a broad population of everyday users and empower them to deal with complex, task-oriented web search. Second, the algorithms and software developed will provide fellow researchers and practitioners a handful of useful tools for solving IR problems incorporating dynamics. Third, the project will reach out to middle school girls and elementary school students. It will be easy for any search engine user to start using the proposed new search engine. However, to be an expert on IR, students need to be good at mathematics, natural language processing, user interface, artificial intelligence, and programming. This will be an excellent project to attract young people and minorities to these STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to create the next generation search engines, to be more specific, decision engines. The focus will be on designing, experimenting, and deploying statistical models for modeling the dynamics presented in the search process. The technical challenges are: (1) given the complexity of the available data, integrating a search engine appropriately into the right places in the larger context for the ultimate information seeking tasks; (2) providing theoretical and practical support to formal modeling of user engagement and other dynamics in retrieval models for better retrieval effectiveness; (3) modeling a user's exploration in the information space and optimizing a search engine's actions and algorithms; and (4) modeling interactions between a user and a search engine as well as interactions among multiple users, creating the dynamic environment for them all to interact and to game with each other and achieve a win-win optimization. The success of this project will start a new research field in IR: dynamic IR modeling. The results of this research will be highly influential with great impact on the next generation search engines. The work will build a foundation for future advances in the fields of reinforcement learning in IR and game theory in IR.",

In total, we published five journal, twenty conference, and fifteen workshop papers. In addition, our 2016 book \"Dynamic Information Retrieval Modeling'' is a comprehensive introduction to statistical modeling of dynamic IR systems. Besides publications, we also reached out to the IR and the broader AI communities with evaluation campaigns, workshops, and tutorial lectures:\n\n- We organized the 2015-2017 TREC DD evaluation campaign with the National Institution of Standards and Technology. We also co-organized the 2018 Dynamic Search Lab at the European Conference and Labs of the Evaluation Forum (CLEF).\n\n- We gave tutorials on \"Dynamic Information Retrieval Modeling'' in top conferences, including ACM SIGIR 2014 and ACM WSDM 2015.\n\n- We co-organized the Deep Reinforcement Learning for Information Retrieval (DRL4IR) workshop series in ACM SIGIR 2020-2021. Our workshop was broadly welcomed by the research community and received more than 200 attendees in 2020.\n\n- We also released software packages, programming codes, datasets, and annotations to the general public. \n\n\nWe are very grateful for this NSF sponsorship, which has fully or partially supported three Ph.D., fifteen Master's, five undergraduate students, one programmer, and three post-doc researchers. Among them, six are from under-representative groups. We have also developed one undergraduate-level and four graduate-level courses from this research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Grace Hui Yang"
