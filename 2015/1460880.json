 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU site award to New York University, located in New York City, NY, will support the training of 10 students for 10 weeks during the summers of 2015-2019. Students will conduct research in neural science -- the study of the biological basis of human nature -- and use their basic knowledge in biology, mathematics, physics and chemistry to solve research problems needing a multidisciplinary approach. A wide variety of projects are available, ranging in scale from the molecular to cellular, and from neuronal network to behavior. Examples of questions students can investigate include: how individuals learn and memorize; what parts of the brain are activated when risky versus carefully calculated decisions are made; how attention modifies perception; how neonatal sensory experience affect mental capacities in adulthood, etc. Students are selected based on their desire to partake in basic research, as well as a match between their expressed topic of interest and those of mentors. The program aims to diversify the workforce in the field of neuroscience by attracting highly motivated individuals interested in pursuing a graduate degree in neuroscience. Students who are underrepresented in the field of neuroscience and have limited research opportunity at their home college/university will be given high priority for the program. For the application process, students will submit a CV and a personal statement describing their research interest in the field of neural science, and obtain two letters of recommendations.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that approximately 50 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and students will be required to present their results through a poster and oral presentation at the SURP symposium. Student will also be required to write a scientific paper describing the results of their summer research.\r\n\r\nStudents are required to be tracked after the program and must respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system (SALG URSSA). More information is available by visiting http://www.cns.nyu.edu/undergrad/surp/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Chiye Aoki at ca3@nyu.edu) or the co-Director (Dr. Margarita Kaplow at mkaplow@nyu.edu).",
