 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical\r\nThere are many interesting and open-ended questions regarding the function of the brain and the nervous system. The key signal transduction pathway lies between the electrical signals that are generated from excitable tissue and synthetic devices (e.g. computers and sensors) that can translate, interpret, and record this valuable information. However, the primary roadblock to seamless integration between the nervous system and computers is related to the lack of materials that can link these two disparate computing systems. The brain is soft, hydrated, and composed of neurons that use ions to communicate with one another. Conversely, silicon-based electronics are rigid, hermetically sealed, and use electrons to process information. This project will invent new biomimetic materials innovations that have the potential to bridge the tissue-device interface. These novel materials can match the mechanical properties of the brain and convert between ionic and electronic signals. Taken together, the improved electrode materials resulting from this project will create bioelectronics interfaces to learn more about the function of the brain. This project will also serve as an invaluable framework for training the next generation of materials scientists and electrical engineers. Students involved in this interdisciplinary project will receive training in polymer science, bioelectronics, and microelectronic device fabrication.\r\n\r\nTechnical\r\nThis project will design and synthesize two classes of materials to improve the miniaturization of multielectrode arrays for use in brain-machine interfaces. Specifically, two materials innovations will be explored to increase charge injection limits and improve the chemical stealth of cortical brain-machine interfaces. First, nanoscale melanin films will increase the charge injection limit and promote electronic/ionic signal transduction. The rationale for this approach is based on the unique combination of nanoscale architecture, redox active chemistry, and biocompatibility that suggests that melanins can transduce ionic and electronic currents efficiently. Second, a class of ultra-compliant zwitterionic conducting hydrogel networks will be synthesized that will promote seamless mechanical, chemical, and electronic integration between electronically active implants and excitable tissue. Taken together, the materials innovations proposed herein will improve both the stimulation and recording of neural tissue using cortical brain-machine interfaces.",

There were three successful components to this effort during the award period. First, catechol-bearing polydopamine materials were used as coatings to improve charge injection in neural electrodes. Second, catechol-bearing hydrogels were used as substrate materials for creating ultracompliant electronics. Third, catechol-bearing hydrogels and companion fabrication processes were used to create ultracompliant neural probes that were used for in vivo recording. A brief summary of each thrust is provided here.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit</p>\n<p>For the first thrust, the properties of redox active polydopamine melanin (PDM) films as a coating material for neural electrodes were evaluated. PDM films with nanometer-scale thicknesses exhibit dc bias dependent charge injection capacities (CIC) with maximum values of 110 &plusmn; 23 &mu;C cm<sup>-2</sup> at 0.2V (vs Ag/AgCl) and reduce the interfacial impedance compared to inorganic conducting films.

Fe<sup>3+</sup>-[PEG-Dopa]<sub>4 </sub>hydrogels are formed through Fe<sup>3+</sup>-induced crosslinking of 4-arm-polyethyleneglycol-dopamine precursors to produce networks. The relative amounts of H-bonds, coordination bonds, and covalent bonds can be controlled through the molar ratio of [Fe<sup>3+</sup>]:[Dopa] in precursor solutions. Networks formed from precursors with high values of [Fe<sup>3+</sup>]:[Dopa] create mechanically robust networks (<em>G&rsquo;</em> = 6880 &plusmn; 240 Pa) that are largely impervious to US-mediated disintegration at intensities up to 43 W/cm<sup>2</sup>. Conversely, lightly crosslinked networks formed through molar ratios of [Fe<sup>3+</sup>]:[Dopa] &lt; 0.73 are susceptible to rapid disintegration upon exposure to US. Pulsatile US exposure enables temporal control over hydrogel disintegration and programmable self-healing. Sustained US energy can also stabilize hydrogels through the formation of additional crosslinks via free radical-mediated coupling of pendant catechols. Taken together, the diverse range of mechanical behavior, self-healing capability, and differential susceptibility to ultrasonic disintegration suggest that Fe<sup>3+</sup>-[PEG-Dopa]<sub>4 </sub>hydrogels yield a class of application-specific stimuli-responsive polymers as smart materials for applications ranging from transient medical implants to matrices for smart drug delivery.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the third and final thrust, ultracompliant microelectrode arrays (MEA) prepared on hydrogel-based substrates would have mechanical properties (<em>G&rsquo;</em> = 1&mdash;10 kPa) that afford better congruence with target organs in the PNS. However, MEA substrates composed of swollen hydrogels, exhibit low toughness and present technical challenges for processes commonly used in MEA fabrication such as thin film deposition, photolithography, and etching. Many MEA workflows require elevated temperatures, high vacuum, organic solvents, and caustic buffers, all of which are fundamentally incompatible with substrates composed of swollen hydrogels. The high water content of hydrogesl (&gt;90 wt%) also reduces interfacial adhesion substantially, which complicates fabrication strategies based on transfer printing. Here we describe a generalizeable strategy to transfer print multilayered microelectronics to mechanically robust hydrogels for use as ultracompliant MEA.
