 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Alabama (UA) is designing and deploying a science DMZ herein referred to as UA SciNet to support the rapid expansion in research across multiple science and engineering disciplines.  UA SciNet is based on the design patterns and best practices emerging from Internet2 and ESNet. UA SciNet is a dedicated, isolated network connecting to the UA wide-area network at the campus network border.  It provides 40 Gbps connections between active data-intensive science areas and high performance computing and research storage resources. It provides an initial 400% bandwidth increase for research and lays the foundation for 100 Gbps connectivity to the wide area network via the UA System Regional Optical network and Southern Crossroads services. It includes a robust performance monitoring and problem resolution component using perfSONAR. It also uses wide-area remote DMA (RDMA) to achieve high-bandwidth remote access to UA Big Data resources.\r\n\r\nThe research impacted by the project includes hydro-meteorologic modeling, disaster event prediction and mitigation, human behavior, and particle physics, specifically leveraging the data-intensive operations at the recently completed National Water Center on the UA campus.  This project also works in coordination with other initiatives both on campus and at the regional and state levels to ensure its effective integration and to ensure its benefits are fully leveraged.  Further, the project brings unique education and training opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students, researchers and system and network professionals to the areas of advanced network infrastructure, data-intensive science, and performance monitoring and diagnostics.",
