 "awd_abstract_narration": "Terahertz Compressive Imaging with Tunable Metamaterial Absorbers\r\nIntellectual merit: \r\nThe goal of the proposed research is to demonstrate single pixel compressive and coded aperture imaging at terahertz (THz) frequencies utilizing metamaterial absorbers as spatial light modulators. It will showcase fully functional single pixel multiplexed terahertz imaging systems not achieved before. Imaging systems will based on various implementations of coded aperture imaging theory including compressive and Hadamard approaches. The PI will explore promising technologies for use in dynamic spatial light modulators though active control of the metamaterial response and which are already part of current research expertise. Dynamic spatial light modulators will consist of pixelated arrays of metamaterial structures that are individually addressable.\r\nBroader impact: \r\nThe development of imaging in the terahertz regime has far reaching impact in diverse areas such as biomedical imaging for cancer detection and high resolution spectroscopy of cells, DNA and proteins, to all weather guidance systems and personnel screening. However existing imaging approaches have limited sensitivity due to the lack of efficient sources and detectors in the terahertz frequency range. Moreover detectors are typically single pixel detectors that require scanning to obtain a 2D image or focal plane arrays which suffer reduced performance. Beyond facilitating technological breakthroughs and intellectual property generation, the project will establish a research and teaching laboratory at Boston College in the areas of metamaterials, terahertz science and technology, and coded aperture imaging. This interdisciplinary research project will permit members of the laboratory to actively contribute to the burgeoning field of metamaterials for terahertz sensing and communications and compressive imaging. These projects provide an excellent opportunity for undergraduate and graduate students at Boston College to learn about the unconventional, complex, and emergent physical properties that metamaterials hold for future technological applications needed to fill voids in the terahertz regime. It will train the future generation of science and engineering majors in valuable and versatile experimental techniques including extremely broadband frequency domain spectroscopy and THz spectroscopy and imaging, and fabricational methods for development of micron and nano-scale artificial electromagnetic materials, as well as computer simulation techniques utilizing the finite element method, and the construction of imaging systems. The PIs strong commitment to undergraduate research, involvement with the McNair Scholarship program, a graduate school preparation program for underrepresented (low income and first generation) undergraduates, will further permit recruitment of undergraduate and graduate students from the underrepresented portion of the Boston College population.",
