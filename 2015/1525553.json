 "awd_abstract_narration": "Learning and adaptation are fundamental processes in living systems. Human beings are clearly capable of learning complex concepts, but even unicellular organisms such as bacteria are capable of adaptive response to external stimuli. This suggests that synthetic systems of biomolecules could, in principle, be developed to enable sustained operation and exhibit similar adaptive behaviors. Thanks to advances in the tools developed in the fields of biotechnology and nanotechnology, it is now becoming possible to engineer such systems in the laboratory. This project will study the design and experimental implementation of synthetic DNA-based information processing systems that exhibit adaptive behaviors such as learning. Successful completion of this research will enable future development of synthetic biochemical systems capable of sustained operation, which could have practical applications such as long-term health monitoring, as well as providing insights into the biochemical basis of learning in biological systems. The project will support training and education of undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThis project will study learning and adaptation in synthetic biochemical systems implemented using DNA strand displacement reactions. In DNA strand displacement reaction networks, multi-strand DNA \"gate\" structures are used to process information that is encoded using single strands of DNA, by binding to freely-diffusing single strands and releasing other single strands into solution in response. In this project, a particular class of DNA strand displacement gates known as \"buffered gates\" will be developed. A buffered gate is one where a large quantity of gates start in an inactive state and a subset are activated to carry out their computational task: once each gate is consumed, in addition to its usual outputs the gate also releases a strand to activate a new gate from the buffer, so the population of active gates remains roughly constant. In this project, buffered gate systems will be studied in simulation and in the laboratory. Crucially, buffered gate systems in which one gate controls the availability of activating strands for another buffered gate will be studied. This will enable information to be stored and updated with the molecular system, thereby enabling adaptive behavior. This concept will be used as the fundamental design building block to implement molecular computing systems capable of adaptive behavior in response to externally-provided input signals. The goal of this project will be to design, simulate and implement molecular logic systems that demonstrate adaptive behavior, for example, implementing supervised learning algorithms.",
