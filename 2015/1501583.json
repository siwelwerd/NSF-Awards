 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns investigations in the theory of numbers and arithmetic geometry. This is an area of research that has applications to cyber security, through cryptography, and to some aspects of coding theory. Shimura varieties are particular kinds of higher-dimensional surfaces, and their rich geometry and arithmetic puts them among the central objects of study in modern mathematics.  They play an essential role in the Langlands program, which is of increasing interest in theoretical physics, and are important tools for understanding elliptic curves and abelian varieties, which now play a major role in cryptography.  The primary goal of the Principal Investigator's research on Shimura varieties is to prove new formulas for Faltings heights, which are a way of measuring the complexity of elliptic curves and abelian varieties.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator will study the arithmetic of special cycles on integral models of unitary and orthogonal Shimura varieties.  There are four distinct, but interrelated, parts of the project.  The first part is to extend to integral models a theorem of Borcherds on the modularity of a generating series of divisors on an unitary Shimura variety.  The main application of this extension will be to prove new cases of Colmez's conjectural relation between Faltings heights of CM abelian varieties and derivatives of Artin L-functions.  The second part is similar to the first, but on orthogonal Shimura varieties.  This will yield still more cases of Colmez's conjecture.  The third part of the project is a generalization of the Gross-Kohnen-Zagier theorem to unitary and orthogonal Shimura varieties, which is expected to yield new cases of the Beilison-Bloch conjecture relating dimensions of Chow groups to orders of vanishing of L-functions.  The fourth project involves the explicit description of mod p reductions of orthogonal Shimura varieties, and is necessary for the third project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Principal Investigator's research lies in the field of arithmetic geometry, which lies at the intersection of number theory and geometry.  At its core, the theory uses geometric methods to study integer or rational solutions to systems of polynomial equations.  The particular kinds of equations studied by the PI define geometric objects called Shimura varieties. \n\n \n\nIt was first noticed in the 1970's that in the special case of a two-dimensional Shimura variety (a Shimura surface), one could find a family of smaller Shimura curves whose intersections with one another could be explicitly computed.  These intersection multiplicities then turned out to be numbers appearing in different branches of mathematics, especially in the representation theory of groups and the theory of modular forms.\n\nThe PI has found many new such examples of this phenomenon, in which the Shimura surface and its family of embedded curves are replaced by higher dimensional analogues, and the intersection multiplicities are closely related to quantities appearing in other branches of mathematics.  By exploiting such relations, the PI and his coauthors have done the following:\n\n (1)  proved new cases of a long-standing conjecture expressing certain integrals on higher-dimensional tori (period integrals) as infinite products (Artin L-functions);\n\n(2)  determined the structure of the reduction modulo different primes of the supersingular loci of Shimura varieties associate to orthogonal groups;\n\n(3)  proved new relations between the intersections of cycles on moduli spaces of Shtukas and higher derivatives of automorphic L-functions;\n\n(4)  shown that certain formal generating series of cycles on unitary and orthogonal Shimura varieties are modular forms.\n\nAspects of these projects were the basis of the doctoral theses of three Ph.D. students at Boston College, and one project was joint with a postdoctoral researcher under the PI?s supervision.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin V Howard"
