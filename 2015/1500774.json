 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award to University of Colorado, Boulder is made to support travel for twenty US graduate students, and three invited speakers from US institutions to a day-long workshop on model-based phylogenetics and phylogeography on the day prior to the Evolution meetings in Guarujo, Brazil (June 26, 2015). Model-based phylogenetic methods are growing at a staggering pace and now provide researchers with an opportunity to address research questions that were not possible before. This proposal is worthy of funding because it will allow U.S. researchers to learn about these new model-based phylogenetic methods first hand from several of the leading researchers in the field. The workshop is structured to provide an introduction to the theory behind the models followed by hands-on experience with the various software packages using real world data.  The PIs and speakers have a strong track record of running successful workshops on similar topics demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed plan. \r\n\r\nThe award will support travel to the meeting and accommodation for twenty US graduate students, including members of under-represented groups. All workshop tutorials will be made publically available through a dedicated website and all presentations will be uploaded to YouTube after the meeting.  100 foreign graduate students, predominantly from South and Central America, will also attend the workshop enhancing opportunities for international scientific collaboration.",
