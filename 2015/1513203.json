 "awd_abstract_narration": "This infrastructure proposal supports the acquisition of a multi-robot team suited for operations\r\nin coastal environments. The robot team consists of two underwater vehicles (AUVs), three\r\nsurface vehicles (ASVs), as well as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs): two fixed-wing UAVs and\r\ntwo quadrocopters. The target domain is the coastal waters of South Carolina. In several applications\r\nsuch as environmental monitoring, homeland security, resource utilization, and contamination\r\ntracking, there is a need to track a mass of water, record a set of properties, such as salinity,\r\ntemperature, presence of different substances, and also record the position and boundaries\r\nof the said body. The proposed infrastructure will enable computing research for addressing\r\nthe above problems.\r\n\r\nThis project revolves around enabling research on several CISE research\r\nfields at the University of South Carolina, including algorithmic development for multi-robot\r\ncoordination, path-planning and state estimation; planning under uncertainty; sensor fusion\r\nfrom different modalities; and human-robot interaction.",

In particular, six Autonomous Surface Vehicles (robotic boats) commonly refered as ASVs were designed and constructed at the University of South Carolina, based on the Mokai EsKape boat. The ASVs are designed to operate in a sliding autonomy mode, starting on manual operation, teleoperation, way point navigation, to autonomous steering and velocity control. In particular, waypoints and velocity commands can be transmitted from a ground control station (GCS) or generated on board the vessel, enabling operations beyond the communication range. The ASVs have been used for research on multi-robot lake coverage for bathymetric measurements; mapping and monitoring of rivers, and operations in the presence of adversarial forces (wind and currents). More specifically, the coverage operations for performing bathymetric surveys were performed. The proposed algorithm took into account the kinematic contraints of the vehicle in order to produce efficient trajectories. Exploration and monitoring of rivers resulted in four different algorithms for operations with different objectives. The ASVs will be utilized in future research on Harmfull Algae Blooms (HABs). Two Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) and one Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) were acquired which were used to pursue research in underwater state estimation, coral classification, and shipwreck mapping. Several students were trained in the design, development, and operations of marine robots. The robots were also used to several highschool students interested in the STEM field.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/26/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ioannis&nbsp;Rekleitis</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513203/1513203_10372159_1574445184954_vlcsnap-2017-01-29-20h13m51s329--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513203/1513203_10372159_1574445184954_vlcsnap-2017-01-29-20h13m51s329--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Two Aqua2 AUVs\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513203/1513203_10372159_1574445184954_vlcsnap-2017-01-29-20h13m51s329--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Two Aqua2 AUVs\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two Autonomous Underwater Vehicle operating over a coral reef.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ioannis Rekleitis</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ioannis&nbsp;Rekleitis</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Two Aqua2 AUVs</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513203/1513203_10372159_1574445005375_Beauty3Mokai--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513203/1513203_10372159_1574445005375_Beauty3Mokai--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Autonomous Surface Vehicle\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513203/1513203_10372159_1574445005375_Beauty3Mokai--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Autonomous Surface Vehicle\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Three Autonomous Surface Vehicles performing Coverage at Lake Murray</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ioannis Rekleitis</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ioannis&nbsp;Rekleitis</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Autonomous Surface Vehicle</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513203/1513203_10372159_1574445371331_AquaCoral2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513203/1513203_10372159_1574445371331_AquaCoral2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Aqua2 AUV with Sonar.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513203/1513203_10372159_1574445371331_AquaCoral2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Aqua2 AUV with Sonar.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An Aqua2 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle with a pencil beam sonar collecting data over a coral reef.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ioannis Rekleitis</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ioannis&nbsp;Rekleitis</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Aqua2 AUV with Sonar.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513203/1513203_10372159_1574445856537_following--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513203/1513203_10372159_1574445856537_following--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"UAV following an ASV\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1513203/1513203_10372159_1574445856537_following--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"UAV following an ASV\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Unmanned Aerial Vehicle following a Autonomous Surface Vehicle during deployments at Lake Murray, SC.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nikolaos Vitzilaios</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ioannis&nbsp;Rekleitis</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">UAV following an ASV</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
