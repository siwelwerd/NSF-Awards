 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of the proposal is to conduct cutting-edge computer\r\nsimulations to help understand the increasingly rich observations of\r\nthe young Universe. The simulations will study the damage wrought by\r\nthe brilliant life and explosive death of the first stars. The\r\nmaterial between the stars is cooked by intense, high-energy radiation\r\nand the simulations will study the consequences of that\r\ncooking. Particles of dark, non-radiating matter respond to the force\r\nof gravity, so dark matter could influence the formation of the first\r\nstars and galaxies. The simulations will study how this influence\r\ndepends on the mass assumed for these poorly-understood particles.\r\nComparisons between the simulations and the growing body of ground-\r\nand space-based observations of the young Universe will significantly\r\nstrengthen the inferences drawn from those observations. The new\r\nsimulations will be suitably visualized and shown to the public in the\r\nIMAX theatre of the Rose-Hayden Planetarium of the American Museum of\r\nNatural History in New York City. Prior videos from this team have\r\nbeen featured daily in that venue, making it an effective point of\r\npublic access especially for young viewers.",

The Lyman alpha emitter fraction is seen to drop rapidly, by a factor of at least three, from redshift six to redshift eight, sharply reversing the upward trend from lower redshift up to redshift six, suggesting a significantly neutral intergalactic medium at redshift eight, which again may be at odds with CMB observations.The investigator's research &nbsp;allows confrontation of theory, constructed as ab initio and from first principles as possible, with observations in physical and diagnostic details that are unprecedented. In this reporting period, among others, the investigator performs an in-depth analysis of the physics-rich endgame of reionization at z=5.7 and above, utilizing jointly the observations of the Lya forest, the mean free path of ionizing photons, the luminosity functionof galaxies and new physical insight. It is found that an upper limit on electron optical depth &nbsp;provides a constrainton the minimum mean free path (of ionizing photons) that is primarily due to dwarf galaxies, which in turn yields a newand yet the strongest constraint on the matter power spectrum on 10-100 kiloparsec scales. The investigator has also performed a suite of high-resolution zoom-in cosmological simulations covering a range of density environment to provide detailed relations between halo mass and star formation rate and between halo massand stellar mass. A new physical effect is discovered in that local supernova feedback effect imprints an observable feature in the shape of the galaxy luminosity functions at high redshift, which will be testable with upcoming observations.<br /><br />The research activities is integrated into training of graduate and undergraduate students throughtheir active participation in research and classroom lectures. Common computing algorithms, software and paralleltechniques have been shared with the larger supercomputing community. For example, the software program SCORCH has been made available to the community, and a physically motivated, accurate supernova feedback implementation has been made available to peer cosmological hydrodynamic simulators and others, to stimulate and accelerate the advancein cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The extremely high computational demands of the investigator's cutting-edge simulations have continued to test and push the technological advances of supercomputers and relatedhardware and software, and drive the development of national research infrastructure. &nbsp;The investigator has also continued to explore possibilities of visualizing simulations, built on an ongoing, effective outreach program to enhance scientificunderstanding of the general public about cosmological research, through effective channels, such as on the World-Wide-Web,at the IMAX theatre of the Rose-Hayden Planetarium of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City and public television programs, like the PBS Nova programs.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/28/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Renyue&nbsp;Cen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1515389/1515389_10391238_1548704631867_panel_plot--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1515389/1515389_10391238_1548704631867_panel_plot--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"He reionization topology\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1515389/1515389_10391238_1548704631867_panel_plot--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"He reionization topology\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Each panel shows a 2-dimensional slice through the simulation volume with the thicknessof a single RT cell (600kpc).
