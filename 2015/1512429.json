These impacts are projected to become more significant in the future due to ongoing urbanization, population densification, and global climate change. The aim of this research is to answer the question, what are the most effective urban heat mitigation strategies for the populations that are most vulnerable to extreme heat? The analysis will focus on neighborhoods in Los Angeles, CA that contain populations that are especially physically and financially vulnerable to increasing extreme heat: (1) the elderly, (2) those without air conditioning, and (3) those of low socioeconomic status that cannot afford increased energy costs. \r\n\r\nThe research will develop a multi-scale coupled modeling framework that resolves regional-scale meteorology, micro-scale meteorology, and building energy flows. Neighborhoods in Los Angeles with vulnerable populations will be identified using parcel-level GIS datasets of population age, income, and access to air-conditioning. The heat mitigation strategies that will be assessed include solar reflective rooftops and pavements, and increased use of street-level and rooftop urban vegetation. These mitigation strategies will be assessed for impacts on (a) outdoor and indoor air temperatures, (b) human thermal comfort, heat stress, and heat-related mortality, (c) indoor thermal conditions for representative buildings without air conditioning, and (d) air-conditioning energy use for representative buildings with air conditioning. Model performance for each element of the model will be thoroughly evaluated by comparing to observations. The multi-scale model and methods for targeting vulnerable populations will be applicable to other cities worldwide in future work. Results from the project will provide targeted solutions to help vulnerable populations deal with extreme heat. Solutions will be communicated to local policy makers, utilities, and other stakeholders, all of whom the PIs have already-established relationships, to provide pathways for implementation. Discoveries will also be communicated to middle and high school students in areas with vulnerable populations through outreach programs at University of Southern California (USC). The PI will work with teachers through USC's Research Experience for Teachers program, with the goal of designing curriculum and research focused lessons that teach students about the fundamental physics describing extreme heat mitigation. Additionally, the PI will teach a demonstration focused lesson in participating teacher's classrooms to excite future young scientists and engineers to follow careers in STEM. A simple website will be created summarizing research outcomes and providing practical solutions for mitigating extreme heat.",

These impacts are projected to become more significant in the future due to ongoing urbanization, population densification, and global climate change. The aim of this research project was to answer the question, what are the most effective urban heat mitigation strategies for the populations that are most vulnerable to extreme heat? The heat mitigation strategies that were assessed include solar reflective rooftops, walls, and pavements, and increased use of street-level and rooftop urban vegetation. Much of the study focused on the Los Angeles basin, though some aspects of the analyses were regional and even global in nature.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">We started by analyzing GIS datasets to identify regions of Los Angeles with populations that are some of the most vulnerable to extreme heat - the elderly and those living in poverty. Next, using a multi-scale modeling approach, we investigated the impacts of adopting heat mitigation strategies in these neighborhoods on outdoor temperatures, pedestrian thermal comfort, indoor temperatures and occupant thermal comfort (for unconditioned homes), and air conditioning energy use. We found that adding street trees and cool pavements led to the largest reductions in near-surface air temperatures. In addition, street trees led to the largest improvements in pedestrian thermal comfort due to added shade. The impacts of cool pavements on pedestrian thermal comfort were more complex. During the day, thermal comfort was worsened in some situations due to increases in sunlight that was reflected by the pavement and then absorbed by pedestrians. However, at nighttime, pedestrian thermal comfort was improved by cool pavements due to residual temperature decreases. Measurements conducted at neighborhood scale found the first observational evidence (to our knowledge) that solar reflective cool roof adoption is associated with neighborhood scale near-surface air temperature reductions. We also found that indoor comfort (in unconditioned buildings) was improved with the addition of cool roofs, with the level of improvement varying by location in the Los Angeles basin.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Other elements of this project investigated the climate impacts of adopting heat mitigation strategies at larger spatial scales, ranging from urban to global scale. We found that cool roofs, cool walls, and cool pavements can reduce temperatures in cities, and as such are an important contributor for mitigating urban heat islands and partially reversing the local impacts of global climate change. In addition, we found that adopting solar reflective materials can have other environmental co-benefits such as reducing concentrations of some air pollutants (e.g., ground-level ozone). On the other hand, adopting heat mitigation strategies can have environmental penalties such as increasing particulate matter concentrations under certain situations. In Los Angeles, the increase in particulate matter was driven by reductions in sea breeze intensity, and increases in concentrations of semi-volatile species that partition into the particle phase as air temperatures are reduced. We also found that adopting cool roofs around the world can reduce urban temperatures, but counter to some previous research, we suggest they would have negligible impacts on global climate. Lastly, solutions to other environmental challenges (e.g., water stress) can have consequences on urban climate. For example, we found that adopting drought-tolerant vegetation (in place of irrigated lawns) for reducing water use can lead to daytime near-surface air temperature increases and nighttime temperature decreases. Daytime temperature increases were driven by reductions in evapotranspiration caused by reduced irrigation and consequent reductions in soil moisture. On the other hand, nighttime temperature decreases occurred due to reductions in soil moisture causing changes in the thermal properties of soils and subsequent decreases in upward ground heat flux.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Outcomes from this research were communicated to policy makers around Los Angeles through committees such as the Committee on Urban Cooling and Heat Impacts. This committee included decision makers from various branches of government within the City and County of Los Angeles (e.g., from the mayor of Los Angeles Sustainability and Resilience offices).&nbsp; Research was also presented at the National Academy of the Sciences for a symposium focused on helping states carry out climate assessments based on policy-relevant research. In addition, teachers from underprivileged parts of Los Angeles worked in the PI's lab for two summers as part of University of Southern California's Research for Teachers program. Curriculum for middle schoolers was developed to teach the basics of heat transfer with applications to heat mitigation strategy adoption. Lastly, several news articles were written based on our research in some of the most highly read outlets (e.g., Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Washington Post), and several radio interviews were conducted on National Public Radio. This allowed the general public to hear about our research in simple terms.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">In total, this project contributed to 21 publications in the peer-reviewed literature.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/29/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: George&nbsp;Ban-Weiss</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1512429/1512429_10366079_1567115654425_3.Figure7--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1512429/1512429_10366079_1567115654425_3.Figure7--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Residual warming due to climate change after adopting cool roofs\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1512429/1512429_10366079_1567115654425_3.Figure7--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Residual warming due to climate change after adopting cool roofs\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Projected residual air temperature change from global climate change relative to current climate after cool roof adoption for (a) mid-century under RCP2.6, (b) mid-century under RCP8.5, (c) end-century under RCP2.6, and (d) end-century under RCP8.5.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vahmani et al.
