 "awd_abstract_narration": "Password authentication is a critical vulnerability in cyberinfrastructure because typical passwords are memorable and easily guessed, leaving them vulnerable to malicious actors. One well-recognized method for strengthening the password security is Two-Factor Authentication (TFA), in which the password is complemented by an additional authentication factor such as a mobile phone or a dedicated token (e.g., a USB dongle). However, current TFA mechanisms do not offer sufficient security and usability. This project breaks new ground towards improving both of these aspects. It designs, implements and evaluates TFA schemes that not only protect against on-line guessing attacks, but also against off-line dictionary attacks in case of server or mobile device compromise. Moreover, the project aims to do so without degrading usability compared to password-only authentication. The creation of formal security models for TFA schemes allow for better understanding of TFA security in general. The resulting research prototypes will be of immense value in future research on building resilient and usable authentication services. The project integrates research into educational activities in the form of advanced curriculum development as well as high school and K-12 student mentoring in the area of Identity and Access Management.\r\n\r\nThe design of new TFA protocols offers security against on-line guessing and offline dictionary attacks. The project formally proves the security of these protocols in a strong security model for TFA protocols that is being introduced as an extension to well-established password-authenticated key exchange (PAKE) models. The goal is to design the TFA protocols in a modular way, allowing for the use of independent device and server components, and enabling the use of the developed schemes with existing password protocols and without the need to modify the server software. Moreover, the research involves developing and testing TFA systems which will instantiate the proposed protocols.  The goal is a TFA systems design that utilizes automated and user-transparent data channel between the mobile device and the client, falling back to localized wireless radio communication only when such a channel is unavailable. Such construction would provide high usability since the user experience of the login process would be almost equivalent to password-only authentication. Finally, the project involves conducting rigorous usability studies in the lab environment and field settings to evaluate the performance, usability, and adoption potential of the proposed approaches.",
