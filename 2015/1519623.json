 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the International Project Office (IPO) of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project, currently a core project under the umbrella of the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) and co-sponsored by the international Commission on Atmospheric Composition and Global Pollution (iCACGP).  IGAC was formed in 1990 to address growing international concern over rapid changes observed in the Earth's atmosphere. IGAC's mission is to foster atmospheric chemistry research towards a sustainable world.\r\n\r\nIGAC's priorities and activities are determined and guided by an international volunteer Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) that includes representatives from 16 different countries around the world. The main responsibility of the IGAC International Project Office's (IPO) is to implement these priorities in collaboration with SSC members and other members of the international atmospheric chemistry community. The role of the IGAC Project Office is two-fold. Its first responsibility is to provide intellectual leadership and create networks that lead to the coordination of atmospheric chemistry research at an international level. IGAC's second responsibility is to act as a liaison between the atmospheric chemistry community and global change and sustainability community.\r\n\r\nSupport for the IGAC International Project Office provides the broader impact of building scientific capacity around the globe.  For developing country scientists, IGAC fosters the creation of a strong cohesive community of atmospheric scientists in under-represented regions of the world and also connects the scientists to the larger IGAC community in order to foster international collaborations.  IGAC also works to communicate atmospheric chemistry research effectively to the international atmospheric chemistry community and to the wider global change and sustainability community, including stakeholders, policy makers and the public.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAbout IGAC\n\nThe atmosphere is the integrator of the Earth system. Human emissions of pollutants and long-lived greenhouse gases into the atmosphere have caused dramatic transformations of the planet, altering air quality, climate, and nutrient flows in every ecosystem. Understanding the global atmosphere requires an international network of scientists providing intellectual leadership in areas of atmospheric chemistry that need to be addressed, promoted, and would benefit from research across disciplines and geographical boundaries.  Acknowledgement of this need led to the formation of the International Global Atmospheric Chemistry (IGAC) Project in 1990.\n\nIGAC?s mission is to facilitate atmospheric chemistry research towards a sustainable world. This is achieved through IGAC?s three focal activities: fostering community, building capacity, and providing leadership.\n\nFostering Community\n\nIGAC is an open international community of scientists researching topics related to atmospheric chemistry (air quality, climate change, carbon and nitrogen cycles, impacts on human health and ecosystems, etc.) that is actively collaborating across geographical boundaries and disciplines in order to contribute to addressing the most pressing global change and sustainability issues through scientific research.  The IGAC biennial science conference and the facilitation of numerous thematic workshops every year provides opportunities to build cooperation and disseminate scientific information across the international community.\n\nBuilding Capacity\n\nIGAC builds scientific capacity through its early career program and national and regional working groups.  The IGAC early career program allows scientists to join an international network early in their career, which puts the cogs in motion to further facilitate atmospheric chemistry research at an international level for years to come.  The IGAC national and regional working groups create a strong cohesive community of atmospheric scientists in emerging countries/regions that together have a sum greater than their parts and connects these scientists to the larger IGAC community to foster international collaboration.\n\nProviding Leadership\n\nIGAC provides intellectual leadership by identifying and fostering activities on current and future areas within atmospheric chemistry that would benefit from research across geographical boundaries and/or disciplines.  IGAC?s vision (Figure 1) is to link fundamental scientific research on emissions, atmospheric processes, and atmospheric composition to global change and sustainability issues such as human health, climate, and ecosystems and how individual and societal responses feed back into the core research-led foci of IGAC.\n\nIGAC's Impact\n\nOver the last 29 years, IGAC has fostered an international community of a couple thousand scientists working on topics related to atmospheric chemistry. IGAC continues to build its community by engaging with scientists from around the world, sponsoring or endorsing numerous events, and hosting an international science conference on a biennial basis.
