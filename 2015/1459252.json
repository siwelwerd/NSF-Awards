 "awd_abstract_narration": "Iron is one of the most abundant elements on Earth and is an essential element for life. Despite its abundance, iron is not always biologically available.  For example, in the water column of the ocean, iron is easily oxidized and precipitates or sinks to the sediments. This can result in there being such a deficit of iron in the open ocean that it is often the primary limiting nutrient for the growth of phytoplankton that form the base of the marine food web. Marine sediments can be a major source of iron to the ocean, when it is made biologically available. Interestingly, one group of bacteria, the iron-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB), can use iron directly as an energy source to fuel their growth, and may govern the availability of iron to other parts of the ocean. While this group can be abundant at hydrothermal vents, little is known about their abundance or activity in marine sediments. Are these bacteria playing an important role in controlling the flux of iron from the sediments to the water column? To answer this, sediments on the east and west coasts of the United States will be analyzed to characterize and quantitate the diversity and abundance of FeOB. In addition, a series of laboratory experiments will be aimed at understanding the specific role they play in controlling iron flux from the sediments to the ocean, as well as the technically challenging question of determining the lower limit of oxygen at which they can grow. This work has relevance to our understanding of how biological control of a seemingly minor constituent in seawater, iron, could have implications for productivity of the entire ocean.  Notably, a predicted impact of climate change on marine environments is to decrease oxygen levels in the ocean. This could have a profound influence on the sedimentary iron cycle, and possibly lead to greater inputs of iron, which could in turn alleviate iron-limitation in some regions of the ocean, thereby enhancing the rate of CO2-fixation and draw down of CO2 from the atmosphere. This project will provide training for a postdoctoral scientist, graduate students and undergraduates. Public outreach will include a student initiated exhibit, entitled \"Iron and the evolution of life on Earth\" at the Harvard Museum of Natural History providing a unique opportunity for undergraduate training and outreach.\r\n\tThe central hypothesis of this proposal is that FeOB are more common in marine sedimentary environments than previously recognized, and play a substantive role in governing the iron flux from the sediments into the water column by constraining the release of dissolved iron (dFe) from sediments. A survey of near shore regions in the Gulf of Maine, and a transect along the Monterey Canyon off the coast of California will obtain cores of sedimentary muds and look at the vertical distribution of FeOB and putative Fe-reducing bacteria using sensitive techniques to detect their presence and relative abundance. Sediments will be used in a novel reactor system that will allow for precise control of O2 levels and iron concentration to measure the dynamics of the iron cycle under different oxygen regimens. Pure cultures of FeOB with different O2 affinities will be tested in a bioreactor coupled to a highly sensitive mass spectrometer to determine the lower limits of O2 utilization for different FeOB growing on iron, thus providing mechanistic insight into their activity and distribution in low oxygen environments.",

Iron(II) was very common on early Earth, and remains common today in those parts of our world devoid of oxygen.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep sea hydrothermal vents, acidic hot springs, and even deep sea sediments and deep terrestrial soils all harbor Iron(II). Iron(III) is very common wherever oxygen is present, which nearly all of the surface and deep ocean, nearly every river and lake, and nearly all the surface soils on all the continents.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notably, Iron(III) forms when Iron(II) encounters oxygen. More specifically, this fast and spontaneous reaction between Iron(II) and oxygen forms Iron(III) oxides, which are commonly known as \"rust\".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Humans typically don't think highly of rust. We associate it with the decay of our bridges, cars, and other objects. Rust is also problematic for the many organisms that need Iron for their enzymes.

On early Earth, before there was lots of oxygen in our atmosphere, there was an abundance of Iron (II) that microbes could use as a \"fuel\" source.

However, we also find them in areas where there is seemingly plenty of oxygen, and we do not yet know how they manage to \"make a living\". This project was aimed at understanding how iron-oxidizing bacteria (which we will call FeOB for short, as the letters \"Fe\" represent Iron on the periodic table of elements) compete with these spontaneous processes. We hypothesized that FeOB might somehow manage to control the oxygen in their environment, allowing them to better compete for Iron(II). We conducted a broad series of studies that revealed that they do, indeed, manage to influence the oxygen concentration around their Iron sources. They do this by forming a layer of polysaccharides, which is kind of like the mucus in the human nose. It covers the Iron(II) minerals and somehow keeps oxygen from accessing them.&nbsp;Also, FeOBs seems to use some tricks like changing the pH (activity) so that they can access Iron in ways that other organisms can't.</p>\n<p>These studies were important for helping us understand how these organisms make a living on a well-oxygenated Earth.
