 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data science techniques have revolutionized many academic fields and led to terrific gains in the commercial sector. They have to date been underutilized in solving critical problems in the US educational system, particularly in understanding Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) learning and learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and increasing retention for students traditionally underserved in STEM. The goals of the Directorate for Education and Human Resources through the Critical Techniques and Technologies for Advancing Foundations and Applications of Big Data Science & Engineering (BIGDATA) program are to advance fundamental understanding of key questions in the field, and catalyze the use of data science in Education Research. Computing has become an integral part of the practice of in modern science, technology engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. As a result, the STEM+Computing Partnership (STEM+C) program seeks to integrate the use of computational approaches in STEM teaching and learning and understand how this integration can improve STEM learning, engagement, and persistence. In this proposal, the Principal Investigators (PIs) will examine environments that many people engage in independently to learn computing, online communities and massive open online courses (MOOCs). This activity could be very compelling as people come to these environments because they have personal goals to learn the material. However, a challenge in these environments is that there is little support for learning. In addition, these environments are not adaptive to learners' needs. This project will tackle both of these challenges. The PIs will first characterize groups of learners to understand their needs and then design approaches to personalizing the environments based on those needs.\r\n\r\nThe PIs address a need for both learning and independent online work communities by providing a combined learning work community. Many authentic production communitites, such as GitHub, do not provide support for novices who want to learn to contribute. Similarly many learning communities, such as MOOCs and other online learning environments, do not provide outlets for learners' products to become authentic. The PIs will combine data from MOOCs and online communities to discover groups of participants who behave in similar ways and investigate how to support the needs of these groups. This will lead to the proposed novel combined learning and work community that both provides support and offers authentic outlets for work products that are valued beyond a particular course.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research was motivated by the observation that despite the tremendous potential, the massive resource in crowd power of the world wide web comes with equally great challenges.  Decades of research studying the inner workings of online communities, whether focused on learning, work or a hybrid of the two, has revealed that a careful balance of exploration, consensus building, and coordination do not occur naturally without support.  \n\nThis project brought together leading researchers in the areas of Language Technologies, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Cooperative Work, Computer Supported Collaborative Learning, and Education to attack this problem with a multidisciplinary three pronged approach. The three components of the work included: (1) Laying a foundation in a versatile computing infrastructure to enable transforming the confluence of data streams into a usable and sometimes sharable format (and this infrastructure lives on through the LearnSpeher.org website); (2) Building computational models of web-scale interaction data to inform development of design principles that can be applied at web scale to communities and smaller online gatherings in order to improve what can be offered for the purpose of on boarding, participation, productivity, and mentoring (and these principles are continuing to be developed and used in ongoing research beyond this grant); and (3) Applying developed technology to gain visibility into the inner workings of social systems on the internet (and this work is continuing even beyond the orginal envisioned scope, including research contributing insights related to monitoring information sharing in COVID 19).\n\nResearch conducted under this grant produced 20 peer reviewed publications spanning diverse areas of work and learning including software development, creative writing, political debate, and core aspects of social identity, especially related to diversity and inclusivity.  In addition to research contributing to the movement of Massive Open Online Courses, the research of this grant contributes to ongoing courses on several university-based and community-college based platforms where interventions signiicantly improve the quality of learning and interaction between students.
