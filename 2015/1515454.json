 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coral reef health has declined worldwide in recent decades, in large part due to changing environmental conditions.  However, these trends lack long historical context.  Coral-based reconstructions of past ocean conditions can help researchers anticipate how reefs will respond to ongoing stressors, such as warming and acidifying oceans.  Three approaches--geochemical, growth banding, and luminescence--are often used to generate these climate records, but are rarely used together.  Combining these methods reconstructs both past environmental change and coral growth.  This project will generate luminescence and growth banding records on three coral cores in collaboration with Dr. Janice Lough at the Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS), which will supplement existing geochemical measurements.  This work will produce a novel record of both environmental conditions and their effects on coral health.\r\n\r\nThree coral cores have already undergone geochemical analyses, both of stable isotopes (delta-18-O and delta-13-C) and elemental ratios (Sr/Ca).  These measurements correspond to changes in seawater temperature and salinity.  At AIMS, luminescent bands will be used to track changes in terrestrial runoff, and coral growth will be measured by three parameters (extension, density, and calcification rate).  In conjunction, these methods record changes in ocean temperature, salinity, and runoff, and their effects on coral growth rate.  This project establishes a methodological basis for future, multi-century records. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.",
