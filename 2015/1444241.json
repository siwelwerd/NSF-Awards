 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1\r\n\r\nRecently, an improvement to the well-established Traditional Specular Meteor Radar technique has been proposed with remarkable potential for both new and improved geophysical science data. The Multistatic Specular Meteor Radar (MSMR) utilizes a networked array of receivers distributed over a geographic area. Specular meteor trail scatter originating from a single transmitter is observed at the various geographic locations enabling a dramatic increase in both the temporal and spatial resolution of the measured wind field. The activities proposed in this project include a workshop focused on the potential of this emerging technique for conducting new scientific studies on topics of meteor radar hardware, data analysis, atmospheric dynamics and meteor and plasma physics to discuss and vet the most promising MSMR science motivations and develop a plan for moving the technique forward.\r\nUntil recently it was not possible to geographically separate the transmit and receive systems because very accurate (1 part in 100 million) frequency accuracy is required to measure the wind.  With the advent of precision GPS oscillators it is now possible to geographically separate the receiver and transmitter and still have the capability to determine the winds.  This advance has enabled the evolution of the Multistatic Specular Meteor Radar technique, which utilizes a single transmitter and an array of receivers distributed over a large geographic area.  The data collected from this array provides a diversity of measurements that are not possible with the classical approach.  As such this new measurement technique will create an opportunity to enable new scientific measurements and push the boundary of scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nPart 2\r\n\r\nHundreds of thousands of meteoroids enter the upper atmosphere each day.  Travelling at 7km/s or faster nearly all of these meteoroids ablate in the lower thermosphere leaving a dense trail of electrons and ions for a short period of time.  Very High Frequency (VHF) radio waves can be scattered from these plasma trails to probe the structure of the lower thermosphere.  Parameters such as the horizontal wind velocity and the ambipolar diffusion coefficient can be extracted from these observations.  The classical approach for observing meteors has been to use a monostatic meteor radar with a co-located transmitter and receiver.  Recently improvements to the well-established traditional specular meteor radar technique has been proposed with remarkable potential for both new and improved geophysical science data.  The Multistatic Specular Meteor Radar (MSMR) technique utilizes a networked array of receivers distributed over a geographic area of 40,000 square kilometers.   Specular meteor trail scatter illuminated from an from single transmitter can be observed at various receiver locations enabling a dramatic increase in both the temporal and spatial resolution of the measured geophysical parameters.\r\nThe proposed workshop will include a panel of experts on topics of meteor radar hardware, data analysis, atmospheric dynamics and meteor and plasma physics to discuss and vet the most promising MSMR science motivations and develop a plan for moving the technique forward.  The second part of the project includes analysis of data from a proof-of-concept campaign using a software controled radar developed under the PI's NSF-CAREER grant.  The collaboration will be established between the radar remote sensing groups at the University of Colorado, Boulder (UCB) and the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) in Kuhlungsborn, Germany.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHundreds of thousands of meteoroids enter the upper atmosphere each day.  Travelling at orbital velocities of 15,000 mph or faster nearly all of these meteoroids \"burn-up\" in the upper atmosphere, approximately 60 miles above the surface of the earth.  During this intense period of intense heating as the meteoroids enter the earth?s atmosphere an optical signature is created that is often referred to as a \"shooting star\".  In addition to this optical signature a trail of electrons is created in the wake of the meteoroid.  Using radar operating at frequencies below 50MHz, note that 54MHz is the frequency of channel 2 on the broadcast television network, a very weak signal will be reflected from these meteor trails that can be observed by a sensitive receiver.  Through a careful and complex analysis of this data, parameters of the atmosphere near an altitude of 62 miles can be measured.  Such parameters include the wind that is blowing at these altitudes.\n\nClassical meteor radar techniques have used the monostatic radar configuration where the same co-located antenna system is used to both transmit and receive the signals of interest.  Until recently it was not possible to geographically separate the transmit and receive systems because very accurate (1 part in 100 million) frequency accuracy is required to measure the wind.  With the advent of precision GPS oscillators it is now possible to geographically separate the receiver and transmitter and still have the capability to determine the winds.  This advance has enabled the evolution of the Multistatic Specular Meteor Radar (MSMR) technique which utilizes a single transmitter and an array of receivers distributed over a large geographic area.  The data collected from this array provides a diversity of measurements that are not possible with the classical approach.  As such this new measurement technique will create an opportunity to enable new scientific measurements and push the boundary of scientific discovery.\n\nThe activities supported as part of this project included a student exchange where a University of Colorado PhD student spent 3 months working in Germany and a workshop focused on the potential of this emerging technique for conducting new scienti?c studies.  The PhD student spent Fall 2016 in Kuhlungsborn, Germany working closely with staff at the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) developing a novel new processing technique to more accurate determine winds in the upper atmosphere using the meteor radar technique. The technique is being implemented on currently operating meteor radar systems and a research paper on the approach will be submitted in early 2017.\n\nThe Multistatic Meteor Radar workshop was held at the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP) in Kuhlungsborn, Germany an included 11 US participants and 20 international participants who are working on the development of the MSMR technique.  Of the 31 participants, 5 were students (2 from the US and 3 European).  The workshop included a panel of experts on topics of meteor radar hardware, data analysis, atmospheric dynamics and meteor and plasma physics to discuss and vet the most promising MSMR science motivations and discussed a plan for moving the technique forward.  The workshop provided an opportunity for researchers and students to build international relationships that will enable future collaborative projects.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/05/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott E Palo"
