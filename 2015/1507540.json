 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical:\r\n\r\nThis award will develop new methods to identify specific genetic profiles in diseased tissues and subsequently release \"personalized\" drug cocktails or diagnostic molecules only within the targeted tissues.  One way to locate and treat diseased tissues is by injecting drug-containing nanoparticles that will circulate through the body until they come into contact with diseased cells.  Nanoparticles can be designed to fall apart inside of cells and release encapsulated drugs; however, to protect healthy cells from receiving the drug, it is necessary to design nanoparticles that only fall apart in diseased cells.  This research will design and produce polymer nanoparticles linked together by DNA \"duplexes\" whose sequences are partially complementary.  The duplexes will be designed to unbind only in the presence of a fully complementary strand of DNA or RNA, leading to the disassembly of the nanoparticles and the release of any encapsulated compounds.  The PIs will produce DNA-linked nanoparticles designed to disassemble in the presence of breast cancer-specific RNA molecules, and will test whether these nanoparticles will selectively release model drugs (dyes) only within cancer cells.  Educational efforts, internships and workshops are aimed at increasing participation and enrollment of underrepresented students in research activities at the University of Delaware.\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\n\r\nThis research addresses the National Academy of Engineering's Grand Challenge to engineer better medicines by developing new approaches that will ultimately allow rapid assessment of the genetic profiles in patients and the release of personalized drug cocktails.  The PIs approach is to incorporate DNA \"strand displacement\" biosensing designs within polymer nanocarriers such that the DNA interface controls nanocarrier stability.  Recognition of specific RNA or DNA sequences will result in a strand displacement reaction that destabilizes the nanocarrier and allows the release of encapsulated drugs or diagnostics.  The major milestones in this work include the design of DNA strand displacement designs sensitive to breast cancer-specific RNAs; incorporation of these DNA duplexes within block polymer micelles; establishment of the specificity and efficacy of RNA-mediated nanocarrier disassembly; addition of cancer cell-targeting peptides on the surface of the nanocarriers; and establishment of selective cellular uptake and efficient cargo (dye) release in breast cancer cells.  Educational activities will include high school internships, graduate recruitment workshops, and mentoring efforts targeted at underrepresented groups, facilitated through the PIs involvement in programs including ACS SEED, SWE, Women in Engineering, and the ACS Scholars Program.",

These nanoparticles are useful as drug delivery vehicles because they can encapsulate, protect, and deliver special RNA molecules that are designed to act as medicines, such as short interfering RNAs (siRNAs). Because the nanoparticles only fall apart and release siRNAs when they are exposed to particular light wavelengths, it is possible to control where (in the body) the siRNA gets delivered, how much siRNA gets delivered, and how frequently the siRNA is dosed: useful attributes for maximizing efficacy in siRNA medicines. In addition to designing these 'responsive' siRNA delivery vehicles, we also created a computational model that was able to accurately predict how different siRNA dosing schedules affected the cellular response to the siRNAs. Notably, our model was able to predict the cellular response to siRNA not only in our own experiments, but also in retrospective analyses of siRNA delivery data reported in literature. The model reliably captured dosing variations and predicted cellular 'gene silencing' responses in both simple models (cells only) and animal models - a key advance with important implications extending beyond our own work.</p>\n<p>We had three original objectives. The first objective was to design a reliable method to 'cleave' (break apart) polymers within polymer nanoparticles. We tested both DNA molecules and light for their ability to trigger polymer cleavage, and identified light as the more effective trigger. The second objective was to test how cleaving the polymers affected the stability of the nanoparticles. We determined how much polymer cleavage was necessary to trigger the nanoparticles to fall apart and release the siRNA. The third objective was to create polymer nanoparticles that could release two doses of siRNA. We incorporated multiple layers of cleavable polymers and showed that varying the stability of the polymers in the two layers resulted in an ability to deliver two doses. Finally, we created a predictive computational model to that predicted the efficacy of our nanoparticles and to establish a framework for making dosing efficacy predictions.</p>\n<p>We synthesized polymers containing two connected parts, or 'blocks.' One block was made of polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the other block was made of poly(5-(3-(amino)propoxy)-2-nitrobenzyl methacrylate)) [P(APNBMA)]. The PEG-P(APNBMA) block polymers formed biocompatible and stable nanoparticles containing siRNA that were readily internalized by metastatic breast cancer cells. Exposure to light stimulated the polymers to cleave, which in turn triggered the nanoparticles to fall apart and release the siRNAs. We also modified the nanoparticles so that they would release multiple doses of siRNA upon repeated exposure to light. To do this, we created onion-like layers on the nanoparticles using a technique called Layer-by-Layer (LbL) assembly, and we showed that exposure to light enabled first the outer layer, and then the inner layer, to fall off and release siRNA (<strong>Fig. 1</strong>). Finally, we designed a computational model that accurately predicted siRNA-mediated gene silencing. Our model identified the fundamental parameters governing gene silencing in various cellular models (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>).<sup>1</sup> Moreover, our model predictions were in excellent agreement with both <em>in vitro </em>and <em>in vivo </em>(<strong>Fig. 3</strong>) experimental results across a retrospective analysis spanning a wide range of literature.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>The intellectual merits of our work are the new understanding it provided regarding how to control the delivery and dosing of siRNAs using a 'stimulus-responsive' nanoparticle design, as well as how to extend the design of these 'responsive' nanoparticles via LbL techniques that permitted multiple doses of siRNA to be delivered in sequence. Additionally, this project uncovered new information regarding how different dosing schedules affect the duration and extent of siRNA activity within cells (e.g., gene silencing). The broad impacts of these studies include both the long-term implications for cancer therapeutics, for which better strategies to control dosing are essential; and immediate implications regarding fundamental understanding of how siRNA dosing affects gene silencing outcomes, enabled by our simple and accurate computational model.</p>\n<p class=\"EndNoteBibliography\">1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roh EH, Epps TH, Sullivan MO.
