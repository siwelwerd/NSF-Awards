 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports the participation of U.S. based early career scientists in the quadrennial Gordon Research Conference on Ocean Modeling and its associated Gordon Research Seminar. This conference brings together a diverse group of academic, federal and international researchers to share the latest advances and identify new challenges in coastal ocean modeling. The conference focuses on novel and recent developments in the application of numerical modeling and simulation to furthering understanding of coastal ocean processes and our capabilities for their prediction. It is at the coast that human activities are most connected with ocean circulation, and ocean modeling offers great promise for connecting scientific research to societal needs through such efforts as forecasting for marine operations and maritime safety, monitoring and prediction of water quality and the transport and dispersal of water borne pathogens, mapping and characterizing the habitats of marine life, and downscaling global models of climate variability and climatic change to infer their impacts in the coastal zone. The most important broader impact of the conference is the establishment and nurturing of relationships between senior researchers, junior researchers and students. Nearly half of the conference time is allocated to informal interactions among participants, to provide numerous opportunities to build these relationships and exchange ideas among people in different age groups, different sub-disciplines of the field, or from different geographic regions. Funds will be used to expand the demographic, professional and geographic diversity of participants by supporting attendance by under-represented and under-resourced groups who stand to benefit from the intellectual environment and networking opportunities of the Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar formats.\r\n\r\nThis project provides funding for travel and registration support to U.S. based early-career professionals and students to attend the Gordon Research Conference on Coastal Ocean Modeling which will be held at the University of New England in Biddeford, Maine, from June 7-12, 2015. The Ocean Modeling conference series highlights the latest research and future trends and recent developments in the application of numerical modeling and simulation to furthering understanding of coastal ocean processes and our capabilities for their prediction. Here the term \"coastal\" refers to estuarine, littoral zone, continental shelf, and shelf-break regions, including mesoscale exchange processes with the adjacent deep-ocean or marginal seas.  The topics to be covered are:  Boundary layer dynamics, Near-shore and estuarine processes, Ice shelf-sea-ice modeling, Physics and ecosystem interactions, Climate change in the coastal ocean, Sub-mesoscale processes and internal waves, Advanced numerical methods, State estimation and data assimilation, and Probabilistic approaches and risk assessment. The project also supports the inaugural Ocean Modeling Gordon Research Seminar to be held June 6-7 in conjunction with the Ocean Modeling Gordon Research Conference. The seminar, designed for graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and other scientists with comparable levels of experience and education, emphasizes the presentation of cutting edge science and includes scheduled discussion time to foster collegial conversations.",
