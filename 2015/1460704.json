Students will be recruited primarily from schools that cannot provide them with opportunities for STEM research and will focus on promoting a vibrant, top-notch research culture by showcasing meritorious local scientists while strengthening partnerships with world-class research institutions.  REU programs, in general, are designed to advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning through hands on research and educational experiences for undergraduates.  The RMSM REU program will continue fostering this legacy and will help students to strengthen their scientific communication skills through a series of seminars that focus on professional development.  They will have the opportunity to learn a second language and immerse themselves in a different culture, while participating in exciting research.  Finally, the participants will help to broaden dissemination to the next generation of researchers through participation in the UPRM Science on Wheels program and :\"Ciencia Puerto Rico\" website.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL PART:  The RMSM REU will contribute to the pool of underrepresented scientists, inspiring young students to enter disciplines with transformative potential, such as finding methods to develop smart soft materials for new consumer products and biomedical applications.  Students will conduct individual research projects in the development and characterization of soft materials and their ability to respond away from equilibrium.  Knowledge in this area will open doors in a broad range of scientific disciplines, which encompass the major challenges in the development of novel materials.  The chosen projects are relevant to ongoing research at UPRM yet were selected because they are suitable for an REU participant to make unique contributions during a summer session.",
