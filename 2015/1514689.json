 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the research program of the Principal Investigator in the area of pattern formation in block copolymer systems.  Block copolymers are molecular structures formed by bonding together two or more different polymers.  Incompatibilities between different blocks lead to a variety of patterns and organization on nanoscopic scales, which in turn leads to a number of different material properties.  This project builds and studies theoretical models for the assembly of block copolymers into a variety of microscopic architectures.  This will lead in turn to the development of formulas that connect molecular properties of polymers to mechanical and morphological behaviors at a larger scale, which will allow prediction and engineering of new materials formed from patterned copolymer phases and aggregates.  There are a number of nanoscale fabrication and biotechnological applications of this approach, including nanolithography, photonics, electronic storage systems, molecular-sized machines, controlled drug delivery, and synthetic biological structures.\r\n\r\nDefect evolution of bulk copolymer phases and orientational ordering is studied in the context of computations performed with reduced dimensional models for hexagonal and lamellar geometries.  The effects of external fields will also be incorporated into this model-reduction framework.  Copolymer aggregates such as micelles and vesicles will be studied using analytic techniques for stability and bifurcation, as well as large scale numerical simulation.   Models for amphiphilic bilayers and heterogeneous membranes will also be constructed and analyzed in a similar framework.  The project will broadly impact experimental investigations and the design of manufacturing processes, as well as provide educational opportunities for graduate and postdoctoral researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBlock copolymers (BCP) are materials which assemble spontaneously into a variety of nano-scale sized structures which may be used for controlled drug delivery, synthetic biological tissue, molecular-sized machines and many other high-tech applications.  While considerable experimental knowledge of their behavior has emerged recently, a theoretical understanding is also necessary for engineering design and prediction of novel features.  This project sought to advance theoretical understanding through mathematical and computational studies.\n\nModels in the form of partial differential equations form the basis for this project's study of block copolymers materials.  Both explicit and approximate solutions were developed, which provided a link between molecular properties and overall morphology.  This allowed for investigations of the microscopic patterns and pattern defects which these materials create, and their interaction behavior in a large-scale environment.\n\nElectric fields may be used to guide the assembly of BCP structures.  Their influence on pattern stability and alignment was investigated both computationally and analytically.  It was found that fields may either stabilize or destabilize certain alignment directions, as well as modulate the size of structural features.\n\nModels were extended to include amphiphilic BCP systems, which are analogous to biological ones which create membranes and other inter-cellular structures.  A comprehensive connection was established between the geometry of such structures and molecular properties.  This allowed for a precise comparison to experimental data and demonstrated the pathways to formation of complex architectures from simpler ones (see figure).\n\nFast and reliable computational methods were developed in this project.  These are applicable not only to the models under study, but a more vast collection of theoretical models used throughout materials science. \n\nA better theoretical understanding of BCP self assembly will help guide experimentalists searching for novel materials.  More broadly, results from this project may be applicable to bio-engineering and manufacturing, and useful in studies of other physical pattern forming systems.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/25/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karl B Glasner"
