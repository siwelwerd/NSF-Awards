 "awd_abstract_narration": "The primary goal of this project is to develop a mathematical foundation underlying the analysis of modern cryptosystems. Cryptography is a core tool used to secure communications over the Internet.  Secure and trustworthy communications and data storage are essential to national security and to the functioning of the world economy.  Recent spectacular research results have enabled the development of new types of cryptography, exciting new potential applications, and hopes for stronger guarantees of cryptographic security in the long term.  This project aims to increase confidence in these new constructions by unifying new methods from mathematics with cryptographic tools.\r\n\r\nNearly all of public-key cryptography relies for its security on the assumed difficulty of solving various number theoretic problems. Recent developments in cryptography such as fully homomorphic encryption, candidate multilinear maps, and efficient post-quantum lattice-based cryptography have produced a multitude of new algebraicand number-theoretic cryptographic hardness assumptions.   Many of these problems are new and largely unstudied by the computational number theory community.   This project uses tools from arithmetic geometry such as capacity theory and Arakelov theory to develop a more rigorous understanding of the theoretical and computational limits to the fundamental cryptanalytic techniques used to assure cryptographic security.  This project will improve the numerical and theoretical tools used in cryptanalysis, and promote a better understanding of the security of many practical cryptosystems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSecure cryptography is essential to modern life.  As the ability to connect people and institutions digitally grows, so does the risk that bad actors will exploit non-secure communication channels. \n\nThe security of modern cryptography depends on the expected difficulty of solving various mathematical problems.  In the 1990's, D. Coppersmith developed a new attack on one such problem, that of finding small solutions of polynomial congruences.  It was an open problem for 20 years to determine the limits of Coppersmith's method in the one variable case. \n\nThe first result of this project was to show that for one variable polynomial congruences there is in fact a hard limit to improving Coppersmith's method.  This solved the above problem.  The limit arises from the fact that there are too many solutions over the ring of all algebraic integers for the parameters of the method to be improved beyond a certain value.  A useful analogy is that Coppersmith's method is comparable to a sophisticated kind of fishing tackle for catching a particular species of fish.  If one tries to use this gear below a certain depth, one finds an infinite number of such fish, and these would simply sink one's boat if caught. \n\nThe proof of the above result used one variable capacity theory.  This subject originated in the classical theory of how electric charges distribute themselves to minimize potential energy when they are constrained to lie on a particular object.  A surprising discovery by Fekete, Szego and others was that this subject applies to the roots of monic polynomials with integer coefficients that have all their roots in a particular set.  In some sense, the roots behave like charges that repel one another.  In terms of the above fishing analogy, we are dealing with electric fish that repel one another.  We are are trying to find how many such fish can be caught by a net of a particular size.  Using a descendant of Fekete and Szego's work due to Cantor and Rumely, we showed there are simply too many polynomials of the above kind for Coppersmith's method to be improved beyond a particular bound. \n\nThe second main result of this project concerned applying Coppersmith's method to find small solutions of linear two variable polynomial congruences.  This is a much deeper problem than the one variable case.  Our main result showed that a heuristic assumption that had been proposed in the literature on this subject is not in fact always true.  This assumption amounted to the expectation that once one found one useful auxiliary function, there would always be a second one of approximately the same size which could be used to complete Coppersmith's approach to finding all small solutions.  We proved that given one auxiliary function, there is a particular capacity one can compute in order to determine if the required second function exists.  In terms of the above fishing analogy, one has to catch two fish of different species because there are two variables.  From the first fish one catches one can tell if there will be a second one in the same general area.  We showed that in a positive proportion of cases, there will be a second function, and in a different positive proportion of cases there will be no such second function.  This led to a new method for bounding the total number of sufficiently small solutions of two variable linear polynomial congruences.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ted C Chinburg"
