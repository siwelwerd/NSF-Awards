 "awd_abstract_narration": "Questions about properties of positive integers, especially the way in which integers factor and the distribution of prime numbers, have fascinated people for thousands of years and have recently found applications in computer science, information security, and signal processing. This proposal concerns several projects in the theory of numbers, emphasizing connections with other areas of mathematics such as Probability and Combinatorics.  The principal investigator was part of a team that made a recent large breakthrough on the distribution of gaps between prime numbers, and further investigations will be made along these lines, together with additional problems about primes and combinatorial objects arising from our techniques. The principal investigator will also continue work on counting integral solutions of certain types of systems of equations, number theoretic functions, and the Riemann zeta function.\r\n\r\nThis research concerns several projects in the theory of numbers. The first concerns accurately counting the integer solutions of certain special types of systems of Diophantine equations that are multidimensional analogs of Vinogradov's system.  The chief goal is to obtain near best possible upper bounds for the number of solutions of such systems, for a large class of such systems.  The second major project is to improve lower bounds for large gaps between prime numbers and chains of consecutive gaps between primes, and gain more information about the integers within such gaps.  The principal investigator will also investigate related problems about the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions to large moduli and the efficiency of hypergraph coverings, both important tools in research on prime gaps. Further projects include refining the counting function of distinct values taken by Carmichael's function, and studying the distribution modulo 1 of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIntellectual merit\n\nThe PI made significant breakthroughs in number theory while supported on this grant.  Together with Ben Green, Sergei Konyagin, James Maynard and Terence Tao, he established the existence of gaps between consecutive prime numbers larger than those previously known to exist.  With Sergei Konyagin, James Maynard, Carl Pomerance and Terence Tao, he established the existence of large gaps in very general sequences of integers which are significantly larger than those previously known.  With Ben Green and Dimitris Koukoulopoulos, he developed a new approach to studying the concentration of divisors of integers.  With Adam Harper and Youness Lamzouri, he established the existence of large inequities in the distribution of primes in arithmetic progressions.  \n\nThe PI also made fundamental discoveries concerning random permutations, in joint work with Sean Eberhard, Ben Green and Dimitrios Koukoulopoulos.  In particular, we estimated precisely how often a random permutation on N letters has a fixed set of size K, uniformly over the parameters N and K.  This theory was applied to various problems in the theory of mathematical groups, such as the theory of transitive groups and the problem of invariable generation of the symmetric group.\n\nThe PI also made significant contributions to the theory of product sets, to the divisors of numbers p-1 with p being a prime, and to the theory of q-th power residues modulo primes (with Moubariz Garaev and Sergei Konyagin).\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe research of four graduate students were supported by Research Assistantships on this grant and gained valuable research experience.  Xianchang Meng worked on projects about the distribution of gaps between zeros of the Riemann zeta function, the distribution of k-free numbers and the distribution in arithmetic progressions of integers with a given number of prime factors.  Junxian Li, Kyle Pratt and George Shakan completed a paper about the distribution of prime numbers in arithmetic progressions.  George Shakan also completed projects about the distribution of sums and products from arbitrary sets.  Kyle Pratt completed papers about prime numbers of special forms and about the distribution of L-functions used in number theory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/21/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin B Ford"
