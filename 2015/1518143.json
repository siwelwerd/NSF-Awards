Broader impacts of the work include research training of graduate students.  The proposers will directly impact their local community by volunteering in a local high school physics classroom, assisting with lab activities, delivering lectures, and leading interactive demonstrations using state-of-the-art equipment from Caltech. \r\n\r\nThe research work will quantify the expected science reach possible with kSZ measurements, and will characterize the impact of astrophysical and instrumental systematics on estimations of cosmological parameters, dark energy, and large scale structure.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGalaxy clusters -- collections of hundreds to thousands of galaxies, the largest collapsed objects in the universe -- are unique in many ways because of their size.  One consequence of their size is that most of the normal matter that falls in is heated up to 100 million degrees C, causing the atoms to separate into electrons and ions and for that plasma to shine brightly in X-rays.  The plasma offers a unique tool for studying clusters and the universe, too: the cosmic microwave background (CMB), the backlight from the hot early universe, is scattered by the electrons in the plasma.  One aspect of this scattering is that it includes a \"Doppler shift\" effect -- the same effect that causes a siren to change pitch if it is moving toward or away from you.  In this case, the spectrum of the CMB is modified by the motion of the plasma.  This Doppler shift, termed the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect after the two theorists who predicted it, has only been seen explicitly in the past few years.  It now presents two exciting opportunities for new cosmological observations.\n\nThe first is to measure the motion of the plasma inside of clusters.  When clusters form and accrete new matter, that matter retains some of the motion it had when it fell in.  The plasma also suffers \"turbulence\", motions on all scales that both prevent the plasma from gravitationally collapsing and also dissipate large scale motion as heat on small scales.  Both of these kinds of motions can be observed using the kSZ effect, and they will help us to understand how these most massive objects in the universe formed and evolve.\n\nThe second is to use the kSZ effect to measure the overall motion of the galaxy clusters.  If this measurement could be made for thousands of clusters, it would provide a new way to test whether the cosmic acceleration we observe today is due to a new kind of energy density in the universe -- dark energy -- or to deviations from the accepted theory of gravity on large scales, general relativity.  In either case, it can help us to understand what new physics gives rise to cosmic acceleration.\n\nNot only are these observations very challenging from a purely instrumental perspective -- one must build very sensitive instruments and field them on large telescopes -- but there are many interfering astronomical effects.  \n\nThe kSZ is observed in the presence of a larger effect, the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) effect, which tells us about the pressure in the plasma.  Small instrumental errors can cause some of the tSZ effect to \"leak into\" the kSZ effect, creating a fake signal.  It also difficult to pull apart the three physical parameters -- plasma density, temperature, and motion -- that determine the two effects.  Our project fully characterized this \"degeneracy\" and determined that, if the temperature can be measured in another manner to 5% (10%) precision (very possible with upcoming missions), then the density and motion can be determined to 5% (10%) and 10% (20%) precision, respectively.  That is, the degeneracy is not fatal for the measurement, but other measurements are needed.\nThe kSZ effect must also be observed in the presence of spatial variation of the CMB, from which it is spectrally indistinguishable.  Fortunately, the two signals have very different spatial dependences, providing some hope of separating them.  The project has included the effect of these CMB fluctuations but has not yet determined their impact.\nThe kSZ effect is also contaminated by the presence of galaxies: galaxies that have a lot of dust and so are bright at high frequencies (&lt; 1 mm wavelength); both behind and inside the cluster), and galaxies that have had a lot of supernovae due to dying stars and so are bright at radio frequencies (cm wavelength).  The project has included the effect of these galaxies and is also seeking to determine their impact.  An important aspect of these galaxies is that, if they are behind the cluster, they may be gravitationally lensed by it, causing their apparent positions to shift and their brightness to increase.  We have included this complex effect.\n\n\nThe award funded the development of a simulation/forecasting computer software package that has included the above effects.  Though the award has finished, it laid an important foundation that continues to be built on so that the desired forecasts of measurements of cluster plasma motion can be made.\n\nThis award supported a graduate student during his first 2.5 years of graduate study.  That student has now won a NASA fellowship and is able to continue the work.  The project has also engendered collaborations with scientists in Italy, France, and at other institutions in the US, and has attracted a Prize postdoctoral fellow to Caltech.\n\nSee Figures 1 and 2. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/19/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sunil R Golwala"
