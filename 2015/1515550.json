 "awd_abstract_narration": "In concert with the overall strategy of the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments, Principal Investigators from Oregon State University, University of Idaho, and University of Texas at Dallas, will study a range of data in online social networks to identify evidence of the long-term impact of informal STEM education. Tracking informal learners over time to understand the impact of informal learning experiences has been a longstanding, daunting, and elusive challenge. Now, with massive amounts of data being shared and stored online, education researchers have an unprecedented opportunity to study such data and apply data analytics and visualization technologies to identify the long-term, cascading effects of informal STEM learning. Research findings will inform the design and development of a data-analysis tool for use by education practitioners to improve STEM learning experiences online, through television and film, and at informal education institutions. An independent external critical review board of learning scientists, computer scientists, engineers, informal STEM education practitioners, participating partners, broadcast media professionals, and policymakers, will ensure a robust evaluation of the research and effectiveness and utility of the data analysis tool to improve practice. A summary report for the field will be written on the scientific and practical reliability and validity of the research and data-analysis model, and the value of the work for audiences beyond informal STEM education practitioners and policymakers. \r\n\r\nThe research is contemporaneously relevant, advancing innovative use of data-mining and data-analysis processes to better understand how informal learners communicate STEM learning experiences and interact with STEM content over time, across a range of social networks. Investigators will research: 1) whether learners who engage in informal STEM education experiences further their learning through discussions and sharing of information in social media networks, 2) which types of data are present in social media that are relevant for understanding the cascading impacts of learning over time, and 3) how learning may evolve independently within shared social networks, which, if discovered, could provide a predictive computational model with implications for significant impact across both formal and informal education. Investigators will employ existing and modified data crawlers to search for key terms and phrases, assess spikes and deformations in posts, queries, and blogs, and experiment with their test data to find which types or configurations of keywords or search terms deliver the most reliable and accurate results. A variety of formats will be explored to test various strategies with participating partners and practitioners. Data will be visualized to represent the following dimensions of learning: a) Interest/Affect, b) Recommendations, c) Understanding/Knowledge-Seeking, and d) Deeper Engagement.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nScience educators invest their time, effort and expertise creating experiences that catalyze the long-term transformation of the learner; striving to build the interest and tools necessary for individuals to pursue a \"cascade\" of experiences subsequent to the initial educational event. Although a laudable goal most efforts to measure whether or not any particular educational experience sets off long-term cascades of additional learning experiences has proven challenging. This Pathways Cascading Experiences project was an effort to explore the potential of using Big Data as a strategy for providing direct measures of the effects engendered by informal science education (ISE) experiences, with the ultimate goal being the creation of a tool that would afford ISE educators with new and improved insights about their practice. Specifically the main focus of the project was to build a web-based interface that could search for evidence of changes in the public?s Google searches, Facebook or Twitter posts or other digital indicators of short- and long-term effects following an ISE event such as the opening of a science museum exhibition or airing of a science-related television show.\n\nThe model was based on the assumption that every ISE experience/event leaves a detectable digital trail by virtue of its unique content; content that is traceable through a set of readily identifiable \"key words\" specific to that event. Using this approach, we developed a model, using simulated data, capable of answering a wide range of practitioner-generated questions related to the long-term effects of ISE experiences.  The resulting model, called TrendSpy, includes two hypothetical ISE experiences and a variety of queries: http://xin.nkn.uidaho.edu:8084/TrendSpy/#/query.\n\nAlthough the TrendSpy model worked well on simulated data it could not be successfully tested using actual data sets from digital platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Google. Unfortunately, in the post-Eric Snowden era, each of these companies has created significant impediments to data access; only allowing access to partial or summarized data sets. Given the limited \"amplitude\" of the events we were trying to detect, these partial data sets were insufficient to allow a full testing of the model.  Although we do not believe that there are any serious or insurmountable theoretical or methodological flaws in our model, the regulatory realities of collecting Big Data in the second decade of the 21st century has made this approach to tracking and measuring the long-term cascading effects of ISE experiences presently untenable.\n\nIntellectual Merit:  The Big Data model we created demonstrated that the concept of using Big Data for tracking and measuring the long-term, cascading effects of ISE events was indeed possible and potentially highly valuable. At the time this proposal was submitted, there was unlimited public access to digital data such as Facebook and Twitter posts and Google searches.  However in the months and years following submission, legitimate concerns about privacy were raised which led to significant restrictions on public access to Big Data.  Without the ability to freely access full data sets from these Big Data platforms, the current model has proven to be of limited value.  However the insights gained from the development of this model highlight the need for further research in the area of Big Data micro-events; events that generate relatively low amplitude effects.  Current Big Data models are all predicated on high amplitude changes in information however many important and significant events, particularly in education, generate relatively modest changes; changes currently difficult to assess with current technologies.\n\nAn additional contribution of the project was the creation of a Whitepaper on issues and potential solutions to the challenges of measuring the long-term effects of informal science education experiences.\n\nBroader Impacts:         Although the Big Data mining and visual analytics tools and approaches developed as part of this project are not currently amenable to use in the broad public sphere they do have potential applications in more constrained, \"private\" education spheres, e.g., tracking effects within in a museum or school?s Facebook Friends list.  The underlying assumption that Big Data can be used to track cascading experiences is not unique to education but equally applies across a wide array of human behaviors, including health, law enforcement, environment and civic engagement.  Thus if the challenges of using existing Big Data sets to measure micro-, low granularity events can be overcome, then the modeling tools developed and insights gained from this research could potentially have broad application across a wide range of human settings and situations; basically anywhere practitioners wish to extend the impact of their efforts beyond the immediate influence of a short-term experience.   This remains particularly true within education. Likewise the Whitepaper created by this project, though focused on issues related to informal science education has the potential to inform thinking and research across all aspects of education, and potentially other topic areas as well; since the fundamental challenges of measure impact are the same in all areas.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John H Falk"
