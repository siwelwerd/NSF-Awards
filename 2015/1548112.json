 "awd_abstract_narration": "While there is much evidence that plants and animals are changing where they live in response to shifts in climate, it remains unclear how they do so and whether changes in one species affect those in other species.  Birds, for example, can move easily from one region to another, but the plants and insects they depend on for food cannot.  This project explores the possibility that birds may find suitable climatic conditions in a new area but be deterred from moving there because the plants and insects they typically feed on have not been able to move there.  Researchers in Maine will use DNA to measure the diets of birds in a broad area where one type of forest stops and another type begins. They will test two possible explanations for why some birds are expanding into one of the forest types where they did not occur previously, while others species appear stuck in one place and are experiencing declines.  The first explanation is that the type of food used by the birds is more available for the expanding species than for the declining species.  The second explanation is that there is a mismatch in timing between the when food becomes available and when the declining species start to breed.  Researchers will engage undergraduate students, citizen scientists, and public school children in the project; everyone will work together to collect data and to discover the links between birds, their food, and climate.\r\n \r\nThe insects and spiders consumed by birds within the boreal-deciduous ecotone will be identified using metabarcoding of 16S mitochondrial and cytochrome oxidase I genes.  Three groups of insectivorous forest birds will be sampled:  \"leading edge\" species (those that are expanding from a southern/deciduous range), \"trailing edge\" species (those that are declining and typically occur in boreal forest), and habitat generalists (those that occur more broadly across the region or habitat types).  Food availability and use will be assessed relative to both time (phenology) and place (habitat).  Life history, range, and behavioral characteristics of prey items will be used to compare the diets of the three bird groups.  Measures of food use will also be compared to timing of breeding and regional long-term population trends from the Breeding Bird Survey to examine possible effects of food availability and use on demography.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlant and animal species\u2019 distributions are not static, but have shifted over geological time with glacial cycles.  Recent climate change may be accelerating such northward species shifts.  While birds have high dispersal ability, the plants and invertebrates that comprise their suitable habitat and food source may be less responsive to potential climate-induced changes in species\u2019 distribution.  Nonetheless, there have been well documented changes in bird species range over the last several decades.  One species, Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) has expanded its northern range boundary from Connecticut to northern Maine in the last fifty years.  Conversely, range contraction of boreal bird species is occurring at the southern edge of ranges in northern Maine.  Thus, our overall objective was to increase understanding of species persistence, expansion, or contraction at an ecotone where two forest types (boreal and deciduous) intersect.  We focused on arthropod food resources used by birds during the breeding season by testing whether availability within habitat types or timing of food availability differed for birds in three groups.  Leading edge birds are those expanding northward, while trailing edge birds are those at the southern edge of their range, and ecotone generalists were those who occur broadly in a variety of habitat types.  We captured birds to collect fecal samples and surveyed arthropod food availability throughout the breeding season in several habitat types:  deciduous forest, mixed forest, coniferous forest, and bog.  Fecal samples were analyzed by metabarcoding using the cytochrome oxidase I (COI) region, which allowed us to identify species collected from the sample by comparison to a comprehensive database (http://www.boldsystems.org/) of known arthropod species.  With this information we were then able to create a database of arthropod characteristics in our samples to assess whether birds differed in their use of available species and their characteristics.  For example, some arthropods have single generations with many offspring (vs. multiple generations of fewer offspring) per year, and thus, may be more suited to some bird breeding habitats than others. \n\nOver three field seasons from 2016-2018, we collected 267 fecal samples from 40 species of breeding songbirds with a focus on cardinal, warblers, thrushes, and sparrows.  After conducting over 2,200 polymerase chain reactions (PCR) to amplify arthropod contents, we successfully amplified DNA in 255 (95.5%) of samples.  While analysis of the full dataset is ongoing, we conducted a preliminary analysis of 32 bird samples.  There were 115 species of arthropods total, with a range of 6-38 species per bird sampled (20.4).  The average number of arthropod species by habitat type was not different among boreal birds (22.4), deciduous birds (18.8), and generalists (20.2). The six orders with the highest percentage of arthropods included: Diptera (\u2018flies\u2019, 33%); Lepidoptera (\u2018moths and butterflies\u2019, 30.1%); Araneae (\u2018spiders\u2019, 11%); Coleoptera (\u2018beetles\u2019, 10.1%); Hemiptera (\u2018true bugs\u2019, 4.0%); Hymenoptera (\u2018ants, bees, wasps\u2019, 3.1%).  There were no significant differences in prey use by bird range type, but, there were significantly more generalist and boreal-dwelling arthropods versus deciduous in all bird samples.  Increasing our understanding of the interactions between forest habitat type and arthropod food availability and use by birds will apply more broadly to the ecotones that occur at biome transitions globally.\n\nBroader impacts of this research comprised mentoring of high school students, undergraduates, and informing other audiences.  Five high school students and 8 undergraduates who were involved with study design, arthropod sampling, bird sampling, DNA extraction, PCR, and purification, as well as data management and analysis.  These students included 10 females and 4 minorities.  Three high school students presented at the Maine Science Fair (and won second and third in the Animal Science division), and undergraduates presented at our \u2018University Day\u2019 research symposium, the Maine Biological and Medical Science Symposium, and an international ecology conference.  One senior thesis and department seminar was conducted, and this student graduated to pursue a master\u2019s in Ecology and Environmental Science.  Other graduates entered medical school, pursued a master\u2019s in molecular biology, and pursued employment in the Maine Forest Service.  One high school student entered a Biology undergraduate degree program.  Outreach to other audiences including a Facebook page (BirdsMovingNorth) that engaged mainly local citizens during the field seasons, presentations to high school science classes, invited talks to American Association of University Women, and a Hampton University Zoology class, and a STEM exploration day for 4-H youth that demonstrated bird mistnetting and taught students how to extract DNA.  One Maine-focused lesson plan was created to provide middle school teachers a local example to engage in required Maine Learning Results on ecosystems focused on bird habitat.  Research findings and products will continue to be shared on Johnston\u2019s website: (https://sites.google.com/maine.edu/jasonjohnston/home). \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason C Johnston"
