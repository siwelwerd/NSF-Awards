 "awd_abstract_narration": "At the present time there is a lack or absence of comprehensive offering of online/offline cybersecurity related exercise-based training and a certification program. Offering such a curriculum can have a broad impact on promoting cyber security education and practices across various organizations. This learning technology can have a significant impact on elevating the quality and the quantity of cyber security courses offered by two and four-year colleges and thus fosters an exponential increase in the number of nationally demanded cyber security professionals. This I-Corps team intends to enhance the curriculum in cyber-security pedagogies and raise the knowledge dissemination prowess of the national and international community in academia. The proposed project introduces online/offline training instructional modules to train individuals interested in learning various aspects of cyber-security through specialization tracks along with a leveling certification program carefully crafted to address the needs of students of two and four-year college students. The project also offers scientifically developed course materials for instructors with the aim of facilitating teaching.  The primary target audiences in this project are community college, upper division and four year collegiate faculty. \r\n\r\nThis online/offline learning development project is codenamed, \"CyberExercises\" and has several features that rectify the previously mentioned issues and consequently, provides a relatively unique position in the market to commercialize our certification program. The first and leading competitive advantage with this project is the development of cyber-security simulations, exercises, and attack use cases designed to replicate real world problems. This allows hands-on expertise in areas specifically relevant to the participant and raises the ability of these individuals to negate the malicious effects caused from them.  A second relevant competitive advantage is the creation of specific tracks customized to each individual.  Several cyber-security certification programs exist, but the competition usually has a generic program that lead individuals to focus on irrelevant material, in fields unrelated to their own, and often results in ineffectual information retention.",

The outcomes of this project improved the understanding of current market needs related to cyber security and facilitated a better design of instructional module prototypes, focusing on teaching cyber security in face-to-face instructional settings and finally introducing a cybersecurity certification program. The certification program on cybersecurity will bring the following values to customers:</p>\n<p>1) Consumers are looking for a curriculum that is local and offers face-to-face training.</p>\n<p>2) Training through simulations is beneficial for gaining experience with actual security breaches and should be included in the curriculum.</p>\n<p>3) Students prefer to have hands-on-training within their course with real data/companies.</p>\n<p>4) A central Web-portal offers instructors with a substantially easier experience locating relevant course materials for their use.</p>\n<p>5) Companies need continued education on a yearly-based for their employees operating in cybersecurity.</p>\n<p>This feasibility study project aims at investigating the needs for a certification program with the target market starting with community college faculty and students. The project primarily targeted faculty and teachers of community colleges and gradually expanded its scope and targeted small and medium size business corporations and firms. The major activities defined in this project was centered on identifying the cybersecurity needs of various types of potential customers and potential stakeholders and investigating whether a certification program with reasonable price and length would help the stakeholders. The project interviewed over 100 professionals strategically identified and selected from various customer segments such as academia, small and medium size enterprises, major IT companies and individuals who worked as professional cyber security experts. Accordingly, a set of questionnaires, surveys, and depth interview questions were carefully crafted and designed addressing different types of customer segments with the aim of exploring the cybersecurity needs throughout the supply chain in education and training.&nbsp; The interviewees were asked about their cybersecurity needs in terms (i) continuous learning and development, (ii) the most critical cyber security concepts, (iii) certifications and formal degrees, (iv) learning methodology, (v) the prepared and easy to adopt learning and instructional modules, and (vi) the most preferred delivering channels.</p>\n<p>The project resulted in identifying three major customer segments: i) Universities and Community Colleges, ii) IT professionals, and iii) Small and Medium size enterprises (SMEs), each demanding certain cybersecurity needs, trainings, continuous developments, and security awareness in general. Further interviews and analysis showed that while the type of the cybersecurity needs vary among these customer segments, they all needed an easy to use Web-based.</p>\n<p>Certifications seem to be valuable for junior level positions; whereas, senior level positions require extensive work experience. On the other hand, a combination of certifications and work experience elevate the credibility of prospective employees. There are several daunting problems with existing cyber security certifications: (1) affordability, (2) online and distance accessibility, (3) incompleteness of syllabus, and (4) out-of-dated curriculum. The specific needs of each customer segment are:</p>\n<p>1. Universities and Community Colleges. College students and teachers need an active source of cyber security course materials and instructional modules for a few reasons: (1) the online search for finding reliable sources of cyber security course materials is costly and inefficient, (2) it is hard and infeasible for instructors to develop their own course materials, (3) it is hard for faculty to find resources in one place. The customers from this segment showed their interest in having access to an online Web-based resource prepared for instructors and assisting them in preparing and introducing new cyber security courses quickly. However, the major problem was lack of financial supports and limited resources that these types of customers often deal with. Support from federal funds is inevitable. The interest on certification program was not as high as it was expected. Rather the needs were focused on having an online resource of cyber security materials.</p>\n<p>2. IT Professionals. Individual IT professionals believed in experience more than certifications. Individual job-seekers felt that if being a certified person could help them hired, then they would bear the cost and pursue the certifications. However, the cost and availability as well as credibility of the certification were among the most important factors when deciding about a certification program.</p>\n<p>3. Small and Medium Size Enterprises (SMEs). The industry is less interested in certifications. Instead, a comprehensive and dedicated training program seems to work well for new workforce of SMEs.&nbsp; When interviewing these types of customers, there was a great demand and interest for some sort of onsite cybersecurity awareness training carefully designed for their employees.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/24/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Akbar&nbsp;Siami Namin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514603/1514603_10346292_1473215943247_Slide10--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514603/1514603_10346292_1473215943247_Slide10--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Customer Archetype Diagram\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514603/1514603_10346292_1473215943247_Slide10--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Customer Archetype Diagram\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Customer Archetype diagram for Cybersecurity Education and Training.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Akbar Siami Namin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Akbar&nbsp;Siami Namin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Customer Archetype Diagram</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514603/1514603_10346292_1473215865105_Slide09--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514603/1514603_10346292_1473215865105_Slide09--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Channel Distribution Diagram\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514603/1514603_10346292_1473215865105_Slide09--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Channel Distribution Diagram\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Customer Distribution Channels for Cybersecurity Education and Training.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Akbar Siami Namin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Akbar&nbsp;Siami Namin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Channel Distribution Diagram</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514603/1514603_10346292_1473216155332_Slide11--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514603/1514603_10346292_1473216155332_Slide11--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Customer Workflow Diagram\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514603/1514603_10346292_1473216155332_Slide11--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Customer Workflow Diagram\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Customer Workflow Diagram for College Students and Faculty.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Akbar Siami Namin</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Akbar&nbsp;Siami Namin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Customer Workflow Diagram</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514603/1514603_10346292_1473216387467_Slide7--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514603/1514603_10346292_1473216387467_Slide7--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Get/Keep/Grow Diagram\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514603/1514603_10346292_1473216387467_Slide7--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Get/Keep/Grow Diagram\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Get, Keep, Grow Diagram for Cybersecurity Education and Training.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Akbar Siami Namin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Akbar&nbsp;Siami Namin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Get/Keep/Grow Diagram</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
