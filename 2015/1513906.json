 "awd_abstract_narration": "Every aspect of our society, from business, to government, to medicine and the sciences, is now tightly intertwined with the functioning of computer networks such as the Internet. Unfortunately, modern computer networks are extremely complicated, making them prone to implementation errors and misconfigurations, which can lead to vulnerabilities and other avenues to attack. To address this challenge, this project is designing and implementing systems which automatically verify correctness of network behavior, and correct vulnerabilities and errors in operational networks. These systems can provide immediate practical assistance to protecting networks and critical infrastructure against the attacks and cyberthreats we read about in the news every day.\r\n\r\nThe project's technology functions by scanning a network, constructing a formal model of the network's behavior, and using custom formal logic algorithms to automatically derive diagnoses and repairs to network state. The core technical approach is founded on data-plane verification (DPV), which models network-wide properties using a view of the network that is as close as possible to the network's actual running behavior, i.e., the data plane: forwarding tables contained in routers, switches, firewalls, and other networking equipment. This low-level view allows DPV to catch and prevent errors that other tools miss, and provides a framework for the unified analysis of heterogeneous, multi-protocol networks.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: This research is designing new algorithms to detect, prevent, and repair errors in complex networks. To achieve this, the researchers are developing a new class of formal methods to efficiently model network properties such as reachability, as well as techniques to store and query these models in real time. The researchers are also developing systems based on these algorithms to quickly and correctly localize faults, repair them before they can affect live networks, and deploy operating environments based on software-defined networking that automate application of their techniques. This research is shedding light on the ability to formally model networks, and is building insights into how to design networks and network protocols that have strong security properties from first principles. The work will also help enable interdisciplinary research across formal methods and networking disciplines, with the common goal of enabling highly available networking infrastructures.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The results of this research will significantly enhance reliability and security of critical network infrastructure, and ease network management tasks. Being able to construct networks that can provide formal guarantees on the correctness and resilience of packet forwarding would have significant economic impact, by making networks more reliable and cost-effective. Networks that can deal reliably with rarely encountered exceptions are an essential component of attack survival and recovery for business and government communication systems. The techniques developed in this research will also improve resilience to misconfigurations, which may accelerate deployment of networks in underdeveloped and rural areas lacking experienced network operators with resources to troubleshoot network problems. Finally, the project is training students on cutting-edge and cross-disciplinary research in networking, formal methods, and security.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This project designed new systems and algorithms to detect, prevent, and repair errors in complex networks.  The project achieved this by developing new techniques of applying formal methods to network infrastructure -- that is, rigorously modeling the network to allow automated reasoning about what could happen on the network, or how it should be configured to achieve goals like availability and security.  To achieve this, the project pursued two broad avenues -- verification and synthesis -- along with work that cuts across both areas.\nFirst, the project developed multiple novel methods of verifying whether intended properties of the network are actually achieved, a computationally difficult problem especially when multiple failure scenarios are considered.  The project developed a new system for verifying network configurations that in many cases achieved at least 1000x speedups over prior state-of-the-art methods using a new approach of efficient model checking combined with a suite of domain-specific optimizations.  The project also developed methods of verifying emerging \"self-driving\" networks with multiple interacting dynamic components, and a way of incorporating real software components into the testing process when models are not available.\nThe project's second main avenue was developing synthesis methods -- that is, systems to automatically configure or repair a network which was not meeting its goals, or which the administrator had not yet configured at all.  In particular, the project designed and built a \"network autocorrect\" system that automatically modifies network forwarding, in as minimal a way as possible, to preserve critical network properties like security.  The project also defined requirements and a preliminary solution for synthesizing control action sequences in service provider networks (such as to respond to an incident or a need for scale-out); systems to automatically scale out virtualized network elements while preserving correctness properties; and a new software-defined network controller design to automatically optimize networks without affecting of functional correctness.\nThird, the project designed building blocks that can apply to both verification and synthesis.  This work included developing models of data planes of programmable networks, and automatically inferring the intended properties to be verified or synthesized.  \nBroadly, this research shed light on the ability to formally model networks, and built insights into how to design networks and their management infrastructure to achieve strong security and correctness properties from first principles.  This work enabled interdisciplinary research across formal methods and networking disciplines. The results of this research can significantly enhance network reliability and security and ease management tasks, for a broad class of organizations for which networks are large-scale and critical, including enterprises, service providers, and government organizations.  The project trained roughly a dozen students, several of whom had taken related industry positions by the end of the project.  Results were disseminated via publications, collaboration with several companies, and tutorials.  As networks are ever more important for day-to-day life, these outcomes can have a significant impact on society.\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Philip Brighten Godfrey"
