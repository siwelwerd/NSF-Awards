 "awd_abstract_narration": "1508748 (Hanson)\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate how basic elements of many commonly used fuels react under conditions typical in an engine.  Laser-based optical methods will be used to track the behavior of these elements during reaction.  The potential outcome of the proposed study will help to reduce emissions from engine combustion.  \r\n\r\nThe PI proposes to use a shock tube study to address aldehyde and ketone reactions, a topic having high level of relevance to the combustion of emerging biofuels.  The emissions of aldehydes and ketones have important environmental and health consequences.  Both types of species are formed in significant quantities as intermediates during the early stages of hydrocarbon oxidation, and significant emissions of these species can occur from engines if combustion is incomplete (e.g. quenched) before full ignition.  Advanced, laser based diagnostics will be used for the experimental investigation, including laser absorption diagnostics for formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and hydroxyl radical (OH), and laser absorption determinations for CO by using cavity enhanced absorption with emission from a quantum cascade laser, providing sub-ppm sensitivity.  These measurements will take advantage of our recent development of an enhanced, ultra-high-sensitivity CO laser absorption diagnostic that can provide sub-ppm sensitivity in shock tube experiments.",

Aldehydes are formed in significant quantities as intermediates during the early stages of hydrocarbon oxidation, that is fuel burning, and significant emissions of these species can occur from engines if combustion is incomplete (that is quenched) before full ignition.  Detailed and accurate chemical reaction mechanisms describing the high-temperature decomposition and oxidation of aldehydes are needed to understand and reduce their negative effects in combustion.  In this research, we have measured the chemical rate constants of several important aldehyde reactions using shock tube and laser methods we have developed in our laboratory.  These research tools provide fast and accurate ways to measure specific chemical reaction at conditions similar to those that occur in vehicle engines.  \n\nThe commercial thrust to increase control, efficiency and power in vehicle engines, while reducing emissions, has pushed combustion devices to more extreme operational conditions.  Because of this, experimental data that accurately describe the chemistry at these extreme conditions are critically needed to test and refine the computer models used to predict and simulate fuel burning in modern engines.  Shock tube/laser experiments provide one of the few experimental approaches can provide the high temperatures, uniform test conditions and sensitive tools needed to study these processes.  \n\nThis research will provide an opportunity to train a new generation of engineering students in modern combustion chemistry methods and state-of-the-art laser and shock tube techniques in the laboratory.  With one of the important problems facing Americans today being emissions from fossil fuels used in vehicles, this research is timely, appropriate and needed.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/21/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ronald K Hanson"
