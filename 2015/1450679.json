 "awd_abstract_narration": "Droughts threaten the health of the nation's forest resources by reducing tree growth and increasing mortality from multiple causes including fires and insect attack. This project will determine when and where forests are most at risk from drought-induced mortality in the western USA under current and future climate scenarios. Plant drought responses will be predicted from a theory of water supply and demand that is based on the physics of water flow. When plants are photosynthesizing they are also losing water by evaporation through the stomatal pores that take up CO2 in their leaves. The lost water is replenished by a passive wicking process that pulls water from the soil into roots and up dead, water-filled xylem tubes. Drought-induced failure of this water transport limits the possible rate of water supply, which by theory is associated with reduced water demand caused by closure of stomatal pores. Consequently, prolonged droughts reduce growth and transport capacity, creating persistent metabolic stresses that increase mortality by the \"chronic stress hypothesis\".  A computer model will combine the supply-demand theory with climatic and landscape causes of drought stress, including precipitation, groundwater hydrology, and atmospheric humidity. The model and chronic stress hypothesis will be tested in greenhouse, plantation, and natural stands, focusing on trees of the intermountain west. Predictions for the region's forests will be made from climate projections. Forecasts will inform decisions on land management. Educational versions of the model will illustrate the combined roles of climate and groundwater hydrology on plant health. The project is a regionally focused trial of an approach that can be applied nationally and globally. \r\n\r\nThe goal is to identify and characterize the key hydraulic traits of plants necessary for accurate predictions of how their gas exchange, vascular performance, productivity, and risk of mortality will respond to climate change. The context is forests of the mountain west (USA), where droughts have already caused significant woody plant mortality. The backbone of the project is a model of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum that applies mathematical approaches for soil water flow to plant xylem. Key research questions include whether the model can be accurately driven by climate and hydrology, the importance of vascular recovery via xylem refilling, and whether there is a chronic stress threshold of vascular dysfunction and consequent reduction in CO2 uptake and productivity that is reproducibly associated with mortality risk. The utility of the chronic stress hypothesis is that hydraulics can be predicted from the climate-coupled model, whereas the exact proximal cause of death is likely variable and less predictable. The integrated model and chronic stress idea will be tested rigorously in greenhouse, research garden, and natural settings, including tests of its ability to \"hindcast\" the current hydraulic status of montane woody plants in the region from known climate inputs. The model will predict the severity of droughts required to threaten western forests, and forecast the immediate impacts of future climate scenarios for the region. Forecasts will inform forest management decisions.  Educational model versions will promote understanding of the plant-climate linkage. Research versions will be available via website, because the basic approach is relevant for analyzing drought impacts on forests of any region.",

This project determined when and where forests are most at risk from drought-induced mortality, focusing on several tree species that are common in western USA, under current and future climates scenarios. This was accomplished by developing new ecosystem models that predict plant drought responses from a theory of water supply and demand that is based on the physics of water flow. The models predict plant photosynthesis, which takes in atmospheric carbon dioxide through stomatal pores found on leaves and converts it to sugars for plant growth and respiration. When stomatal pores are open to take up carbon dioxide water is lost to evaporation. The lost water is replenished by a passive wicking process that pulls water from the soil into roots and up dead, water-filled xylem tubes. Drought-induced failure of this water transport limits the rate of water supply, and so the theory and models reduce plant water demand by closing the stomatal pores. Prolonged droughts reduce plant growth because photosynthesis is reduced when stomata are partly closed and it ceases when stomatal are fully closed. Prolonged droughts also affect water transport capacity, creating persistent stresses that increase the risk of tree mortality.&nbsp;This theory was used to explain rapid mortality of aspen forests in the USA state of Colorado. Mortality was explained primarily by water supply and demand associated with depleted soil water supplies in late spring and early summer. Tree mortality was mediated by topographic controls over energy input from the sun, which drives evaporation rates, and horizontal movement of groundwater, which increases water supply in areas along stream courses and in low-lying areas in the landscape. The supply-demand theory was incorporated into a novel model to simulate the exchange of water between tree roots and three-dimensional groundwater flow, and used to quantify the extent to which riparian cottonwood trees rely on water supply from a nearby river to prevent mortality. The results show that water withdrawals from the river for irrigation or energy production, or reduced river water flow associated with future warming with less water storage from winter snow, will increase the likelihood of cottonwood trees experiencing chronic stress and eventual death. The project also investigated how plants can potentially avoid chronic stress by growing their roots to groundwater sources that provide a water subsidy to supplement what is provided from rainfall. The supply-demand theory was used to develop a new model of root growth to understand the combined roles of root water access and hydrology on tree survival. The model was applied under current and potential future climate by testing it at a warming and drought experiment on pinyon pine and one-seed juniper. The integrated model showed that trees survived during drought by pulling water from bedrock fissures. However, the model also showed that tree root growth must occur prior to drought. The implication is that trees exposed to warmer droughts are less likely to have the root growth needed to survive even if there is groundwater nearby. Thus tree stands will be more vulnerable to mortality under future, warmer climates.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts</p>\n<p>The project involved underprivileged fifth grade students from public schools Buffalo, NY, through the University at Buffalo Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering Program (ISEP).

Students learned first principles of the role of water supply and demand on plant growth rates, and the importance of plant interaction with groundwater.
