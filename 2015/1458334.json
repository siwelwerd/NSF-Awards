 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract \r\n\r\nAn award is made to the University of Alaska Museum (UAM) of the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) to complete the transition of its Genomic Resources Facility to a state-of-the-art liquid nitrogen system, the gold standard in modern cryopreservation.  UAM is home to one of the largest research collections of frozen animal and plant tissues in the world.  In addition to its global scope, it features unparalleled holdings of arctic and subarctic material from a region undergoing profound environmental change and rapidly increasing human encroachment.  Notable holdings include the largest and fastest-growing collection of marine mammal tissues in the world; samples from migratory birds that come from six continents to breed in Alaska each year; and permafrost-preserved tissues from extinct Pleistocene organisms.  The conversion to a liquid nitrogen system will secure an incalculably valuable scientific resource for ongoing and future research and education efforts.  Nearly all frozen tissues are associated with voucher specimens, adding to their information content and allowing for research on countless aspects of organismal biology beyond genetics and genomics.  For example, samples from the UAM-GR are routinely used by scientists globally to investigate questions in evolution, ecology, toxicology, biomedicine, and numerous other fields.  The project will also train students in modern cryopreservation technology and collection management and outlines plans to leverage ongoing outreach of the UAM to highlight the research, education and wider societal benefits of the collection.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded to facilitate the purchase and installation of four Liquid Nitrogen cryovats and associated racks to replace failing mechanical freezers.  Additionally, a liquid nitrogen plant of sufficient production capacity to maintain eight cryovats will be maintained. The resulting configuration represents a 68% increase in space efficiency and will accommodate all samples currently housed in failing mechanical freezers as well as an anticipated 20 years of continued growth.  The transition to a cryopreservation system entirely based on liquid nitrogen will enhance specimen security and significantly reduce energy consumption.  This project will train graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge cryopreservation methods and collections-based research in the biological sciences.  Outreach at UAM-GR will continue to target visitors of all ages including K-16 students, researchers, politicians, and the public.  These efforts will be augmented through the production of podcasts and videos targeting native Alaskans, a group that is significantly underrepresented in the STEM disciplines.",
