 "awd_abstract_narration": "Species diversity increases latitudinally from the poles to the equator, making the tropical regions the most species rich on Earth.  New World tropical plants - from Mexico to Argentina - harbor an unprecedented 37% of vascular plant species.  One of the reasons for this high diversity may lie in the history of the area. South America was isolated from other continental landmasses until about 3 Mya when the isthmus of Panama closed.  During this period, geological events and global climate change led to the formation and maintenance of many biomes, creating a heterogeneous landscape with new ecological opportunities for members of the isolated plant assemblage to adapt.  This research will generate genetic and environmental data from a group plants with a Neotropical distribution. The goal of this work is to better understand how the evolutionary patterns in each biome combine to generate this unparalleled level of plant diversity.  This work will help document existing biodiversity in the Neotropics and foster collaboration with Latin American scientists.  Research findings will be communicated via publications and to the broader public by participation in museum exhibits and online media.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this work is to explore the balance of two evolutionary patterns - biome conservatism versus biome shifting- and how it has affected Neotropical plant diversification through space and time.  Biome conservatism is the tendency of plant groups to remain in similar environments and retain corresponding ecological traits as they diversify. This pattern implies that evolutionary success through diversification may come primarily from biome expansion through time or long distance migration from point of origin to similar biomes. Alternatively, shifts into novel biomes- biome evolution- could be critical in driving high diversification rates by providing access to new ecological niches to which plant species can adapt. To unravel patterns of biome conservatism and biome shits in the Neotropics, field work will be conducted in Brazil and Colombia to collect members of the large Neotropical plant family Bignoniaceae.  Using high-throughput amplicon-based sequencing techniques and statistical phylogenetic analyses, the goals are this project are to (A) detect early diversification events in Bignoniaceae and (B) estimate diversification rates and correlate biome conservatism and biome shift events with these diversification rates across the family.  Based on the importance of niche availability to adaptation, increased opportunities available in newly occupied biomes may facilitate significant increases in speciation and diversification rate following biome shifts.",

This staggering amount of diversity has inspired explorers and researchers alike to investigate the source of such high species numbers. The goal of my dissertation work on the trumpet creeper family, Bignoniaceae, is to help answer a small part of this enduring question. A family of about 800 species, this mostly tropical group is distinguished by its large, colorful trumpet-shaped flowers. From documenting species diversity through taxonomy and phylogenetics to understanding biogeography through divergence dating and ancestral state reconstruction, we are seeking to understand this group's role in plant diversification worldwide. The first step in my project was uncovering species relationships in several understudied clades of the family via molecular phylogenetic methods. First we collected about fifty taxa through field work in Brazil, Colombia, and Argentina, as well as from herbarium collections around the world. We DNA sequenced several chloroplast and nuclear gene regions and gathered existing sequence data from colleagues for 123 taxa across several major clades. Then, we used statistical computer programs to generate species relationships based on similarities in the DNA sequences. After generating these evolutionary histories, or phylogenies, we used fossil data to date speciation events and assigned species ranges to each taxa to help us better understand when and where important evolutionary events took place in these groups.</p>\n<p>Our taxonomic work suggests that Neotropical Jacarandeae, the earliest diverging lineage in Bignoniaceae, consists of only one genus, not two as treated in previous classifications.

We also found that pantropically distributed Tecomeae consists of five major clades, with two groups in the New World and three in the Old World.
