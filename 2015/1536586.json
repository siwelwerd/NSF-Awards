 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will extend for five years and enhance the multi-decadal oceanographic observations from the MV Oleander, a container vessel that on a weekly schedule crosses four distinct regions, namely the continental shelf, Slope Sea, Gulf Stream and Sargasso Sea on its route between New Jersey and Bermuda. The enhancements include an acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP) pair that will provide direct measurement of the currents through the base of the thermocline to about 1200 m depth in the open ocean on the one hand, and high vertical resolution profiling of the upper ocean on the other. The former will enable research into the full upper ocean structure of the Gulf Stream, the mesoscale eddy field, and the highly variable Sargasso Sea, all of which are important components in the large scale ocean circulation including the climatically important meridional overturning circulation (MOC). The latter will greatly improve coverage on the continental shelf, shelfbreak front and resolution of the mixed layer seasonal thermocline structure.\r\n\r\nThe Oleander track is uniquely situated as it enables in situ measurements across the shelf and slope, through the southernmost extension of the North Atlantic subpolar gyre, and into the subtropical gyre. The beauty of these ADCP snapshots is that they tell us what the ocean is doing over a wide range of scales. Ensemble averaging these leads to robust data sets that will contribute to continued and deeper investigations into (1) seasonal, and interannual to decadal variability on the mid-Atlantic Bight shelf, (2) dynamics controlling the communication between the shelf and open ocean, (3) connectivity along western boundaries in the MOC at different latitudes, and (4) interannual to decadal variability in the Gulf Stream position, strength and the structure of the subpolar gyre, and the recirculation in the Sargasso Sea. In addition, the high horizontal resolution of surface salinity, temperature and velocity afforded by individual tracks will enable continued investigation into sub-mesoscale processes. A replacement ship is expected to enter service in the second or third year of the project. With the installation of two new ADCPs on the new hull, one for improved shelf-slope operation and one to profile to 1200 m depths, the Oleander project will greatly increase its observational footprint in the northwest Atlantic. All data will be available to the public as soon as they are processed and quality-controlled. The expansion of the University of Hawaii UNOLS-wide ADCP data acquisition system, UHDAS to include volunteer observing ships will allow for real time data streams from not only the Oleander, but also other such ADCP-equipped vessels in operation in the North Atlantic.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nOleander Project Outcomes  The new vessel and the installation of new sensor systems.\r\n\n\nThe Oleander Project is a long-term effort to monitor and understand processes over the continental shelf, slope, Gulf Stream and Sargasso Sea that was started from the original MV Oleander in the mid 1970s. The weekly round-trip of the Oleander between New Jersey and Bermuda provides an extraordinary and cost-effective means to measure ocean conditions in an ecologically and commercially important area. Over the years the program has evolved from occasional temperature measurements across the shelf to a more regular operation that spans the entire transit to Bermuda. In the early 1990s the program expanded from just XBTs to include Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers, ADCPs, that operate continuously providing ocean velocity and near surface temperatures. The ADCPs have been slowly upgraded from 150 kHz to 75 kHz and now with the new Oleander to a pair of instruments, 150 and 38 kHz, that can profile the ocean down to more than 1000m into the main thermocline and covering the major warm water component of the northward Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation component.\r\n\n\nThe latest phase of the Oleander project started in 2017 when Bermuda Container Lines (BCL), now Neptune Group, made plans to replace the existing ship with a new vessel to be built in China by SDARI Ltd. Since this was a new design we felt that we should take advantage of the opportunity to maximize the data collection potential with an expanded ADCP suite. And all this was to be controlled by a new data acquisition system and telemetry.\r\n\n\nEarly in this build process we started discussions with SDARI how the science equipment was to be accommodated in the new design. This included a trip to Shanghai to meet with the designers. The ship was launched in August 2018 with the ADCPs and GPS antennae installed although not operational. The ship arrived in Bermuda in February 2019 and we were allowed access to the ship in April. The new data acquisition system components had been purchased by the spring of 2019. Through the summer and fall were spent integrating and debugging the various components. By the end of 2019 we had connected all the components but were finding faults with the ADCPs. We quickly realized that the OS150 was not returning any data but rather was indicating bad transducers. In December 2019 the OS150 was removed and sent to RD Instruments for repair and returned in March 2020. Another problem was the ABX-Two GPS receiver which precise heading information for the ADCPs but has proven to be a troublesome device very sensitive to its setup.\r\n\n\nThe arrival of Covid-19 prevented access to the ship from early 2020 until April 2021 when we were allowed back on board the ship in a restricted fashion and to further debug the system. The repaired OS150 was reinstalled in April 2021. From the limited data we had collected it appeared that we were experiencing bubble sweep-down problems affecting both ADCPs but mostly the OS38. Bubbles are very effective at preventing the transmission of acoustic signals. As a result, an undership camera system was constructed that could be bolted onto the transducer ring around either the OS150 or OS38 ADCPs. In November 2021 the camera was installed on the 38 kHz ADCP by divers in Bermuda for a round trip to New Jersey. Although the camera did not have battery capacity for the entire trip it did last through the early portion of the southbound leg. On the northbound trip, when the ship is typically lightly loaded, the camera showed significant bubble clouds sweeping over the transducer. But during the initial portion of the southbound trip when the ship was loaded and drawing about one meter more than on the northbound leg, the bubble clouds were much reduced. As a result, it appeared that we should be getting reasonable returns from the OS38, at least on the southbound runs in reasonable weather. That this does not appear to be the case has and is causing some concern as to where the problem, if it is not bubbles, exists.\r\n\n\nAlthough the program formally ended in March 2022 efforts to improve the system continued. The OS150 again showed problems with the acoustic transducer so the unit was removed once more in July 2022. The urethane covering had been removed for a second time and the ADCP was again sent to RD Instruments for repair. It was now pretty clear that the forward location of the OS150 subjected the unit to extra abuse when the ship encounters rough seas. As a result, we have decided to install an acoustic window over the transducer which is funded by the follow-on Oleander Project with Dr Magdalena Andres from WHOI as the lead PI.\r\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2025\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: CharlesNFlagg\n"
