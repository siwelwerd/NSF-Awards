 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop and test a new conceptual framework for understanding brain function, and informing biologically based artificial intelligence systems.  The underlying theory holds that the properties of any neuron and any cortical area are not fixed but undergo state changes with changing perceptual task, expectation and attention.   Because of the multiple routes by which this top-down information can be conveyed, each neuron is essentially a microcosm of the brain as a whole.   \r\n\r\nIn this framework, a neuron is viewed as an adaptive processor rather than merely a link in a labeled line, taking on functions that are required for performing the current task.  The theory accounts for cortical function at the circuit level.  Through an interaction between feedback and intrinsic connections neurons select inputs that are relevant to a task and suppress inputs that are irrelevant.  The experiments will combine visual psychophysics, fMRI, large scale high density electrode array recordings and optogenetic manipulation.  These techniques will be used to measure changes in effective connectivity between cortical areas and the relationship between effective connectivity and the information represented by neurons at different recording sites as animals perform different visual recognition tasks.  Computational models will be developed to account for how task-dependent gating of connections can be achieved and will reproduce the functional dynamics observed experimentally.  Though the experiments will focus on the visual modality, the findings from the work will formulate a general theory of brain function that is broadly applicable to the brain as a whole.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur study is based on the idea that visual perception results from an interaction between bottom-up signals coming from the eye and top-down signals that convey information derived from experience.  We were able to determine the influence of expectation on the properties of neurons in the visual cortical pathway by training macaques on a delayed match-to-sample task:  after being shown an initial image, using a touch screen monitor, they indicated whether a target image belonged to a previously shown cue.  This enabled us to determine which object components were most informative for object recognition.  To identify the cortical regions that were activated by our library of images we performed a series of fMRI scans.  We used this information to guide the placement of arrays of electrodes, enabling us to record from individual neurons while the animal performed the object recognition task.  From these recordings we have been able to determine how expectation can alter the functional properties of neurons, and how information is represented at different stages in the visual cortical pathway.  For cells that responded to images taken from our image set, we found that their selectivity was influenced by object expectation. \n\nThe implantation of electrode arrays has also allowed us to study changes in visual representation in multiple areas of the brain that assist with vision during the course of perceptual learning.  Using a macaque that was trained on a visual discrimination task, we measure the associated functional changes, at the neuronal level.  The animal?s ability to do the task improved with training, and along with the behavioral improvements, neurons in multiple visual cortical areas carried more task related information. Interestingly, although high level areas in the visual cortical hierarchy represented this information early in training, there was a shift towards the involvement of lower level areas over further weeks of training. \n\nBroadly, this project helps us understand the mechanisms, at the level of cortical circuits, by which we think and perceive.  It informs us how our experiences shape the way we analyze the world around us.  The mechanisms we uncover in the processing of visual information has broader impact for other aspects of brain function, including other sensory modalities, motor control, memory and cognition. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/15/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles D Gilbert"
