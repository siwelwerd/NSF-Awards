 "awd_abstract_narration": "Project Summary\r\nThe instrumentation requested in this proposal will be used to enhance R/V Langseth?s seismic functionality and reliability. The proposal states that replacing the existing SYNTRAK MCS system with the proposed Sercel SEAL 408 system is critical for the future of Langseth and the science community that requires it for seismic imaging. References are made to the Langseth ?Incline Village? Science workshop report in 2010, where the science priorities provided detail on future scientific goals that require a more capable system. The current system is more than 20 years old, is no longer supported and is well beyond its expected service life. In order to meet the needs of scientific community, upgrading the multi-channel seismic (MCS) capabilities of the National Seismic Imaging Facility is a necessity. The premise of the proposal is that the purchase of the Sercel SEAL 408 satisfies these requirements and does so in a fiscally responsible way.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present report is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",
