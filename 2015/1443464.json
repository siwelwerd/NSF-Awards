 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gases trapped in ice cores have revealed astonishing things about the greenhouse gas composition of the past atmosphere, including the fact that carbon dioxide concentrations never rose above 300 parts per million during the last 800,000 years.  This places today's concentration of 400 parts per million in stark contrast.  Furthermore, these gas records show that natural sources of greenhouse gas such as oceans and ecosystems act as amplifiers of climate change by increasing emissions of gases during warmer periods.  Such amplification is expected to occur in the future, adding to the human-produced gas burden.  The South Pole ice core will build upon these prior findings by expanding the suite of gases to include, for the first time, those potent trace gases that both trapped heat and depleted ozone during the past 40,000 years.  The present project on inert gases and methane in the South Pole ice core will improve the dating of this crucial record, to unprecedented precision, so that the relative timing of events can be used to learn about the mechanism of trace gas production and destruction, and consequent climate change amplification.  Ultimately, this information will inform predictions of future atmospheric chemical cleansing mechanisms and climate in the context of our rapidly changing atmosphere.  This award also engages young people in the excitement of discovery and polar research, helping to entrain the next generations of scientists and educators.  Education of graduate students, a young researcher (Buizert), and training of technicians, will add to the nation?s human resource base.   \r\n \r\nThis award funds the construction of the gas chronology for the South Pole 1500m ice core, using measured inert gases (d15N and d40Ar--Nitrogen and Argon isotope ratios, respectively) and methane in combination with a next-generation firn densification model that treats the stochastic nature of air trapping and the role of impurities on densification.  The project addresses fundamental gaps in scientific understanding that limit the accuracy of gas chronologies, specifically a poor knowledge of the controls on ice-core d15N and the possible role of layering and impurities in firn densification.  These gaps will be addressed by studying the gas enclosure process in modern firn at the deep core site.  The work will comprise the first-ever firn air pumping experiment that has tightly co-located measurements of firn structural properties on the core taken from the same borehole.\r\n\r\nThe project will test the hypothesis that the lock-in horizon as defined by firn air d15N, CO2, and methane is structurally controlled by impermeable layers, which are in turn created by high-impurity content horizons in which densification is enhanced.  Thermal signals will be sought using the inert gas measurements, which improve the temperature record with benefits to the firn densification modeling.  Neon, argon, and oxygen will be measured in firn air and a limited number of deep core samples to test whether glacial period layering was enhanced, which could explain low observed d15N in the last glacial period.  Drawing on separate volcanic and methane synchronization to well-dated ice cores to create independent ice and gas tie points, independent empirical estimates of the gas age-ice age difference will be made to check the validity of the firn densification model-inert gas approach to calculating the gas age-ice age difference.  These points will also be used to test whether the anomalously low d15N seen during the last glacial period in east Antarctic ice cores is due to deep air convection in the firn, or a missing impurity dependence in the firn densification models.  \r\n\r\nThe increased physical understanding gained from these studies, combined with new high-precision measurements, will lead to improved accuracy of the gas chronology of the South Pole ice core, which will enhance the overall science return from this gas-oriented core.  This will lead to clarification of timing of atmospheric gas variations and temperature, and aid in efforts to understand the biogeochemical feedbacks among trace gases.  These feedbacks bear on the future response of the Earth System to anthropogenic forcing.  Ozone-depleting substances will be measured in the South Pole ice core record, and a precise gas chronology will add value.  Lastly, by seeking a better understanding of the physics of gas entrapment, the project aims to have an impact on ice-core science in general.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe atmosphere is an important part of the global climate system.  It controls both incoming and outgoing radiation that modulates the Earth\u2019s temperature.  As such, it is important to accurately reconstruct the composition of past atmospheres and relate changes in greenhouse gas composition with global climate records from various archives.  This is critical as we attempt to document how natural greenhouse gas variations are tied to climate change. \n\n \n\nPaleoatmospheric records are stored in glaciers by the continuous trapping of air parcels when snow is transformed to ice at the top of glaciers.  Once trapped, these air parcels are advected down into the glacier by normal ice flow.  Ice cores through a glacier provide samples of past atmosphere in that are analyzed by extracting the air samples from the ice and analyzing the composition.  Once the compositional data is in hand, one needs an accurate age model to place the compositional changes in a sound stratigraphic framework that can be compared with other climate records.  Because the gases are trapped at depth in a glacier, the age of the gases is somewhat younger that the surrounding ice.  In the past, a densification model has been employed along with the ice age vs depth record from counting annual layers and correlating volcanic markers to construct a gas age vs depth relation.  Uncertainties in model estimates of the ice age &ndash; gas age difference can be quite large (&gt;500 years) at sites with low accumulation rates and low temperatures.  This is especially problematic for East Antarctic ice cores like South Pole. \n\n \n\nThe current project utilizes a high-resolution record of atmospheric methane (CH4) to construct the gas age vs depth relation for the SPICE core.  PSU analyzed 732 samples of ice from the glacial transition of SPICE (10-25ka) in high resolution (~50 years) and also ran samples throughout the Holocene at 100yr resolution.  Oregon State analyzed the Holocene and glacial samples at ~50 year resolution.  The SPICE core CH4 record was then matched to the CH4 record from the WAIS divide ice core where the dating uncertainty was &lt; 200 years for the gas records.\n\n \n\nThe broader impacts of our work primarily revolve around the training of 11 undergraduate students in the lab here at Penn State.  Each of these students was trained to handle the ice core samples from beginning to the end of the extraction procedure utilizing an automated extraction/analytical device known as the \"Spider\".  The students were exposed to the intricacies of working in an international ice core laboratory with particular emphasis on quality control and meticulous record keeping and attention to detail during the preparation and analyses of the SPICE samples.  The data from our project is being incorporated into a PhD dissertation by Jenna Epifanio at Oregon State.  Finally, our work provides the gas age vs depth relation that will be used by all other principal investigators who measure gas composition on the SPICE core. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/09/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Todd A Sowers"
