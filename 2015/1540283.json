Algorithmic Game Theory (AGT) stands at the intersection of these two fields. It has had significant practical impact, in a broad range of applications including online, matching and assignment markets, internet advertising, information diffusion, airport security, etc. \r\n\r\nThis workshop will showcase the impact of\u00a0 AGT on practice, and explore avenues for increasing the field's practical impact, including connections to machine learning, data science, and financial markets.",
