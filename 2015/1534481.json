 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ASME Applied Mechanics and Materials (McMat) meeting is a quadrennial  conference jointly established by the divisions of Applied Mechanics and of Materials of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). This meeting covers all aspect of mechanics and materials, from experiment, computation to theory.  It provides a unique platform for researchers from industry, academia and national labs to come together to present, share and identify the most important developments, trends and innovations in the field.  The upcoming McMat 2015 conference, to be held in Seattle, Washington, June 29-July 2, 2015, places special emphasis on advancing the knowledge in the emerging areas of energy, health, soft electronics, advanced manufacturing, and mechanics and materials education. This award will provide partial travel support for beginning researchers including graduate students, postdocs as well as community college faculty members to attend the conference. Special effort will be made to identify and support women and under-represented minority members as they are currently under represented in the mechanics and materials field.\r\n\r\nThe McMat 2015 is one of the most well attended conference in the mechanics and materials field expecting over 400 participants from over 30 countries. This travel award will foster a greater and more diverse conference participation of US young scholars. It provides a unique opportunity to research active graduate students and postdoc researchers, and community college instructors in mechanics education, to learn about the most recent and important developments and innovations, and to interact with the researchers who are actually working on the forefront of these areas.  In addition, the award will promote the participation and recognition of women and underrepresented minorities in the mechanics and materials field.",
