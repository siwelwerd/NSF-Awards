 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 5th International Summit on Hurricanes and Climate Change will take place June 9-14, 2015 in Chania, Crete, Greece with organizing support provided by Aegean Conferences. The purpose of this summit is to bring together an international assemblage of leading academics and researchers on various sides of the debate to discuss new research and express findings about climate changes and future climate scenarios and their implications regarding regional and global hurricane (tropical cyclone) activity. The goals are to address what research is needed to advance the science of the hurricane climate and to provide a venue for encouraging a lively, spirited, and sustained exchange of ideas. Specific topics that will be addressed include surface wind fields, storm surge, seasonal prediction, remote sensing, interannual variability, paleotempestology, lightning, decadal variability, intensification, extra-tropical transition, air-sea exchange, and landfall probability.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts will be a better understanding of the future hurricane threat to the U.S. and elsewhere as well as to allow early career participants to have international exposure of their research and network with each other as well as with leading international scientists.",
