Unfortunately, no matter how much effort is put into verification and validation of software, existing techniques are inherently limited, and software is routinely released with bugs and issues that limit its functionality and can dramatically affect the user experience. This project investigates an approach that has the potential to significantly improve the scalability and effectiveness of symbolic program analysis and verification techniques, that will improve the dependability of modern web applications,. \r\n\r\nThis project develops techniques and tools that use symbolic execution and automata-based verification techniques to automatically analyze and verify web applications, and store results of symbolic analyses in a graph database for efficient storage, and retrieval. The methods use incremental and differential analysis strategies that utilize the graph database in order to improve scalability and effectiveness of software analysis and verification. The project trains graduate students, and will make its artifacts publicly available to other researchers and educators.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main goal of this project was to develop scalable program analysis\ntechniques to improve security and dependability of software systems.\nWithin the scope of this project, we have developed several novel program\nanalysis techniques and improved their scalability. \n\nWe developed novel constraint solving and model counting techniques for\nhandling both numeric and string constraints and their combinations. We\nimplemented our results in a novel constraint solver called ABC that stores\nconstraints as automata.  To improve scalability of constraint based program\nanalysis, we developed a constraint database called Cashew that can cache\nnumeric and string constraints and model counting queries.  We conducted\nempirical studies that demonstrate that constraint caching can significantly\nimprove the performance of symbolic and quantitative program analyses.\n\nOur results on constraint cashing demonstrate that using appropriate\nconstraint databases, the scalability of symbolic program analysis can be\nsignificantly improved.\n\nWe developed a novel static, scalable analysis technique for detecting\nside channels in software systems based on symbolic cost analysis of\nprogram paths.  We implemented our symbolic path cost analysis technique\nfor detecting side channels in a prototype tool, CoCo-Channel (Compositional\nConstraint-based side Channel analyzer), for analyzing Java programs.\n\nWe developed symbolic analysis techniques for detecting vulnerabilities\nthat are due to adaptive side-channel attacks, and synthesizing attacks that\nexploit the identified vulnerabilities.\n\nOur results on side channel analysis demonstrate that symbolic execution\ntechniques, when combined with automata-based model-counting constraint\nsolvers, can be used to identify side channels in software applications. Side\nchannel analysis is a very important problem in computing since it can be\nused to identify leakage of privileged information, which is crucial for\ndependability of modern software systems.\n\nOur results on automated attack synthesis enable us to identify the attacks\nthat malicious users can launch against software systems.  This knowledge\nis necessary for remedying existing vulnerabilities.\n\nWe developed a static analysis technique for iOS executables for checking\nAPI call vulnerabilities.  Using a combination of dependency analysis and\nstring analysis, we were able to detect potential violations of Apple?s\nAPI policies (such as restricted use of private/sensitive APIs) in iOS\nexecutables.\n\nOur results on information-flow tracking show that it is feasible to perform\naccurate forensic analysis of attacks in real-world scenarios. This can\nhelp making software systems more secure against the increasingly common\nphenomenon of advanced persistent threats.\n\nThe results from the research conducted within the scope of this project were\npublished in international conferences and presented to the international\nresearch community.
