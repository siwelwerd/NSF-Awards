 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. W. H. Wills of the University of New Mexico will lead a collaborative team of interdisciplinary researchers from several institutions in a two-year study of the agricultural foundations of the prehistoric complex society that developed in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, between ca. AD 500 and 1300.  Chacoan society flourished especially during from AD 900 to 1100 when residents of the high elevation, arid canyon built massive stone buildings (great houses) that formed the social and ritual center for a network that extended over vast distances and included trade relations with societies nearly 1500 miles to the south in Central America.   Despite more than a century of inquiry at Chaco, the economic processes which allowed this development are poorly understood, particularly the role of food production in supporting labor and construction of public architecture in an environment that is not currently suitable for intensive agriculture.  Understanding how ancient farmers created and sustained costly social institutions in marginal environments may offer real insights for modern efforts to efficiently manage competing demands for limited water or resources in many parts of the United States and other parts of the world.  The integration of multiple remote sensing methods draws on scientific and engineering breakthroughs to improve our knowledge about historical changes in the past.\r\n\r\nThe project will employ a range of remote sensing technologies for acquiring highly accurate geospatial data about canyon geomorphology and archaeological site locations as the basis for reconstructing changing land surfaces through time.   Like most stream systems in desert environments, Chaco has deep deposits of alluvium that have accumulated over time in response to changes in climate and other factors.  The canyon residents adjusted to these changes by altering the location of fields and houses, many of which are deeply buried and visible only in eroded areas or through non-destructive remote sensing technologies such as ground penetrating radar, airborne LiDAR and 3-D photography.  These data will be coupled with conventional geoarchaeological information obtained by researchers in the field.  The project will use the reconstructed land surfaces as geospatial platforms for evaluating agricultural productivity models, settlement patterns, and human modifications (such as water canals) that may have affected hydrology.  The team will identity historical factors that may have provided stimuli for rapid population growth and social innovation, as well as conditions that may have fostered problems that could not be solved and led to the depopulation of the canyon by the 14th century AD.",

Unprecedented social and economic change occurred within a few human generations, marked by the construction of massive stone buildings (great houses), some four stories high with hundreds of rooms.  At its peak in the late 11th century AD, the people of Chaco seem to have culturally dominated the Four Corners Region of the US Southwest and had established trade connections with Mesoamerican societies to obtain macaws, chocolate and copper bells.   Why this happened remains mysterious to researchers.\n\nChaco Canyon today is a forbidding place for farmers, lacking a permanent water source and characterized by aridity and short-growing seasons.  Archaeologists assume that the environment in the past was somehow more favorable for maize cultivation but have struggled to understand exactly how it supported such a dramatic increase in social complexity.  Our research project is designed to reconstruct the land surfaces and hydrology of Chaco Canyon before and during the emergence of great house society in order to better appreciate the dynamic relationship between food production and local conditions that may have enhanced or constrained social change. \n\nThe project is a collaborative effort between archaeologists at the University of New Mexico and remote sensing specialists at other organizations (Earth Analytic, Inc. and the National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping).  Our archaeological fieldwork at Chaco Culture National Historical Park involves detailed geoarchaeological examination of exposed alluvial deposits (mainly flood deposits on the canyon floor) throughout the canyon together with the collection of organic materials for radiocarbon dating.  These data are integrated with airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) to create land surfaces for modeling and GPR (Ground Penetrating Radar) to identify potential buried agricultural fields.  All fieldwork has been conducted through a research permit from the National Park Service.\n\nAnalyses are ongoing and focused on geospatial modeling of areas in and around Chaco Canyon that meet expectations for suitable agricultural production.  The ?Agricultural Suitability Modeling? portion of our study entails integrating large publically available data sets for soils, vegetation, hydrology, climate, geology and historical land use in a GIS (Geographic Information System) model.  We can observe potential changes in suitability by altering the importance of different variables, and we can use the archaeological record to stipulate conditions that seem likely for different times during the great house period.  For example, we know there is good evidence was extensive flooding between ca.
