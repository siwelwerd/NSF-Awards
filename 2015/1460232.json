 "awd_abstract_narration": "The increase in the number of felt and damaging earthquakes near injection sites in Middle America has the public's attention. Given this, there is an ever-growing need to better understand how these sequences develop and to educate the public about the science of induced seismicity. The problem is that the low station density in the central and eastern United States means that many small earthquakes are not easily identified using standard analyst review techniques, and the lack of a complete catalog of small earthquakes greatly impedes induced seismicity studies. Additionally, while temporary networks are often deployed after a sequence has started producing significant or felt earthquakes, these networks miss the initiation of the induced earthquake sequence. Our solution is to use data from the EarthScope Transportable Array, to establish more complete catalogs that better describe the full characteristics (both before and after) of induced seismic sequences. \r\n\r\nTo obtain a better understanding of the source physics of induced seismicity, we propose to systematically identify currently uncataloged small magnitude earthquakes located near fluid injection sites in the central and eastern US by applying a newly developed frequency domain detection algorithm and array visualization mapping techniques to transportable array data. Using newly detected events, we will build a template waveform catalog for use as subspace detectors. The detections will be used to build more complete catalogs for eight geographically dispersed basins. These enhanced catalogs will be analyzed to address the following questions: (1) Are there detectable events in basins where other catalogs show no seismicity or are some basins aseismic? (2) To what extent are the template events we identify similar in waveform characteristics and/or location to previously cataloged events? (3) Are observed rate increases consistent with the Gutenberg-Richter relation and is there a predictable change in b-value with time? (4) Do transient stresses from the passage of relatively large surface waves dynamically trigger additional induced events or otherwise change the distribution of induced seismicity? This study will more fully develop frequency domain detection algorithms and subspace detectors tuned to identify small earthquakes, and will be used to create new earthquake catalogs with magnitude of completeness levels lower (magnitude less than 2.4) than most existing catalogs. This large spatial scale analysis has the potential to provide new information about induced earthquakes and provide a quantitative measure of the ubiquity of induced seismicity in different regions.",

To do this, we developed a new seismic detection algorithm tuned for the regular spaced grid of the EarthScope U.S. Transportable array. While the detection catalog was constructed for the CEUS, we focused on three basins (Williston in North Dakota, Denver-Julesberg in Colorado, and Permian in Texas and New Mexico). We reviewed the detections to build earthquake catalogs, clustered the waveforms into groups of repeating sources (and identify unique sources), and looked for evidence of dynamic triggering from larger more distant earthquakes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We found the Williston Basin is relatively aseismic, as had been previously documented, even at lower magnitudes. We identified a new potentially induced seismic zone in the Denver-Julesberg Basin near Hugo, Colorado. The new detection algorithm found ~50 events located within ~2 km of an injection well. There was only one event located in this area in the EarthScope Array Network Facilities (ANF) catalog. In the Permian Basin, we identified two main source areas, one near Snyder, Texas and the other near Dagger Draw, New Mexico. In the Dagger Draw area, of the 135 identified earthquakes only 37 are in the ANF catalog. The waveforms from these events are very similar, falling largely into two families, suggesting these events are closely located and there is limited diversity in the orientation of the faults and source mechanisms. Near Snyder, Texas of the 336 identified earthquakes only 88 are in the ANF catalog. Unlike Dagger Draw, waveforms from events near Snyder are very diverse forming &gt; 20 event families. This is likely a response from a greater number of injection wells, resulting in a greater separation in event location. It may also represent a more diverse orientation in the fault structures and source mechanisms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another key aspect of this study was to look for evidence for remote earthquake triggering.&nbsp;For many decades it has been well-established that some large earthquakes can trigger aftershocks many, many miles away, a phenomenon called<em> remote dynamic earthquake triggering</em>. Triggering is commonly identified from statistically significant increases in earthquake rate coincident with the passage of seismic energy. In establishing rate changes, short duration earthquake catalogs are commonly used, and triggered sequences are not typically analyzed within the context of background seismic activity rates.&nbsp;In this work we made it a priority to establish robust background rates using 3-year datasets, not the commonly used 5 hours of data. We looked at&nbsp;500 mainshocks recorded at four western U. S. 33-yearlong earthquake catalogs and compared the ability of three different statistical methods to identify remote earthquake triggering. Counter to many prior studies, we find remote dynamic triggering is rare (conservatively, &lt;2% of the time). For the mainshocks associated with remote rate increases, the spatial and temporal signatures of triggering differ. We found that a rate increase coincident in time with mainshock energy alone is insufficient to conclude that dynamic triggering occurred, and that to classify dynamically triggered sequences, we must move away from strict statistical measurements and instead use a compatibility assessment that includes multiple factors, like spatial and temporal indicators.
