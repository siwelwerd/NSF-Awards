 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Noyce Capacity Building project will strengthen a partnership between the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and Milwaukee Public Schools aimed at improving the quality of STEM education in area high needs schools.  The goal of the project is to develop capacity to train Master Teachers in content knowledge propagated in the classroom through action research.  The key feature of the project is a needs assessment that will lead to the design and implementation of a series of micro-credential modules that will cover STEM disciplinary content, leadership, and evidence-based pedagogies. \r\n\t\r\nResearch has shown that increased insight into disciplinary content and evidence-pedagogies has a positive effect on teacher performance and teacher professional identity, which in turn are directly related to more effective enactment of STEM curricula.   This project builds on that research basis with a micro-credentialing model that will provide participating teachers with opportunities to connect their learning to classroom practice.  The project also addresses a need to enhance Master Teachers' content knowledge in Milwaukee Public Schools, as captured by the secondary student achievement data in mathematics and science.  Evaluation of the grant activities will focus on gaining formative feedback related to implementation and effectiveness of the needs assessment, micro-credentialing modules, and faculty recruitment plans.",
