 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for participation in the conference \"p-adic Methods in Number Theory\" held at the University of California, Berkeley on May 26-30, 2015.   Since their conception by Kurt Hensel around 1900, p-adic numbers have played a central role in number theory; for example, they are used in a crucial way in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem.  To a number theorist, p-adic numbers are just as \"real\" -- and just as important -- as real numbers.  Both are ways of \"filling in the gaps\" left by considering just rational numbers.  In their book \"Number Theory I: Fermat's Dream,\" Kato, Kurokawa, and Saito write poetically, \"In the long history of mathematics a number meant a real number, and it is only relatively recently that we realized that there is a world of p-adic numbers.  It is as if those who had seen the sky only during the day are marveling at the night sky. [ ]  Just as we can see space objects better at night, we begin to see the profound mathematical universe through the p-adic numbers.\"  This conference will bring together experts in the many different facets of p-adic numbers and their applications, will promote a cross-fertilization of ideas between number theorists of all stripes, will expose graduate students and postdocs to state-of-the-art techniques and results, and will promote participation by underrepresented minorities and women in high-level number theory research. \r\n\r\nA conference on p-adic methods in number theory is timely and important, as many spectacular recent number-theoretic advances have made use of deep p-adic methods.  We mention, for example, recent work establishing special cases of the p-adic local Langlands correspondence; the proof that most hyperelliptic curves of odd degree have just one rational point; developments on non-abelian Coleman integration and integral points on curves; work on the fundamental curve of p-adic Hodge theory; and recent results on perfectoid spaces.
