 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2015 Collective Intelligence Conference in Santa Clara, California, provides a unique opportunity for graduate students to interact with scholars and practitioners from universities, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and various government agencies. The term \"collective intelligence\" refers to the processing of information by a group of people and technological resources, in a manner comparable to but more extensive than the functioning of an individual human brain.  Owing to its interdisciplinary origins, this nascent field attracts open-minded graduate students willing to step out of their academic silos.  The conference itself will address cutting edge ideas including how collective intelligence emerges, social computing, crowdsourcing, collective search and memory, the use of technology to improve collective intelligence, and collective responses to emergencies and crises such as earthquakes and power outages.  Attendance at the conference will offer students concepts, ideas, and experiences that will encourage them to do transformative work in their future careers.\r\n\r\nSpecial graduate student activities will play a distinct role in the 2015 Conference.  A panel discussion on careers in collective intelligence will offer presentations by leaders in the academy, business, non-profit sector, and government, and will focus on four key dimensions: knowledge, tools, questions, and portfolios.  In a collective intelligence syllabus project, students will work in teams to construct possible syllabi for an upper level undergraduate, interdisciplinary course.  A graduate student challenge will involve students in constructing a set of crowdsourcing and collective intelligence challenges that can be used in the classroom.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe annual Collective Intelligence conference was held in Santa Clara, California and organized by the University of Michigan to encourage interaction with entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley.   The conference provided a unique opportunity for graduate students to interact with scholars and practitioners from universities, businesses, nonprofit organizations, and various government agencies. \n\n \n\nThe 2015 conference attracted over three hundred attendees and approximately one hundred graduate student attendees.  The NSF funds paid for 20 students from a variety of fields including physics, biology/ecology, and engineering to attend the conference and participate in two special activities: a syllabus creation project and a discussion of how to categorize types of collective intelligence. The conference itself received no direct funding from the NSF.\n\n \n\nThe Collective Intelligences Syllabus Project was a collective attempt to design a course in collective intelligence.  One way to transform the academy is by proposing new courses during their job interviews.  At present, only a handful of universities teach courses on Collective Intelligence.  Those that exist are at the graduate level and taught within a discipline &ndash; typically computer science, information, biology, or philosophy.  To tap into the collective knowledge and interests of students and faculty, we created a hive where students worked in teams to construct possible syllabi for an upper level undergraduate, interdisciplinary course on collective intelligence.\n\n \n\nPrior to the session, participants prepared a framing/categorization for a Collective Intelligence/Crowdsourcing class.   This consisted of three to eight categories and then papers or real world examples for each category.  This activity resulted in a twelve part categorization that has been refined and used in classroom teaching at the University of Michigan and elsewhere.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/13/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Scott E Page"
