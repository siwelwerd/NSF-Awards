Idealized free electrons that interact with the positive nuclei of the solid but not with each other can already give surprising effects: the differences between metals, electrical insulators, and semiconductors can already be understood at this free-electron level.  One part of the proposed work is concerned with newly discovered materials in topological states that can be analyzed using the branch of mathematics known as topology.  Some topological phases can be understood in terms of free electrons, while others require strong interactions between the electrons. The PI will investigate both kinds of topological phases.  Both can support atomically thin conducting layers at the surface of a bulk insulator, which have potential for technological applications.  The PI will pursue a major new research direction to understand topological effects in metals and in optical properties such as light reflection and transmission, building on recent success in insulators and for transport properties such as conductivity.\r\n\r\nInteractions between the electrons are crucial in allowing systems to reach the steady state of thermal equilibrium, or put another way, to have a well-defined temperature.  The second focus of the research is to understand quantum matter far from the steady state of equilibrium, like certain semiconductor devices. There are indications that numerous new states and phenomena emerge when quantum effects are particularly strong.\r\n\r\nThis award also supports broader impacts with a common goal.  This project will contribute to the training of graduate students in important fields of condensed matter physics, some of which have the potential to yield practical technologies.  The PI will continue mentoring at the undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral levels with special attention to members of groups currently underrepresented in the physical sciences, including service as physics faculty advisor to a new UC Berkeley program.  An accessible book on topological phases of matter, including the quantum Hall effect, spin liquids, and topological insulators, will be co-authored with an international collaborator. Occasional lectures to the lay public and K-12 classes will help spread enthusiasm for physics and materials science.  The PI will continue to organize conferences and a focused seminar at Berkeley in order to propagate research developments, and will also seek to contribute to the condensed matter community through other forms of service.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\nThis award supports theoretical research and education on new kinds of order that emerge has a consequence of interactions in quantum systems. Strongly interacting quantum systems can exhibit new kinds of order and show many different kinds of temporal evolution.  The research has three thrusts on understanding: \r\n\r\n1. how the same geometric properties that underlie topological phases in gapped systems have observable consequences in gapless systems (metals) ranging from free-electron band metals to strongly correlated states arising in high magnetic fields.\r\n\r\n2. quantum dynamics in one dimension in both translation-invariant systems and disordered systems through a combination of numerical matrix-product-state methods and analytic theory. The two main goals are to understand anomalous transport in strongly correlated, translation-invariant, non-integrable models and to develop connections between many-body localization, entanglement, and quantum chaos. \r\n\r\n3. how fractional particles such as Majorana fermions modify non-equilibrium dynamics in topological phases.\r\n\r\nResearch on these projects involves a combination of advanced analytical and numerical methods and will impact many areas of condensed matter physics, including experiments.\r\n\r\nThis award also supports broader impacts with a common goal.  This project will contribute to the training of graduate students in important fields of condensed matter physics, some of which have the potential to yield practical technologies.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe funding received under this grant was used to carry out theoretical research on the quantum behavior of electrons in solids.  Many of the important technological uses of solids are based on their electronic properties, such as transport (how electrons move through the material) and optical responses (how light interacts with a material).  The first set of results obtained through this funding are about how the advances, in the past decade or so, in understanding the geometry and topology of electron wavefunctions help resolve some old questions about optical behavior.  The wavefunction is the quantum-mechanical description of an electron's state, and its dependence on momentum in a crystal has a kind of geometry reflecting the electron's position within the crystalline unit cell; this geometry is absent when the electron is in vacuum.  This geometrical perspective also helped us find possible new behaviors in recently discovered materials related to nonlinear optics (how materials behave in a strong optical field, such as that of a laser) and conductance in a magnetic field.\n\nAn example is the understanding of novel magnetic-field effects in a new category of materials called Weyl semimetals.  These are materials that lie on the boundary between normal metals and insulators even without the external doping used to make semiconductors.  The theory of these magnetic effects and their connection to optical rotation were described in a Physical Review Letter whose first author was NSF-supported student Shudan Zhong.  Our subsequent work is addressing nonlinear optical results in these materials, which are among the strongest ever measured in the visible range of frequencies.\n\nThe second set of results are about how strong interactions between electrons or atoms lead to changes in their dynamical behavior, including new types of \"hydrodynamics\" in clean materials that generalize those in a simpler fluid like water.  Our picture of many materials and fluids is based upon the idea of thermal equilibrium: an initial inhomogeneous state of a fluid becomes (after some time) homogeneous and well described by a few parameters such as temperature.  Quantum systems can modify this behavior in several ways: a system may fail to reach thermal equilibrium because its particles do not move freely, for example because they are localized by disorder effects.   Numerical methods based upon quantum entanglement have been extremely valuable in this field for refining and confirming theoretical conjectures.\n\nBroader impacts of the research include the training of NSF-supported graduate students in this area with clear potential applications to technology.  The PI also participated in outreach activities at the grade school level and in supervision of undergraduate research, including past involvement in a mentoring project for science students from underrepresented groups.  In addition to regular classroom teaching at UC Berkeley and at advanced schools in condensed matter physics, the PI developed publicly available online lecture notes and continued progress toward a textbook.  He gave a non-technical overview of some aspects of quantum behavior in materials at the American Association for Advancement of Science meeting and was active in service to the scientific community, including helping to organize the major meeting of the American Physical Society in this field (the \"March Meeting\") as an elected member-at-large of the Division of Condensed Matter Physics.  The support of research and education activities through this grant is sincerely appreciated.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joel E Moore"
