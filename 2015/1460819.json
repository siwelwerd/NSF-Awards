 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Rhode Island will host the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships in Oceanography (SURFO) program at the Graduate School of Oceanography (GSO)in Narragansett, RI for 10 weeks each summer. SURFO will engage 12 undergraduates in a cutting-edge, authentic oceanographic research and educational experience primarily focused on quantitative aspects of oceanography (e.g., physical oceanography, geophysical fluid dynamics, marine geophysics, population genetics and biodiversity, biogeochemical cycling, and quantitative ecology). Each student works with a research advisor and a graduate student to develop/conduct a hands-on research project in an area of oceanography appropriate to each student's background and interests. The program recruits undergraduates with a strong background in mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, computer science, or engineering. The intended outcome is to develop interest in ocean science research, and prepare students for careers and/or graduate studies in the field. Students also benefit from a SURFO-tailored seminar series and workshops chosen to help them better integrate into research environments, critically analyze and develop science knowledge, safely maneuver in the laboratory and field, improve their writing and oral communication skills, and nurture ethical behavior.",
