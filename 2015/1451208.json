The Burgers Program for Fluid Dynamics at the University of Maryland, in collaboration with the Center for Environmental and Applied Fluid Dynamics at Johns Hopkins University, will address this lack by proposing to offer a Summer Research School on Turbulence. This Summer Research School is designed primarily for advanced Ph. D. students, i.e. students who have had an introductory course and who would find it beneficial to go deeper into the subject. It will also be beneficial to beginning post-doctoral researchers. The Burgers Program for Fluid Dynamics and the Center for Scientific Computation and Mathematical Modeling at the University of Maryland and the Center for Environmental and Applied Fluid Dynamics at Johns Hopkins University jointly offer a School on Fluid Dynamics: Topics in Turbulence designed primarily for advanced graduate students, i.e. students who have had an introductory course and who would find it beneficial to go deeper into the subject. It will also be beneficial to beginning post-doctoral researchers who have the need for further instruction. Sixteen US graduate students or postdocs will be able to participate in this event from U. S. universities other than Maryland and Johns Hopkins.  \r\n\r\nThe School will focus on recent developments in the understanding of turbulence, its prediction and control using modern experimental and analytical techniques and powerful numerical simulation capabilities. Tutorials on turbulence theory, experimental and simulation methods, turbulent transport in single and two phase flows and applications of turbulence will be given by lecturers from the University of Maryland, Johns Hopkins University and elsewhere. Discussions will provide opportunities for student and faculty participants to have a rich exchange of ideas and the participants will also have the opportunity to present their own work in a poster session.",
