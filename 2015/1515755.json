 "awd_abstract_narration": "It is well-recognized that better understanding of nonlinear processes is key to progress in many areas of science and technology, including climate prediction and  development of advanced materials. Theoretical progress in nonlinear sciences depends on advancing the frontiers of theoretical and computational tools of mathematics in complex problems. Computational tools, while generally suitable for nonlinear problems, usually lack mathematical rigor. Mathematical rigor is important in validating the  models used in applications.  Rigorous methods of mathematical analysis are, on the other hand, usually restricted to special, simpler settings. This project seeks to bridge the gap between  mathematics and computer-based approaches  for a class of important applications from mathematical physics and fluid dynamics.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on an extensive development and refinement of  rigorous nonperturbative methods discovered by the principal investigators to answer important open questions that arise in mathematical physics and fluid dynamics. The problems include, in particular, the following: (a) stability of regular or blow-up solutions in super-critical partial differential equations, especially in Yang-Mills theory and wave maps; (b) investigation of steady solutions in viscous fingering in nonperturbative regimes with different regularizations, and of their linear and nonlinear stability; and (c) investigation of the stability of oscillating parallel fluid flows of large amplitudes.",
