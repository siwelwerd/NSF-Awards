 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating an innovative building envelope system to fill the industry need for enhanced resistance to natural and man-made hazards including explosions and impact events from wind or water-borne hazards.  It also provides energy efficiency and ease of construction. This building envelope system, the comb-tie envelope system, is important because it will enhance the understanding of how insulated wall panel systems can be used to provide a thermally efficient and blast resistive envelope to building systems. Competitive technology is not currently available and thus the system will create new markets by providing a cost effective solution for federal and military building construction where blast protection and energy efficiency are required. The technology will also complement existing technology used for conventional construction applications. The technology can be manufactured in the U.S. providing the potential for new business and employment opportunities. The project will result in a proof-of-concept of the comb-tie envelope system with the following unique features: ease of installation, the ability to support loads under large panel displacements, and thermal efficiency. These features provide the following advantages: performance under extreme loads, cost savings, and thermal efficiency when compared to the leading competing composite panel systems in this market space.  \r\n\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gap(s) as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The system relies on an innovative shear tie connector and a supporting design approach. The knowledge gaps addressed will include determination of the idealized connector shape for installation and pullout and shear performance, the strength provided by the connector, verification of the capacity under loading, and validation of the design approach. The project will finalize the detailing of the tie system developed for the insulated panels through finite element modeling of the system. The ability of the tie to provide composite action to the wall system and the ability to be easily installed will be quantified. The refined details will be prototyped and experimentally evaluated through pullout tests and shear tests to quantify the strength provided. These component property results will be used for finalizing the design approach which allow for fabrication and load testing to ensure that the design strength and deformation performance levels are achieved. The complete system will also be verified under explosive loading to verify the dynamic capabilities of the systems. In addition, personnel involved in this project, undergraduates and graduate students, will receive innovation and technology translation experiences through the proof-of-concept development, and market opportunity investigations with industry trade organizations and wall panel producers.",

These panels are constructed with a layer of rigid insulation sandwiched between two concrete wythes. The concrete wythes are tied together using shear ties, commonly fabricated using polymer materials to mitigate thermal bridging through the insulation layer, causing the wall to act as a composite when resisting loads. This project focused on the development of an innovative multi-hazard resistant precast concrete insulated wall system which includes a proprietary shear tie detailed to provide enhanced resistance to extreme man-made and natural hazards. Cladding systems for high risk facilities are often the first line of defense to extreme hazards and shield critical load-bearing components from direct exposure to such threats. These threats often cause exterior cladding panels to accrue larger deformations than typically seen for conventional loading (e.g., wind) and thus may need to satisfy critical deformation limit states in additional to design strengths.</p>\n<p class=\"Text\">The main design objective was to produce a shear tie which would allow the panels to achieve larger deformations, and thus higher damage levels, without sacrificing design capacity or significant structural integrity. After a comprehensive examination of suitable polymer materials for the tie, polycarbonate was selected due to its combination of tensile strength and superior ductility. Initial tie prototypes were fabricated using state-of-the-art additive manufacturing technologies and, following several rounds of preliminary mechanical testing, the final design revisions were manufactured using injection molding (see Figure 1). Three variants of the ties were fabricated: DT22 (2 in. insulation with 2 legs), DT23 (2 in. insulation with 3 legs), and DT24 (2 in. insulation with 4 legs), using a single aluminum mold block with interchangeable inserts for each tie variant (see Figure 2). The DT23 serves as the standard configuration, suitable for typical insulated panel designs with uniformly spaced ties. The DT22 and DT24 variants serve as slight derivatives of the DT23 design, intended for lighter and heavier panel designs, respectively. The capacity of the ties was evaluated using experimental testing to determine their shear resistance, a parameter used in design calculations for insulated wall panels. Specialized tests were also conducted to isolate the sole shear resistance of insulation to facilitate design of the innovative wall system with different types of insulation.</p>\n<p class=\"Text\">Following shear testing, a set of 24 insulated wall panels were fabricated (see Figure 3) and tested under uniform pressure using a water bladder setup (see Figure 4) at Lehigh University. Several different design configurations were considered to assess the effect of varying placement location, quantity and number legs for the shear ties. For example, a standard industry design configuration uses ties spaced uniformly at 16 in. on center. Performance-based analyses of the wall panels suggested that a larger number of ties concentrated closer to the ends of the panel provided a more efficient shear transfer mechanism. Therefore, two additional panel layout schemes were designed to reflect this finding. The results of semi-static testing using the water bladder setup showed that although panels with different shear tie layouts are currently designed for the same flexural capacity using industry guidelines, panels with heavier shear ties (i.e., DT24) concentrated near the ends achieved significantly larger flexural capacity relative to standard uniform tie layouts (see Figure 5). All panels achieved significantly greater ductility than panels designed with other commercially available shear tie systems.</p>\n<p class=\"Text\">The experimental resistance of insulated wall panels was then used as part of a performance-based blast design and analysis framework to estimate the performance of these components to blasts or other extreme loading conditions. This framework was developed using enhanced performance-based limit states to facilitate a more accurate and component-specific prediction of dynamic response, as opposed to current antiterrorism guidelines which specify prescriptive deformation limits and damage definitions for a given component type. Using this analysis framework, several parametric studies were performed to evaluate the effect of varying panel constitutive properties and geometric configurations to determine which design parameters have the greatest influence on the overall response, specifically ductility, of the components.</p>\n<p class=\"Text\">Following the successful completion of experimental testing and extensive computational modeling, the innovative shear tie system was licensed to ALP Supply, a supplier of precast concrete accessories, to market, fabricate and distribute the ties. Lehigh will continue to work closely with ALP to introduce the ties to the precast and tilt-up concrete construction industries through construction site visits, demonstrations at fabrication facilities and presentation at industry trade shows, conferences and technical committee meetings.</p>\n<p class=\"Text\">The outcomes of this research are currently being used to develop new recommendations to produce more economical, sustainable and energy efficient building envelopes, especially for facilities susceptible to extreme or multi-hazard threats. This is particularly important, given the growing popularity of these systems in residential, commercial, recreational and government facilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/27/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Clay&nbsp;J&nbsp;Naito</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1543038/1543038_10394118_1545972535093_CoverPhoto_001--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1543038/1543038_10394118_1545972535093_CoverPhoto_001--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Project Overview\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1543038/1543038_10394118_1545972535093_CoverPhoto_001--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Project Overview\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image provides an overview of the DucTie connection system developed as part of the NSF research effort</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Matthew Gombeda</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Clay&nbsp;J&nbsp;Naito</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Project Overview</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1543038/1543038_10394118_1545420882381_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1543038/1543038_10394118_1545420882381_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2 -
