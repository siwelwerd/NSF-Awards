 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is a global array of radio telescopes operating in unison to undertake 1mm wavelength Very Long Baseline Interferometry imaging of the black holes in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy and the core of the radio galaxy M87.  The EHT may potentially be able to image the close environs of these black holes, near the event horizon, the region where the gravitational pull of the black hole is so powerful that not even light can escape. This conference brings together the growing community of researchers interested in this topic. Funding via this award will support other investments NSF is making in this area.\r\n\r\nStudent training, outreach, and integrating junior researchers into the collaboration are important for STEM training in general and for building the EHT community. Supporting the travel of students and junior researchers to the 2014 collaboration conference is the top priority of this award.  The proceedings of the workshop will be linked on the EHT2014 website after the meeting concludes. In addition to slides and abstracts, audio and video recordings of talks will be included.   There will also be a public lecture by the PI during the conference.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) is the first astronomical instrument capable of imaging the boundary of a black hole. This boundary, known as the event horizon, is the point at which the gravitational field of the black hole is so intense, that even light cannot escape.  At this 3-dimensional surface surrounding the black hole, light travels on curved paths due to the gravitational field and a ?shadow? feature - a ring of light surrounding a dark region - is formed.  If astronomers could directly observe this unique signature of strong gravity, tests of Einstein?s theory of gravity could be carried out at the edge of a black hole where.  To do this requires a telescope with a magnifying power equivalent to that of being able to see an orange on the moon.  The EHT links radio dishes around the world to form a virtual Earth-sized telescope with the necessary magnifying power: about 2000 times that of the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nThe collaboration funding and building the EHT is international and includes many Universities and institutes.  This award funded travel for young and senior scientists to attend an EHT collaboration meeting where a range of exciting topics were discussed: the science behind black holes, how to assemble an Earth-sized array, and planning for upcoming observations that will be the first to attempt imaging of a black hole. \n\nThrough this award, participation by key scientists and students was enabled, and the resulting program of talks on black holes from many perspectives was captured on a website that is now available for the public to learn from and enjoy.  The EHT team is delighted to make these learning materials available to a broad audience, and the project is grateful for the opportunity to pursue science at the cutting edge.\n\nThe conference website can be viewed at:\n\nhttp://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/conferences/eht-2014\n\nand more details about the EHT are available at:\n\nhttp://www.eventhorizontelescope.org/\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/04/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sheperd S Doeleman"
