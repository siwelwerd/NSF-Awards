 "awd_abstract_narration": "Auerbach (1512442) - The study involves theoretical calculations aimed at understanding the complex catalysis involved in converting biomass-derived organic compounds to liquid fuel precursors in the confined spaces of zeolites while avoiding deactivation due to coke formation.  A novel theoretical approach will be employed that will be benchmarked against experimental data.  The PI will also incorporate aspects of his research into educational and outreach programs including an immersive summer science experience for middle- and high-school girls.\r\n\r\nThe proposal builds on recognition that selective conversion of biomass-derived organic species to longer-chain liquid fuel precursors and the undesired reaction to form coke, are both examples of carbon-carbon bond forming reactions, and thus amenable to theoretical methods that provide insight into fundamental mechanisms of carbon chain growth as affected by zeolite structure and chemical properties.  Thus, the proposed work addresses both phenomena, but through a unique theoretical approach - \"metadynamics in reverse\" - by examining the more-straightforward carbon-carbon bond breaking process and appealing to microscopic reversibility to gain insight into the carbon addition reactions.  To this end, the PI will employ and extend several aspects of computational catalysis developed in his lab (in collaboration with the software firm SCHROEDINGER) to obtain accurate energetics of carbon bond forming and breaking while incorporating effects of framework dynamics and long-range forces, all while keeping simulation times manageable.  Specifically, the work will address how confinement effects in the zeolite cage influence the balance between the activation and condensation steps in aldol condensation.  The theoretical predictions will be benchmarked against related experimental studies carried out by his collaborator, Paul Dauenhauer.\r\n\r\nThe broader impact of the research is in the general insight it will provide on organic reactions in zeolite structures, especially the factors that control selectivity between condensation reactions to produce desired specific carbon-number products and unchecked carbon condensation to form coke.  In addition to the direct insight into the aldol condensation process, the theoretical techniques that will be developed and refined should have broad applicability to reaction processes in the confined environment of zeolite cages.  The PI has developed a strong education and outreach plan that incorporates aspects of his research while addressing studies showing that interest in science and math dwindles amongst girls during their middle-school years.  He also directs an inter-disciplinary program for undergraduate students at U Mass Amherst that forms teams of students to address real-world scientific issues, especially those dealing with biomedicine and renewable energy.",

Biofuels are renewable just like food: a new crop is grown each year, harvested, and converted into a useful energy source -- liquid fuels. And they are carbon-neutral because the process of growing a fuel crop removes the same amount of carbon-dioxide from the air as is emitted during the burning of the fuel inside a motor vehicle's engine as shown in Fig. 1</p>\n<p>Figure 1: Biomass cycle.</p>\n<p>Efficient conversion of feedstocks like plant-based materials to liquid fuels requires special chemical \"chaperones\" called <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">catalysts</span>, which help to steer the reactions towards desired products under mild, inexpensive conditions. Zeolites are nanoporous crystals that have shown great promise for converting plant-based materials into biofuels (see Fig. 2). For over 60 years, zeolites have been used as catalysts in the conversion of petroleum products to high-octane fuels, and as a result, enjoy the exalted status of being the most used synthetic catalysts on planet earth. We and many other investigators are fascinated by the challenge of figuring out how to use zeolites for making carbon-neutral biofuels.</p>\n<p>Figure 2: A zeolite nanoporous catalyst containing a guest molecule in its channel.</p>\n<p>However, cellulosic biofuels have remained too expensive for broad adoption because the process of converting materials derived from plants into biofuels also produces byproducts, and worse, these byproducts (often called \"coke\") can clog the pores of zeolites rendering them useless as catalysts (see Fig. 3). As such, there is a double loss: loss of precious carbon that could be converted to biofuels, and loss of catalyst material. These losses combine to make cellulosic biofuels more expensive and less widely adopted, thus extending the use of fossil fuels and their very high carbon emissions (more than 1900 million metric tons in 2018 in the USA; https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/commodities/carbon).</p>\n<p>Figure 3: Intermediate acyclic and cyclic molecules leading to biofuels and coke.</p>\n<p>There is thus a national imperative to understand more thoroughly the reaction mechanisms leading to biofuels and coke in zeolite nanopores, to maximize biofuels and minimize coke formation. To address this need, we have engaged in a computational study along with experimental collaborators to investigate the fingerprints of key molecular intermediates (so-called \"guests\") that can lead to either biofuels or coke in zeolite nanopores. We have focused on fingerprinting molecular intermediates using the way these molecules vibrate as their characteristic signatures, which can be probed using so-called infrared (IR) spectroscopy. We have computed IR spectra for several combinations of zeolite-guests using the most state-of-the-art approach: called \"periodic density functional theory\" (DFT) to yield accurate predictions. The combination of precise experiments and accurate DFT calculations leads to the most powerful chemical microscope: able to see molecular species and their vibrations with atomic-level detail.</p>\n<p>We have studied by acyclic and cyclic molecules in zeolites (see Fig. 3) to determine how their IR spectra vary with molecular shape for acyclic compounds, and molecular connectivity for cyclic molecules.

This is a very subtle distinction, so identifying the IR signature is an important advance. Also, trans-shaped molecules are normally more stable because they have more \"elbow room,\" suggesting we'd expect there to be more trans molecules than s-cis.
