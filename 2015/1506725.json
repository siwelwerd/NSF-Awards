 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professors Vachet and Rotello and their groups at University of Massachusetts, Amherst will develop a new mass spectrometry-based imaging approach to track nanomaterials in biological samples. Nanoparticles are increasingly used in applications that include drug delivery, sensing, imaging and therapy. In all cases, nanoparticles with the desired biological stability are required. Conversely, the increased presence of nanomaterials in commercial products raises concerns over the environmental and biological fate of nanomaterials. These new methods to be developed by Vachet and Rotello will provide quantitative insight into how to design nanoparticles of desired stability, from semi-stable materials used in drug delivery to much more stable materials that are required in commercial products. In addition to the envisioned scientific and societal impacts, the PIs propose to disseminate learned knowledge broadly through the National Nanomanufacturing Network (NNN) among the nanomanufacturing research, development and education community, as well as provide research opportunities to both undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented minority groups.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual merits of the proposed work lay in the development a dual mode imaging approach that can track nanoparticles based on both their core material and their functionalized monolayers. Specifically, Vachet and Rotello will use laser desorption/ionization (LDI) MS to track nanoparticles in tissues according to the monolayer molecules attached to the gold core and laser ablation (LA) inductively-coupled plasma (ICP) MS imaging to site-specifically monitor the extent to which nanoparticles stay still intact in biological systems. Vachet and Rotello will then use this new combined imaging approach to study the effect of nanoparticle surface chemistry, nanoparticle size, and tissue biochemistry on nanoparticle stability in tissues and organs from mice after intravenous (IV) injection of these NPs.",

The new imaging approaches are based on the combination of laser ablation inductively-coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and laser desorption/ionization MS (LDI-MS). The dual-mode imaging methods provide site-specific information about nanomaterials distributions and their stability, which is essential information for designing nanomaterials with the desired properties for a particular commercial application. Upon applying these techniques, we have discovered that surface charge dictates the distributions of nanoparticles in vivo, with charged nanoparticles being readily removed from circulation while neutral nanoparticles are more readily recognized by the immune system. We also find that certain organs and sub-organ regions of a given tissue impact the stability of nanoparticles. The liver readily degrades nanoparticles in vivo, much faster than occurs in comparable liver cell cultures. Nanoparticles are more stable in the spleen, but certain regions of the spleen, such as the white pulp and marginal zone can degrade certain nanoparticles faster than other. Finally, we find that some surface coatings provide greater stability for nanoparticles in vivo than others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader Impacts:</span> This research has several broader impacts. Nanomaterials are attractive as imaging and therapeutic agents and are found in an increasing number of commercially available products. We have developed powerful methods to monitor their stability in vivo, which should improve the design of new nanomaterials. Our methods also have the potential to transform the development of nanomaterial-based therapeutics by providing detailed information about how biological systems respond to targeted drug delivery systems. Long term, our work would contribute to better medical treatments. Another impact of this work is on the training of new scientists. Eleven PhD and undergraduate students received training as part of this project. Each was trained in the areas of nanotechnology and mass spectrometry, which are research areas that are having a broad impact in many fields of science and technology.
