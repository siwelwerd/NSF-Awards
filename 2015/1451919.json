 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increased nitrogen loading from human activities degrades water quality and threatens aquatic biodiversity.  It has long been assumed that as nitrogen loading to rivers increases, nitrogen production in the stream via biological nitrogen fixation (the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen gas to biologically available nitrogen) would cease. At the same time nitrogen loss via denitrification (the conversion of available nitrogen back to nitrogen gas) would increase, causing a net reduction in nitrogen in rivers and streams. Yet, recent work in estuaries and lakes suggests that high rates of both nitrogen fixation and denitrification can co-occur across a range of nitrogen loadings, challenging this widely-held assumption.  This research will provide fundamental understanding about the response of rivers to anthropogenic nitrogen enrichment and will enable better management of nitrogen cycling at regional and global scales. This work also seeks to create a more ecologically-informed citizenry by integrating ecosystem ecology techniques into GK-12 and undergraduate education.  The construction of a mobile analytical lab to facilitate sampling streams across the United States will be accomplished through a unique collaboration among engineering and biology-oriented undergraduates and faculty at Michigan Tech. The mobile lab will also be used to design new laboratory exercises for an undergraduate ecology course, support student research projects, and facilitate outreach to GK-12 students in the western Upper Peninsula of Michigan.\r\n\r\nThis study will apply new analytical techniques and new stream models in the context of observational and experimental manipulations of nutrient loading to test hypotheses on the balance between nitrogen fixation and denitrification across gradients of nitrogen loads in streams and rivers at the continental scale.  The study will address three fundamental questions:  (1) Do N fixation and denitrification co-exist in streams across a natural range of nitrogen concentrations, as they do in other aquatic ecosystems?, (2) Do \"hot spots\" and \"hot moments\", i.e., spatial and temporal heterogeneity, facilitate this co-existence?, and (3) Do increasing nutrient loads shift the balance to favor losses via denitrification? The study will capitalize on the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) as a continental-scale experimental framework to test the hypotheses through three interacting research elements: a gradient study of N2 fixation and denitrification (years 1-4), a multi-scale spatial and temporal study to identify hot spots and hot moments of N2 fixation and denitrification (years 2-5), and an experimental study of nutrient enrichment effects on N2 fixation and denitrification in streams (years 4-5). The project will use MIMS as a new analytical technique along with acetylene reduction and acetylene block assays to measure N fixation and denitrification, and to couple these measurements with reach-scale models commonly used to estimate stream metabolism to estimate denitrification and N2 fixation.",

Nitrogen fixation rates were detectable using the acetylene reduction assay in 13 streams across all substrates measured (rock, wood, sediment, macrophyte, etc), while denitrification was detectable on substrates in all study streams. Denitrification rates were ca. 250 times higher than nitrogen fixation rates when averaged across all streams. Microbial taxa capable of nitrogen fixation and nitrate reduction were detected on substrates across all study streams. Detailed spatial and temporal studies in a subset of streams showed that nitrogen fixation rates were often statistically related to surface water concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus and ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus, while denitrification was related to substrate type, dissolved oxygen concentration, and carbon availability. Yet most of these statistical models explained less than 20% of the variation in process rates, likely because the explanatory variables were measured at the reach scale, while process rates are actually controlled by factors on much smaller scales relevant to microbes. Moreover, in some streams we found that the two processes may co-occur on the same substrate (e.g., rock or sediment) and/or on adjacent samples, suggesting that fine-scale variation in environmental conditions may allow the seemingly incompatible processes to co-occur. Regardless of the mechanism, our results demonstrate that there is widespread potential for nitrogen fixation and denitrification to occur simultaneously in stream ecosystems, and we cannot assume that they are simply explained by high or low nitrogen concentrations. These results will help create more accurate riverine nitrogen budgets and models, which are required to better manage human effects on nitrogen cycling at regional and global scales.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this project were aimed at creating a more ecologically-informed citizenry by integrating ecosystem ecology techniques into undergraduate and graduate education.
