 "awd_abstract_narration": "There are over 600,000 aging bridges in the United States which have been subjected to extreme deterioration due to various mechanical and weather conditions, inadequate maintenance, and deficiencies in inspection and evaluation. Currently, manual Non-destructive evaluation (NDE) is a way to identify and predict early-stage bridge deterioration to enable proactive interventions for repair for bridges. However, the delivery of the current NDE technologies cannot meet the increasing demands for highly-efficient, cost-effective and safety-guaranteed inspection and evaluation. Hence the threat to safety of aging bridges has been recognized as a growing problem of national concern to the general public. The objective of this I-Corps project is to finalize and commercialize automated robotics systems for safety, efficient and cost effective of bridge inspection and evaluation. The typical customers of the proposed innovation are the Departments of Transportation and bridge management contractors seeking for a creative, efficient, low cost and safe bridge inspection tool.\r\n\r\nThis team has developed autonomous NDE robotic systems for bridge inspections. The proposed robotic system integrates NDE sensing technologies with recent advances in robotics and automation sciences that can inspect and evaluate the bridge efficiently and accurately in real time manner. The proposed project will generate knowledge and enabling tools for designing new robotic technologies for sustainable national bridge infrastructure. The development of two robotic prototypes, bridge deck inspection robot and steel bridge structure inspection robot, that combines NDE sensors with robotic sensing will provide new methodologies to fuse heterogeneous sensing technologies for accurately detecting hidden defects inside bridge structure and deck. The development of the non-destructive robotic inspections will provide new designs for safe, efficient and less costly bridge inspection. The proposed work will draw from current robotics advancements to provide a new and unique approach to bridge maintenance. This will represent a major advancement within civil engineering and the on-going bridge maintenance challenges within our highway infrastructure.",
