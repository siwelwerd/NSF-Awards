 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to Harvard University's Harvard Forest is supported by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) and the Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) in the Directorate for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS). The REU program, located in Petersham, MA, will support the training of 12 students for 11 weeks during the summers of 2015- 2019. Research will focus on collecting, visualizing, analyzing, and communicating ecological \"Big Data\". Students will be mentored by researchers who are conducting innovative forest ecology research. The program aims to meet five overarching objectives: 1) Enhancing the ability of students to undertake high-quality interdisciplinary research; 2) Building teams of researchers in which students bring different strengths to the table, collaborate on cutting-edge projects, and find their own intellectual \"voice\"; 3) Encouraging students to link fundamental and applied issues in science; 4) Communicating research findings to a wide range of audiences; and 5) Cultivating the next generation of ecological scientists and educators that reflects the diversity of backgrounds and experiences of students in the United States. The Harvard Forest REU program actively recruits students from a broad spectrum of cultural, economic, educational, and ethnic diversity. The Harvard Forest's commitment to diversity was recognized with the 2014 Human Diversity Award from the Organization for Biological Field Stations. Over the next five years, the program is committed to enhancing diversity and cultivating the next generation of scientists. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 60 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present their results at scientific conferences. Students participating in collaborative groups are fully involved in the development and execution of projects on the cutting edge of ecological research. Students are also encouraged to develop independent projects that reflect their own interests and observations. Students participate in workshops on ethics, scientific writing, and presenting and analyzing data.\r\n\r\nStudents maintain contact with Harvard Forest so that the impact of the Summer Research Program on their career progress can be assessed. Demographic data about students are collected through responses to emails sent via the NSF reporting system. More information is available by visiting http://harvardforest.fas.harvard.edu/other-tags/reu, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Aaron Ellison at aellison@fas.harvard.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Andrew Richardson at arichardson@oeb.harvard.edu).",

In the same interval, the proportion of applicants from minority groups (African-American, Hispanic, Native American, Native Alaskan, Pacific Islander) grew from near zero to its current 16-20% (Fig. 1 top panel). During this grant period, we sustained high proportions of applicants from minority and female applicants. The relative numbers of applicants (2015?2019) among academic years and institution types also has remained steady.</p>\n<p>Every year, 20 to 30 students participate in the HF Summer Research Program. In the most recent grant period, an average of twelve students/year were supported by REU Site funds; the others were supported by REU Supplements, other grants from NSF, private donors, and Harvard University. Some students received partial funding through their home institution (e.g., our women's-college partners). Female participation (Fig. 1., purple) is somewhat higher than the application pool and exceeds the proportion of 18-25-year-old women in the general population. Minority participation (Fig. 1., turquoise) has increased sharply from 10-12% to an average of 45% over the past ten years, reflecting the proportion of post-millennial (1997-2012; 48%) minority individuals in the general population.

(2016, BioScience 66: 1070-1078) published the results of our pre- and post-survey assessing student gains. Between 2005 and 2015, we sent the survey to all 263 Summer Program participants; 79% completed it. Results, controlled for prior experiences, revealed significant improvements across all learning goals. Prior laboratory research experience and perception of being a respected member of a research team were positively associated with gains in research skills and abilities to do and present research. All students reported gains in research skills, but students without prior experience gained more than students with prior experience. Although the pre- and post-surveys did not indicate changes in the students? goals of pursuing STEM and/or environmental careers, the positive learning gains suggest that students with prior interests in STEM fields solidified their aspirations. Beginning in 2016, we implemented an IRB-approved longitudinal study of program participants.</p>\n<p>We send an annual survey to all HF REU program alumni, to track educational and career paths of participants, and to assess long-term program impact on educational and career goals.

Most alumni are working or studying in an environmental field (68%). Some are in engineering and computer science (10%), reflecting the interdisciplinary nature of our program. The percent of alumni who ranked the importance of the HF REU program as ?extremely important? or ?very important? in defining their long-term career goals was high not only among current undergraduates (67%) and graduate students (73%), but also most of those in the workforce (57%), demonstrating that our program?s influence persists.
