 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Description of Significance and Importance\r\n\r\nLocal governments face complex crosscutting policy issues that transcend traditional administrative silos organized around function. When a single issue or objective crosses multiple independent units, collective action and coordination problems can arise from fragmented authority. Local sustainability is a broad and complex issue and provides an ideal lens through which to study these organizational challenges. Despite the widespread adoption of sustainability goals by local governments, an administrative apparatus to coordinate their implementation is lacking or inconsistent in many communities. This research examines the impact that different administrative arrangements have on policy efforts and outcomes and assesses the institutional structures necessary to facilitate the success of local sustainability efforts. Functional coordination and collective action problems within a single government are similar to institutional collective action problems that arise from fragmented governmental authority within metropolitan areas. In both cases, the connectedness of services, objectives, and resource systems produces positive and negative externalities. Resolution of these dilemmas requires additional resources and expertise, as well as the development of administrative structures to integrate decision-making. This work intends to initiate a general theory of institutional collective action that encompasses administrative dilemmas within as well as between organizations. It proceeds in two stages: First, it will collect quantitative data on administrative institutions via surveys administered to local government officials. Second, eight cities will be selected for in-depth analysis based on characterizations developed from their survey responses. An analytic narratives approach and social network analysis will be applied to explore the mechanisms available for overcoming functional collective action dilemmas in local sustainability. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nAlthough functional coordination has long been a concern within public administration, these issues are not emphasized in contemporary policy theories. Little is known about how the design of administrative mechanisms influences organizational ability to integrate decisions and resolve functional collective action problems. Even less is known about how administrative mechanisms affect policy outputs and outcomes at the organizational level. Through an exploration of city sustainability policy, this research will initiate a theory of functional collective action that extends institutional collective action research beyond its current focus on horizontal and vertical fragmentation among independent governments. Findings will provide insight to address the common problem of \"fuzzy boundaries,\" whereby the lack of clear lines of responsibility for tackling complex policy issues necessitates more coordinated efforts. This research will systemically identify the strengths and weaknesses associated with different mechanisms for overcoming functional collective action and enable municipalities to make more informed choices and minimize administrative dilemmas within as well as between organizations. The results of this analysis are expected to be of applied value to local government practitioners. Additionally, the empirical survey data collected from this research will contribute to the broader study of urban governance and policy in the US and enable researchers to better examine sustainability and local government administration questions.",

As a result of their innovative efforts to advance environmental, social and economic well-being, both within their jurisdictions and larger society, cities are increasingly being recognized as leaders in sustainability policy. However, because it is a broad and complex objective, its success requires coordinated action among the multiple administrative and functional units that are responsible for carrying out relevant activities and services. In the absence of coordination, fragmented authority and individual agency decisions can lead to inefficient policy outcomes and stymie larger city-wide sustainability goals. The resolution of these service or function-based collective action dilemmas often requires the development of formal and informal administrative structures and processes for integration.</p>\n<p>This research used a mixed-method design to gain insight into how city governments organize to administer their sustainability initiatives and to develop a theoretically robust Functional Collective Action (FCA) framework. Our quantitative research included implementation of the Smart and Sustainable Cities and Towns survey. The survey collected information on cities&rsquo; sustainability priorities, the allocation of administrative responsibility for the design and implementation of sustainability initiatives, the formal and informal mechanisms used to coordinate relevant efforts between departments, the status of a variety of sustainability-related policy actions, the extent of collaboration with various units inside and outside of the city government, and the perceived programmatic impacts of sustainably policy. The survey was administered to all US cities with populations over 20,000 (n=1,282) and 504 completed surveys were returned (39.3%). The data has been analyzed to assess broad patterns of activity and to test hypotheses related to FCA.</p>\n<p>The objective of the qualitative portion of the research was to develop a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the administrative approaches and mechanisms cities use to overcome FCA challenges in sustainability. Based on their responses to the survey, the following eight cities were selected as subjects for in-depth case studies: Orlando, FL; Providence, RI, Ann Arbor, MI; Oakland, CA; Gainesville, FL; El Paso, TX; Ft. Collins, CO; Kansas City, MO.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Findings</strong></p>\n<p>The quantitative assessment enabled our construction of a 10,000 foot view of local sustainability initiatives in the US as well as the development of a general understanding of the key administrative and organizational factors that affect their outcome. For example, the number of different city government units that share responsibility for sustainability emerged as particularly important. On average, six units are involved and Figure 1 shows the distribution across the 504 cities in the sample. Having more units actively involved in sustainability design and implementation was found to increase the scope and integration of cities&rsquo; efforts, but also increases the potential for FCA challenges. Other findings from the analysis of survey data point to the importance of having a dedicated sustainability staff, but suggest that their location within the city organization does not, in and of itself, meaningfully shape outcome.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Figure 2 introduces the FCA framework and depicts the four general approaches that cities can use to overcome FCA challenges. Figure 3 shows how our case study cities align with each approach.</p>\n<p>The findings from the qualitative analysis provide a nuanced understanding of the dynamics and mechanisms associated with each approach. For example, the City of Orlando utilizes Lead Agency Coordination to overcome FCA challenges. Figure 4 lists the key formal and informal mechanisms it employs to coordinate activities across units to achieve its specific sustainability objectives. Across all eight cities, variations of these mechanisms provide order and predictability to decision making. The most important factor enabling cities to successfully overcome FCA challenges in sustainability is consistently the &ldquo;influence&rdquo; of the headquarter department. A number of factors shape this influence, as shown in Figure 5.</p>\n<p>A key intellectual contribution from our research centers on theory development; the Functional Collective Action framework builds on theories of local governance, bureaucracy and political institutions, and public administration literatures. Although we develop and apply FCA to the topic of sustainability, we posit that FCA challenges and the mechanisms reviewed to overcome them are relevant far beyond issues of local sustainability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/28/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rachel&nbsp;M&nbsp;Krause</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461526/1461526_10355652_1532813015227_NSF_report_F1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461526/1461526_10355652_1532813015227_NSF_report_F1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1: Distribution of number of city units involved in sustainability\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461526/1461526_10355652_1532813015227_NSF_report_F1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1: Distribution of number of city units involved in sustainability\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Distribution of the number of administrative units involved in the number of sustainability initiatives across US cities.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Krause, Hawkins, Feiock</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rachel&nbsp;M&nbsp;Krause</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1: Distribution of number of city units involved in sustainability</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461526/1461526_10355652_1532813344045_NSF_report_F2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461526/1461526_10355652_1532813344045_NSF_report_F2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2: Arrangements for Facilitating Functional Collective Action\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1461526/1461526_10355652_1532813344045_NSF_report_F2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2: Arrangements for Facilitating Functional Collective Action\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Four general organizational arrangements utilized to overcome FCA challenges.
