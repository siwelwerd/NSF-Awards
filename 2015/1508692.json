 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Yu Huang of the University of California Los Angeles is establishing an electrical transport spectroscopy (ETS) measurement approach for in situ probing electrochemical surface of metallic nanomaterials during electrocatalytic reactions. Their study can offer new fundamental insights on the correlation between the structural/compositional/chemical characteristics of diverse electrocatalysts with their electrocatalytic performance, leading to the development of a new generation of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts for diverse energy technologies and improved energy efficiency, including fuel cells, batteries, and other important electrochemical and photochemical processes. The research program will actively recruit female students and students from underrepresented groups to participate in the proposed research. Through existing school programs, Professor Huang will continue to design science projects and offer research opportunities for local and national high school students.\r\n\r\nWith a specially designed device structure based on metallic nanowires and electronic measurement configuration, Professor Huang's group will conduct in situ electrical transport measurement of the metallic nanowires, simultaneously with in-device cyclic voltammetry. This method exploits the surface-adsorption induced diffusive scattering to produce an electronic signaling pathway for in situ monitoring of the electrochemical interfaces between the metallic nanostructures and electrolyte under different electrochemical conditions. After initial validation on the ultra-fine platinum nanowires (PtNWs) model system they will conduct systematic investigations of a wide range of nano-electrocatalysts for fundamentally and/or practically important electrochemical processes.",

Therefore, we used a newly-developed on-chip signaling method to in situ probe electrochemical interface of metal catalysts. Utilizing the concurrent nanoelectronic measurement of metallic nanocatalysts during electrochemical reactions, which only respond to surface adsorbed species through surface scattering of the conduction electrons, the resulting electron transport spectroscopy (ETS) provides significant surface specific signals that reveal its surface states in action. Here, we have used ETS to investigate the adsorption of anions (such as sulfate, halides, and cyanides) on ultra-fine platinum nanowires (PtNWs). Anions from electrolyte or undesired contaminations often cause competitive adsorption on the catalyst surface, which could significantly block the adsorption of electroactive reactant molecules or hinder the formation of intermediate species. We demonstrated that surface adsorbed anions can substantially alter the surface scattering of PtNWs and generate significant nanoelectronic signals to give unique ETS characteristics. The specific anionic adsorption on PtNWs surface can be &ldquo;visualized&rdquo; via ETS characteristics and detailed analysis of ETS results provide direct (and quantitative) information on the competitive anodic adsorption models and provide valuable insights to unravel such rich complexity in these surface interactions. We further showed that the ETS studies of competitive adsorption of mixed anions, showing a potential route to address the problem of undesired anionic chemisorption that caused negative effect to the practical energy devices. In addition to the ETS investigation of metal nanomaterials based electrocatalytic systems, we also expanded the application of ETS to chemical sensing. We demonstrated that the ultrafine PtNWs have ultrahigh sensitivity to H<sub>2</sub>. We also demonstrated the sensitivity and selectivity of such H<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>sensors can be readily tuned by modifying the surface adsorbed molecular ligands, which offers an easy and effective solution to tackle the general challenges of selectivity in sensor applications.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In summary, we showed ETS can serve as a powerful tool for the in situ characterization of electrochemical interface during electrocatalytic reactions. Complementary to the traditional electrochemical or spectroscopic strategies, the ETS approach provides sensitive and surface selective signals with considerable precision and accuracy for the qualitative and quantitative analysis at low level of target analytes. In addition, ETS measurement offers important insight on the correlation between surface adsorption states with electrocatalytic performance, which is crucial for the continued optimization of electrocatalysts in real-world energy conversion devices. We future showed that the basic principle of ETS can be used in other research fields, such as chemical sensing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/25/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Yu&nbsp;Huang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1508692/1508692_10402228_1537901133129_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1508692/1508692_10402228_1537901133129_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"In situ ETS of halide adsorption on Pt surface\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1508692/1508692_10402228_1537901133129_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"In situ ETS of halide adsorption on Pt surface\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This figure shows the experimental set up and the basic principle of on-chip electrochemical and nanoelectronic measurements of PtNWs.
