 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this collaborative research project is to measure the information content of different artifacts used in early design no matter how the design is described, and also to study the growth of information, or reduction of uncertainty, in the early stages of engineering design.   Information of various types is produced and used in design, and each may be expressed in different forms, such as pictures, text, symbols, or animation.  A general design representation is being developed to translate any type of design information into a neutral form.  Second, metrics are being created to measure the information content of artifacts based on this neutral representation, along with tools to quantify the information content of designs.  Models developed on an earlier project will be used to validate the information metrics by experimentally measuring how information within different designs, as measured by the metrics, can reduce design uncertainty.  \r\n\r\nIf successful, this research will transform the methods for control and evaluation of engineering design projects.  With information measurable in the context of decisions, computer tools and formal methods could be built to measure the progress of design projects in terms of the information used and decisions made, rather than the more indirect metrics used today, such as time elapsed or money spent.  This research will stimulate new research into the understanding and measurement of the \"state of knowledge\" of a design team. By having a way to measure knowledge state, it could be possible to quantify the designer's knowledge gain throughout a design project, which could lead to new tools and methods for evaluating a design team's capability in retaining and reusing knowledge between projects, and for objectively assessing the learning curves of student design teams. The findings of this research will be integrated into design-related courses at each university in order to improve students' appreciation for \"learning by doing\" and give them a better feel for the complexity of decision-making in engineering design.",

It starts with needs and ends with a solution, both of which are information types.&nbsp; Between these two terminals, information is transformed from one form to another.&nbsp; Among these, text and sketches are the most pervasive forms used in the early design.&nbsp; Understanding design in terms of these transformations is difficult because these transformations are numerous and often too fast to observe.&nbsp; This project helped cross that barrier in demonstrable ways, esp. for text and sketches.&nbsp; The outcomes are discussed below.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Evidence of chunking during ideation sketching</strong>: A series of experiments performed on human engineers shed new lights on the cognitive process of humans during creative ideation and sketching of new technical ideas.&nbsp; The results show that the formation of thoughts in the brain and their transfer to paper as pen strokes happen in a certain pattern, where periods of brain activity are separated by small pauses.&nbsp; These periods of activity result in clear functional units of the idea being produced that are recognized by the designer with unique names.&nbsp; This cognitive pattern is known as chunking.&nbsp; It is a well-known phenomenon in cognitive science, but its existence was not previously demonstrated in engineering ideation or sketching, which is a contribution of this research.&nbsp; <strong>Figure 1</strong> shows a concept sketched by a study subject presented with a novel design problem.&nbsp; The chunks formed through clustering of pen activities are differently colored here.&nbsp; Each color-coded cluster describes an object that is assigned a unique name by the designer, which shows the existence of chunking. &nbsp;<strong>Figure 2</strong> shows a time study of the designer?s pen activity, showing periods of activity (columns) and pauses (gaps), which visually illustrates the chunking effect.</li>\n<li><strong>Metrics to quantify the information stored in freehand technical sketches</strong>: Based on the empirical evidence of chunking, this research proposed a method to objectively measure the technical information stored in freehand sketches.&nbsp; Sketches are among the most popular representations of technical information, as engineers use them to generate, record, and convey technical ideas.&nbsp; A lot of technical data is contained in sketch form, yet there is no objective way to measure their information content.&nbsp; Measuring the information of sketches could enable the objective assessment of the value of a sketch, the rate and quantity of information generated in a design, or the creativity of a designer, along with permitting more in-depth research studies into the design process.&nbsp; To this end, this research proposes four metrics to quantify a sketch?s technical information based on the number of chunks and their functional and spatial relations.&nbsp; <strong>Figure 3</strong> shows a sketch, with the chunks labeled with numbers, and its corresponding entity-relation diagram (ERD), where the nodes are the named objects or chunks, and the relations are based on their spatial proximity.&nbsp; Based on this graph, four information metrics are proposed: raw count, arbitrary weighted count, weighted count by node cardinality, and Shannon?s information entropy. &nbsp;Further studies show that these metrics do in fact reflect the sketch?s visual complexity, which is one component of its information content.&nbsp; With this research, it is now possible to assign a numeric value to the technical information contained in a sketch, irrespective of the bytes required for computer storage.</li>\n<li><strong>An algorithm to separate and visualize the information units in plain-text technical data</strong>: This research produced a novel algorithm to separately account for the information units stored in technical data expressed in natural English.&nbsp; The algorithm determines the part of speech of each word in a sentence and then infers the word?s role in conveying meaning by classifying it as one of the four data types: entity, relation, attribute, or value.&nbsp; From this inference, the algorithm builds a graph to visualize the sentence as a diagram.&nbsp; This ability has enabled sophisticated reasoning, including automatic inference of the designer?s intent from the plain-English phrases written in a system-level function model and automatically generating detailed functional architectures, thus effectively automating the concept-generation task.&nbsp; This research is also being employed to analyze plain-text technical requirements from a U.S. defense contractor, including analyzing complexity, dependencies, redundancies, ambiguities, or inconsistencies.&nbsp;
