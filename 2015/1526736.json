 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will study big network data, including but not limited  to those generated by communication using mobile devices and online social media.  The increasing availability of such datasets poses both opportunities and challenges. On one hand, their relatively easy collection and analysis facilitate the understanding of online human activity and the design of better services. This, however, requires that targeted answers can be efficiently provided based on limited (sampled or aggregated) data. On the other hand, the combination of big data and powerful inference techniques poses privacy concerns and an increasing need for effective anonymization techniques. \r\n\r\nThis project will address both aspects and will advance the state of the art in network modeling and analysis. In the first part of the project, adaptive link-trace sampling will be designed for ERGM inference of network structure and/or attributes and for node-level analysis. Time series analysis will be applied to aggregate spatio-temporal network activity data to infer and predict patterns. In the second part of the project, novel models and algorithms will be designed in order to generate synthetic networks that resemble real ones with respect to target characteristics of interest. The methods will be applied to simulation and anonymization of network data and can improve the understanding of the tradeoff between utility and privacy in this domain. \r\n\r\nFor further information see the project web site at: http://networkdata.calit2.uci.edu",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNetwork data - whether arising from social networks, mobile applications, or other user online or offline activities - is a vital resource for scientific and engineering applications, but also poses considerable challenges. Methodological challenges include: (i) effectively sampling from large networks and analyzing sampled network data, and (ii) generating synthetic graphs that resemble real networks with respect to particular properties.  Simulating networks with specific structural features, in particular, is a difficult problem that arises in many settings.  Simulated networks are necessary tools for algorithm testing and system evaluation, vital for prediction, and at the core of many inferential procedures.  Such networks can also be used as privacy-preserving proxies of sensitive relational data, allowing anonymization of large-scale data sets while retaining features of importance for scientific or commercial use.  \n\nIntellectual Merit: On the methodological side, this project  introduced (i) new techniques for working with sampled or incomplete network data and (ii) novel approaches to construction of synthetic graphs.  These contributions include a series of efficient algorithms for producing networks that preserve important features such as degree structure, degree mixing, attribute mixing, clustering, and community structure, while randomizing other features that the user does not seek to preserve. In addition to algorithm design and experimental evaluation, we have provided a number of theoretical results, including performance and quality guarantees as well as hardness proofs.  We also introduced techniques for improved modeling of incomplete network data, increasing the range of settings that can be studied by network analysis, and potentially reducing data collection costs.  On the application side,  we applied our techniques to develop privacy-enhancing technologies for online social networks and mobile devices, to infer urban ecology from city-wide cellular data, to study the association between personal networks and fear of crime, and to enhance wireless signal strength maps.  \n\nBroader Impacts: This project has led to new, freely available software tools that have been disseminated to the public, as well as a body of novel techniques that will improve the ability of system operators to protect user privacy and detect security threats.  The project trained several graduate students, including from STEM-underrepresented groups, who have since completed their studies and gone on to work in top research and industry positions.  Finally, our contributions to basic problems facing cellular carriers, mobile application developers, and online social networks have the potential to improve our understanding of user online behavior,  enhance online privacy, and contribute to the US economy.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/18/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Athina Markopoulou"
