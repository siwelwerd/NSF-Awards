 "awd_abstract_narration": "Milkweeds (Asclepias) are common and ecologically important perennial plants of North American grassland and forest ecosystems.  They are the only host plants of the monarch butterfly, a species of significant conservation concern.  Because milkweed species diversified over a short evolutionary time span, reconstructing their relationships is exceedingly difficult and requires examination of a large amount of data from across their genomes and powerful computational techniques.  This research will contribute to the development of new methods for more accurately determining evolutionary relationships when many species have been formed in rapid succession.  The results will have implications for better understanding the coevolution between milkweeds and monarch butterflies and the evolution of plant defense, as well as provide a robust evolutionary context for understanding the results of other scientific studies exploring aspects of plant reproduction, genome evolution, and other areas using milkweeds. The project will train postdoctoral fellows and graduate student in the latest phylogenetic and bioinformatics methods thereby training the next generation of phylogenetic biologists.\r\n\r\nThis research will demonstrate the feasibility of solving difficult phylogenetic problems at the species level in plants by employing improvements in next-generation sequencing techniques. The work combines methods for targeted sequencing of hundreds of specific regions of the nuclear genome applied to unusually large within-species sampling.  The project applies nuclear gene probes developed directly from Asclepias genome and transcriptome sequences to effectively target 768 genes and substantial amounts of their non-coding flanking regions.  Phylogenetically useful off-target sequences, (e.g., complete chloroplast genomes) are also obtained. By sampling 20 individuals per species, the approach will distinguish common causes of gene tree discordance: incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. An analytic workflow will be applied that incorporates simulation of incomplete lineage sorting and a combination of species tree inference methods that are effective even when introgression has occurred. Because current species tree approaches are constrained by a computational tradeoff between the number of loci and number of alleles that can simultaneously analyzed, the project will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of alternative methods.  The large sample of loci will also validate the recognition of species not currently accepted in Asclepias. Undergraduate and graduate student training in genomics, bioinformatics, and phylogenetics will target participants from underrepresented groups. Project outcomes will reach the broader scientific community and the general public through workshops held at scientific meetings, K-12 education modules focused on milkweed ecology and evolution, and demonstration exhibits at a public botanic garden.",

There are over 130 species of milkweeds exhibiting a tremendous range of variation in habitat, growth form, and flower characteristics. Because they use toxins and other strategies to defend themselves against the insects that feed upon them, milkweeds have served as important study systems for understanding the coevolution of plants and plant-feeding insects. For example, only milkweed species can serve as suitable food plants for monarch butterflies, one of the most familiar and charismatic insect species, but one that is of great conservation concern due to extreme population reduction in recent years. Milkweed species themselves are of great conservation concern due to habitat loss, particularly in prairies and wetlands, and two species are federally listed as Threatened by the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service. However, a full understanding of milkweed ecology and the evolution of interactions with insects has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of the evolutionary history of milkweeds.<br /><br />The primary goal of this project was to obtain a complete understanding of the phylogeny (evolutionary history) of two groups of milkweeds (<em>Asclepias</em>, Apocynaceae) totaling 70 species. We collected DNA sequences using genome sequencing techniques that target a panel of over 3,000 nuclear genes that represent sequence variation across the entire milkweed genome. However, because of the very rapid diversification of milkweeds, driven by a large number of new species being produced over a very short period of time, new approaches and technical advancements were necessary to carry out this research. Thus, we introduced the following analytical novelties: 1) we sampled many individuals from up to 45 populations for each of the 70 species in our target group of milkweeds; 2) we developed a user-friendly program for coding a source of DNA variation (insertion-deletion mutations) often ignored because of the lack of a simple-to-use tool for incorporating such data; and 3) our extensive data set was used to validate a new tool to objectively filter samples from our data set that are of insufficient quality, replacing the arbitrary methods that are commonly used, which increased the number of samples that we could analyze. The two new tools will be useful for ensuring that other researchers investigating the evolutionary relationships of any type of organism can maximize the usable data recovered from their experiments.<br /><br />We found that our new approach provided a clear reconstruction of the evolutionary history of our target group of milkweeds that was unattainable using traditional methods. For example, previous studies found uncertain or unexpected relationships of the species related to common milkweed (<em>Asclepias syriaca</em>). However, we found strong support for the hypothesis that showy milkweed (<em>Asclepias speciosa</em>) is the closest relative of common milkweed. This result confirms the close relationship suggested by the overall morphological similarity of these species and their frequent hybridization in nature. Further, our new results also have shed light on and refined our understanding of traits involved in adaptation to drought and resistance to insect feeding (e.g., plant hairs and waxes). Based on our findings, it appears that large increases in leaf hair density are a recent evolutionary phenomenon in milkweeds that may be associated with colonization of more open areas with pronounced dry seasons.<br /><br />Our project involved the training of the next generation of scientists, including one postdoctoral researcher, one graduate student, and 27 undergraduate researchers enrolled at Oklahoma State University and Hobart and William Smith Colleges (New York), in addition to workshops that were held to provide students and other researchers training in the use of genome sequence data in phylogenetic research. Elementary school students in the Geneva City School District (New York) summer school program were exposed to new ideas and learned about science through monarch and milkweed themed presentations, crafts, and games designed and presented by undergraduate students working on the project. A milkweed education display was installed at the Botanic Garden at Oklahoma State University that provides information about the importance of milkweeds in prairie ecosystems and their role as host plants for monarch butterflies.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/05/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mark&nbsp;Fishbein</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457510/1457510_10359547_1628201340282_syriaca2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457510/1457510_10359547_1628201340282_syriaca2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Common Milkweed (Asclepias syriaca)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457510/1457510_10359547_1628201340282_syriaca2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Common Milkweed (Asclepias syriaca)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The common milkweed is one of the most widespread and well-known species of Asclepias in North America.
