 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide a service to the Earth Science community by organizing historic magnetotelluric data into an openly available and searchable database.  At present, magnetotelluric data from historical observational campaigns are not widely or easily available. Thus, a researcher planning an experiment is typically unaware of these data, with very limited (or no) access to previous data from the same or nearby areas, except through the published literature.  More complete and free access to these previous results would be a great asset in planning an observational campaign and would enhance the outcomes of research.\r\n\r\nMagnetotellurics is a geophysical method for inferring the earth's subsurface electrical conductivity from measurements of natural geomagnetic and geoelectric field variation at the Earth's surface.  Magnetotelluric data enable studies of Earth's deep crustal structure, investigating the distribution of silicate melts in the crust and mantle, and earthquake precursor research.  Commercial uses of the data include oil and gas exploration, geothermal exploration, mineral exploration, and groundwater monitoring.",

For this, MT employs very large-scale natural sources from the solar wind and lightning. Modern-day MT uses state-of-the-art instrumentation, data processing and analysis tools to provide valuable information about deep Earth structure. However, there is a longstanding need to modernize deeply historical MT data formats to a common standard that is fully documented, platform-independent, extensible, and accessible to the broader community of geoscientists. Within the framework of this project, we have led just such an effort.</p>\n<p>The outcomes of this project include a modern, self-decriptive MT data format, and the first openly available comprehensive database of magnetotelluric (MT) and related electromagnetic data (<strong>IRIS EMTF</strong>; <a href=\"http://www.iris.edu/spud/emtf\">ds.iris.edu/spud/emtf</a>) that we developed over the past decade but matured and populated with data in the framework of this NSF project. The database [<em>Kelbert</em> <em>et al</em>, 2011] is a result of collaboration between Oregon State University, the Geomagnetism Program at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology Data Management Center (IRIS DMC). Initial content of the database included hundreds of NSF-funded USArray MT data sites, but it has since been expanded to include contributions from historical data campaigns, restored from a variety of formats to homogeneous and readable new data format, <strong>EMTF XML</strong>. Versatile format conversion tools (<strong>EMTF FCU;&nbsp;</strong><a title=\"EMTF FCU\" href=\"https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/projects/emtf-fcu\" target=\"_blank\">https://seiscode.iris.washington.edu/projects/emtf-fcu</a><strong>)</strong>, have been developed to support conversions to and from EMTF XML. These tools are open source.</p>\n<p>The MT database is a helpful tool for MT scientists, and is widely used by the international scientific community in teaching, planning future surveys, and then to leverage the value of new data at the inversion and interpretation stage. It has also turned into a primary resource for researchers in space weather, and for the power grid industry. MT impedance, a data type that relates geoelectric fields to geomagnetic fields at the Earth&rsquo;s surface, provides a critical missing component for estimation of geomagnetically induced currents: quasi-direct currents caused by geomagnetic storms that can destroy valuable equipment and cause extended blackouts. We envision that this database will also be useful for researchers in other areas of geophysics, such as seismology, who would like to use real MT data for hands-on learning and joint inversion analysis. As of September 14, 2018 this international database included 5186 sites from 124 surveys collected in the scope of 16 projects. Of these, 3125 MT sites came from North America. We continue to solicit and receive community data contributions for long-term archiving.</p>\n<p class=\"AbstractNormalText\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"AbstractNormalText\">References:</p>\n<p class=\"AbstractNormalText\">Kelbert, A., G.
