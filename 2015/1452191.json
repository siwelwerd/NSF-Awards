 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the polar cap topside ionosphere, a heretofore poorly characterized region of geospace, using novel experiments with the Resolute Bay Incoherent Scatter Radars (RISR-N and RISR-C) together with observations from the Enhanced Polar Outflow Probe (ePOP), observations from the three Swarm spacecraft, and numerical experiments using the Ionosphere/Polar Wind Model (IPWM). Although this project focuses on one region of geospace, it also relates to the connections between this region and other parts of the high-latitude geospace system. The polar cap topside ionosphere is a transition region with the magnetosphere through which ion upflows and outflows are transported. The polar cap is also a transition region between the dayside and the nightside, across which a significant amount of plasma is transported.\r\n\tA new pulse sequence will be developed for the incoherent scatter radars to enhance the sensitivity to the topside. The following specific questions will be addressed: (1) What are the typical properties of the polar cap topside ionosphere? (2) Which physical processes control the day-to-day, intraday, and patch-to-patch variability of the topside scale height and related quantities such as plasma temperature and ion upflow/downflow flux? (3) What do the polar cap topside observations imply about conditions upstream, e.g. in the cusp/cleft, and above in the polar wind?",
