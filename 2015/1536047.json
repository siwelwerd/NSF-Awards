Researchers attend this forum to identify methods of improving their work, and seek feedback from fellow researchers on their work. For students, this is a valuable avenue to interact with other top-tier researchers. This award will support students at U.S. institutions to attend the 2015 ACM MOBISYS Conference which will be held in Florence, Italy, May 18-22, 2015. Priority will be given to students who will benefit from attending this workshop but are unlikely to attend due to the unavailability of travel funds. In addition, applications from female and underrepresented groups in higher education are greatly encouraged. \r\n\r\nThe requested travel funds will allow graduate students conducting research in the field to attend high-caliber technical presentations, be exposed to state-of-the-art research, and interact with leading researchers and fellow graduate students. The impact to the students' careers from attending ACM MOBISYS 2015 is expected to be substantial, since they would be unable to attend this event without the support of this grant.",
