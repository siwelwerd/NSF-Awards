 "awd_abstract_narration": "Precipitation processes, such as evaporation and condensation, have the ability to affect the large-scale weather systems in which they are embedded.  This research award will provide funding for a collaborative team of researchers to study how snowfall processes affect overall storm evolution.  The research will make use of ground-based instrumentation, remote sensing, and numerical modeling to gain a better picture of the profile of snowflakes in a storm and whether the models are representing the snow correctly.  Differences between the observations and the models will indicate the relative importance of snowfall processes in storm events.  The result of the award should be improved modeling for both weather and climate purposes and enhanced international scientific collaboration between the United States, Norway and Sweden.  Students would be educated and trained, ensuring the development of the next generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nThe research team plans to contrast real-world observations of the spatial and vertical distributions of snowfall with the representation in numerical models, and seek to quantify the impacts of any differences on storm evolution.  The goal would be to better define the relationships between microphysical and dynamical processes for three meteorologically distinct high-latitude meteorological extremes (Alaska, Norway and Sweden).  The observational component of the research will include in-situ measurements of snowflake statistics using the Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera and remote sensing from radars using an existing satellite radar snowfall retrieval scheme.  The modeling aspect of the work would be performed using the HARMONIE, ECMWF-IFS, and WRF systems.  Three main objectives will be addressed in the project:  1) Quantify real-world vertical profiles of snowfall microphysical properties with uncertainties at each site, 2) Compare observations of the vertical profile of precipitation properties with their representation in numerical model for different synoptic conditions, and 3) Evaluate the impact of discrepancies in modeled and observed precipitation profiles on potential vorticity modification for forecast storm events at each site.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHigh-latitude weather comes in many forms from large, cold, mid-winter light snowfall that gradually accumulates over many days to short-lived, intense polar lows with winds so strong they are sometimes referred to as Arctic hurricanes.  The strength of winter storms at higher latitudes and the amount of snow they produce depend on many factors including where the air within the storm originated and the amount of heat released by the precipitation it produces.  Because it is difficult to make measurements in remote, cold, snowy regions, some important questions remain concerning how high-latitude winter storms develop and evolve that lead to uncertainty in weather forecasts and impact the everyday lives of people who experience these events.\n\nThe goal of this project was to improve our understanding of the causes differences between the structure and intensity of distinct snow events using data from three high-latitude research sites that experience different types of winter storms: Alaska, Norway, and Sweden.  By deploying instruments capable of measuring snowfall accumulation, photographing the individual snow particles that make up this snowfall, and profiling the clouds that produce it, we linked the characteristics of many different high-latitude snowfall events to environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, and winds.  These measurements were then used to evaluate how well weather models predict surface snowfall and the amount of ice contained in the clouds from which it fell.\n\nThe project has provided new information about the distinct snow regimes commonly observed at these sites and the mechanisms responsible for the often very different snowfall characteristics.  We found that the strongest systems, observed in Haukeliseter, Norway, were generally associated with turbulent conditions that featured alternating periods where snow particles were observed to move upward for several minutes before falling again to the surface.  These ?pulsed? events were very deep, with large amounts of ice extending several kilometers above the ground, featured very large snow particles (or clumps of particles) at the surface, and produced high snowfall rates.  Conversely, events with more uniform fall speeds indicative of less turbulent conditions, were shallower, had clouds with lower ice contents, and generated less snowfall at the surface.  At the colder temperatures characteristic of the higher latitude site in Kiruna, Sweden, snowfall also exhibited pulsed and steady snow events but both sets of conditions featured lighter snowfall rates and smaller, more pristine snowflakes. A third regime consisting of very shallow, very light snowfall was also observed in Kiruna.\n\nBesides furnishing a better understanding of high-latitude snow events, this project supported two graduate students in the U.S. and supplied data used by two other graduate students in Norway and Sweden.  It also generated three peer-reviewed publications and was the source for several conference presentations describing the results.  The measurements collected during the project now serve as a rare resource for other researchers to further understand the processes involved in generating high latitude snow events.
