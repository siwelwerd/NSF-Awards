 "awd_abstract_narration": "This U.S.-Polish International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project creates a unique three-year opportunity for U.S. students to acquire early career research experience abroad in the fields of biology and chemistry of natural products. Through a combined program of field and laboratory research this IRES provides a rare opportunity to prusue discovery of new species, new chemical diversity, and insights into environmental interaction and biological synergy in one of the best preserved medieval forests in Europe, the Bialowieza Forest of Poland. The engagement of U.S. and Polish mentors with expertise in ecology, forestry, biology, chemistry, plant sciences, and mycology will assure the scientific success of this interdisciplinary project. By focussing on biological and biochemical characterization of select plants and fungi, the US-Polish team expects go gain a better understanding of novel plant and fungi biodiversity. Special attention will be devoted to study of the metabolites and ecological roles of diverse natural chemical compounds found in such natural settings.  From an educational perspective, this three-year IRES should provide exceptional access to a unique environmental setting for U.S. student participants along with the opportunity to work side by side with renowned European scientists as they gain valuable early career research experience.\r\n \r\nThe IRES project supports the participation of four U.S. students annually (two undergraduate and two graduate) for the three-year duration. U.S. student participants spend six weeks abroad in the area of the Bialowieza Forest working together with their U.S. and Polish mentors and Polish students on complementary, thematically-linked research projects. Pre-trip training includes both technical and cultural preparation.  Post-travel follow-up by the PI and University of Mississippi staff continues with scientific mentoring and career advise. For borader impact, new insights based on the study of the ecology, biodiversity, and chemical diversity of Bialowieza Forest are expected to contribute to refining future strategies for management and conservation of such rare biological resources. Results will be disseminated through websites, presentations, workshops, and scholarly publications. Overall, the cooperative activities of this IRES project are expected to enhance STEM education at all institutions involved, strengthen international partnering, and facilitate the development of a new interdisciplinary research collaboration that bridges biology and natural products chemistry.",
