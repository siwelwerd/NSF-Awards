 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical:\r\n\r\n3D printing is a fast-growing field that aims to create intricate three-dimensional structures of very precise specifications for a broad range of applications. Currently, 3D printing of plastic is a relatively common process and is often available in public libraries or service centers for a nominal fee. 3D printing has tremendous potential for applications in biology and medicine. For example, with a 3D printer, one could create structures of multiple cell types placed together with a precise geometry in a single Petri dish to replicate the types of cell interactions that are present in human organs. These engineered tissues could be used outside of the body to predict how different types of drugs may interact with humans or could be used inside the body to replace damaged tissues. However, the use of this technique to print cell-containing materials remains a difficult challenge. This is in part due to the unavailability of bio-inks that are both cell-compatible and have the physical and chemical properties required to be printable. Here, the PIs plan to develop a family of bio-inks with the properties required for printing as well as the ability to protect cells and maintain their viability during and after the printing process. This project has the potential to develop a novel, sophisticated family of bio-ink materials that may have great therapeutic impact. Additionally, women and under-represented minority (URM) graduate and undergraduate students will be introduced to a variety of scientific careers as well as the skills that may be required for these careers. This award will also facilitate the establishment of a 3D bio-printing facility at Stanford University, which will introduce students at the undergraduate and graduate level to novel processes in the field of engineering.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\n\r\nWhile 3D printing of thermoplastics is now routine, the rapid prototyping of cell-laden, polymeric constructs for biotechnology and medical applications is still restricted to specialized research laboratories. A key limitation preventing the widespread use of cell-based 3D printing is the lack of suitable bio-inks that are cell-compatible and have the required physico-chemical properties for printing. Here, the PIs plan (1) the design of a novel family of biomaterials with tunable biochemical and mechanical properties with the appropriate physico-chemical properties for use as cell-laden bio-inks, (2) the exploration of a two-stage crosslinking strategy to provide mechanical shielding during flow and to improve the resolution of printed structures, and (3) the spatial patterning of multiple biochemical and mechanical cues within an open-channel construct to guide cell behavior. During the course of this project, women and under-represented minority (URM) graduate and undergraduate students will be introduced to a variety of STEM careers as well as the skills that they may require through visits to local high schools, preparation of a 3D printing module for high school science teachers, and a summer intern research experience. Additionally, through the establishment of a 3D bio-printing facility at Stanford University, students at the undergraduate and graduate levels will be trained in the process of 3D bio-printing and the design and production of novel materials, preparing them for entry into engineering career paths in the workforce.\r\n",

Tissue engineering and three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting have emerged as promising avenues to create patient-specific tissues and organs that can be used for transplantation, without the need for organ donation. The goal of this NSF project is to design novel bio-inks that can help push forward 3D bioprinting technology, so that in the future we can print functioning organs for transplantation. Towards this goal, we designed a family of novel self-assembling bio-inks for cell-based 3D bioprinting, which we termed MITCH-Alginate. MITCH-Alginate utilizes a dual-stage crosslinking process: (1) The first stage of crosslinking uses protein-protein interactions to form a weak hydrogel within the cartridge of the bioprinter to prevent cell sedimentation and to protect cells during the printing process; (2) The second crosslinking step uses alginate and ionic crosslinking to stabilize and mechanically support the construct after printing. During this project, we demonstrated that: (1) several different cell types, including fibroblasts and human adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs), printed in MITCH-Alginate remained greater than 90% viable at multiple time points up to three-weeks following printing; (2) MITCH-Alginate has excellent print fidelity, maintaining the printed shape and resolution at a three-week time point; and (3) that we are able to tune the biodegradation rate of MITCH-Alginate by oxidizing the alginate portion of the ink to various extents. Taken together, we have demonstrated that MITCH-Alginate is a cell-supportive bio-ink that can be used to 3D bioprint various structures of interest with excellent resolution and fidelity, highlighting its potential to be used in printing more sophisticated structures. The results of this NSF project have been shared in several national and international conferences (including the TERMIS World Congress, Biomaterials Congress, International Conference on Biomolecular Engineering, and North American Vascular Biology Organization Meeting) and have resulted in the publication of a total of 25 scientific publications (including scientific articles and book chapters).</p>\n<p>In addition to scientific progress, this NSF project has also resulted in the recruitment and training of four graduate students (one MS and 3 PhD students) and four undergraduates in the field of 3D bio-printing.
