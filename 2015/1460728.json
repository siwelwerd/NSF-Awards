 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funded by the Chemistry Division supports a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site at that is designed to provide hands-on research opportunities to talented underrepresented minority (URM) students from two-year colleges throughout the United States where research opportunities are limited. The project is to bring in two-year college students to the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire during the summer for ten weeks to work on research projects with faculty in the departments of Chemistry, Biology and Materials Science. The project aims to enrich and empower URM students' learning through hands-on research, develops students' interest and competence in the STEM fields, and enables them to bridge from two-year colleges to four-year colleges, thereby enhancing their professional opportunities. This project will increase the number of URM undergraduate students conducting research at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. This increased diversity in the research environment in turn will strengthen the programs in Chemistry, Materials Science and Biology. Students will gain practical, hands-on research experience using modern instrumentation, and become immersed in a student-centered research environment at a four year institution.\r\n\r\nThe scientific research projects that students are to work on include synthesis of new cyclic mucin peptides and of new \"smart\" biphenyl and terphenyl derivatives, development of reversible self-assembled \"smart\" copolymers, the study of microstructures of superconducting wires and the study of nitrile-Group IV Lewis acids complexes. Other topics to be investigated include electron and hydride transfer mechanisms of quinone reductases, long range molecular communication and dynamics within the Pro-tRNA synthetases, the synthesis and study of the properties of new metal-mathanobactin nanoparticles and, finally, the distribution of atmospheric ozone and CO over and along Lake Michigan,",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe original intent of the project titled \"Give Research Opportunity to Underrepresented Minority STEM Students (GRO URMSS)\" is to recruit REU students to conduct research at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire for three  years.  The current year is its fourth year of \"No-Cost Extention\" year.  We were able to meet the goal of the No-Cost Extention period.  Two underrepresented minority students (both females) were recruited from the chemistry majors at the Chemistry Dept. at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire.  Both students were provided with stipends and funds for supplies for their research projects as intended by the original intent in the proposal and as proscribed by NSF.  Due to insufficient funds, the students could not be provided with free allowance of room and board during the ten weeks that they were conducting research in their mentors' laboratories during the summer 2019.

The two REU students were able to participate in other chemistry students' research seminars during the summer, though not a scheduled series of seminars.\n\nThe two REU students recruited, one conducted research in the area of analytical chemistry in Dr. Knoche-Gupta's laboratory.
