 "awd_abstract_narration": "The value of engaging students in course-based research experiences has become increasingly appreciated as more is learned about effective approaches to retaining students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) studies and preparing them well for future positions in the various fields affected.  The significance and importance of this project is that it is designed to introduce this experience into a community college on a large scale by helping a broad range of faculty, including adjunct faculty, explore, develop and assess sustainable strategies for integrating course based research experiences into lower-division transfer courses in biology and environmental science.  Adjuncts are an important resource on many community college campuses but they are often overlooked when campuses engage in broad change efforts.  \r\n\r\nThe goals and scope of the project are to prepare community college students (both STEM majors and those majoring in other fields) for opportunities available as they transfer to four year schools and to generally help these students realize their capacity for and interest in participating in scientific research efforts as well as help them realize how science is done and how it may affect them.  The project capitalizes on the unique variety of courses at Lane and their: integrated lecture/laboratory class formats; small class sizes; exceptional research sites; the longitudinal datasets being gathered on campus to advance knowledge in ecology and environmental science projects; the number of committed faculty; and the college's laboratory support capabilities. Faculty change models (AAAS, 2009) along with evidence-based undergraduate research models from other colleges (CUR, 2007) will be explored for their relevance and applicability by engaging adjunct faculty and full-time faculty in Faculty Learning Communities for professional development.  These faculty will discuss with and learn from each other how to transform their courses by integrating campus based research into the lecture and laboratory components of their courses. An estimated 2000 students a year will be engaged in doing science together with their professors.  Based on prior pilot studies at the college, the students will achieve measurable gains in scientific literacy and gain needed skills in science research as well as gain a sense of self efficacy as scientists leading to increased persistence in science majors.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education in support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/.",
