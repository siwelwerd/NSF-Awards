 "awd_abstract_narration": "The evolutionary origin of Cetacea (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) in the Eocene, >50 million years ago, ranks among the best-documented macroevolutionary transitions. To non-scientists, this move from a terrestrial habitat to a committed aquatic lifestyle might seem improbable, yet the wholesale changes in anatomy required for this transformation are recorded in the fossil record. With the advent of genomics, it is now possible to study this remarkable evolutionary change at the molecular level. In this project, researchers will document the genetic basis of traits that were altered in the evolutionary genesis of these secondarily aquatic mammals and trace the molecular changes that produced a modern whale. In this project, researchers will train a postdoctoral scholar, graduate students, and multiple undergraduate interns at UC Riverside, a minority serving institution. The ethnically diverse makeup of UC Riverside provides an opportunity to bring cutting edge research to students who are historically underrepresented in science. Results from the research also will be incorporated into coursework and provide content for museum displays focused on evolutionary principles. Grant participants, including students, will collaborate with staff at the San Diego Natural History Museum to relate exciting research breakthroughs in a revitalized 'Fossil Mysteries' exhibit with bilingual educational modules.\r\n\r\nFor Cetacea, standard phylogenetic analyses of fossil and molecular data have been used to reconstruct major phenotypic transformations in the group, with fossils providing signposts that place key evolutionary innovations relative to Earth history.  Yet, despite ongoing phylogenetic studies based on large datasets, a fully resolved reconstruction of cetacean evolution has been elusive. The researchers propose a three-pronged approach to an enhanced study of cetacean evolutionary history that will utilize >500 genes to: 1) compare alternate approaches to the reconstruction of species trees using a robust sample of genetic data, 2) resolve problematic systematic relationships within Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins), Phocoenidae (porpoises), and Balaenopteroidea (rorquals and gray whale), 3) synthesize a phylogenomic blueprint for modern cetaceans.  Exon capture and next generation sequencing methods will be employed to rapidly characterize candidate loci that represent genes predicted to have undergone adaptive or degenerative change. The researchers will target genes that are critical for behavioral and anatomical features that are highly derived in the group, including loci implicated in vision, hearing, olfaction, deep diving, aging, tooth development, baleen formation, and brain size.  The end result will be the first, detailed, genomic characterization of a major macroevolutionary transition that is also documented by extensive fossil evidence.",

At the completion of this project we generated whole-genome sequencing data for ~65 cetacean species, which is approximately two-thirds of the living cetacean species on Earth. Our analyses of genomic sequences provide robust support for some of the most contentious problems in cetacean phylogeny such as the evolutionary position of the pygmy right whale. In addition to developing novel methods for assessing genome-scale phylogenies, we reported new methods for building evolutionary trees using transposable genetic elements. These methods are widely applicable to other evolutionary studies because transposable elements are found in a broad range of organisms including diverse animals, plants, and fungi. We also developed a new test to detect hybridization between different species. Application of this test to transposable element data from cetaceans indicates that different species such as the blue whale and the gray whale have a history of hybridizing with each other in the geologic past. At the genomic level, we characterized mutations that are associated with the evolution of key anatomical and physiological traits that are found in different whales including the loss of smell in toothed whales, the loss of teeth in baleen whales, as well extensive modifications to the skin. We discovered the genetic basis for the loss of melatonin, also known as the sleep hormone, in the ancestor of all living whales. The loss of functional copies of genes that are responsible for melatonin production appears to be functionally linked to the evolution of uni-hemispheric sleep where only half of a whale's brain is asleep during rest. Finally, this grant proposal funded the design and production of a new exhibit on the evolutionary transition from teeth to baleen at the San Diego Natural History Museum. This bilingual exhibit is seen by thousands of K-12 school children each year and provides an opportunity for these children to learn how diverse scientific fields such as paleontology, developmental biology, and genomics can be integrated to study evolutionary patterns and processes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/04/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mark&nbsp;Springer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457735/1457735_10355239_1614870558150_Cetaceanhybridization--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457735/1457735_10355239_1614870558150_Cetaceanhybridization--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Gene Flow in Baleen Whales\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457735/1457735_10355239_1614870558150_Cetaceanhybridization--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Gene Flow in Baleen Whales\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The PIs developed a new approach to detect gene flow among lineages and showed that baleen whale phylogeny is marked by widespread evidence from transposons for introgression/hybridization (arrows in image).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Image from doi:10.1093/jhered/esz076</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mark&nbsp;Springer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Gene Flow in Baleen Whales</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457735/1457735_10355239_1614871793808_Timingofgeneloss--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457735/1457735_10355239_1614871793808_Timingofgeneloss--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Inactivation of Skin Genes in Whales and Hippos\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1457735/1457735_10355239_1614871793808_Timingofgeneloss--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Inactivation of Skin Genes in Whales and Hippos\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Evolutionary timetree for hippos, cetaceans, and an outgroup (cow) with estimated inactivation times (red triangles) for various skin and hair genes.
