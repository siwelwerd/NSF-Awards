 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports US participation in the Third Muenster conference on inner model theory, the core model induction, and hod mice that will be held July 20-21, 2015 at the Institut fur Mathematische Logik, WWU Muenster, Germany. \r\n\r\nThe conference will be devoted to recent work on the construction of canonical inner models via the core model induction method, and to the theory of hod mice upon which this work rests.  Large cardinal hypotheses play a central role in the set-theoretic foundations of mathematics. The inner model program attempts to  associate to each large cardinal hypothesis a canonical minimal universe of sets in which that hypothesis is true.  Some of our deepest understanding of large cardinal hypotheses come from this program. The core model induction method is our most powerful method for constructing such canonical inner models. This conference will be devoted to recent work that strengthens the method in important ways. The website for the conference is http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/logik/Personen/rds/muenster_meeting_2015.html.",
