 "awd_abstract_narration": "Marine paleoclimate archives show that approximately one million years ago Earth's climate transitioned from 40,000-year glacial /interglacial cycles to 100,000-year cycles. This award will support a study designed to map the distribution of one million year-old ice in the Allan Hills Blue Ice Area, Antarctica using state-of-the-art ground penetrating radar. The Allen Hills was demonstrated to contain a continuous record of the past 400,000 years and is also the collection location of the oldest ice samples (990,000 years) yet recovered. The maps resulting from this study will be used to select an ice-core drilling site at which a million-plus year-old continuous record of climate could be recovered. Ice cores contain the only kind of record to directly capture atmospheric gases and aerosols, but no ice-core-based climate record yet extends continuously beyond the past 800,000 years. A million-plus year-old record will allow better understanding of the major mechanisms and driving forces of natural climate variability in a world with 100,000-year glacial/interglacial cycles.  The project will support two early career scientists in collaboration with senior scientists, as well as a graduate student, and will conduct outreach to schools and the public.\r\n\r\nThe Allan Hills Blue Ice Area preserves a continuous climate record covering the last 400,000 years along an established glaciological flow line. Two kilometers to the east of this flow line, the oldest ice on Earth (~1 million years old) is found only 120 m below the surface. Meteorites collected in the area are reported to be as old as 1.8 million years, suggesting still older ice may be present. Combined, these data strongly suggest that the Allen Hills area could contain a continuous, well-resolved environmental record, spanning at least the last million years. As such, this area has been selected as an upcoming target for the new Intermediate Depth Ice Core Drill by the US Ice Core Working Group. This drill will recover a higher-quality core than previous dry drilling attempts. This project will conduct a comprehensive ground penetrating radar survey aimed at tracing the signature of the million-year-old ice layer throughout the region. The resulting map will be used to select a drill site from which an ice core containing the million-plus year-old continuous climate record will be collected. The proposed activities are a necessary precursor to the collection of the oldest known ice on Earth. Ice cores provide a robust reconstruction of past climate and extending this record beyond the 800,000 years currently available will open new opportunities to study the climate system. The data collected will also be used to investigate the bedrock and ice flow parameters favorable to the preservation of old ice, which may allow targeted investigation of other blue ice areas in Antarctica.",

A primary reason to recover old ice is to understand one of the major puzzles of climate system history: why did the climate system change from dominantly 41kyr to 100kyr glacial cycles about one million years ago? In addition, we want to evaluate the CO<sub>2</sub>-climate relationship prior to and across the major transition in the Earth's climate system to determine whether the long term cooling trend between 1.5 and 0.8 million years ago was related to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations.</p>\n<p>To achieve the primary project goal we used ground-based ice-penetrating radars to map ice thickness and internal structure of the blue ice fields in the Allan Hills, East Antarctica (see <strong><em>Radar-detected layers</em></strong>). Others have dated some of the layers that outcrop at the surface in the ablation zone using argon-argon methods to date volcanic ash, and by correlating stable-isotope measurements with records from the dated ice core at Dome C. We were able to track these dated layers upstream with our radars and establish depth-age relationships along the entire flow line. We used the measurements of ice thickness, dated stratigraphy, and existing measurements of surface velocity, and surface accumulation rate to constrain and validate a numerical model of the ice flow.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We found that matching the observed pattern of near-surface stratigraphy of the ice sheet required surface velocities and accumulation rates to be about 30% less than present during glacial periods (see <strong><em>Observed and modeled near surface&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>layers</em></strong>).
