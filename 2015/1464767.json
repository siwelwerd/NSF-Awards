The field of fluid dynamics has a long history going back to the works of Bernoulli and Euler. Despite its long history, fluid dynamics continues to be an active and exciting field of research, with many of its fundamental problems still wide open. For instance, the lack of a scientifically satisfactory understanding of turbulent phenomena, and questions regarding the long-time existence of the fundamental equations believed to govern the dynamics, are two well-known examples.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will bring together some leading researchers in the area of mathematical fluid dynamics, with emphasis on the application of partial differential equations to the study of the problem of fluid motion. The main goal of this workshop is to facilitate discussion and collaboration in a focused setting. In particular, the workshop will provide an ideal opportunity for graduate students and young researchers to interact with experts in the field.\r\n\r\nConference web site:  http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~disconmm/Shanks-2015/index.php",
