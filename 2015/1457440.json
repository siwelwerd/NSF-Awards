 "awd_abstract_narration": "Flowering plants are the most abundant and diverse form of plant life on Earth. This dominance is largely due to the evolutionary success of one group, the Pentapetalae, characterized by whorled flower parts in multiples of five, which account for over 70% of described species. In contrast, flower parts are arranged in multiples of three (monocots, for example), two, or a variable number in less abundant groups of flowering plants.  The shift to whorled pentamery of the Pentapetalae occurred about 100 million years ago, and appears to have been one of the most successful evolutionary innovations of not only flowering plants, but of green plants in general. This research will investigate the evolution of the underlying genetic changes that contributed to this ancient evolutionary event. It promises to discover the new and/or modified genetic pathways that produced the typical Pentapetalae flower, one of the major mysteries of plant evolution. Several undergraduates will be trained in phylogenetic and molecular biology methods and analyses, and high school teachers will participate in the research through a summer workshop.  Data generated will be shared freely online and will provide tools for other researchers and the public to investigate other questions about flowering plant evolution. \r\n\r\nThe researchers will sequence genes expressed during flower development in a phylogenetically representative sample of flowering plants and employ state-of-the-art transcriptome analysis techniques to achieve three major goals. Firstly, phylogenetic relationships among lineages subtending the Pentapetalae clade will be reconstructed. Robustly resolved phylogenetic relationships of the lineages preceding the shift to the pentamerous whorled flower are currently lacking but pivotal to interpreting the evolutionary sequence of genetic changes that underlie this key morphological innovation. Secondly, several comparative methods will be used to identify, date, and determine the evolutionary impact of whole-genome and/or gene duplication event(s) that predate the origin of the Pentapetalae. The occurrence of whole-genome duplication events prior to Pentapetalae is widely acknowledged but their precise positions are uncertain. Lastly, RNA-seq and in situ hybridization approaches will be used to infer spatial patterns of gene expression in non-Pentapetalae versus Pentapetalae flowers to identify gene expression changes that correlate with a shift to whorled pentamery in the latter. Together, this integration of approaches will provide exciting new insights into our understanding of flowering plant evolution",
