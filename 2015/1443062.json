Provision of these new metadata and data evaluation services across communities will improve the ability to integrate and reuse trustworthy data for crosscutting synthesis and analysis across science communities.  The focus on use metadata rather than discovery metadata is a significant shift in focus.  Use metadata is a fundamental building block needed to allow effective scientific analysis workflows.  The team builds a significant collaboration with several interdisciplinary partner organizations that provide guidance to this project.",
