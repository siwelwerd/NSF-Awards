 "awd_abstract_narration": "Freshwater ecosystems support a disproportionate percentage of Earth's biodiversity and are among the most threatened by human activities and global climate change. Insects dominate fresh-water ecosystems in terms of animal biodiversity and ecological processes. Temperature controls insect growth, developmental timing, survival, and reproduction, which influence both the distributions of individual species and the specific set of species that occur in different freshwater ecosystems. Thus, many effects of global change and other anthropogenic activities on freshwater ecosystems will likely be manifested through their thermal effects on aquatic insects. The thermal limits of individual freshwater insect taxa and the underlying physiological mechanisms that determine those limits still remain poorly understood.  This research has practical importance because resource agencies use aquatic insects and other invertebrates to make inferences about ecological health and water quality.  However, these data are often difficult to interpret, because we have a poor understanding of how and why species are differentially responsive to elevated temperatures. This collaborative project links researchers with a broad range of expertise to understand how temperature affects organismal physiology, life-history outcomes, and ultimately the distribution of species across entire landscapes. \r\n\r\nThe research team will experimentally manipulate thermal regimes to quantify the effects of temperature on life-history outcomes (survival, growth rates, development times, size and fecundity) of a diversity of mayfly (Ephemeroptera) species. Laboratory experiments will identify how the specific physiological processes that affect life-history outcomes (respiration, energy allocation, the production of metabolites, and gene expression) respond to different temperatures. These laboratory studies will be used to refine ecological niche models (empirically derived relationships between environmental temperatures and species distributions in time and space) that are used in freshwater biodiversity assessment and monitoring.  In particular, these studies will clarify which descriptors of environmental temperatures (e.g. mean annual temperature, mean summer temperature, the magnitude of diel thermal change, etc.) are most important to species performance. Ultimately, these studies are intended to provide a robust understanding of the linkages between thermal physiology, life-history variation, and species distributions.  Robust outreach efforts will make this understanding useful to the large ecological monitoring community.",

Insects dominate freshwater ecosystems in terms of biodiversity and ecological processes and are monitored worldwide because of their ecological importance. Temperature is known to influence several life-history attributes (individual growth, development, survival, and reproduction) that collectively limit the abundance and distribution of aquatic insect species. However, the underlying physiological mechanisms that determine those limits remain poorly understood, and we do not fully understand how temperature shapes either the natural distributions of species or how those species will respond to global climate change. In this project we tested the hypotheses that temperature limits the distributions of aquatic insects through its effect on resource allocation, and that warming decreases egg production by shunting energy to other metabolic processes. We performed full life-cycle laboratory experiments to quantify how fitness and other life-history outcomes of four species responded to temperature. We were able to identify important thermal landmarks for each species (see accompanying illustration for one species,&nbsp;<em>Neocloeon triangulifer</em>). These ranged from thresholds for growth and development at the low end to temperatures that resulted in complete mortality at the high end. Routine laboratory measures of upper thermal limits involve short term tests that ramp up temperature over a matter of hours to determine at what temperature animals expire. Our whole-life tests show that real-world upper thermal limits are substantially lower, and the temperature range within which species can maintain viable populations is quite narrow. The illustration shows a zone (in green) between 16 and 24 degrees C, in which this mayfly can thrive. Within this range as temperatures warm growth and development rates rise predictably, but adult size and fecundity drop steadily. Above 24 degrees both the growth and development rate as well as adult size and fecundity drop precipitously and even though a few individuals can survive as high as 28 degrees, they cannot maintain a viable population at this temperature. Each of the species we tested behaved similarly, but the actual landmark temperatures varied. Separate experiments were performed to show that it was temperature per se and not dissolved oxygen levels as affected by temperature which was the deciding factor. We also provided animals from our experiments to all of our grant collaborators to aid their efforts to identify the physiological mechanisms underlying these life-history outcomes (e.g., how temperature alters oxygen consumption profiles, caloric allocation to different tissues, the metabolic status of larvae, and gene expression patterns). Another collaborator used our results to test, interpret, and refine models used to predict species distributions and their responses to climate change. The Stroud Center Education Department interpreted the results of our experiments to create a \"Stream Fever\" learning activity that is now part of the core set of lessons that teachers may choose from when requesting a stream study program at the Stroud Center or at their school.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/13/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Bernard&nbsp;W&nbsp;Sweeney</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1455906/1455906_10360573_1565709746127_Neocloeon_triangulifer_thermal_response--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1455906/1455906_10360573_1565709746127_Neocloeon_triangulifer_thermal_response--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Thermal response of Neocloeon triangulifer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1455906/1455906_10360573_1565709746127_Neocloeon_triangulifer_thermal_response--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Thermal response of Neocloeon triangulifer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Important thermal landmarks for the mayfly species Neocloeon triangulifer (see text for details).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David H.
