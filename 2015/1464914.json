 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\n\r\nIn this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Pat Dussault of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and Prof. Keith Kuwata of Macalester College are developing new approaches to the synthesis of ethers. Ethers, which contain a Carbon-Oxygen-Carbon linkage, are an important functionality present in medicines, natural products, solvents, and organic materials. The research pursued under this award is anticipated to have impact both in chemistry and in associated fields such as drug discovery and materials science. Dussault and coworkers are also creating a practical and widely accessible knowledge clearinghouse related to the synthetic application of organic peroxides, that is encouraging wider exploitation and safer application of the rich chemistry of peroxides.  Other broader impacts of this work include the training of both undergraduate and graduate students in experimental and computational research methods and the mutual enrichment of collaboration between a research university and a primarily undergraduate institution.\r\n\r\nExisting methods for the introduction of the ether group are predominantly based upon reaction of nucleophilic oxygen with electrophilic carbon. The research under this award employs both experimental and theoretical approaches to explore a new mode of synthesis based upon attack of carbon nucleophiles on the electrophilic oxygen atoms within organic peroxides.  The research is organized around two major research aims. Aim 1 combines experimental and theoretical approaches to develop improved methods for ether synthesis by the reaction of peroxides with carbanions. Emphasis is placed on understanding the factors that influence peroxide reactivity, the mechanism of the bond-forming step, the scope of C-O bonds that are approachable via this strategy, and control of selectivity in attack on unsymmetrical peroxides.  Aim 2 investigates intermolecular C-O bond forming reactions as an approach to specific classes of functionalized ethers and intramolecular reactions as an approach to cyclic and spirocyclic ethers.",

Our work expanded and optimized methods for synthesis of ethers based upon reaction of electron-poor oxygen in the form of organic peroxides with electron-rich carbon atoms in the form of carbanions, carbon atoms with such high electron density that they are represented as having a formal negative charge.  By inverting the usual polarity of C-O bond formation, we facilitate the synthesis of ethers that are challenging over even possible to introduce using existing processes.  The concept underpinning our work has been known for nearly a century, but practical application has been limited by the previous inability to balance peroxide reactivity with peroxide stability.  Our work combined experimental and theoretical investigations to identify stable classes of peroxides which undergo efficient conversion to ethers. These new approaches are already working their way into the synthetic literature. \n\nResearch supported under A New Paradigm for Ether Synthesis also resulted in several other discoveries that will merit further investigation.  The peroxide O-O bond, although formally a weak bond, can be very difficult to cleave; this has been observed both chemically and electrochemically.  In the course of some fundamental studies seeking to understand activation of the peroxide bond,  we stumbled across the remarkable reducing power of two different iron-based complexes:  those prepared from iron salts and thiols (often known as mercaptans) and iron salts and borane, a simple reagent containing only boron and hydrogen.  In each case, the complexes are far more potent for activation of peroxides than the constituent components (iron alone, thiol alone, or borane alone).  Our discovery that these complexes are not consumed in the reduction reactions but are instead catalysts that can turn over multiple cycles in the presence of added reducing agents, suggests further studies related to reductions not only of peroxides but other functional groups.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/18/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick H Dussault"
