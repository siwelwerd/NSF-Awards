Iteration across data acquisitions is used to optimize to a final image solution. Increased image dimensionality, either spectral or spatial, is a highly desired commodity. If these techniques can be made routine, then many areas of microscopy could benefit. The proposal reflects substantial outreach to women and significant educational efforts towards graduates and undergraduates.\r\n\r\n.",
