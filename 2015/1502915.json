 "awd_abstract_narration": "Microscopic fungi (microfungi) represent a diverse assemblage that is distributed worldwide and includes bread molds, plant pathogens, powdery mildews, rusts, slime molds, and water molds. A large percentage of these organisms are harmless or even beneficial, but some cause disease and death in animals, plants, and other fungi resulting in major economic loss and serious negative implications for human and ecosystem health. Despite their importance, little is known about their distribution, diversity, ecology, or host associations. This project is a collaborative effort involving 38 institutions in 31 states and aims to consolidate data from specimens housed in biodiversity collections for 2.3 million microfungi specimens and make these data available through online resources. The consolidation and increased accessibility of these data is critical to inform and promote new and innovative research, education and community engagement around this little-known but important group of organisms.\r\n\r\nSpecimen data generated by this project will be used to assess natural and human-induced environmental changes on microfungi distributions, and evaluate the impact of these changes on the function and health of ecosystems. This project fills a critical gap in the national digitization effort by contributing images, digitizing specimen label data, and linking associated ancillary data for over 1.2 million North American specimens of microfungi. Additionally, nomenclature and taxonomic information will be updated to reflect the newest practices as dictated by the International Codes for Nomenclature. These data will provide a foundation for making informed decisions by agribusinesses, educators, forest managers, government agencies, horticulturalists, policy makers, researchers, and the general public. The broader education goals of this project will be facilitated through the development and implementation of a teaching module for high school biology on the economic importance of microfungi. This award is made as part of the National Resource for Digitization of Biological Collections through the Advancing Digitization of Biological Collections program and all data resulting from this award will be available through the national resource (iDigBio.org).",

This was a collaborative project involving 23 funded institutions.  The primary goal of this project was to digitize specimen labels and associated ancillary data for approximately 1.2 million specimens of microfungi held in herbaria within the United States.  These data were uploaded to the MycoPortal  (http://mycoportal.org/portal/index.php) and made available to both scientists and the general public.  As of June 2018, MyCoPortal contained ~3.5 million specimen records of both macrofungi and microfungi.  The Wisconsin State Herbarium contributed 91,198 specimen records to the MycoPortal.  Of these 87,272 (96%) are with images, 67,899 (74%) have been georeferenced, and 81,040 (89%) have been identified to species.  The microfungi collection at the Wisconsin State Herbarium represents one of the largest collections of microfungi in the United States.  It had not been well-curated or much used for more than four decades prior to the beginning of the microfungi digitization project.  The collection was re-organized during the digitization process and now that the specimens have been databased and the label data is available online, requests to view and borrow specimens have increased.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/24/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Maryann E Feist"
