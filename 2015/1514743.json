 "awd_abstract_narration": "Our brains are constantly changing. Experiences and memories leave their imprints on connections between neurons. Understanding this process is fundamental to understanding how the brain works. While this question has been of central importance to neuroscience for decades, at this moment researchers are well positioned to make significant progress -- new recording devices and imaging techniques are revealing the activity and changes within the networks of the brain at unprecedented scale and resolution. Sound mathematical models are essential to keep up with the mounting avalanche of data. The goal of this project is to develop mathematical tools to assist with improving understanding how networks of neurons are shaped by experiences. Developing this theory is crucial for understanding learning, as well as associated disorders. The project will focus on how learning improves the brain's ability to make decisions and store memories. Graduate students and postdocs joining this project will be part of an established, interdisciplinary mathematics research community. Trainees will gain a wide perspective of mathematical neuroscience through integrated research at three institutions, including extensive visits among them. \r\n\r\nThis research project builds on earlier results of this team to address a central challenge in the mathematical analysis of biophysically realistic neuronal networks: How brain activity changes brain structure over time. Understanding neural computation demands a description of how network dynamics co-evolves with network architecture. The research team will address this challenge by answering specific questions about the interplay between spatiotemporal patterns of neural activity, the attendant changes in network architectures, and the resulting neural computations. This project focuses on two main questions. First, what mathematical techniques can describe the co-evolution of network dynamics and network connectivity toward stable assemblies of neurons? To address this question this project will build a theory describing how global network structure evolves under the dynamics of biophysically realistic plasticity rules that operate on the scale of individual spikes and synapses. Analysis of these models requires novel multiscale and averaging methods. The resulting equations allow analysis of the stability of network architectures and their dependence on stimulus drive. With these results, the second question can be addressed: How does network plasticity create spatiotemporal dynamics that support the basic building blocks of neural computation? Models to understand how plasticity forms networks whose dynamics underlie specific operations on incoming stimuli will be developed to address this question. The mechanism by which long-term plasticity can reshape the connectivity of a network to encode a precise temporal sequence of events will also be investigated.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNeuroscience has emerged as one nation's marquee scientific priorities.  Stunning new experimental advances are revealing data about the brain?s electrical activity, and the brain?s  connectivity &mdash; or wiring diagram &mdash; on a scale and resolution that could only be dreamed of in decades before.  The opportunities to derive new, fundamental knowledge about life and behavior are unprecedented.  \n\n \n\nSeizing these opportunities, however, demands that we make the link between two very different types of measurements:  activity on the one hand, and connectivity on the other.  This is a daunting challenge, because both of these measurements have proved so enormously complex.  The wiring diagram in particular is neither rigidly structured nor apparently random, but is in the intermediate zone that is most difficult to handle.  What features of this enormous diagram matter most for key aspects of neural activity &mdash; and, equally important &mdash; which matter least?  Knowing the answers will allow us to focus our research on similarities and differences among brains, brain areas, and brain states that drive commonalities and distinctions in their dynamics.\n\n \n\nWe have advanced a mathematical framework aimed at a solution.  This framework revealed that the overall extent to which a network is coordinated &mdash; quantified by the number of its degrees of freedom, or its dimension &mdash; can be predicted by just a handful of small, tractable wiring patterns that recur within the larger wiring diagram.  The same is true for the input-output transformations of the system as a whole.  We believe that this is a fundamental step toward interpreting the brain?s wiring diagram, complementing other more specialized approaches.  Because it is framed in terms of mathematics, the tools we have developed are ready to impact other fields of science and engineering that are tackling complex networks as well.\n\n \n\nNeurobiology is not the only field where there has been an explosion of recent research in neural networks:  they also underlie the current revolution in artificial intelligence.  Common to both fields is the need to understand how basic activity patterns in these networks change under the process of learning.  We have developed tools that begin to explain how the activity dimension described evolves under the most common network learning rules.  These appear to lead to a systematic decrease of dimensionality, possibly simplifying the process of rapid learning.  This type of finding points the way toward a future in which we not only understand how wiring leads to activity, but how that activity, and the wiring that supports it &mdash; is systematically learned.\n\n \n\nInterpreting the brain?s wiring will never be accomplished by one field of science alone &mdash; it demands a confluence of many disciplines, from neurobiology to physics to microscopy to systems engineering to statistics to applied mathematics.  It also demands collaboration among multiple institutions, in our case three universities located across the country as well as an outstanding nonprofit research institute.  This team-science, interdisciplinary approach has crated an ideal environment for training students to attack complex modern problems, and this grant supported the work of several such trainees.  Trainees as well as the PI gave presentations nationally and locally and published papers that share our findings in journals, open-access online repositories, and science newsletters, and gave talks to share this work with practicing scientists, graduate students, and undergraduates just starting to explore the world of scientific research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/12/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric T Shea-Brown"
