 "awd_abstract_narration": "Subdivision-based algorithms can solve problems from a wide variety of applications in mathematics, computer science, and the sciences.  For example, these types of algorithms are used in computer graphics, mathematical biology, computational geometry, mathematical modeling, robotics, machine learning, and mathematical computation.  Subdivision-based algorithms are popular because they are relatively easy to describe and implement on a computer, and they are often efficient in practice.  The work in this project is to quantify and improve the effectiveness of these types of algorithms.  By studying the efficiency and providing algorithms to approximate solutions to problems which are typically considered intractable, the results of this project provide techniques which can be applied to practical problems throughout the sciences.\r\n\r\nSubdivision-based algorithms recursively and adaptively subdivide a given domain into smaller regions until, in each smaller region, the behavior of a problem-specific feature can be determined.  Subdivision-based algorithms are frequently used because they are parallelizable, recursive, and adaptive.  More precisely, they use weak local tests and perform more subdivisions only near difficult features.  These features that make subdivision-based algorithms practical, however, also make them challenging to study.  For example, local tests make global topological correctness difficult and adaptive (non-uniform) subdivisions make the number of subdivisions difficult to bound.  This project addresses both of the important questions of complexity and correctness for subdivision-based algorithms in the following two ways: (1) Using continuous amortization as a uniform method to compute the complexity of subdivision-based algorithms.  (2) Developing topologically certified subdivision-based algorithms for geometric applications on algebraic varieties.  This project extends the technique of continuous amortization to many different types of algorithms including iterative and two-dimensional subdivisions; additionally, the project develops subdivision-based algorithms to approximate previously intractable problems such as the medial axis and intersections of surfaces.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring this time the PI published 6 journal papers, 3 conference papers, and submitted one additional journal paper.  In addition, the PI's students published 2 additional papers.  The PI also produced and released two software packages supporting the PI's work.\n\nThe PI published a series of papers on the topic of continuous amortization.  This series of papers significantly developed this complexity analysis technique to apply in much more general settings.  This series of work also resulted in the first complexity analysis of a subdivision algorithm in arbitrary dimensions.  While being interesting in its own right, the results have also generated interest in other mathematical fields which is developing into new connections between mathematics and computer science.\n\nThe PI published a series of papers that study the correctness of algorithms.  The results of these papers (and the accompanying produced software) provide algorithms which are guaranteed to never make a mistake, but to be efficient.  The development of such methods are critical in automation technologies because it is important in many applications that automated technology (such as self-driving cars) does not make a mistake.\n\nThe PI published a series of papers that study connections between computability and dynamical systems.  In dynamical systems, it is common for researchers to use computer experiments to determine which theories to peruse.  However, due to the chaotic nature of dynamical systems, it is sometimes the case that such calculations are provably impossible.  By developing methods to understand and identify which quantities can and cannot be calculated, this saves other researchers from developing meaningless data, and identifies which computations are meaningful in related fields, such as physics.\n\nThe PI supported four graduate students over the lifetime of the award, one PhD student and three masters students.  The PhD student and two of the masters students graduated during the award period.  The PI also graduated one additional Masters' student, who was not supported by the award.  In addition, the PI published papers with four graduate students (two of which were not his student) over the lifetime of the award.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe PI has published papers in academic journals and conference proceedings in order to disseminate the results to the community. In addition, versions of the submitted papers have been placed on the arXiv, in order to freely disseminate the results to the community.

The PI also served as the proceedings editor for the 2017 ISSAC conference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/09/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Burr"
