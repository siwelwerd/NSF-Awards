Research on water quality is motivated by the state?s prioritization of management of water resources. An interdisciplinary team of researchers with expertise in biology, ecology, environmental engineering, chemistry, and geology will develop analytical facilities and expertise through the Appalachian Freshwater Initiative (AFI) to understand and detect ecological and biological impacts of complex mixtures of contaminants in water under varying climate change scenarios. Research on GW detection will take advantage of the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in Green Bank, WV. This team, consisting of astrophysicists and engineers, will build the physical and human infrastructure necessary for researchers to directly detect and characterize gravitational waves. The project will broaden participation of minorities and females in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) professions through continuing education workshops and scholarships. Public engagement will occur through citizen science efforts, as well as museum and planetarium displays and programs.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description \r\nThe freshwater quality research focuses on detecting novel and dilute contaminants and pathogens, understanding the complex chemical interactions and pathogen characteristics, predicting contaminant transport, toxicity, and degradation pathways, and understanding how climate-related changes in precipitation regimes affect biological communities. The group will develop rapid, sensitive, low-cost sensors for contaminants and pathogens that have the potential to impact aquatic ecosystems and the freshwater supply. Researchers will work to understand the sub-lethal, chronic, and cumulative effects of the chemical, biological, and physical contaminants in Appalachian streams and rivers. In addition, the group will model effects of multi-contaminant mixtures on ecological communities. Detection of GWs and the characterization of GW sources will allow studies ranging from early universe cosmology to formation and evolution of galaxies to populations of compact objects in the local universe to tests of general relativity and alternative theories of gravity. The sensitivity of pulsar timing arrays to nanoHertz frequency gravitational waves emitted by supermassive black-hole binaries will be enhanced through addition of more millisecond pulsars to the array, development of improved algorithms for characterization of pulsars, better understanding of the source populations, and improvements in the sensitivity and efficiency of algorithms for detecting GW signatures.",
