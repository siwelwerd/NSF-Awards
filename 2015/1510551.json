The goal of this work is to create a new mode of enzyme immobilization that contains high enzyme levels per volume, and most importantly, retains or improves enzyme activity. Through the use of protein self-organization in the presence of biocompatible materials, a porous, high surface area particle containing active enzyme will be created. As a test case, an enzyme that produces pharmaceutical precursors and its regenerating partner enzyme will both be immobilized in the particles. The particles will be tested for production of product, stability over time, and the ability to collect and reuse over multiple reaction cycles. The results of this research will not only be an improved method of enzyme immobilization, but will generate fundamental knowledge of how placement of partner enzymes in immobilized structures can improve their performance and productivity. The particle platform developed here is modular and can be easily applied to a wide variety of enzymes that make important products. The PIs will integrate the research with activities for middle to graduate school to recruit and retain women in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to create bio-catalytic, self-assembled materials capable of providing the required micro and nano-structured environment to support and enhance enzymatic activity for industrially relevant applications. Traditionally, enzymes are immobilized on solid synthetic supports via covalent interactions or adsorption in order to enhance activity, recovery, and/or lifetime. Here, enzymes are engineered to assemble with complementary protein building blocks to create biocatalytic materials. This provides a local protein-crowded environment and eliminates the need for covalent immobilization or non-specific adsorption which often leads to loss of structure and function, and lack control over specific enzyme placement or density. This project combines protein engineering, to produce proteins containing both enzymatic and self-assembly domains, and protein-inorganic self-assembly, to build appropriate structures to control enzyme performance and recovery. Self-assembly occurs first at the nanoscale and then at the microscale to produce hierarchically structured supraparticles that have internal structural complexity to achieve high surface area and porosity. The proposed research will provide basic knowledge and proof of concept of protein-inorganic self-assembly with a coupled two enzyme system for production of chiral amines with co-factor regeneration. The employed design strategy is modular, so that multiple enzymes can be used simultaneously in the same supraparticles, either dispersed homogenously or segregated spatially. The modular design also sets the material structure independently of the physical properties of the enzyme(s), and allows almost any enzyme(s) to be used. The impact of supraparticle immobilization on enzyme activity and synergy will be evaluated, and also a practical assessment of the utility of this system to be used in industrial reaction processes will be provided. Additionally, this work also generates fundamental knowledge on protein self-assembly with inorganic components and insight as to how spatial control of enzyme placement can give control of kinetic parameters and activity. This work will demonstrate that protein-inorganic self-assembly of enzymes can provide a general template, as well as the required chemical and physical environment, to support complex industrial biocatalysis.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Biomaterials Program of the Division of Materials Research.",
