 "awd_abstract_narration": "The fifth annual meeting of the Underrepresented Students in Topology and Algebra Research Symposium (USTARS) is to be held at Florida Gulf Coast University on April 18-19, 2015.  Speakers will give 30-minute research talks in various subfields of topology and algebra; these subfields include algebraic combinatorics, enumerative geometry, knot theory, and representation theory.  Two distinguished graduate students will give hour-long presentations and one invited faculty member, Dr. Angelica Osorno of Reed College, will give a one-hour keynote address.  Invited undergraduate researchers will participate in a poster session.\r\n\r\nUSTARS promotes diversity within the mathematical community by providing a platform for collaboration and professional development.  Participants are exposed to a variety of current research, ideas, and results, and meet underrepresented professors and students who will become future collaborators or colleagues.  The conference also promotes diversity by encouraging women and minorities to attend and give talks. Indeed, the conference organizing committee is diverse in gender, ethnicity, and educational background, and hence is well-positioned to encourage participation from a diverse group of students. The participants of the conference will continue to influence the next generation of students by serving as much needed mentors and encouraging students in the mathematical sciences to advance themselves and participate in research and conference events.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ustars.org/",
