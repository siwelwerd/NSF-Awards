The model can be run either with prescribed SST or coupled to a slab mixed-layer ocean. The model development process will include gathering input to understand the community's needs along with numerical experimentation to design the optimal functionality of the model. The software group at National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) will facilitate the development of the model for community use; the PI and her team will perform Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima (DECK) experiments following the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) protocols and prepare manuscripts documenting the model's behavior. \r\n\r\nThe project will result in a tool that can be effectively used by other researchers in the climate science community.",
