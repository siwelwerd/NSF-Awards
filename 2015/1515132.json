It is established that there are different philosophies as to what is considered ?science? and what is valued as ?scientific? in a specific culture.  This project is concerned with a cross cultural analysis of science concepts and science education between different language-cultures, as well as the teaching of subject-matter content in foreign language contexts.  This study will investigate the conceptualization of science in the Korean university setting at Seoul National University (SNU) in close collaboration with Dr. Seungho Maeng, a researcher in the department of Science Education.    The project will provide a crucial vantage for the promotion of the cross-cultural understanding of these topics.  \r\n\r\nThere are few studies that compare the concepts of science between langua-cultures.  This study investigates Korean students, who are becoming an increasingly large sector of the population of international students at American universities. As more Korean students become enrolled at American universities, it is essential that educators in the United States have tools  to understand the origins of scientific concepts of this student population.  This study will document the disconnects between the American conceptualizations of science and the Korean system, which will in turn assist educators in STEM fields to develop teaching materials designed to support Korean students who are studying at American universities as well as Korean scientists who teach or work in those universities.   In order to ascertain these cultural differences, this study will conduct interviews with students and instructors of science courses as well as record science classroom interactions. This award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Korea.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project investigated the science education system in the Republic of Korea in order to better understand the enculturation and difficulties of Korean undergraduate students in STEM courses in the US. \n\nThis project has two distinct sections, which when combined together allow us to see several key aspects of the modern Korean system of STEM education at the university level.  The first section consists of classroom observation of a college-level geophysics class at a large research university in Seoul, Korea.  Six class sessions were recorded using a video camera.  A transcript was made of each of these recordings in Korean and subsequently translated in to English.  The transcripts of these classroom sessions were then analyzed using a systemic functional linguistic framework.  The second section of this research involves interviews with students in the geophysics course as well as students in a physics course also taught at the university. Using these two aspects together, the researchers can analyze classroom discourse from both the perspective of the actual events of the classroom as well as the opinions of the students and professors as to those events and macrocultural ideas about science in Korean education at large. \n\nA large part of this project is concerned with a cross cultural analysis of science concepts and science education between different language-cultures, as well as the teaching of subject-matter content in foreign language contexts. There is a polysemous relationship between different language-cultures in how basic aspects of science are defined.  This creates a disconnect between individuals from different language groups when they work or interact with other cultures.  This raises the important question of, \"What comes to define science in different cultures?\" There is clearly an ideology as to what is considered \"science\" and what is valued as \"scientific\" in a particular culture.  Language plays a key role in this issue. Therefore, a careful analysis and comparison of the language used in the teaching, learning, and practice of science in different language cultures will provide a crucial vantage for the promotion of the cross-cultural understanding of these topics. This study investigated specifically the conceptualization of science in the Korean University setting.\n\nIn order to ascertain these cultural differences, this study conducted interviews with students and instructors of science courses.  In these interviews, the intent was to gather information concerning how each individual interprets the way science was taught to them, how they learned it, and most importantly how they conceptualize the idea of  \"science\" themselves. \n\nThe Korean context and the location of a university in Seoul in particular is important given the large influx of international students from these areas who are coming to the United States.  According to a report from the Bookings Institute, between 2008 and 2012, there were 56,503 international students from Seoul enrolled at Universities in the United States.  Of these students 20% were in STEM fields (Ruiz, 2014).  While this is a significant amount of the population, of those at most universities there are few established frameworks for international students that go beyond basic ESL and instead work with enculturation and interaction in the new academic context.\n\nThe Study conducted through the 2015 EAPSI project investigated how Korean students think about science in both Korean and in English in order to see if there are discernable differences between these concepts between the language/cultures even within the two different Korean contexts as well as compared to American students in the US context.\n\nThis study has two preliminary conclusions.  First: the Language barrier.  Terms and conceptual understanding of particular phenomenon are coming from the western system, which does not always translate completely from one language to the other, especially given Korea?s relative youth on the science scene as compared to the western established system's origins.  Scientific terms are typically translated English in to Chinese and then in to Korean.  The result is a thrice-translated term, which does not closely align with the original concept. The second major conclusion is concerning the general transitivity of the Korean system.  In Korea the education system is attempting to adapt the western style, however greater Korean culture does not follow the same cultural concerns as the western American System.  This causes a kind of two-minded institution, wherein education both wants to be the Western system (interaction), but still adhere to the traditional Korean system (transmission).  This is not an indictment of the Korean system by any means, the data merely shows that the systems are different and in order to improve Korean science education we must first recognize this fact and second we must decide on which course to take.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/15/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Seth L King"
