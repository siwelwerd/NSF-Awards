 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to further our fundamental understanding of plasma turbulence and flows by making detailed comparisons of large-scale computer models with carefully controlled laboratory experiments. Turbulence and its effects are ubiquitous in magnetized plasmas on Earth, in near space, and throughout the universe. Turbulence can drive increased transport of particles, heat, and momentum, which affects our ability to confine plasmas for applications on Earth, such as fusion energy, and can play an important role in accelerating particles to high energies, for example in the space weather environment comprising the Sun and Earth. The large numbers of high energy particles generated during space weather events have the potential to seriously impact satellites, communications, and power systems on Earth.  Being able to reliably predict such events requires a detailed understanding of the underlying physics, including the physics of turbulence and the interaction of turbulence and flows. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this work is to validate, through controlled laboratory experiments and close experiment-theory-model coupling, a fully global, nonlinear two-fluid model appropriate for understanding turbulence and transport dynamics in a collisional laboratory plasma. Despite a long and ongoing history of work to understand the dynamics of plasma turbulence in the presence of sheared flows, there still appears to be no validated model that can accurately reproduce experimental observations over a wide range of turbulent states in even relatively simple, well-controlled experiments. Even in these 'simple' laboratory experiments, enough complicating physics are present so that interpreting measurements purely experimentally, via quasilinear theories, or via local nonlinear models seems to be difficult or impossible. The proposed experiments will take place in the dual-source HelCat (Helicon-Cathode) device at the University of New Mexico. HelCat is a flexible device that provides unique capabilities important to these experiments. The GBS (Global Braginskii Solver), a fully 3D global drift-reduced Braginskii solver that has been used previously to model both linear and toroidal devices will be used to model these experiments. Experiment-model comparisons will be undertaken under a wide range of conditions, from coherent to fully-developed turbulent states.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this research was to elucidate the nonlinear dynamics of plasma turbulence in the presence of flow shear, through experiment-model cross-validation.  Turbulence, and turbulent transport of heat, momentum and particles, in the presence of sheared flows is ubiquitous in laboratory, space, and fusion plasmas.  Thus, these outcomes potentially have broad impact in many areas of plasma physics.\n\nExperiments were conducted in the linear HelCat (Helicon-Cathode) basic plasma science device at the University of New Mexico (UNM).  HelCat utilizes a radio frequency (RF) helicon plasma source, and has a uniform axial magnetic field.  Experiments focused on two main areas.  First, turbulence dynamics were studied in detail in the presence of azimuthal flows with varying radial shear.  The radial flow shear was affected by the introduction of both grid and ring electrodes.  Secondly, the azimuthal flow dynamics were studied in detail.  In particular, a laser induced fluorescence (LIF) system, capable of measuring the density, temperature, and flow profiles of neutral argon (the working gas), was implemented, and utilized to study neutral particle dynamics, in order to understand their effect on plasma flows.  Experiments showed that the edge turbulence in HelCat plasmas is a hybrid of drift modes, driven by radial pressure gradient, and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) modes, driven by flow shear.  Both types of turbulence (modes) are important in astrophysical, space, and fusion plasmas.  A complex, nonlinear, nonmonotonic relationship between flows and turbulence was found.  The understanding of the flow dynamics remains incompletely understood, but it is clear that both neutral particle effects, as well as turbulence-driven flow (zonal flow), played only moderate roles in the overall flows.\n\nNumerical modelling of HelCat plasmas was undertaken using the Global Braginskii Solver (GBS) code developed at Dartmouth College.  The code was run on parallel computing clusters both at Dartmouth and UNM.  In this work, the code was further developed to include a third, neutral particle, fluid, in addition to ion and electron fluids.  Additionally, a new, distributed model of the helicon plasma source was developed, and Braginskii equation terms dependent on the parallel (to the magnetic field) electron temperature gradient were added [1].  Each of these code additions were thought to be potentially important in understanding turbulence in HelCat plasmas.\n\nDetailed experiment-model comparisons confirmed that the experiments were generally qualitatively consistent with the flow shear-turbulence suppression paradigm.  Detailed understanding of the turbulence-flow dynamics in these experiments - as captured in GBS model - remains incomplete in a few respects, however.  In particular, the code is only able to match the measured plasma flows very roughly.  It is not yet clear if the code is lacking some important physics, or if the experimental measurements are erroneous (or both).  Future work will continue to address this issue.  Despite these outstanding issues, however, the detailed characterization of the nonlinear dynamics of plasma turbulence in the presence of sheared flows and dynamical neutral particles is significant, with potentially broad application.\n\n[1] S.
