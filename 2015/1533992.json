 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project provides support for the 2015 Workshop on the Economics of Information Security (WEIS). WEIS fosters cross-disciplinary, cross-sector (i.e., academia, industry, nonprofit, and government), and cross-national discussion on information security. The focus on the economics of information security was chosen not only because of its intrinsic importance, but also because of its basis for bringing together social, computer, and information scientists and engineers to share knowledge, information and methods from their respective domains. WEIS covers issues that are core to the NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, and spans both the Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) Directorates within the Foundation.\r\n\r\nThe WEIS conference draws a 50/50 split between US and European participants, with a small number of participants from Asia.  The venue rotates between US and European locations, with two years in the US for every year in Europe.\r\n\r\nAll funds from this grant will go towards supporting US undergraduate and graduate student attendance at the WEIS conference, to be held in June 2015 at the Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands. This project will thus provide US students with valuable opportunities for students to meet and interact with notable researchers, thereby furthering their own research careers.",
