 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project focuses on the development, implementation, and evaluation of new and effective policies for topology aware resource allocation of energy resources under uncertainty. When a malfunction occurs in an electricity provisioning system, it is vitally important to quickly diagnose the problem and take corrective action to prevent outages. This project will support fundamental research to enhance both the proactive and reactive reliable operation of the smart grid without costly infrastructure investments. Specifically, this research project will show that controlling the grid's topology can enhance the grid's reliability and better manage resources. In addition, this research will develop the procedures required to find the most reliable grid topology in response to changes in energy demand. Thus, the primary societal impact of this research is to increase the capability to prevent and resolve unexpected blackouts, which account for approximately $90 billion in losses each year for U.S. businesses and consumers. This research involves several disciplines including power systems, parallel computing and optimization.\r\n\r\nInteger Linear Programming models can overcome several limitations in the current topological aware models such as capacity planning, re-allocation and scheduling of resources. The research team will study a collection of mixed integer linear programming models designed to identify optimal combinations of supply sources, demand sites to serve, and the pathways along which the reallocated power should flow. The models explicitly support the uncertainty associated with alternative sources such as wind power. A simulator configured with multiple intelligent distributed software agents will be developed to support the evaluation of the model solutions. Applications of interest include (but are not restricted to) generator and load scheduling applications in energy management and service systems; pricing and revenue management problems; and inventory control.",

The PIs studied the energy resource allocation (e.g., supply and demand) levels to integrate high distributed energy resources (e.g., wind) in multiple IEEE electric test systems through integer linear programming formulation and economic dispatch models. Specific outcomes of this activity resulted in a seamless interconnection of neighboring generator participation with better accurate estimation of capacity, demand, and scheduling of generators, than that of existing techniques for larger grid structures. A Capacitated Transshipment problem solver was implemented using multiple tools such as AMPL, C# ASP.NET and OMNETT+ to model network flow problems.</p>\n<p>2. The team investigated how controlling grid topology via decomposition or sub-system models can enhance grid stability under contingency conditions. Specifically, a clustering mechanism was developed and deployed to decompose large scale grids into smaller microgrid formations to study the generation to load ratios in several IEEE test systems. Two metrics, Generator to Load Ratio (G/L) and modularity index, were used to assess microgrid clusters. A G/L ratio of more than 100% indicates a self-sufficient grid cluster with an excessive generation that can be given to other microgrids, while a G/L ratio of less than 100% indicates that this cluster cannot meet its load, thus requiring resources from neighboring microgrids. &nbsp;The modularity index, on the other hand, measures the density of grid structures, with the high value being dense and the low value being sparse.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. The topological reconfiguration for planning and operating resources were accomplished via forecasting approaches. The PIs investigated the uncertainty associated with the grid parameters such as price, load, demand, generation, and wind via data-driven models and forecasting techniques.&nbsp; The outcome of this activity led to several machine learning-based forecasting approaches with accurate forecasts of grid parameters with mean absolute percentage error values less than 4%.</p>\n<p>4. The computational performance of three different AC-OPF formulations (power balance polar, power balance cartesian, and current balance cartesian) were studied. These formulations were tested several large-scale test systems. The current balance cartesian yielded optimal results and computational savings compared to the other formulations.</p>\n<p>5. The project resulted in the publication of two journal papers and ten conference papers. Two additional journal papers and two conference articles were submitted, and their status is pending.
