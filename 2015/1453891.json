 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this CAREER Award, the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division is supporting fundamental research of Professor Jimmie D. Weaver at Oklahoma State University. Professor Weaver will study photoinitiated electron transfer as a means of activating halogenated arenes, heteroarenes, and polyfluorinated arenes towards carbon-carbon bond forming reactions.  This research will provide fundamental understanding of the reactivity of transient radical and radical ion species as well as new methods for the construction of important chemical motifs. Proposed routes are shorter, more efficient and allow the syntheses of previously inaccessible structures.  In addition, Professor Weaver will integrate the research and educational components of this project by providing a nontraditional based lab experience which exposes undergraduates to cutting edge research, as well as an outreach program aimed at stimulating curiosity in science among elementary students.  His research group will develop a database of essential information on the relevant electrochemical properties of molecules in an easily accessible online platform.\r\n\r\nIn this research, new methods will be developed for the photochemical synthesis of alkylated, arylated, and alkenylated arenes, heteroarenes and polyfluorinated arenes by formation of strategic carbon-carbon bonds. Changes to the leaving group, the electronic structure of the arene, and the photocatalyst all factor into the nature of the observed reaction.  A variety of mechanistically distinct reactions will be developed. This research will facilitate: 1) the design of safer reactions that do not involve highly reactive chemicals, 2) the use of less expensive chemical processes for which no prefunctionalization is needed, and 3) the development of reactions with high chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nFunctional molecules are critical to the human experience, and most of these compounds must be synthesized.  Hence, continued innovation in chemical synthesis is critical for national interest and development industry processes and to create new opportunities and solutions for existing problems.  This project sought to advance chemical synthesis.  The underlying hypothesis of this proposal was that many cross-coupling reactions could be achieved as a result of electron transfer, as opposed to prefunctionalization of the coupling pieces, which had become the most common way to synthesize molecules.  This was expected to significantly broaden the scope of what could be built, since the prefunctionaliztion process necessarily restricts the number of available inputs. To this end, we have shown that visible light photocatalysis can be used to access a number of reactive intermediates and that they are capable of forming new bonds with minimally functionalized compounds.\n\n We have focused our efforts to a few of areas.  The first is in the area of photocatalytic C?F functionalization of highly fluorinated arenes (Scheme 1, right) which expands access to the important field of organofluorines.  The second area is the photocatalytic functionalization of azoles (left).  More recently we have explored strategies to expand the reach of electron transfer chemistry and have investigated a mechanism that has broad applicability within the field of photocatalysis. \n\nAll three areas are linked in that visible light is used to drive otherwise unfavorable electron transfers, which typically results in an unstable, and therefore a reactive species that has great potential to enable chemical synthesis.  Some of this work was completed prior to funding or was redacted due to budgetary restrictions (references in black). The references to articles resulting from the NSF supported work are listed in blue.\n\n \n\nBriefly, we explored the role of the halogen in the reactivity of azole motif after electron transfer.  Simply changing from a chloride to a bromide results a change in the identity of the reactive species, and in turn, leads to different type of reactivity.  When we explored the nature of the reactive species formed from electron transfer to organofluorines, we found that even resilient C?F bonds could be ruptured and that this took place in a highly predictable fashion and could be exploited for synthesis.  We demonstrated that a class of molecules, dihaloalkanes, for which EDA complexes could be used to expand access.  This also served as a cautionary tale to the community, as it appeared that the phenomenon we observed was likely unknowingly at work in others? work too.  We also collaboratively explored deeply reducing photocatalysts that could push the limits of what is possible.  Finally, we introduced collidinium salts as a surrogate for aliphatic halides capable of leveling redox potentials- allowing a single set of conditions that can induce electron transfer and reactivity.\n\nBroader Impact\n\nThis project provided training opportunities for eight different graduate students which has already culminated in 4 PhDs and 2 MS degrees.  Additionally, it facilitated research opportunities for 8 undergraduate students.  Several of these individuals represent underrepresented groups.  These individuals are either still seeking their degree or are gainfully employed in some aspect of the chemical industry.\n\nIn addition to the direct impact, societal engagement was achieved through interactions through local elementary schools.  Efforts were made to promote chemistry through chemical demonstrations and classroom science projects such as berry-sensitized solar cells. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jimmie D Weaver"
