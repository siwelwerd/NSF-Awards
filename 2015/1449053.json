 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Program Phase I project could lead to a dramatic improvement in natural gas processing economics using membrane technology. Natural gas processing is the largest industrial gas separation application, and natural gas separation equipment currently represents a market of approximately $3-5 billion per year. Due to high energy intensity and environmental concerns with currently dominant amine systems, gas processors are seeking alternative separation options.  Membrane technology offers many advantages including clean, simple, and efficient operation. However, expanded use of clean membrane technology has been hindered by  insufficient  separation  performance  of  existing  membranes. If  successfully  developed,  the  new perfluoro polymeric composite membranes to be developed in this project will strengthen the competitive position of membrane technology in the natural gas treatment market, allowing users to capture the ease of processing and environmental advantages offered by membranes. If gas selectivity and permeance targets are met, significant reductions in the operating cost (up to 30%) and in the capital cost (up to 40%) can be achieved. Corresponding gas processing costs would also drop about 35%. The proposed technology can potentially be extended to other applications such as H2/CH4, He/CH4, and olefin/paraffin separations.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this Phase I research project are to optimize synthesis of new perfluoro dioxolane copolymers and to fabricate these materials into robust composite membranes, whose gas separation performance is superior to commercially available membranes. Building on recent synthesis work at NYU,  a  series  of  perfluoro  dioxolane  copolymers  will  be  prepared  to  study  structure/property relationships. Optimization of the polymerization reaction will be carried out to obtain the targeted copolymers with optimized gas separation performance, reasonably low cost, excellent chemical and thermal stability, good film-forming properties and solvent-processability. The resulting copolymers will be fabricated into thin-film composite membranes and tested with industrially relevant mixtures at MTR. At the end of the Phase I project, the most promising copolymer will be selected for scale up and commercialization in a Phase II program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project examined a new class of perfluorinated polymers for use as gas separation membranes.  Perfluorinated polymers exhibit unsurpassed chemical stability, which is important for operation in the harsh environments often found in gas separation applications.  Previous perfluorinated polymers studied for membrane applications showed expected excellent durability, but insufficient gas selectivity to find widespread commercial use.  Our new perfluoropolymers are more selective, making them very attractive for use as membranes in important industrial separations such as CO2 removal from natural gas.  Use of these membranes would allow an environmentally-friendly gas separation technology to replace energy-intensive chemical absorption methods currently used in industry.\n\nIn this program, several promising candidate perfluoropolymers were synthesized and used to fabricate industrial multi-layer composite membranes.  Systematic permeation testing was conducted to reveal polymer structure/property relationships and to optimize membrane formulations.  The most promising membranes were tested with gas mixtures at conditions representative of important commercial separations.  The best-performing new perfluoropolymer membranes show superior combinations of gas permeance and selectivity compared to existing membranes for a number of applications, including CO2 removal from natural gas and hydrogen recovery from refinery streams.  Based on these mixture performance data, a techno-economic analysis indicates the new membranes can be a game changer for the separation industry. \n\nIn preparation for commercialization, synthesis of the new perfluoropolymers was optimized and scaled up to quantities required for roll-to-roll composite membrane production.  In future work, these membranes will be converted into modules and tested on a pilot system at a natural gas field site.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/09/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Zhenjie He"
