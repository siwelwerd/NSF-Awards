 "awd_abstract_narration": "A significant number of adults in the US and outside lack access to formal financial services such as savings accounts. When available, savings products are used to decrease income volatility, accumulate money for business investments, pay for unexpected health emergencies, and invest in children's education. Saving outside of formal bank accounts can be difficult: cash in hand or under the mattress is more easily spent. Hence, devising means to improve savings can lead to better living standards and economic outcomes Americans and the poor in developing countries.  After expanding its large cash transfer program Oportunidades to urban areas, the Mexican government opened bank accounts for urban recipients of the program and paid their benefits directly into these accounts. In 2009, the government began tying debit cards to these bank accounts, which are run by a government bank. This doctoral dissertation project exploits this unique data collection opportunity by using the gradual rollout of debit cards in urban localities in Mexico to identify their causal impact on savings among program recipients. It will use data from a number of sources, including bank account balances, deposits, and withdrawals in program recipients' bank accounts over three years, as well as household survey data on their consumption, income, and assets over seven years.\r\n\r\nA theoretical model predicts that, by enabling program recipients to access their accounts at the nearest ATM of any bank rather than the nearest government bank branch, debit cards will increase savings through two channels. First, debit cards reduce the non-monetary transaction cost of accessing savings, making saving more attractive. Second, they provide a technology to build trust in the bank, which is initially low among Mexico's poor: while saving, a recipient can repeatedly check her balance at any ATM to make sure the bank hasn't stolen her money. Furthermore, these effects should be greater for those living far from government bank branches but sufficiently close to other banks' ATMs, and this distance effect should be greater for those who have more difficulty saving at home (for example, because the husband takes and spends the saved cash, which is always given to women). The distances between each family and the nearest ATM and nearest government bank branch are key variables to test these hypotheses. Combining Census block codes for families in my panel data with Census block shape files and the geographic coordinates of ATMs and government bank branches, I will estimate the distance from each household to the nearest ATM and government bank branch, and use variation in these variables and the rollout of debit cards to test the model's predictions. The results from this study will provide important insights for the American government and other countries seeking to increase financial inclusion.",

Qualitative survey responses and anecdotal evidence support the low trust hypothesis, but rigorous studies are scarce. In addition, while a number of studies have looked at the monetary transaction costs associated with using formal financial services, the importance of non-monetary transaction costs such as traveling to the bank to withdraw money is not well-understood.

Lowering these barriers can increase not only formal savings, but overall savings, due to the difficulties in saving informally. Debit cards provide not only easier access to savings by allowing cash transfer recipients to access their savings at any bank's ATM, but also a technology to monitor and build trust in financial institutions. Specifically, we find that after receiving debit cards, beneficiaries do not increase their savings for the first 6 months to 1 year, but after this initial period, they begin saving and their stock of savings increases over time. During this initial period, however, they use the card to check their balances frequently; the number of times they check their balances decreases over time as their self-reported trust in the bank increases.</p>\n<p>We then test whether the observed increase in bank account balances represents an increase in total saving or a substitution from other forms of saving, both formal and informal. Using longitudinal household survey data, we find that after about one year the treatment group increases total savings by about 5 percent of income relative to the control group, which is close in magnitude to the effect we see in the administrative account data. We find no differential change in income or assets in the treatment group compared to the control. These results suggest that the increase in savings is not driven by higher income but by (voluntarily) lower current consumption, and that the increase in bank savings represents new savings rather than a substitution from other forms of saving.</p>\n<p>Finally, a portion of the increase in savings is achieved through a decrease in the consumption of temptation goods: alcohol, tobacco, and sugar. Indeed, this is the only consumption category with a statistically significant decrease after receiving the card. Although the poor do save at home, saving informally is harder as the money is susceptible to temptation spending, either by the beneficiary herself or by her husband if she lacks control over his access to her savings. Indeed, we also find that among beneficiaries living with a spouse or partner, those with lower baseline bargaining power relative to their spouse have a higher increase in savings after receiving the card. Our results suggest that saving in formal financial institutions may help solve some of the intra-household bargaining and self-control problems associated with trying to save informally.</p>\n<p>Governments in many countries--including the US and developing countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Brazil--pay benefits from social programs directly into bank accounts tied to debit cards, with little knowledge of what policy interventions will best enable the poor to save. The broader impact of this project is likely to result from this project's finding that a lack of trust in financial institutions is an important barrier preventing the poor from saving. We have presented this result to several groups of policymakers at the World Bank, which works directly with governments around the world on increasing financial access and enabling the poor to save, as well as government policymakers in Mexico's government development bank, main social program, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Social Development. In addition, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) used the evidence from this project in its 2016 flagship report to emphasize the role of trust in banks as a necessary condition for financial inclusion.
