 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Linn-Benton Community College's (LBCC's) \"Promoting Retention and Completion with STEM Research and Design Cohorts\" Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project will annually provide approximately 21 scholarships to academically talented LBCC STEM majors with financial need. Because this project builds upon and expands prior successful S-STEM efforts (Tech Scholars Program, TSP-I and TSP-II), participants will be referred to as TSP-III Scholars.  Chemistry, physics, geology, engineering, math, computer science, and biology will be the target majors for the scholarships. Students will engage in research and/or design project experiences as part of one of several possible Research and Design Cohorts (RDCs). This will be accomplished through a one-credit course called \"Destination Graduation,\" which is an institutional requirement; a STEM-centered version of this course will be available to S-STEM scholars.  Further, students will have the opportunity to engage in additional optional RDC activities with faculty members after completion of this course.  Scholars will be recruited primarily through targeted outreach to four groups: (1) Oregon Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) program, (2) Linn and Benton Counties' 5th Year High School Students, (3) College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP), and (4) For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST) Robotics.  Targeting these groups for recruitment is expected to yield a pool of applicants who not only have the academic talent or potential to succeed in STEM disciplines, but also financial need, as many students engaged in some of the programs are low-income, first generation college students.  Additionally, the MATE ROV teams in Oregon are roughly 50% female, thus lending to the possibility of broadening participation of women in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nExpected short-term outcomes of the project are: (1) to provide significant financial relief for the students; (2) to foster an environment where students feel supported by the program and the college to stay in school, have a sense of community at the college, achieve academic success, and transition successfully to a four year program; (3) to engage faculty in a system that assesses outcomes and makes changes when appropriate to improve student learning and retention.  The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) will be used to determine whether or not the students who receive the scholarships indeed face reduced financial strain compared to non S-STEM students, including non-STEM majors.  This survey will be issued several times throughout each year allowing for a comprehensive measure of how the scholarships impact financial stability and ability to concentrate on learning.  Intermediate expected outcomes are that TSP-III scholars will: (1) be retained and perform well academically compared to their non S-STEM counterparts; and (2) transfer successfully to a four-year institution and feel a continued sense of peer group support at those institutions.  Data reflecting student retention and success will be provided by LBCC's Office of Institutional Research to track student performance each quarter allowing faculty, advisors, and project staff to intervene early if problems are identified.  The National Student Clearinghouse will be used to track the number and percent of TSP-III Scholars who transfer successfully. In collaboration with partners such as California State University at Fullerton and Oregon State University, a follow-up survey will be administered to obtain feedback on the scholars' experience, progress, and preparedness for the four-year program as well as the extent of peer support received.",

The main vehicle for completing this goal was the creation of Research and Design Cohorts (RDCs) that helped create a community of practice where students could find increased support and motivation from faculty, staff and other students.&nbsp; RDCs are similar to Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REUs) but take advantage of scaffolding provided by external groups.&nbsp; RDCs allow for a large number of students to take part while requiring only a modest workload investment from faculty.</p>\n<p>The two RDCs created are the ?Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) Club? and the ?Space Exploration Club?.&nbsp; The ROV club centers its work around the Marine Advanced Technology Education (MATE) Center?s annual international ROV competition.&nbsp; MATE publishes mission specifications in November of every year.&nbsp; Teams then design, build, and operate ROVs capable of completing the missions and enter their ROVs in regional and international MATE competitions.&nbsp; The Space Exploration club has students select a research goal each year.&nbsp; Membership with the Oregon Space Grant Consortium helps determine each year?s research and design goal.&nbsp; This team has pursued projects that work with payload sensors aboard high-altitude balloons or rockets.</p>\n<p>During the five-year grant, RDCs were open to both S-STEM students and students not receiving S-STEM grants.&nbsp; Approximately half of S-STEM students took part in RDCs.&nbsp; Many S-STEM recipients report that it was the grant that allowed them to take part in RDC activities.&nbsp; Students taking part in the RDCs found themselves in a community that allowed for increased communication between faculty, staff and other students.&nbsp; Student and faculty reported forms of increased communication include:&nbsp; RDC members forming of student study groups for courses held in common; increased informal tutoring of students new to a course by students who previous completed that course; increased use of formal tutoring services based upon recommendations of other RDC students; recommendations by RDC students to other more junior RDC students to apply for internships and scholarships; and countless supportive acts where students or faculty would assist students in navigating school.</p>\n<p>Additional features that were created due to this grant include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a campus-wide online scholarship system:&nbsp; a new online scholarship application submission process was created that allowed students and reviewers to work with applications entirely online.&nbsp; Videos were created by S-STEM grant PI?s to assist students in writing good applications.&nbsp; Videos detailing how to mitigate effects of implicit bias were identified for reviewers working in the online review setting.&nbsp; The online scholarship application system has greatly increased student applications toward scholarships.</li>\n<li>a significant increase in summer internships gained by our students:&nbsp; the Oregon Space Grant Consortium reported that for at least two years the state of Oregon had the largest per-capita number of students taking part in NASA internships.&nbsp; Of these Oregon students, LBCC had the largest overall number of current or past students taking part in NASA internships.&nbsp; The large number of LBCC students taking part in NASA internships can be explained by two main reasons:&nbsp; a)&nbsp; the RDC model created on campus a cultural expectations for students to apply for internships and b) the RDCs themselves gave students exposure to both programming in python and use of arduinos ? both of these are often specifically listed as desirable experiences for applicants.&nbsp; These NASA internship numbers reflect an overall increased trend of LBCC students seeking and receiving summer internships and jobs in STEM fields.</li>\n<li>an institutionalization of two RDCs that provide scholarship funds and material and supply budgets:&nbsp; The ROV Team and the Space Exploration team have both become ?co-curricular clubs?.&nbsp; This status means that each team has a materials, supplies and travel budget of around $5000 each and that each team can award around $5000 of talent grants to its students each year.</li>\n<li>two one-credit classes were created that introduce students to microcontrollers, programming, sensor selection and calibration, soldering, wiring and other basic skills.&nbsp; One of these classes has students design, build and test an Arduino-run mini-ROV; the other class has students build and fly an adafruit feather datalogger on a model rocket and then analyze data collected from an accelerometer, pressure sensor and temperature sensor.&nbsp; These one-credit classes require no prior programming or electronics skills.&nbsp; Equal numbers of first-year and second-year students tend to make up the class which, as with the RDCs, creates a community were new and returning students can share and gain from one-another?s experiences.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Research and Design Cohorts, as with the more general Research Experiences for Undergraduates, help promote both retention and degree completion for STEM students.&nbsp;
