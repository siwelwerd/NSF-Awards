 "awd_abstract_narration": "Driven by discoveries, and enabled by leaps in technology and imagination, our understanding of the Universe has changed dramatically over the course of the last few decades. The fields of astronomy and astrophysics continue to create new connections to physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science. Realizing these scientific opportunities is contingent upon maintaining and strengthening the foundations of the research enterprise. Based on the decadal survey of astronomy and astrophysics, New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics, the Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics (CAA) identifies issues of concern to the astronomy and astrophysics community and provides guidance to federal agencies regarding their astronomy and astrophysics research programs in order to encourage the field?s scientific progress. The CAA is under the auspices of the Board on Physics and Astronomy and the Space Studies Board of the Division on Engineering and Physical Sciences at the National Academy of Sciences. \r\n\r\nThe activities of the Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics serve to disseminate information from the supporting agencies into the broader community, as well as provide the agency officials with community-based input. The CAA routinely gathers input from the astronomy, astrophysics, and physics communities. Additionally, members of the committee converse with agency officials, congressional staff, and members of the astronomy and astrophysics community.  Staff and committee members also participate in annual meetings of the American Astronomical Society and, occasionally, the American Association for the Advancement of Science and American Physical Society.  The CAA is supported by NASA and NSF.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics (CAA) is a joint activity of the National Academies? Board on Physics and Astronomy and the Space Studies Board.  One of its principal responsibilities is assisting the Boards in achieving their goals of monitoring the health of the scientific disciplines under their purview, identifying important new developments at the scientific forefronts, fostering interactions with other fields, strengthening connections to technology, facilitating effective service to the nation, and enhancing education in physics and astronomy.\n\nThe overarching purpose of the CAA is to support scientific progress in the fields of astronomy and astrophysics, and to assist the federal government in integrating and planning programs in these fields. The CAA?s scope spans the full range of astronomy and astrophysics research, including space- and ground-based observations. The committee's domain encompasses stellar, galactic, and extragalactic astronomy, particle astrophysics, cosmology, the search for extra-solar planets, and aspects of fundamental physics relating to astronomical objects. The CAA's scope also includes appropriate cross-disciplinary areas.\n\nOne of the ways that it carries out its responsibilities is by monitoring the progress in implementation of the recommendations of the 2010 Astronomy/Astrophysics Decadal Survey - New Worlds New Horizons (NWNH), and the consequences to NWNH and the research community of any changes in budget structure.  It also oversees the development of other studies that impact the astronomy astrophysics communities, and is the primary body at the National Academies that is involved in developing the next decadal survey for this field.\n\nDuring the reporting period, the CAA organized one independent, committee-led study: \"New Worlds, New Horizons &ndash; A Midterm Assessment.\" This study was executed by  a committee composed partially of CAA members and resulted in a timely report impacting federal support of astronomy and astrophysics.  More information about this reports is given in the report itself, which can be downloaded for free in pdf format at www.nap.edu.\n\nThe CAA stays apprised of policy and science developments through its continued interactions with federal representatives, scientists, and mission/facility leaders at its in-person and teleconference meetings.  The CAA met in-person 6 times and by teleconference approximately10 times during the course of this funding cycle.  All in-person CAA meetings feature a number of open sessions that members of the public can and do attend.  At two of those meetings, it prepared short reports, the first on the Small Explorer (SMEX) mission line at NASA and the second on the appropriateness of NASA's preparations for the upcoming decadal survey committee.\n\nThe CAA also organized two town halls at AAS meetings, through which it solicited community input on various issues, including preparation for the upcoming decadal survey.  CAA staff regularly attend AAS meeting and support an exhibit booth, at which they hand out free copies of National Academies reports (particularly pertaining to astronomy and space science) and converse with conference-goers about the roles of the CAA and the National Academies.\n\nThe committee maintains a public website (http://sites.nationalacademies.org/BPA/BPA_048755) that contains: the committee statement of task; a list of upcoming meetings and events; a list of past meetings and events; a list of the committee membership and staff; presentations from past meetings; a list of related report-writing activities; a link to the Space Studies Board website, and acknowledgement of the CAA?s sponsors at NASA and NSF.\n\nThe committee also maintains the Astro2010 web site (www.nas.edu/astro2010), which provides brief summaries and links to free downloads of the three survey reports; rosters for every committee, panel, and study group; information on the dissemination efforts and press activity following the survey?s release; and acknowledgement of the CAA?s sponsors at NASA, NSF, and DOE.
