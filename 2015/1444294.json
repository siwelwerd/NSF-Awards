 "awd_abstract_narration": "The parameterization of air-sea interaction at high wind speeds  continues as a topic of great interest to air-sea exchange. Being able to predict air-sea gas exchange of radiatively important gases such as carbon dioxide is needed to project climate scenarios.  A previous NSF award (AGS- 1036062; 1036006 Collaborative Research: Measuring Air-Sea Gas Exchange in High Winds for Improvement of Physics-Based Air-Sea Transfer Parameterizations: HiWinGS) funded a 4-year project to develop and improve gas exchange measurements.  A HiWinGS cruise to the Labrador Sea was successfully completed in Oct-Nov 2013, yielding more than 700 hours of coordinated flux and wave physics observations, including more than 100 hours at wind speeds of 15-27 m/s. This is a unique data set. \r\n\r\nSpecific goals of the analysis work undertaken here are to:\r\n1) present an analysis of the observed transfer coefficients for heat, momentum, the trace gases DMS and CO2 with respect to wind speed, stress, bubble plume characteristics and sea state; \r\n2) further develop the refined physical representations for gas transfer at high wind speeds in available bulk flux algorithms; and \r\n3) engage in a critical assessment of the various CO2 flux data sets obtained from the HiWinGS cruise.",

In general, the rate of gas transfer increases with increasing wind speed, and the gas transfer velocity is often modeled as a simple function of wind speed alone, but the wind speed dependence is not the same for all gases.&nbsp; A model which treats the various physical mechanisms independently (i.e. a &lsquo;universal&rsquo; physical model) can, in theory, represent the air-sea transfer of any gas species .&nbsp; But we have an incomplete understanding of many important physical mechanisms, especially with respect to the details of&nbsp;
