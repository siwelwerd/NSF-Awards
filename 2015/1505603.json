 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will develop nanofluid-filled louvers that can be used as light blocking devices, as well as visible light redirectors and solar infrared energy absorbers and manipulators. The louvers through their optical transparency to visible light and optical properties redirect the incoming collimated sunlight so that natural lighting improvement and management for deeper daylight penetration are achieved, reducing lighting electrical power cost. In addition, reduced glare and offsetting of artificial lighting needs can be accomplished, increasing occupants' comfort. The faculty and students involved in the project will organize lectures and workshops to share their results to the local community to inform of the possible benefits of the research. The integrated education and research program will enhance recruitment and outreach to various underrepresented communities at the two public universities that serve a large population of underrepresented students in STEM. Daylight is an important aspect of everyday life inside buildings, as it enhances individual productivity, increases student performance and well-being. The project has the potential to have an impact in the perception of and adaptation of older buildings to contemporary uses by virtue of sustainable energy technology. The project results offer a better working environment, reducing the energy requirements and the carbon footprint of buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe major objective of this project is to study the fundamental optics and thermal-fluid mechanisms for enhanced daylighting, enhanced solar infrared (IR) energy harvesting, and enhanced energy transport, via use of proposed nanofluid-filled prismatic louvers. In particular, the project will study the effects of the prismatic louver geometry, orientation and control in glazings, and the photothermal physics of nanofluids for achieving: (a) Visible light redirection and diffusion and smart control for better natural light penetration in the indoors, and (b) Selective radiation absorption through IR absorption-enhanced nanofluid for heat gain manipulation of the incoming solar radiation. The specific aims of the project include: (i) Optical analysis and experimental verification of enhanced daylighting; (ii) Spectral analysis of selected nanofluids for enhanced solar IR radiation harvesting; (iii) Thermal analysis and measurements for enhanced heat transfer and energy storage; and (iv) Daylighting and thermal management control for realizing a smart louver system. The project will develop prismatic louver geometries and orientations for optimum daylighting condition for a variety of climatic zones. At the same time, nanofluids (e.g., low-volume TiO2 nanoparticles in water) tailored for selectively increasing solar IR absorption/harvesting but not affecting visible light penetration will be developed and studied. An important objective of this project is to study the interplay between increased daylight penetration and the effects on reducing heating/cooling needs. This is required to effectively manage both the incoming light and solar radiation, by proper control of light redirection and heat transfer to either the surrounding environment, or to secondary heat exchanging and/or thermal storage tank, or to thermoelectricity generators. Theoretical and experimental work in both optics and heat transfer issues are addressed. For the first time to the project team's knowledge, the project addresses solar IR energy harvesting, regulation and management in a way that makes optimal use of their impact through an integrated and adaptable design that can address different climatic, and seasonal needs. The project through its hybrid methods and results, e.g., lighting and sun-shading, energy savings, thermal load reduction and nanofluid-based heat storage/transfer allows for the conversion of natural resources, achieving green energy and sustainability.",

To this end, it is recognized that buildings have the potential for significant energy consumption improvement.  The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that nearly half of total U.S. energy usage is from buildings and over 55% is from lighting, space heating, and space.\n\nHence, a critical factor in building performance and in particular building facade performance lies within its interaction with solar energy.  Incoming near-infrared energy can significantly increase the temperature of interior surfaces, which leads to greater cooling requirements.  Unmanaged solar energy can also introduce glare, making spaces visually uncomfortable.  Often times, in order to overcome these effects, window shades and blinds are used to block solar energy from workplaces.  However, natural light can significantly offset electric lighting requirements and is essential for a healthy and productive workplace.\n\nThe opportunity, in both thermal energy harvesting and daylighting strategies in the building's envelope design, offers potential in enhanced utilization of sunlight to increase a building's performance as well as occupants' experience.  However, many of the available technologies to date can accomplish only either energy harvesting or daylighting strategies.  Daylight harvesting refers to the redirection of sunlight into building spaces such that natural lighting is sufficient to reduce electric lighting usage and can be achieved through the intrinsic design of the building's facade or through daylight facade components.  Thermal energy harvesting refers to the proper collection and management of incoming IR solar radiation from the facade components in order to enhance the thermal behavior of a building and achieve mitigation of solar loads or harvesting of solar energy to offset mechanical system requirements. \n\nThe motivation of our work was to explore techniques and develop a technology that\n\nHarvest and manage incoming solar loads to mitigate energy requirements of a building's mechanical systems (i.e., space heating and cooling, water heating), and\nOffset artificial lighting requirements by increasing useful daylight penetration.\n\n\nIn particular, the project studied the effects of different liquid filled prismatic louver geometries and orientation in glazings, and their performance in redirecting visible solar radiation for enhancing the natural illumination, while at the same time reduces thermal loads and redirects thermal energy to secondary uses.
