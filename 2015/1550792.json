 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sustainability has become a very important topic in engineering education. According to Outcome H of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) engineers need to have \"the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context.\"  Therefore in order for engineers to fulfill their responsibility to find sustainable solutions to worldwide challenges new graduates must have the necessary knowledge, skills, and awareness to discover viable, desirable, and feasible solutions that include sustainability concepts.  \r\n\r\nThe PIs are convening a \"Summit on Global Sustainability in Engineering Education\" to: (a) gather a select group of researchers to explore pedagogical models that incorporate sustainability awareness and principles in engineering education; (b) formulate action plans for developing and deploying said learning modules; and (c) introduce global sustainability awareness at different universities in the Americas. \r\n\r\nAll participants are required to disseminate Summit and post-Summit results through conference publications.  The PIs will target dissemination through the Latin American and Caribbean Consortium of Engineering Intuitions and the ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition.  In addition all materials developed based on the Summit will be posted and available online.",
