 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase II project focuses on robot systems designed for early childhood education (preK-2). There is increasing research and applications for educational robotics, but little attention are focused on the foundational years. The early childhood segment is underserved because there are few available platforms for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education that are developmentally appropriate for children 4-7 years old. However, research shows that from an economic and a developmental standpoint, educational programs that begin in early childhood result in lower costs and more durable effects than those that begin later on. This project focuses on developmentally appropriate robot kits for young children, and the curriculum support, teacher resources and automated assessment tools to make this innovation useful for early childhood education in a broadly disseminated, sustainable and scalable way. Recent re-envisioning of early childhood programs by the Federal government has resulted in calls to develop innovative technologies and approaches for teaching STEM. Given the size of the industry devoted to early childhood education, the potential commercial impact is significant, opening new markets and job opportunities.  This innovation also has the potential to have significant positive impact on the US economy by preparing children with economically important skills.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe innovation underlying this project is the design of a robot system that engages 4 to 7 year old children in learning programming concepts through the use of a developmentally appropriate programming language. In order to be developmentally appropriate for this age range, the programming language is physical, not typed, with no screens or keyboards of any kind required. The resulting educational platform also enables children to develop engineering design process skills by building physical objects that can respond to different inputs through the use of sensors. This project is organized around five technical objectives: a developmentally appropriate robot kit for young children to learn programming and engineering; robot modules for curriculum integration with other areas such as math, science, literacy and the arts; support systems for early childhood teachers through a web portal with resources for both formal and informal education and professional development strategies; and an automated learning assessment system that collects data characterizing student learning directly from the robot, analyzes it through innovative mechanisms and displays it using visualization tools according to the different needs of parents, educators and school leadership to understand learning outcomes; and cost reduction of the robot system for broadening adoption.",

Research shows the need to start early on to introduce concepts from computer science and engineering, to avoid gender stereotypes and to reach a diverse body of students. However, in order to develop tools for young children, it is imperative that these be designed following developmentally appropriate practice to facilitate integration with STEM curriculum, while also supporting socio-emotional development and teamwork.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through this funding, KinderLab robotics developed and commercialized the KIBO kit, for children 4 to 7 years old.&nbsp;Designed for open-ended play, KIBO lets children make almost anything &ndash; a character from a story, a carousel, a dancer, a race helicopter &ndash; anything that they can think of. The child creates a sequence of instructions (a program) using the wooden KIBO blocks. They scan the blocks with the KIBO body to tell the robot what to do. They press the button and the robot comes alive. With KIBO, young children can become programmers, engineers, designers, artists, dancers, choreographers and writers, without the need of spending time sitting in front of a screen. Through this grant, different modules and sensors were developed, tested and made commercially available for KIBO to engage children in programming and interacting with the world around them. Curriculum resources and materials were developed for parents and teachers. To date, KIBO can be found in over 54 countries all over the world, and all 50 states in the US.</div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/05/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
