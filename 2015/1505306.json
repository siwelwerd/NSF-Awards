 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports a small modeling workshop to be held at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (NOAA/GFDL) in Princeton, NJ to bring together a group of scientists to focus on using the data collected in 2013 during the Southeast Atmosphere Studies (SAS), a field campaign supported in part by the Atmospheric Chemistry Program at National Science Foundation, to investigate biosphere-atmosphere interactions and the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the atmosphere.  The purpose of the workshop is to evaluate, diagnose and improve climate and air quality modeling of different temporal and spatial scales for improving representation of fundamental atmospheric processes. The effort will focus primarily on models that simulate the formation of SOA and other trace species in the troposphere over the Southeast US, with the ultimate goal of understanding the radiative impacts of these species. \r\n\r\nThe expected results of the workshop are to: (1) reconcile the discrepancies on biogenic volatile organic compound emission inventories among global and regional models; (2) make recommendations for a condensed isoprene gas-phase chemistry for use in 3-D chemical models; (3) identify the extent to which major SOA precursors and production pathways can be constrained using data from SAS; (4) summarize the possible impact of atmospheric chemistry on regional climate over Southeast US.\r\n\r\nThe workshop is enabling the community of US scientists to work together to utilize the massive amounts of data collected during the SAS campaign to answer some key questions of societal interest.  For example, an important question is: what are the roles of anthropogenic and biogenic emissions in contributing to high ozone and particulate matter concentrations over the Southeast US? And what is the best strategy for modeling SOA over this region?  These questions are important for gaining a better understanding of air quality and climate in the Southeast US.",
