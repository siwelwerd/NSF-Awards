 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research asks the question \"What STEM career routes lead to more diverse and cosmopolitan research collaborations?\"  This question is important because previous research has found that greater collaborator diversity and cosmopolitanism (e.g. collaborators from different institutions, different fields, or different countries) is positively related to publishing productivity and development of research capabilities among STEM researchers. The contributes directly to the NSF mission to promote the progress of science by studying factors related to enhancing increased research and publishing productivity, as well as considering a variety of additional career success indicators important to the health and well-being of the nation's STEM workforce.\r\n \r\nWe examine race and gender as key dimensions in our study because previous work suggests that women and underrepresented minorities will tend to have less diverse and cosmopolitan collaboration patterns, due to diminished professionally relevant social capital and network contacts. The research uses the 2006 and 2010 National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG) and examines changes in collaboration patterns over time (2006-2010) for a wide variety of STEM workers, including doctoral level but also persons with bachelors and masters' degrees. The study focuses on six distinct measures of career success: team versus individual work organization, number of employees supervised, job satisfaction, promotion, salary, and skill augmentation.  In each case, the research asks \"how does research collaborator diversity and cosmopolitanism affect success?\"",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe contributon of this study is to understanding the role of STEM degree pursuit, both undergraduate and graduate, on later career success.  The project uses NSF provided data for a de facto population of STEM graduates over several years.  One focus of the work was the extent to which, if any, a more cosmopolian approach to collaboration has an effect on career outcomes.  The study determined that the effects are consderable and that those who collaborate with a wider expanse of people have better promotion and advancement outcomes and better pay.  This is consistent with previous work done on research collaboration, but the work here includes people who are not often collaborating on research but on other business tasks and the results remain largely the same.  Another study focuses on the extent to which one's career either benefits or is disadvantaged by changing fields during one's education.  We examined both transitions to STEM degrees from non-STEM as well as from non-STEM to STEM.  Surprisingly, we fouind that both types of transitions result in more favorable career outcomes in terms of salary, rank, and numbere of people supervised. These findings constitute the intellectual merit of the study.\n\nThe reserarch from this work is available in the public domain journal literature as well as from the authors. \n\nThe broader impacts reside chiefly in the possible uses of the findings.  Perhaps the most radical use could be informing science policy which tends to consider transitions away from STEM degrees as, if not a failure, something not to be encouraged.  It people are benefiting from transtions to and from STEM then the supposition that a linear trajectory in the same field is desired should be questioned.  However, it may the case there there is a departure from the national interest in stimulating commitment of STEM careers and the indvidual's personal career outcones. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/11/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barry Bozeman"
