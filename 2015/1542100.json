 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific and engineering investigations and understanding of ultra-small objects, known as nano-materials, is not only revolutionizing critical fields such as medicine, personal electronics, and national security, but it is also sharpening the understanding of how the Earth works.  The air one breaths, the soil in which crops are planted, the metals from minerals that build industries, and the contaminants that can profoundly harm one (from arsenic to dangerous bacteria), are all related to and/or influenced by the vast store of nano-materials that make up key portions of the planet.  These nano-materials must be studied and understood, despite great difficulty due to their minute size, to safely and efficiently clean the air, purify water, and allow the responsible use of Earth's vast store of life-sustaining resources.  The Virginia Tech National Center for Earth and Environmental Nanotechnology Infrastructure (VT NCE2NI) will greatly accelerate the progress that Earth scientists and engineers have made in studying, understanding, explaining, and utilizing Earth for the well-being of all.  In addition, new types of environmental sensors and detectors based on rapidly emerging nanotechnologies, for example to detect harmful living and non-living contaminants in air, water, and soil, will clearly be a major benefit to society.  VT NCE2NI users will consist of far more than professional academics and their advanced research students.  Users will also come from private and publicly-held companies, as well as students from high schools, community colleges, liberal arts colleges, and key minority-serving universities. \r\n\r\nVT NCE2NI provides an NNCI site to specifically support researchers who work with nanoscience- and nanotechnology-related aspects of the Earth and environmental sciences/engineering at local, regional, and global scales, including the land, atmospheric, water, and biological components of these fields.  The national presence of VT NCE2NI is significantly enhanced by a close partnership with the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).  NNCI geo- and environmental science/engineering users have access to both the Virginia Tech and EMSL/PNNL sites depending on specific technical needs and geographic considerations.  VT NCE2NI consists of (i) the 15,000 sq. ft. Nanoscale Characterization and Fabrication Laboratory (NCFL) that houses a broad array of high-end, state-of-the-art electron-, ion-, and X-ray-based characterization tools, sample preparation laboratories, as well as meeting space and ample office space for visitors; and (ii) the 6,300 sq. ft. Virginia Tech Center for Sustainable Nanotechnology (VT SuN) which contains extensive nanomaterials synthesis facilities and knowhow (in aqueous, soil/solid media, and atmospheric environments), characterization tools, and experimentation/reactor systems, plus meeting rooms and additional office space for visitors.  VT NCE2NI also provides broader impact initiatives including substantial funding for students from key minority-serving institutions, and outreach programs with community colleges and four-year liberal arts colleges.  The overall contribution of this NNCI site will be to accelerate the growth of a field that is revolutionizing the understanding of several broad aspects of Earth and environmental sciences and engineering.",

This includes enhancing their ability to apply nanotechnology to solve challenges in the Earth sciences and far-reaching and critical environmental issues. NanoEarth is the only NNCI site dedicated to the nanoscience and technology of Earth and its environment and is partnered with the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory (EMSL) at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), one of the principal US Department of Energy research sites located in Richland, WA.</p>\n<p>Prior to NNCI funding, Virginia Tech's central nano-characterization and fabrication laboratory could only support a handful of external users due to limited staff availability. NNCI funds created new positions that allowed the facility to increase external users to 25% of total users. More impressive is the fact that the usage hours for external projects grew seven-fold from less than 500 to over 3,600 hr/yr over the 5 years. This drastic increase is correlated to NanoEarth's mission to support Earth/environmental researchers who often require more assistance on projects from sample preparation to instrument operation, data analysis, and interpretation. In year 4, for example, each of our 5 technical staff aided 58 users on average for over 50 hours per project.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Highlights:</strong></p>\n<p>Below are three highlights from the hundreds of projects that NanoEarth impacted:</p>\n<p>1) <strong>Natural, incidental, and engineered nanomaterials and their impacts on the Earth system</strong>: Nanomaterials are critical components in the Earth's past, present, and future characteristics and behavior. They have been present since Earth's origin in great abundance. Life, from the earliest cells to modern humans, has evolved in intimate association with naturally occurring nanomaterials. This synergy began to shift significantly with human industrialization. Since the Industrial Revolution, incidental nanomaterials (those produced unintentionally by human activity) have been produced continuously and distributed worldwide. In the past half century, engineered nanomaterials have been produced in very small amounts relative to the other two types of nanomaterials, but still in large enough quantities to make them a consequential component of the planet. Following major advances in experimental, computational, analytical, and field approaches, it is becoming possible to better assess and understand all types and origins of nanomaterials in the Earth system (Figure 1). It is also now possible to frame their immediate and long-term impact on environmental and human health at local, regional, and global scales.</p>\n<p>2) <strong>Micronic Technologies, </strong>a small, local, woman-owned technological company in Bristol, VA: This work targets the removal of nanoparticle contaminants from aqueous waste streams. A filter-free industrial-scale water purification technology effectively separated a nanomaterial-containing liquid waste stream. Most importantly, gold, titanium, and silver, all of which were present in the mixed nanoparticle waste stream were reduced by more than 99.8% (Figure 2). Collectively, these results demonstrate a filter-free, scalable approach to removing nanoparticle contaminants from aqueous waste streams.</p>\n<p>3) <strong>Dinosaur proteins</strong>: Dr. Caitlin Colleary, Assistant Curator of Vertebrate Paleontology at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, hypothesizes that proteins detected in dinosaur fossils can be definitively assigned to the original organism and excluded from exogenous contaminants. Methods currently being used to study ancient proteins destroy bone material and do not take into consideration potential mechanisms that allow proteins to be preserved on such long-time scales. However, the 21 Tesla Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (21T FTICR MS) at PNNL-EMSL, one of only two in the world, allowed analyses of fossil biomolecules with unprecedented resolution that may finally make it possible to distinguish between endogenous biomolecules and exogenous organic contaminants in dinosaur fossils. The highly specialized capability of the 21T FTICR MS makes it an ideal tool for evaluating the complicated molecular degradation of bones that have been buried and subject to millions of years of degradation and geological processes.</p>\n<p><strong>Reaching Further:</strong></p>\n<p>NanoEarth's education and outreach efforts impacted over 12,000 individuals.
