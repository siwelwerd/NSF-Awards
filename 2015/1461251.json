 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the renewal of the Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in Physics at Kansas State University. The site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.   Each year the ten-week program will involve twelve undergraduate students. At the core of the program are the research projects with mentors from Kansas State faculty.  The REU site will focus on interactions of laser light with matter at atomic and nanoscales, as well as investigations of neutrinos and elementary particle collisions and probing how students learn physics.  The experience of what real science is like helps the participants make better informed decisions about careers, graduate work and/or professional school. Whether they choose to continue in physics or a related technical field, or choose to move to a different area, bright students making good choices early in their careers is in the national interest.\r\n\r\nUndergraduate student participants will do research on how atoms and molecules behave in intense and ultra-fast optical and x-ray pulses, precision spectroscopy in laser-cooled atoms, how light interacts non-linearly in optical fibers, the properties of nanoparticles in solution, and protein self-assembly with simplified models. They will help build next-generation hardware for high-energy particle detection, improve measurements of neutrino oscillations, and help faculty use research-based assessment tools. This experience will be supplemented by a series of lectures that provide the background these students need to carry out their projects. The participants will gain experience in explaining their research work to a variety of audiences and will also read about and discuss ethical behavior in science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nKansas State University's Department of Physics hosted twelve students each summer to do research under the guidance of our outstanding faculty, funded directly by this grant from the National science Foundation, jointly sponsored by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.  These students came from around the United States, mostly from smaller colleges that offer fewer opportunities for research than we have available at K-State.  We recruited a diverse group and offered a welcoming environment for these new scientists.  The program's impact expanded as other students funded by other sources joined and enriched the experience for all. \n\nStudents actively engage in research with K-State faculty, postdocs, and graduate students on topics spanning the physics enterprise:  from molecular and laser physics, understanding how molecules dissociate into their constituent parts, to soft matter physics in which properties of cells are probed at the fundamental level, to neutrino physics and understanding what stellar populations tell us about cosmology, to investigations of how students learn physics.  Some of these research projects led to peer-reviewed journal publications, talks at conferences, and other original scientific reports. \n\nIn addition to the scientific research, K-State's REU program provides many other aspects of professional development for future scientsts. We have arranged a wide variety of seminar and training experiences, including a summer-long ethics course, taught by two philosophy professors and attended by a physics faculty member.  There, students explore many practical ethical issues, including data handling and integrity, the relationships between advisors and graduate students, and the responsibilities of scientists to their fellow researchers and to society.  Furthermore, they learn some basic skills in electrical circuit design and machining.  Our world-class faculty have given tutorials and research seminars at the undergraduate level.  Each student participant presents on their progress bi-weekly at the Friday group meetings, and gives a final presentation in the style of a contributed conference talk at the end. \n\nWe have tracked our students over many years.  A vast majority attend graduate school (78%) after graduating with a Bachelor's degree.  Furthermore, in the last three years, six former REU students have enrolled as graduate students in physics at K-State, which we view as anecdotal evidence for the positive experience of the participants.  Quantitatively, in a national comparison (the SURE III survey), participants rate our program highly.  For example, about 93% said our program exceeded their expectations, while in comparison nationally 64% said that their REU program exceeded expectations. \n\nFor many, the program confirmed their choice of a career in physics, and gave them a boost in skills and enthusiasm to pursue it.  For a small number, it helped them decide to pursue interests in engineering, medicine, or a non-technical area.  It is good for our country that bright students make an informed career choice early in their education, and this REU program has advanced that national interest.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/14/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kristan L Corwin"
