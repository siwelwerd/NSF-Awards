 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Partnerships for Innovation: Building Innovation Capacity (PFI:BIC) project addresses a significant and growing societal problem: toxic or harmful algal blooms (HABs), commonly called \"red tides\". Every year, millions of dollars are lost due to red tides and HABs throughout the US and the world. Losses can be direct, such as human illnesses and deaths from the consumption of contaminated food or the mortality of fish and shellfish resources, or indirect, such as the avoidance of all seafood products during red tides, even products that are safe. Management of areas threatened by HAB toxins currently involves monitoring programs that rely on weekly flesh-testing of shellfish collected from many locations along a coast.  These programs are expensive, slow, providing protection through conservative harvesting closure policies that have not changed for decades. Red tide management can be greatly improved through the use of technological advances such as the Environmental Sample Processor (ESP), a submersible, self-contained \"laboratory-in-a-can\" that collects water samples and identifies molecules or genes that indicate the presence of hazardous species of algae. ESPs operate autonomously for months and transmit data, including environmental conditions, to shore. The goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate ESPnet, a system that will utilize these novel biosensors to provide environmental awareness and decision support capabilities for resource managers charged with protecting public health and the viability of fisheries industries and tourism from toxic HABs. This system is transformational, as it applies a new sensor technology to a major resource management problem that is currently addressed through monitoring programs that are expensive, slow, and outdated. No other service system of this type currently exists for managing HABs, microbial pathogens, or other water-borne diseases or problems.\r\n\r\nESPnet will be based on a network of ESPs that will supply real-time, high-frequency HAB surveillance information through a web portal complete with automated data analysis and visualization tools, allowing managers to view the coastal environment with unprecedented detail so they can act decisively and effectively. The three-year project will include field deployments of multiple ESPs at key locations along the Gulf of Maine (GOM) coast. The project team will work with their industry partner, McLane Research Laboratories, to modify ESP hardware and software to reduce power consumption and extend deployments to fully sample the HAB season in the GOM.  Meeting the overall goal of this project requires a development effort to fully automate ESP data analysis and to merge that with geospatially rendered environmental measurements; this system must be tailored to non-experts and available via a user-friendly data portal. Human factors will be addressed through identification of user groups and characterization of receptivities to the new system, optimization of the manner in which system information is supplied to users, characterization of feedback among user groups, and estimation of economic costs and benefits from the ESPnet technology. \r\n\r\nThis project addresses fundamental issues underlying management of the most widespread of all HAB poisoning syndromes--paralytic shellfish poisoning or PSP. Project activities thus have important societal benefits.  The ESPnet concept can be applied to PSP problems elsewhere in the U.S., as well as to other HAB poisoning syndromes, and to a host of non-HAB problems that affect water quality, such as viruses and microbial pathogens. This project therefore satisfies the criterion \"fostering connections between discoveries and their use in the service of society\".  This project has extensive undergraduate and graduate training, as multiple students and interns will be involved. Project results will be broadly disseminated through scientific papers, workshop and conference presentations, and discussions with the media. This project thus meets NSF's Broader Impact Criterion II through \"advancing discovery in understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning\".\r\n\r\nPrimary partners include Lead institution: Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Biology Department and Marine Policy Center (non-profit research and educational institution); Industrial partner: McLane Research Laboratories (Falmouth, MA; small minority-owned business); Academic partner: Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (Moss Landing, CA; non-profit).

Currently, state agencies monitor coastal waters for toxins in the tissues of shellfish and other affected resources, typically collecting weekly samples, extracting toxins, and making regulatory decisions the basis of those results. As the HAB problem has expanded throughout the US in recent years, many agencies are struggling to monitor multiple HAB toxins and HAB species throughout the year across a range of habitats. <strong>This project advances a new approach to HAB monitoring and management that can make this monitoring more cost effective and efficient through the use of robotic instruments that detect and count HAB cells while deployed remotely in coastal waters</strong>. One of these instruments is the Environmental Sample Processor or ESP (Figure 1), sometimes referred to as ?a robotic lab in a can?. The project explored the development of ESPnet, a network of ESPs placed in coastal waters to detect HAB cells, with associated software to process and visualize those results. The study area was the Gulf of Maine, a region subject to annually recurrent outbreaks of the microscopic algae <em>Alexandrium catenella</em> that produces a toxin responsible for human illness and death from paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP).&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">This project made significant progress in multiple ways. In prior years, ESP deployments was limited to shallow locations close to shore and in relatively simple current systems. As experience with these instruments improved and modifications were made to deployment protocols and mooring design (Figure 2), it was possible to extend deployments throughout the Gulf of Maine, including in areas like the Bay of Fundy and eastern Maine where tidal currents are strong and tides enormous. ESPs and their mooring systems emerged from development and modification efforts with capabilities that allow deployments lasting three months or more in any environment found in the Gulf of Maine.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a key result, as it reduces the significant expenses of re-deployment and recovery of these instruments.</p>\n<p>Another result was the development of strong communication channels with user groups. On multiple occasions, discussions were held about user needs, and these views were incorporated into not only the locations for ESP deployments, but also in methods for the rapid dissemination of data from these instruments. For the first time ever, a robotic HAB biosensor detected a major pulse of <em>Alexandrium</em> cells that led to the emergency closure of shellfish harvesting in an area where the weekly shellfish toxin testing had not yet revealed danger. When state managers subsequently tested shellfish in that area, toxin concentrations were 40 times the regulatory limit, a truly dangerous situation prevented by the robotic sensor.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">Throughout this project, ESP's were deployed at more than ten locations in widely varying depths and currents. Experience was gained not only in deployments in coastal waters up to 100 m deep with strong currents and tides, but also with dockside deployments where the instrument was on land, but drawing water from nearby sources. This type of experience is critical to the development of a diverse and effective HAB observing system.</p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">To facilitate the collection and dissemination of data, project engineers developed a data portal and dashboard. These allow the ESP to be triggered on the basis of pre-specified criteria (e.g., salinity or other indicators of water masses known to support <em>Alexandrium</em> blooms).&nbsp; They also provide the capability to ingest data from the ESPs plus other sensors and regional data sources to provide \"situational awareness\" for managers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">Yet another significant result was the refinement of a toxin model that converts <em>Alexandrium</em> cell abundance numbers from the ESPs into estimates of shellfish toxicity.
