 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Audience Summary\r\n\r\nThe aim of this project is to use formal methods, game theory and evolutionary game theory, to gain insight into whether and how diversity does and does not improve knowledge creation. It will investigate whether the dynamics of social interaction can help explain why some academic disciplines (such as the STEM fields and philosophy) have failed to diversify. The results of this study will be used to propose concrete suggestions for how to improve participation of underrepresented groups, and women in particular, in academia and other epistemic communities. Analyzing the claim that diversity in epistemic communities improves knowledge creation, and assessing how to improve diversity in epistemic communities has the potential to significantly impact scientific outcomes and scientific inquiry. Furthermore, an exploration of why epistemic communities fail to diversify and how to change this has clear impacts for women in academia and their professional success. This project will include an integrated teaching component which will involve the development of a new undergraduate course, a new unit to be added to a second course, and two graduate seminars focusing on the outcomes of the proposed research. These courses will include results obtained from this project.  Throughout the project the PI will collaborate with graduate students, providing further integration of research and graduate education/advising. This project will also incorporate broader impacts activities including ongoing support for the UC Irvine Hypatia society for female graduate students in philosophy, a meeting for women entering graduate school in philosophy of science.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary\r\n\r\nGame theory and evolutionary game theory are methods primarily employed by social scientists and biologists. In recent years, however, these methods have increasingly been adopted by philosophers to address a number of traditional philosophical problems, including epistemological ones. This project proposes extending this methodology into an area of philosophy, feminist philosophy of science, where it has not been used previously, but where it has transformative potential. The problems of interest to feminist philosophers of science (such as how diversity influences knowledge creation, how to increase diversity in epistemic communities, the role of values in science) are well informed by the dynamics of social interaction and these dynamics can be fruitfully understood through game theoretic models. The results of the proposed project will be of interest to philosophers and philosophers of science, but also to game theorists and evolutionary game theorists in the social sciences, especially in economics which has an existing literature on women in the work force.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to investigate 1) the ways that inequitable norms emerge in human groups, especially surrounding gender and race, 2) the ways that these norms emerge in academic communities, 3) how academic communities work, including the spread of new theories, and 4) how information spreads in larger communities.  These issues were investigated using social models - computer simulations intended to represent what happens in real communities - and human subjects experiments\n\n1)    I used models to look at how cultural evolution works in groups that have social categories like race and gender.  In general, cultural evolution is very different in the face of social categories.  And, in particular, these categories lead to norms and social rules that take advantage of their presence to promote social coordination.  This can help us understand, for instance, why gendered division of labor is so common across societies - the presence of social categories allows for coordination.  Other norms also emerge in the presence of these categories that do not promote coordination, though.  These are bargaining norms.  The tendency is that once categories are in place, unfair bargaining tends to emerge since categories allow the creation of rules like \"men get more and women get less\".  This part of the project yielded an academic book, \"The Origins of Unfairness\", and four academic papers. \n\n2)    Academic communities are composed of people with social identities - men, women, people of different colors, and different sexual orientations.  These facts matter to how science is done.  I used models to look at how social identity might impact academic communities, and especially collaboration in these communities.  In particular, I investigated how and why certain groups might get less academic credit for their work as a result of bargaining in collaborations.   In addition, my co-authors and I used network models, that represent social ties in a group, to look at how and why people might pick collaborative partners.  For instance, a black scientist might avoid white collaborators if she is likely to be discriminated against by these individuals.  This part of the project yielded four academic papers.\n\n3)    Social models can tell us something about how scientific communities work, and thus how to improve the progress of science.  In this part of the grant I looked at a number of questions.  I investigated whether it is better or worse for scientists to communicate broadly within their community.  I considered why conservative research strategies might be selected for by the processes of hiring in science.  I also looked at how psychological biases related to social trust and conformity might impact the progress of scientific theory change.  And lastly, I investigated how industry can use propaganda to shape public belief related to science.  This part of the project yielded six academic papers\n\n4)    The last part of the project asked: given our social networks, why do people hold false beliefs?  And how can we promote good beliefs?  It drew very heavily on work from part 3.  In particular, understanding belief and theory change in science can give us important insight into beliefs in broader communities.  We found that understanding social ties and social biases is crucial to understanding why people hold the beliefs they do.  We also found that these social ties make us vulnerable to particular kinds of propaganda, especially on social media where bad actors can pose as trusted peers.  In order to protect public belief, we suggest that it is important to treat misinformation as an ever-evolving threat that requires ever-evolving strategies to fight.  This part of the project yielded the book \"The Misinformation Age\", one academic paper, and several more popular articles and blog posts.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/09/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Cailin M O'connor"
