 "awd_abstract_narration": "The relationship between engineers and their ultimate client, the often-invisible public, lies at the heart of the engineering profession's identity and mission. Today, the over 2 million practicing engineers in the US routinely make complex and critical decisions with significant implications for the public's health, safety, and welfare in a relational vacuum, where publics are imagined rather than engaged with. Postulating that different conceptions of the public reinforce different professional ideologies, identities, and forms of practice, this research seeks to examine how engineers see their relationship to the public, what formal and informal mechanisms form those views, and how existing conceptions are expressed in interactions with diverse publics. This work constitutes a first step toward deeper insight into how the belief structures created by engineers' conceptions of the public enhance or weaken engineering practice and, ultimately, how they support or undermine the profession's aspiration to promote the social good. Results will provide a basis from which engineering education and the engineering profession at large could shift to include a reimagined view of the public that renders publics visible, underscores the technical and moral relevance of their voices, and gives them a well-defined role in the engineering enterprise. By extension, this research will make possible a revised understanding of engineers' role in society.\r\n\r\nThis research is driven by the hypothesis that engineering education promotes conceptions that distance engineers from the publics they serve and compromise their ability to promote the social good in locally desirable and socially just ways. The proposed study initiates research in engineers' conceptions of the public - what these conceptions are, how they form, and how they are expressed in interactions with diverse publics during boundary work - through a single case study methodology. The research design includes the following data sources: 1) official engineering documents that frame the profession's discourse around engineers' relationship with society, 2) interviews with engineering students, faculty, and practicing professionals, and 3) interviews with members of mobilized publics who have extensive experience - positive and/or negative - interacting with engineers. The analysis will involve two qualitative research techniques to identify prevalent engineering conceptions, and will culminate in data triangulation to determine points of convergence and divergence between how engineers view the public and how members of diverse publics view themselves. This work is exploratory, aiming to build a deeper understanding about engineers' conceptions of the public. The goal is to set a foundation from which educational interventions that foster mutually edifying collaborations between engineers and society can be explored, developed, and implemented.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research has focused on the ways in which engineers conceive of \"the public\", where those conceptions come from and to hypothesize ways in which those conceptions may influence how engineers approach problem solving.  Core engineering documents that highlight the profession?s values and goals were analyzed and it was found that engineers largely see themselves as problem solvers and see \"the public\" as recipients of the benefits that engineering work provides.  In these documents, it was often recognized that collaboration was important to solving complex social problems, while simultaneously \"the public\" was characterized as developing, poor, lacking information and technologically illiterate. \n\nInterviews with engineering students, faculty and working professionals showed a more diverse range of views with respect to the relationship between engineers and \"the public.\"  In some cases, \"the public\" was seen as a valuable source of local knowledge and experience as well as critical \"end users\" whose input was essential toward achieving successful engineering designs.  In other cases, \"the public\" was seen largely as a hinderance to efficiency and the engineering process.   In many cases the engineers expressed concerns that \"the public\" was unaware of what engineers do and therefore interacted with unfair or unrealistic expectations, making it difficult for engineers.  Oftentimes when describing the ideal relationship between engineers and \"the public\", however, the engineers discussed issues like collaboration, mutual respect and where engineers and the public are both informed about the other.  The interviewees expressed that this ideal relationship would lead to better engineering designs, better use of funds, and could help foster better informed engineers and members of \"the public.\" \n\n Finally, interviews with members of \"the public\" (non-engineers) who had been involved in complex social issues with engineering were conducted.  Preliminary analysis of these interviews has shown that these members of \"the public\" often felt unheard and disempowered in relation to engineers and also to the regulatory agencies that engineers worked for. \n\nThis work has opened a critical space for introspection by the engineering profession, which is essential right now given the largely publicized and damaging consequences that have come from engineering mistakes in relation to safety, health and the environment.  This work points to latent messages in the engineering profession that place \"the public\" predominately in a \"one down\" position in relation to engineers.  This distancing between engineers and \"the public\" can be very dangerous, especially as engineers work more and more on socially contextualized problems like climate change, poverty reduction, and environmental quality.   This work has built a foundation to better understand those critical views in engineers and will serve as a spring board for future work addressing ways to create different messages about \"the public\" in engineering education and for the engineering profession.  Ideally, this revision of how engineers conceive of \"the public\" will foster better relationships between engineers and \"the public\", where engineers actively work to empower and listen to members of \"the public\" toward finding more appropriate and mutually beneficial solutions.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nathan Canney"
