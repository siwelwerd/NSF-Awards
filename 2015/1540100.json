 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concussions are a significant health concern and there is growing research in the field.  Unfortunately, researchers who are in different disciplines and working on concussion-related research are often unaware of the current state-of-knowledge in the other disciplines. This workshop will aim to facilitate discussions about the current state of the knowledge with respect to the sources, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of concussions and to provide an opportunity for the establishment of new working teams that can make significant advances.  Outcomes of this workshop will include pathways for understanding the relationship between the specific impact event and resulting degree of injury, design of effective protective equipment from such injuries, and technology to integrate health-monitoring devices into the equipment.  The workshop will facilitate cross-disciplinary research that is expected to significantly improve the prevention and diagnosis of concussions, thus making sports safer for athletes and combat safer for soldiers.  The workshop will also help the development a roadmap for future research and policy in concussion prevention and diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThe cross-disciplinary concussion prevention and diagnosis workshop will bring together a diverse audience with a collective wealth of knowledge in order to facilitate discussions about the current state of the knowledge with respect to the sources, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of concussions; identify research gaps; determine future research paths that will provide solutions to the concussion epidemic; generate a report that will assist funding agencies in defining research initiatives; provide opportunities for new working teams; and disseminate knowledge across disciplines through panel sessions.  The workshop will include cross-disciplinary panel sessions and small-group discussion sessions.  The four panel sessions will interrogate the approaches used for four different population segments, youth sports, females in high school and collegiate sports, professional sports, and the military.  Within each session, the goal will be to identify the cross-disciplinary research gaps and determine the future research paths.  The topics will cross between dynamics, biomechanics, sensors, bioengineering, materials, medicine, and imaging.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF funding enabled The University of Massachusetts Lowell to host a series of two workshops structured to bring together a highly-interdisciplinary group of researchers and practitioners to discuss the current state of concussion research and determine paths forward to address the prevalence of concussions in and out of sports.  The first workshop was held on June 2-3, 2015 and the second workshop was held on April 10-11, 2017.  \n\nConcussions are a form of traumatic brain injury caused by an impact and are a growing concern among athletes and those who are involved with sport.  Recent years have led to increases in awareness and research related to concussions but little definitive understanding of the specific mechanism and pathology of concussions.  Unfortunately, researchers who are in different disciplines and working on concussions are often unaware of the current state-of-knowledge in the other disciplines. These workshops facilitated discussions about the current state of the knowledge with respect to the sources, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of concussions and provided an opportunity for the establishment of new working teams.  \n\nTechnology is beginning to take on an important role in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of concussions.  Sensors must initially provide data about the impact and the athlete to understand the mechanism of the injury.  Only after a more definitive understanding of the injury mechanism, can sensors and protective equipment design contribute to an effective monitoring and protection of athletes.  It was made clear during the 2015 workshop that there are a many gaps in current research focused on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of concussions.  \n\nEducation and awareness surrounding concussions has a significant ability to reduce the occurrence and improve the diagnosis of concussions, but more research is needed in providing educational awareness programs with better scientific data and principles and in determining the efficacy of those programs.  New technologies are being developed and used, but there are concerns about the reliability of those technologies, in part because there are very few standards or testing for the equipment.  The designs of new helmet systems must be advanced, but the helmets must be tailored to the types of impacts which cause traumatic brain injuries in the sports.  The design of helmets and other protective equipment must address both rotational and linear accelerations caused by differing impact locations, magnitudes and durations and differing athlete susceptibility to those impacts.  Neck strength was one physiological condition identified which could have a significant contribution and therefore could be a subject of more research.\n\nThe most significant problem, as identified during the workshop, in diagnosing concussions is lack of a definitive objective marker to confirm that the person actually experienced a concussion. It was discussed that even if such a perfect bio-marker was found, it would not conclude which section of the brain were affected. This presents a challenge for educated decision making in return-to-play and return to normal activities.  Ocular response was identified as one potential method for detecting concussions.  Preseason and post-impact tests often include a subjective combination of balance, eye movement, and cognitive tests to diagnosis a concussion.  Concussion diagnosis is also plagued by concerns of under-reporting of concussions and concussive symptoms in sports.\n\nOne of the most significant research gaps in the treatment of concussions is the lack of double-blind studies to evaluate the current treatment practices. Currently, rest is the only treatment commonly recommended, and this is partly because it is known that rest cannot aggravate the symptoms. Light cognitive exercise now sometimes used to treat concussions so long as it does not exacerbate the symptoms. In addition to affecting the initial impact, factors like nutrition can also affect the healing process after an impact.  Treating concussion with nutritional supplements, such as Zinc, was identified as a potential treatment method, but those treatments lack the necessary clinical studies to determine efficacy.  Return-to-play, study, and activity guidelines also lack the research to have clinical confidence in those practices.\n\nThe highly-interdisciplinary 2017 Concussion Research Workshop brought together a similarly diverse group of participants as the 2015 workshop and leveraged its outcomes.  The 2017 workshop focused on facilitating each participant?s basic knowledge about the cross-disciplinary elements of advancing concussion research.  Key elements of advances in wearable and imaging technologies were discussed and identified as critical areas of research which offer abilities to contribute to overcoming the lack of understanding about the impact conditions.  Many of the challenges to overcome are part of other broad areas of research in wearable sensors, flexible electronics, big data, active image processing, data security, and smart and connected health systems.  \n\nThe series of concussion research workshops have provide direction of future research which will advance the fundamental understanding of the specific mechanism and pathology of concussions and accelerate the technologies needed to better prevent, diagnose and treat concussions.\n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/17/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Xingwei Wang"
