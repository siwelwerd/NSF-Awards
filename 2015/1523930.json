 "awd_abstract_narration": "Internal-wave strain and internal-wave-driven turbulent mixing for the global ocean will be mapped using the WOCE (World Ocean Circulation Experiment) hydrographic data set of more than 18,000 CTD (Conductivity, Temperature and Depth) profiles.  Diapycnal diffusivities will be estimated using a strain-only version of a fine-scale parameterization which has been found to agree with the shear-and-strain version to within a factor of 2.  The proposed work represents a more than 5-fold expansion in coverage.  These mixing predictions will be compared with those from density-overturn analysis being conducted by Luther and Decloedt (2010) on the same data set.  Refinements to the fine-scale parameterization will be made based on recent advances and insights.\r\n\r\nThis project expands on previous work which used shear and strain from ~3500 Lowered ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler)and CTD profiles.  That work found that (i) most of the ocean was characterized by small diffusivities consistent with direct but sparse microstructure measurements, and (ii) turbulence was extremely heterogeneous, with hotspots associated with abrupt topography.  Sampling was sufficient to infer global-average diapycnal velocities as a function of depth and latitude from the vertical advective-diffusive equation.  However, much of the ocean was undersampled and statistics were inadequate to characterize the meridional overturning circulation by individual basin.  The proposed analysis will provide a much more comprehensive geography of ocean mixing.  Inferences of the thermohaline circulation basin-by-basin will test if the bulk of the overturning occurs in the Indian Ocean as inverse budgets suggest. With higher vertical resolution, finer binning of internal wave strain will be possible.  Concerns that the scaling falls short near strong forcing will be addressed by comparison with density-overturn analysis of the same data set.  It remains to be seen whether ocean mixing is dominated by weak widespread internal-wave-driven mixing or very intense hotspots.\r\n\r\nQuantifying and understanding of ocean mixing remains one of the most vexing problems in physical oceanography.  Its correct parameterization in general circulation models (GCMs) is critical to correctly reproducing a wide range of features on timescales of months to millennia, linking it not just to the circulation but also weather prediction, biogeochemical cycles and longterm climate.  As a member of the Climate Processes Team on Representing Internal-Wave Driven Mixing in Global Ocean Models, the PI is working closely with numerical modelers to improve sub-grid-scale parameterizations for internal-wave-driven turbulent mixing in GCMs.  As with the earlier work, the PI will be available to help other researchers with their implementations of the fine-scale parameterization in other data sets.  Predictions from this work will be publicly available to the community.  The PI will work with outreach resources at APL-U of Washington to better educate the general public in the roles of waves and mixing in physical oceanography.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAway from the surface and bottom, ocean mixing is driven mostly by breaking internal gravity waves which carry energy into the interior from boundary forcing by wind and tides.  A parameterization for turbulent mixing based on internal-wave strain was applied to 30,000 full-depth profiles of temperature and salinity from all the major oceans to produce a geography of ocean mixing.  This represents 30 times the number of profiles previously used for such studies.  The global turbulent dissipation of 2 TW is consistent with  internal-wave tidal and wind power sources, allowing energy budgets to  be considered.  But depth-integrated dissipations vary by 3-4 orders of  magnitude, elevated over mid-ocean ridges (as illustrated by the map of vertically integrated turbulent dissipation rates in the North Pacific which shows elevated values over the Hawaiian Ridge and numerous ridges in the western basin) through the full water column (as illustrated by repeated east-west sections of turbulent diffusivity K in the Indian Ocean) in contrast to previous work which suggested turbulence was concentrated near the bottom over rough topography.  \n\n The distribution of mixing as a function of depth and latitude in the Indian, Pacific and Atlantic illustrates that average diffusivities are relatively uniform and turbulent dissipation rates concentrated in the more stratified upper 1 kilometer of the ocean at temperate and subtropical latitudes where density stratification is strongest.  Little evidence is found for elevated mixing in the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. \n\nThe mixing rates can be used to quantify the meridional overturning circulation, also known as the global conveyor belt, that connects the abyssal and upper ocean.  Upwelling dominates but is weaker than previous estimates.  \n\nThis work represents a major advance in describing the geography and global budgets of turbulent dissipation and mixing in the ocean, linking the smallest (1 cm) physical scales of turbulence with the largest (10,000 km) of the global conveyor belt.  Questions remain about why the geographic and vertical distributions exhibit the patterns observed and whether anything has been missed, particularly near the bottom and surface where the parameterization is less reliable. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/12/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric Kunze"
