 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics.  The Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array System (VERITAS), located in southern Arizona, is a ground-based observatory designed to study high energy gamma-rays.  VERITAS has unique capabilities, providing high sensitivity pointed observations of both galactic and extragalactic sources.  This award supports scientists at California Polytech State University to carry out research with VERITAS.  The group will work on improved gamma-ray detection algorithms for VERITAS and use the improved sensitivity to study acceleration mechanisms in active galaxies and to search for dark matter.  Undergraduates will be involved in the research.  The group will work with the Center for Excellence in Science and Mathematics Education to communicate the physics of black holes and high energy gamma-ray emission to students.  They will also work with teachers in the Student Teacher and Research program and develop teaching supplements that can be used in middle school curricula.\r\n\r\nVERITAS has embarked upon a broad program of Galactic and extragalactic source observations, as well as studies of signatures for new physics such as dark matter.  With this award the California Polytech State University group will work on improvements to the stereo reconstruction algorithm, focusing on the gamma-ray shower impact position, zenith, azimuth, shower height, and energy.  Undergraduates in the group will use the improved detection algorithms to analyze blazar data.  The group will study observations of dwarf galaxies to look for signatures of dark matter.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThe primary goals of this project were to improve VERITAS gamma-ray detection algorithms and to use the improved algorithms to study the acceleration mechanisms of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and dark matter while bringing astrophysics experiences to Cal Poly undergraduate students.  Active galaxies are powered by a supermassive black hole located at their center.  The primary physical features are a disk of stellar material that is accreting onto the black hole and a jet of very energetic particles emitted near the black hole's event horizon that is directed perpendicular to the accretion disk. AGN are classified as Blazars when the jet of high-energy particles is oriented such that it points toward our telescopes on earth.  Slightly misaligned jets are classified as Radio Galaxies.  The key to understanding the physical mechanisms close to the black hole is to measure the energy spectrum of these sources.  We also search for VHE emissions from dwarf galaxies that are relatively nearby, have a very high dark matter content, and few or no other sources of VHE gamma-rays.  Our hope is to detect the extremely rare decays or interactions of dark matter particles which make up about 25% of the universe but have so far eluded direct detection.\n\nThe VERITAS collaboration has detected more than 63 very-high energy (VHE) gamma-ray sources with the Very Energetic Radiation Imaging Telescope Array (VERITAS), located at the Whipple Observatory in Southern Arizona.  Of note in the list of detections is 3C 264 which was the second radio galaxy discovered by VERITAS [1, 2].  The new Shower-Image Template Stereo-Reconstruction Method (ITM) developed by the PI using support from this grant [3] was instrumental for extracting this science.  Our multi-wavelength analysis of the spectrum suggests that 3C 264 is a variable source and that we detected it in a state of enhanced gamma-ray emission in February and March of 2018.  The enhanced emission is attributed to the injection mechanism of the jet near the supermassive black hole.  Monitoring of this source continues because two of the knots further down the jet are starting to collide and we are looking to see if this interaction also produces very-high-energy gamma-rays. \nThe ITM method is also used to analyze the dark matter targets because it significantly reduces bias in the backgrounds thereby improving our understanding of the images and the information we can extract from them. A Cal Poly senior project student analyzed observations of Ursa Major II with the ITM method in search of dark matter.   The sensitivity to dark matter was increased, but no signal was detected.\n \n\n\nThe broader impacts of this work include the educational development of undergraduates and community outreach.  In 2017, the PI invited undergraduates to join the VERITAS effort to discover very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from Active Galaxies.  Ten students have participated in the project.  They learned new computer skills and the data analysis techniques needed to identify gamma-ray signals.  They related the signals to the physical mechanisms going on near the supermassive black holes in AGN.  The extreme application of modern physics combined with the excitement of discovering new sources of very-high energy gamma rays is a powerful introduction to what research is all about and it is a great motivator for studying physics.  Five undergraduate students went on to work on in-depth studies aimed at improving the collaboration analysis software. Four of these students were able to join the PI on observing shifts in Arizona prior to the COVID shut down.  In addition, the PI has given public lectures, conference presentations, outreach colloquia, and a Public Radio interview.
