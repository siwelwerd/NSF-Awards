A final joint session will summarize the results from the different breakout teams and summarize recommendations for future research. This Workshop will gather some of the leading US and European experts in quantum photonics and facilitate cross-pollination of ideas that will impact future science and technology. This conference will cover a wide range of multidisciplinary topics related to quantum information on a chip. It will open up new directions for research that will leverage out the infrastructure in the area of nanophotonic integration.",
