 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides support for a three day conference titled \"Health in Africa and the Post-2015 Millennium Development Agenda\" to be held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign on May 20-22, 2015. The symposium will facilitate an interdisciplinary examination of the health conditions in Africa 15 years after the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were adopted in 2000 by the United Nations. The MDGs are a set of eight international development goals with a vision to create a world with less poverty, hunger and disease, greater survival prospects for mothers and their infants, better educated children, equal opportunities for women, and a healthier environment; a world in which developed and developing countries work in partnership for the betterment of all. The objective of this symposium is to assess the success and failures of the Millennium Development Goals in the areas of health and disease in sub-Saharan Africa. A core group of researchers based at the University of Illinois in the fields of medical geography, public/global health, and epidemiology will lead the symposium. An interdisciplinary group of both young and well established researchers from Africa and North America, including graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, will be invited to participate in the three day event.\r\n\r\nDespite the commitment of the United Nations and its member nations to achieve the Millennium Development goals by 2015, progress on three of the goals related to health is yet to be realized. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to bear the burden of a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, and Ebola and faces an emerging prevalence of non-communicable disease such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The challenges posed by this dual burden of disease and its demographic, economic, social and epidemiological impacts are enormous in a continent facing resource-constrained health systems. This conference will place particular focus on the socio-environmental and geopolitical factors affecting health conditions in Africa. Specific papers will examine these factors from different theoretical perspectives, including disease ecology, the demographic transition model, the epidemiologic transition and nutrition transition frameworks as well as globalization. Conference findings will be widely disseminated with the intent to advance recommendations for the \"Post-2015 Development Agenda\". The conference will also provide a forum to launch collaborative initiatives for mitigating the dual burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to examine the rising \"dual burden\" of infectious and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in relation to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). It was deemed that the scale of the challenge demanded an extraordinary response hence the need to bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers to discuss these issues and advance recommendations. The project was particularly concerned with socio-environmental and geo-political factors affecting the shifting burden of infectious diseases and NCDs in SSA and the effects on already fragile, resource-constrained health care systems.  However, in the project's final year, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded the scope to include analyzing health systems' responses and resilience in confronting the pandemic in SSA.\n\nMuch of the work for this project began at a three-day symposium on \"Health in Africa and the Post-2015 Millennium Development Agenda\" held at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2015. Panels and presentations were organized around the themes of food security; maternal and infant health; health service provision; infectious diseases; and NCDs.  Hailing from Africa, North America, and Europe, symposium participants included academic researchers, policy analysts, and representatives of non-governmental organizations and African national public health agencies.  The Symposium served as a springboard for the project's major outputs which include an edited book and two sets of publications in scientific journals, as discussed here.\n\nOne of the major outcomes of this project comprised a series of rigorous empirical studies that document the dual burden of disease in SSA including continued challenges posed by communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and malaria, along with the increasing prevalence of NCDs including diabetes, hypertension, and obesity.  Published as chapters in the edited volume, Public Health, Disease, and Development in Africa (Routledge, 2018), the studies not only describe changing patterns of disease burden across SSA, but also discuss sociopolitical and environmental drivers of change including changes in diet and food supply, political instability, deforestation, climate, and cultural norms.  Many of the chapters adopt a case study approach and include in-depth investigations of specific health outcomes in specific countries and/or districts. \n\nMaternal and child health is a critically important health issue in SSA and one that is strongly rooted in the dual burden.  For mothers and children, exposures to infectious diseases and experiences of NCDs can increase the risk of adverse health outcomes including undernutrition and maternal and infant mortality.  Project participants investigated these topics in a series of papers published in the journal, Global Public Health in 2017.  The papers highlight the considerable progress in many SSA countries in tacking infant and child mortality, while documenting disparities in progress within countries based on rural-urban location, poverty, and educational attainment.  Another important theme is the uneven availability of health care services for mothers and children across SSA and the challenges women face in accessing skilled birth attendants.  Data for Malawi and Nigeria show that many women, especially poor women, do not have a skilled attendant to assist with childbirth, despite the World Health Organization's recommendation that an attendant be present.\n\nThe project's final contribution will comprise a series of articles on \"Resilient Health Systems for Sub-Saharan Africa: Lessons Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic\" to be published in the open-access journal, Annals of Global Health.  Looking retrospectively, with implications for the future, articles address the significant gap in the research literature about COVID-19 testing, surveillance systems, and vaccination efforts in the context of SSA. With an emphasis on resilience, the articles discuss lessons learnt in countries' varying responses to the pandemic, and they describe exemplars, such as public-private partnerships, for building responsive and effective health systems.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/08/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sara Mclafferty"
