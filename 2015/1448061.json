 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project will be to recycle materials for use in manufacture of advanced batteries.  Success and commercialization of this projects? technology will facilitate recycling of consumer and electric vehicle waste batteries.  The project enhances scientific understanding by demonstrating the durability, robustness and recyclability of advanced engineered materials.  Societal and commercial impacts of the successful commercial implementation include: (1) Preservation of critical materials (for example cobalt) for processing into the new battery. (2) Savings of energy used in mining, and the avoidance of sulfur oxides (SOX) and arsenide that result in processing ores. (3) Elimination of hazardous disposal costs of end-of-life batteries. (4) Reduced manufacturing costs. (5) Establishment of new jobs required for collection, processing and distribution of materials. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of this Phase I research project are to demonstrate feasibility of recycling material from lithium-ion batteries. The research project will recycle scrap batteries using innovative processes that produce material suitable for use in new batteries.  The project will process and characterize the recycled materials and compare those technical results with appropriate standards.  To stage the pre-commercial demonstration, new cells will use recycled materials and be characterized directly for capacity, rate and cycle life.  The Phase I project will target a small cell made using recycled material.  The Phase I project will result in comparative analysis of small cells made using recycled material and standard commercial material, with performance expectation of the cell from recycled material to be within 5-10% of the cell from fresh commercial material.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Small Business Technology Transfer Phase I project \"Advanced Materials Recycling of Lithium-ion Battery Electrodes\" demonstrated early stage feasibility of a new cathode-to-cathode method of recycling Li-ion battery electrodes.   Rather than classical separation and purification of metals components, the innovation applied low-energy methods to recover spent-electrode material and prepare a functional Li-ion battery electrode. Small test cells built during the effort demonstrated manufacturing grade performance of the recycled material.\n\n \n\nResults Summary:\n\nThe project developed recycling processes using electrodes harvested from source-cells as a function of state of health.  The performance of recycled material was evaluated using test cells made from recycled and standard electrode materials.  At the conclusion of the project, cells were built with a mix of recycled and commercial electrodes and compared with a standard, their equal performance demonstrated demonstrated a potential use of recycled material in manufacturing.  The development characterized materials as a function of product state from harvest through recycle treatment.  To summarize the observations, harvested electrode material from spent batteries had low capacity (for example, specific capacity of 127 mAh/g) and low discharge voltage.  After treatment with the Phase I process the material demonstrated a significant rebound in capacity (147mAh/g) and maintained a high voltage discharge profile.  While the recycled material capacity improves to meet the original material in future developmental work, recycled material from this process is suitable to mix with commercial electrodes.  With a technically viable recycled product for the advanced battery market, the project result provides a starting point in a road map for the battery industry to reduce costs and improve sustainability.  A continued effort in Phase II will improve the process capabilities and scale.\n\nCommercial Applicability:\n\nThe commercial application of this technology is recycling of Li-ion batteries from portable electronics, electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage.  The battery industry has cost challenges for materials at the beginning of life and disposal at the end.  The recycling industry based upon the process addresses them by reducing lifetime costs and returning critical material to battery manufacturing.  Current metal refining technologies are technical misfits for recovery of advanced battery materials. With little constituent elemental value in Li-ion applications, recyclers must add substantial fees to process end of life cells, and cannot return material for the manufacture of new batteries.  As a low cost cathode-to-cathode recycling technology, this development has the capability to improve the value of products from recycling, and therefore, reduce the cost of recycling.  Vertical integration of cathode-to-cathode recycling with battery manufacturing can provide for a 30% cost reduction in manufacturing.  With successful scale development in Phase II and beyond, the commercial scale will reduce the recycling burden below the current industrial goal of 4% of OEM cost.\n\n \n\nEfficiency and Environmental Impact:\n\nThis project developed environmentally friendly processes to recycle Li-ion batteries. In comparison with current refining processes, the innovation eliminates waste, uses 12% of the energy to produce a usable cathode product, and contributes to the sustainable use of critical materials such as lithium.  The reuse of electrode material demonstrates a pathway to avoid emissions such as sulfur oxides (SOX) and arsenide that result in processing ores.\n\nPublic Benefits:\n\nMany Americans expect efficient technology to exist for the recycle of advanced batteries.  International agreements prohibit the export of electronic scrap batteries, and critical elements are commonly on the bill of materials for lithium-ion batteries.  These must be maintained within the ..."
