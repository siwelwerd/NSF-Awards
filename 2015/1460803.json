 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the International REU site for Gravitational Physics hosted by the Physics Department at the University of Florida, Gainesville. The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and NSF supported Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatories (LIGO) projects take advantage of a growing number of research-able faculty at small and minority colleges in support of their research efforts. At this REU site, undergraduate students will have an opportunity to establish contact with, experience the research environment of, and work beside, international collaborators involved in all aspects of gravitational wave detection. They will be encouraged to develop, on their own accord, ongoing projects with their international partners.  Exposure to research will help cultivate students' independence, while the experience in an international setting will furnish them with contacts within a global network, as they pursue their future research.  In addition, interaction with large, focused collaborations such as LIGO/Virgo and eLISA can catalyze exposure of these students to the realm and scope of research.\r\n\r\nDetection of gravitational waves requires extremely sophisticated techniques in experiment and analysis; it also involves large facilities, significant manpower and international collaborations. Research projects will take place at a variety of locations, including the Albert Einstein Institute, Hannover; APC, Paris; the National Astronomical Observatory, Tokyo; University of Glasgow; University of Birmingham; Cardiff University; University of Adelaide; Australian National University, Canberra; the University of Western Australia, Perth; Seoul National University, Seoul; Laboratoire de l'Acc\u00e9l\u00e9rateur Lin\u00e9aire, Orsay; National Institute for Subatomic Physics (NIKHEF), Amsterdam; University of Melbourne; and INFN laboratories, Italy - all in conjunction with the University of Florida.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the duration of this grant we have had a total of 95 students experience the challenge of our IREU program, in 18 different institutions throughout Europe and Asia.  Our program focuses on students from small schools with restricted access to research facilities, and on students of minority status, with the intention of offering them increased access to current research environments.  Despite COVID, we were able to continue functioning through the extended period of national lock-downs, principally because a sufficient number of hosts were willing to propose and mentor online projects at a time when there was no other option.  Our program would have been impossible without the continued involvement of graduate student assistants and other administrative staff.  We have been very fortunate to have Paul Fulda and Peter Wass willing to take over management of our program at a time when the two original PIs were in the process of stepping back to make way for younger leaders, and we are grateful they have chosen to seek out new hosts so that IREU projects can remain at the forefront of current research.  Our NSF funding has shown very clear support the framework which enables the IREU experience, and we look forward to a vibrant and sustained program for decades to come.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bernard F Whiting"
