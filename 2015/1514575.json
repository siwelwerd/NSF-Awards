 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: Pressure Based Mapping of Protein Free Energy Landscapes\r\n\r\nProteins are the molecules in our bodies and in all other living organisms, plants, bacteria, fish, animals, that do most of the work to maintain and reproduce life. They are chains of small chemicals, called amino acids that are linked together. The number and order of the amino acids defines the shape or structure of the protein and also its function. Proteins fold up into compact shapes, but to do their jobs like digesting food or generating the force that makes birds and insects fly, they have to change their shape. This research is aimed at understanding how the sequence of amino acids defines the folding of proteins and how they change their shapes to function. Understanding how protein sequences control their shape and function will be of great use in designing new proteins for applications in biotechnology. For example, better, more active and more stable proteins can be designed for green chemistry bioreactors to make the chemicals used in daily life without harming the environment. Proteins are nano-machines and nanomaterials that will find numerous applications in electronics, computing, biosensing and nano-fabrication. All of these technological advances will be based on the understanding of the relationship between protein sequence, stability and function. The strong international collaboration on which this research is based will provide the students with a world-view of the scientific endeavor, and help them establish international networks that will aid them as they pursue their careers. The graduate and undergraduate students who will participate in the research will be immersed in a comprehensive interdisciplinary environment, incorporating multiple experimental and computational approaches. The large NMR data sets generated by the research are shared with the NSF sponsored undergraduate educational program in the undergraduate computer science major at RPI, the Data Analytics Through-out Undergraduate Mathematics program (DATUM). Support will be provided for the undergraduate research program run by the Center for Biotechnology. The research will also involve the RPI high school internship program run by the Center for Biotechnology for Troy area high schools (with a large minority population). \r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to map experimentally the folding free energy landscapes for selected model proteins, and to identify the sequence and structural determinants of their folding cooperativity, initiation and pathways.  This will be accomplished by exploiting the advantages of pressure perturbation coupled with site specific NMR, fluorescence, SAXS and other biophysical approaches. The underlying premise of the present proposal is that pressure, due to its unique mechanism of action, can provide exclusive insights into protein folding. Within the framework of the main objective, three specific questions will be addressed:  How does sequence code for protein folding cooperativity.   How are protein cooperative interactions linked to their volumetric thermal expansion.   How do residual native interactions in pressure unfolded states affect folding mechanisms. This project  will address central outstanding issues in protein folding and conformational dynamics, first by significantly and systematically increasing the experimental database of detailed protein folding energy landscapes. Secondly, it will provide experimental scenarios describing how sequence defines folding routes and cooperativity. Finally, it will reveal how sequence specifically controls access to excited states on folding landscapes.  This project is jointly funded by the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Physics of Living Systems Program in the Division of Physics in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.",

Most of the work was carried out on a model protein, whose structure was made of up repeating structural units called leucine rich repeats, facilitating understanding of interaction cooperativity because there are no contacts in the three dimensional structure that are separated by many amino acids in the primary sequences. We described the underlying energetic and conformational properties of the natural, wild type, sequence of the repeat protein pp32. We showed that the protein unzips gradually from the N-terminus to the C-terminus. We also demonstrated that the consequences of destabilization by introducing packing defects by mutation depended upon where in the protein they were introduced, while the global destabilization was similar no matter where the mutation was introduced. In one case a mutation of Leucine at position 139 to the smaller residue alanine equalized the stability across the entire protein, in another case subsitution of isoleucine (large) by alanine in the N-terminus greatly exacerbated differences. Interestingly, creating a large packing defect in the center of the repeat protein&nbsp; led to the population of an intermediate structure in which the right side of the protein remained in a state very near native, but the left side of the protein was completely disordered. The nature of their disrupted states was also shown to strongly depend on the organization of the proteins. We obtained this information by comparing the NMR spectra of the buried residues (that have methyl group that are hydrophobic - afraid of water).</p>\n<p>We showed as well that while pressure tends to populate intermediates more than other denaturing approaches, there is no specific effect of pressure on protein unfolded states. If the protein completely unfolds, i.e., it does not populate states like above in which one part of the protein is folded and other parts are not, then the compactness of the unfolded state is the same as for denaturation by heat or other methods. This again underscores that pressure is a good way to populate, observe and characterize folding intermediates because of its local effects, but once the protein is unfolded it is the same as by any other method, confirming the usefulness of high pressure perturbation, i.e., the end point is the same, structurally, as for other methods.</p>\n<p>The usefulness of high pressure in these studies was also illustrated by our work studying the kinetics of unfolding of a small model protein. We were the first to report the implementation of an NMR method called ZZ-exchange spectroscopy to determine the rates of folding and unfolding of the protein as a function &nbsp;of high pressure. This application of an advanced NMR dynamics approach should prove to be a very useful tool in the understanding of the structural transitions of proteins that are linked to their function.</p>\n<p>Another useful application of high pressure demonstrated by the work on this project was to implement &nbsp;other types of NMR dynamics experiments at high pressure. While ZZ-exchange can be used to measure dynamic exchange between conformations on a timescale of seconds, CEST experiments access timescales in the millisecond range, while CPMG can yield information on exchange on the microsecond timescale. Thus, our work has shown that application of high pressure can lead to the population of protein partially or fully unfolded states and the implementation of NMR dynamics experiments can provide information on how fast the reactions are over timescales from microseconds to seconds.</p>\n<p>We also worked with colleagues at the Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) beamline at the synchrotron in at Cornell University in Ithaca New York to develop and apply high pressure SAXS in order to characterize the compactness of the protein ensemble populated at high pressure. This information is key in building an experimental model for the excited states of proteins. This project was one of the pioneering projects at the beamline and has served to develop this tool for other users in the US and abroad. This is the only high pressure SAXS set-up available for protein studies in the United States.</p>\n<p>Overall the work made possible by this award has clearly demonstrated the incredibly subtle role of sequence in dictating protein structural dynamics and stability. It has also demonstrated that high pressure is an exceedingly practical and efficient way to get a large enough fraction of the protein molecules in a solution into these \"excited states\" so they can be characterized in great detail. Finally pursuing this goal of detailed structural characterization of protein \"excited states\" has led to the implementation of high pressure perturbation in state-of-the-art experimental approaches, opening paths for many important future discoveries in protein science.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/05/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Catherine&nbsp;A&nbsp;Royer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1514575/1514575_10402545_1633467224148_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1514575/1514575_10402545_1633467224148_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Conformational landscape of the pp32 repeat protein\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1514575/1514575_10402545_1633467224148_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Conformational landscape of the pp32 repeat protein\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image depicts both the relative stabilities and the average structures of the excited state conformations of the pp32 protein</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Martin Fossat</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Catherine&nbsp;A&nbsp;Royer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Conformational landscape of the pp32 repeat protein</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1514575/1514575_10402545_1633467465173_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1514575/1514575_10402545_1633467465173_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Consequences of cavity mutations on pp32 energetic landscape\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1514575/1514575_10402545_1633467465173_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Consequences of cavity mutations on pp32 energetic landscape\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The mutation of large amino acid residues to a small one has different consequences on the folding cooperativity of pp32 and the population of excited states.
