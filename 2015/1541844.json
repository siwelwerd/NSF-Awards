 "awd_abstract_narration": "The interdependence among regional-scale food, energy, and water (FEW) systems has gained increasing attention, especially in light of recent natural disasters that have revealed hidden vulnerabilities in the infrastructures and resources supporting basic community needs. Much scientific effort has been focused on understanding and improving the resilience of FEW systems in particularly vulnerable regions, such as arid regions or areas of extreme poverty.  Significantly less work has been done to understand the resilience of FEW systems in areas of water abundance, such as the U.S. Midwest, a highly productive agricultural region. As extreme weather events, coastal flooding, and droughts occur more frequently, less vulnerable regions like the U.S. Midwest will likely experience increases in population driven in part by the in-migration of environmentally displaced people.  Such migration will increase stresses on regional FEW systems by altering the socio-economic distribution of residents and the industrial mix of the region, increasing competition among various land uses, and exacerbating impacts on water quality and other ecosystem services. Given the importance of FEW systems in water-abundant regions, understanding the interactions between direct (local climate variability) and indirect (in-migration) effects of climate change on such regions is critical.\r\n\r\nOhio State University will host a two-day conference to investigate the implications of the direct and indirect effects of climate and environmental change on the resilience of regional FEW systems in non-coastal, water-abundant regions such as the U.S. Midwest. The conference will focus on identifying the basic science and theory that are needed to further understanding of regional FEW systems with an emphasis on the dynamic coupling among biophysical, economic, and social systems. The objective of the conference is to identify priorities for interdisciplinary research that will help to enhance the resilience and adaptive capacity of regions where existing FEW system infrastructures and resources may experience significant pressures due to such migrations coupled with the direct effects of increasing temperature and climate variability. Sessions are planned to examine (a) migration as an adaptive response to climate change; (b) natural and built capital for ecosystem services and resilience; (c) technology and innovation for resource resilience; (d) social and cultural aspects of community resilience; and (e) models and data for regional sustainability and resilience assessment. The conference will engage approximately 50 prominent researchers and representatives of local, state, and federal government agencies, in a series of facilitated, interactive sessions to discuss the current state of knowledge and the needs of decision-makers who are grappling with the challenges of capacity-building under increasing constraints. The results of the conference will be synthesized into a roadmap for the research needed to develop resilient and sustainable FEW systems in regions that may become critically important to a growing and shifting human population.",

The conference was led by Elena Irwin (PI) and Co-PIs Joseph Fiksel, Casey Hoy, and Jay Martin and involved over 50 prominent researchers from universities and government agencies. The workshop focused on the basic science and theory needed to further our understanding of regional FEWS, with an emphasis on the dynamic coupling among biophysical, economic, and social systems. The goals of the workshop were to (i) consider the science that informs questions of climate change impacts, human adaptations, and implications for FEWS at regional scales, and on this basis, (ii) identify the current knowledge gaps, and (iii) develop a research agenda to be synthesized in this white paper that would lay the foundation for a proposal on Innovations at the Nexus of Food Energy and Water Systems (INFEWS).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The main insight that emerged from workshop discussions is that human adaptations to climate change both respond to and influence spatial and temporal mismatches in the demand and supply of food, energy and water resources across a range of scales, but particularly at regional scales. Thus, <strong>incorporating adaptive behavior at the individual and community levels into coupled human-natural system models is a critical research gap for understanding the resilience of regional FEWS and designing innovative FEWS solutions.</strong> The conference participants identified research questions and gaps in three key areas of human adaptations?human migration, land use, and community adaptation?as well as the scientific and data challenges for integrated modeling and innovation in these areas. These are summarized in the white paper that the conference organizers submitted to NSF. The conference also led to a successful INFEWS proposal that was funded in September 2017: INFEWS/T1: Impacts of Deglobalization on the Sustainability and Resilience of Regional FEWS. NSF Project #1739909. The results of the 2015 FEWS workshop laid the foundation for this work by (1) providing the creative brainstorming that led to the main research questions centered around the role of deglobalization in the regional Great Lakes FEWS and (2) providing an initial set of contacts with regional stakeholders that formed the basis of our current regional advisory council for the Great Lakes regional FEWS. The conference also led to a synthesis paper that focuses on integrating social and behavioral sciences into FEWS systems and modeling (Irwin, E. et al. Human Adaptations in Food, Energy and Water Systems J Environ Stud Sci (2016) 6: 127). We developed a conceptual framework that illustrates how omitting these perspectives can lead to misleading results regarding technology innovation and adoption in FEW systems (see Figure). We further explore this in a forthcoming book chapter for a FEWS textbook (<em>Introduction to the</em> <em>Food-Energy-Water Nexus</em>, Saundry &amp; Ruddell, eds).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Intellectual merit</strong>. The Ohio State workshop has contributed to a growing body of knowledge about the types of human adaptations that are critical to understanding how coupled human-natural systems are likely to respond to climate change and the implications for regional FEWS?and in particular, those in less vulnerable regions that may experience greater in-migration and land competition. Due to the interdependence among food, water, energy, land, and ecosystem services, an interdisciplinary approach is essential for understanding the dynamic coupling among biophysical systems, economic systems, and social and behavioral systems. Key research areas to be explored include inter- and intraregional household and firm migration decisions in the face of climate change; the role of built and natural capital in preserving and harnessing ecosystem services; the roles for technology and innovation as well as social and cultural aspects in influencing community responsiveness and resilience; and modeling challenges for regional FEWS sustainability and resilience assessment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Broader impacts</strong>. The research priorities identified in this white paper will address the needs of society in the face of unprecedented changes in regional climatic conditions, as well as rapid technological and social change. In particular, the development of improved scientific knowledge will help all levels of government to anticipate, prepare for, and respond to the direct and indirect consequences of climate change, including both gradually increasing stresses, sudden shocks and new system structure and function. The suggested research initiatives will support decision makers in gathering high-value information, exploring potential future scenarios, developing capital investment plans, ensuring adaptive capacity, planning for disruptions, and practicing adaptive management of regional FEWS. In addition, these research priorities provide guidance for educational priorities in the development of a 21<sup>st</sup>-century workforce with the requisite disciplinary knowledge and the capacity to work effectively in interdisciplinary teams on the design and management of FEWS. Finally, credible research results will facilitate knowledge transfer and dialogue about effective governance of FEWS among public and private sector stakeholder groups.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Elena&nbsp;G&nbsp;Irwin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541844/1541844_10374474_1553985743894_DSC_0303--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541844/1541844_10374474_1553985743894_DSC_0303--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"workshop talk\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541844/1541844_10374474_1553985743894_DSC_0303--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"workshop talk\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Attendees at the 2015 FEWS Ohio State workshop</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">E Irwin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Elena&nbsp;G&nbsp;Irwin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">workshop talk</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
