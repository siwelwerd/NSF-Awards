 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory near Geneva Switzerland. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the mass of the Higgs boson has the value it has. To answer these questions it is necessary to go beyond the present picture of the Universe described by the Standard Model to the next phase of development, Beyond the Standard Model (BSM). Investigations in BSM physics probe such questions as why matter dominates over anti-matter in the Universe, the values of the masses of the fundamental constituents of matter, the quarks and the leptons, the size of the mixings among the quarks, and separately among the leptons, and the properties of dark matter.  This project will focus on the study of the properties of special types of particles, mesons, whose nature can reveal information about fundamental physics beyond the Standard Model.\r\n\r\nThe work in this award will use data collected at the Belle experiment at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) laboratory in Japan. Belle is built around the interaction region of an asymmetric electron-positron collider. The main goal of Belle is to detect particles made of a quark-anti-quark pair, so called mesons. In particular those mesons made of charm quarks (charmonium) and bottom quarks (bottomonium). These mesons are described in the SM by the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). By studying these mesons, one can probe for BSM fundamental physics processes such as Charge Parity (CP) violation, rare meson decays and possible exotic particles which could indicate the presence of Dark Matter.\r\n\r\nThe Belle Experiment at KEK in Japan  has the world's largest data samples recorded at the bottomonium resonances  in the mass range of  10 GeV, the so-called Upsilon resonances. At these resonant energies the electron positron beam particles have a much higher probability of producing  B mesons, allowing experimenters to acquire large statistics and observe rare phenomena . The central aim of this RUI program of research by the Luther College group is to study the spectroscopy of bottomonium and related states, with a focus on resonant states that probe the limits of our understanding of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) and improving the theoretical understanding  in lattice QCD (the techniques used to make computer predictions of QCD calculations).  The Luther College program provides an unusual opportunity for undergraduate students to become meaningfully involved in a world-leading experiment, taking part in every aspect of Belle data analysis, and in the development of software tools for the upgraded experiment, Belle II.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe PI of this grant, Dr. Todd Pedlar of Luther College, is a collaborator on the Belle and Belle II experiments.  In this project over the past three years he has worked together with several undergraduate students under his charge at Luther on physics analyses of Belle I data and made various contributions to the software the upcoming Belle II experiment.  \n\nThe PI's analysis work has focused on bottomonium spectroscopy - studies of the bound states of bottom quark with its antiquark.  During the  present grant period, the focus has necessarily turned more to the work of preparing Belle II, analysis production has slowed - but there are several analyses underway in the bottomonium system - including the refinement of other radiative decay measurements, of the production of charm mesons in bottomonium decays, and, related to these, the inclusive production of charm mesons in electron-positron annihilation.  \n\nThe PI has two published peer-reviewed conference proceedings as outcomes of this grant period's work, and has been analysis committee chair on several Belle I publications as well.  In addition, during the years of this grant, the PI participated in the writing of the B2TIP (Belle II Theory-Interface Platform) report which was recently sent for publication and is on the arXiv.  This years-long project involved studies made by most of the Belle II Collaboration, as well as collaborating theorists.  This important report communicates the physics expectations for Belle II, which begins physics data runs in 2019.\n\nIn this period, analysis work has taken something of a back seat to work preparing for Belle II, given the need for timely preparation of both software and hardware for the experiment.  The Luther group worked on and helped coordinate efforts within the particle identification arena, with a group known within Belle as the Physics Performance subgroup.  Part of the PI's responsibilities concern the combination of signals from various subdetectors of the Belle II system to produce common identification criteria for particle species, and involve commissioning data taken in early 2018.  \n\nThe PI and his students also continued outreach to local middle and high schools, which is an important part of the mission of this research group, The PI is convinced that the communication to local students of his work with this international collaboration - where there are clear applications of the ideas they study can and does serve as encouragement for them to continue to pursue their studies in science and hopefully gives them encouragement possibly to pursue science or engineering fields in the future. \n\nThe culmination of these efforts is expected in subsequent years - namely, summer outreach gatherings for middle and high school students, as well as weekend \"minicamps\" during the academic year.  The local schools he has visited with as part of this effort are in rural northeast Iowa, where many  come from homes without college educated parents, and where exposure to current work in science is lacking.  Several schools the PI is in contact with have communicated the desire to give more enrichment in their science teaching to their students - and through conversations the PI has had with these teachers, new ideas are arising for outreach to teachers as well. \n\nThe visits the PI has made with local students have enabled him to discuss elements of his work, and to present some of the exciting ideas of particle physics to them.  A helpful tool for the presentation of these ideas is a Virtual Reality simulation of the Belle II experiment developed by colleagues at Virginia Tech. During the grant period this simulation was used by the PI and students to discuss the physics studied by Belle II and the ways particles are detected in such an experiment.  As one might expect \"viewing\" Belle II and interactions therein using an Oculus Rift system was a wildly popular part of visits with students. \n\nThe PI expects to expand this particular work in the near future, having made connection with the local chapter of Girls Who Code, a national organization for encouraging girls to become more adept at and involved in computer science and related fields.  He also has become a board member for the Northeast Iowa STEM Festivals and is working on plans to bring his students to outreach events they hold regionally. \n\nFinally, the PI as part of his work has also begun work within Belle II's outreach committee to promote the federally supported research of Belle and Belle II internationally.  Belle II is, as of Spring 2018, a collaborating member of the International Particle Physics Outreach Group (IPPOG).  The PI's involvement with the Belle II IPPOG effort centers on the development of and delivery of International Master Classes - which are large coordinated efforts used to bring particle physics ideas and teaching to large numbers of high school students around the world.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/15/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Todd Pedlar"
