The main idea is to acquire a sparse signal from a very small number of measurements using a specialized sampling and reconstruction process.  Since one promising application of CS is medical imaging, improvements in CS systems are also expected to advance real-world healthcare applications.  In this project, the investigators will study the fundamental connection between error-correcting codes (ECC) and CS and leverage recent advances in ECC to design improved CS measurement and reconstruction systems.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the connection between linear-programming (LP) decoding of binary linear codes and LP reconstruction will be used to develop a non-asymptotic theory for the design and analysis of CS algorithms and measurement matrices.  The first part of the project will focus on novel relaxations of the CS reconstruction problem that allow non-convex regularization and iterative solution.  The second part of the project will focus on applying the theory of pseudo-codewords, which was originally developed to understand iterative and LP decoding of binary linear codes, to achieve a non-asymptotic analysis of iterative reconstruction algorithms for CS.  The third part of the project will focus on exploiting additional signal structure (i.e., beyond sparsity) that exists in high-contrast imaging applications such as angiograms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCompressed sensing (CS) is a rapidly advancing area of signal processing and statistics that has the potential to change the way that some analog signals are transformed into digital signals. The main idea is to acquire a sparse signal from a very small number of measurements using specialized sampling and reconstruction techniques. Since one promising application of CS is medical imaging, improvements in CS systems are also expected to advance real-world healthcare applications.\n\nThis project investigated the fundamental connection between error-correcting codes (ECC) and CS.  The goal was to leverage recent advances in ECC to design improved CS measurement and reconstruction systems.  This project resulted in two key outcomes.  \n\nThe first outcome is the extension of an analysis technique from coding theory, called density evolution, to characterize the performance of message-passing reconstruction (MPR) for sparse measurement matrices.  This allows a performance comparison between MPR based on quantizing the signal and MPR based on using a Gaussian approximation.  Using this technique, it was shown that MPR based on Gaussian approximation results in negligible loss with much lower computational complexity as long as the measurement matrix is not extremely sparse.  From a practical perspective, this suggests that simple reconstruction techniques, such as relaxed belief propagation, should perform well for a wide class of measurement matrices. \n\nSecond, a non-rigorous analysis technique from statistical physics called the replica method was studied for the CS problem.  A long-standing conjecture in this area is that the error incurred by optimal reconstruction equals the simple functional form predicted by the replica method.  The key outcome of this research is a rigorous proof of this conjecture, under mild conditions.  From a theoretical perspective, this research provides insight into why this formula is correct and resolves a long-standing conjecture \n\nThe intellectual merit of this research lies in practical and theoretical contributions described above.  The broader impact stems from the possible impact on practice.  Since CS is expected to change the way that many analog signals are transformed into digital signals, we believe these results could also have an important on the design of future signal processing systems.  This grant also supported, in part, the research of five different PhD students.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/10/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Henry D Pfister"
