 "awd_abstract_narration": "The team will use ground-based telescopes to study the vast population of \"satellite\" galaxies that live in the suburbs of cities of galaxies called clusters. We know that satellite galaxies can transform themselves from bluish systems rife with brilliant, young stars into reddish systems filled with dull, old stars. But models that attempt explain this remarkable transformation fail dismally. This means that the modellers need much more guidance about factors that govern a galaxy's life in the suburbs. The team will provide that important guidance. The team will also expand existing, successful outreach programs at their institutions. Areas of emphasis include high school students using the new data to conduct inquiry-based research, school teachers adding evidence-based research into their lesson plans, deaf students \"smelling\" and \"touching\" data that have been suitably transformed, and Hispanic students being encouraged to continue on from college to graduate school.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the project is to examine the physical processes responsible for quenching the star formation in clusters' satellite galaxies, as distinct from their central galaxies. Models of central-galaxy quenching agree well with observations. In contrast, models of satellite-galaxy quenching strongly violate observations, meaning that such models need better guidance about the processes involved. The team will provide that guidance by obtaining new spectroscopic data for massive groups and clusters at redshifts of 1-1.5 and comparing those data to existing lower-redshift data. These comparisons will be used to analyze the dominant modes of satellite quenching, how galaxies populate dark-matter halos as a function of environment, the relative timing of morphological transformation and star-formation quenching, and the dominant driver of size growth in quenched galaxies. These results will lead to new, better-informed models of satellite-galaxy quenching.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Gemini Observations of Galaxies in Rich Early ENvironments (GOGREEN) Survey is a large multi-year project carried out by an international team using observations from the Gemini International Observatory, which is operated in partnership  by the NSF\u2019s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory.  This program used 430 hours (55 nights) of observations on the two Gemini telescopes, one in Chile and one on the island of Hawaii.  It was the largest program accepted to Gemini Observatory\u2019s new Large &amp; Long Program (LLP) category in the initial round of proposals.  GOGREEN was designed to produce the premier dataset on galaxies in galaxy groups and clusters in the distant Universe, when it was between 4.2 and 5.7 Billion Years old.  The co-PIs of the NSF proposal are the US leads for this project.  \n\nThe goals of the project that fall under the heading of intellectual merit were to: 1) study how galaxies in clusters and groups evolve from the distant universe to today; 2) provide new constraints on how galaxies are transformed by dense regions of the universe, specifically how the formation of new stars in these galaxies is stopped and how their shapes are altered; 3) make a precision measurement of the amount of stars that inhabit dark matter halos, as both a function of the distance to the halo (e.g. cluster vs. group) and as a function of distance, which corresponds to the age of the Universe.\n\nThe goals of the project that fall under the heading of broader impact were to run an research-based outreach program at a local high school.\n\nThe project has produced a variety of impactful outcomes in the areas of Intellectual Merit and Broader Impact.\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n\n\nWe have assembled an unparalleled spectroscopic and imaging survey, in which we are able to identify distant galaxies in a large range of environments and are equally effective and observing galaxies down to an unprecedentedly low stellar mass and for a large range in intrinsic galaxy properties.  This dataset will be made public in August 2020 and will have lasting legacy value for the astronomical community.\nWith these data we are able to identify galaxies in clusters, determine the detailed individual properties, e.g. stellar mass, age of stars, and determine the problems of the environments in which they live, e.g. massive clusters, low mass clusters, cluster cores, cluster outskirts.  We are therefore able to provide a comprehensive characterization of how galaxy properties depend on environment.\nWe have found that galaxies in distant clusters are forming stars less than those outside of clusters.  This provides compelling evidence that something about being in the cluster alters the evolutionary paths of galaxies.\nThe relative numbers of galaxies at different masses in clusters is different than in the field.  However, the relative numbers of galaxies at different masses when split into passive and star forming galaxies is the same in different environments.  It is just the relative total numbers of each of these subpopulations that is changing, which induces a change in the total mass distribution of the galaxy population.  This behavior is in stark contrast to what is seen in more nearby clusters and the implications are that galaxies stop their star formation in a fundamentally different way in the distant universe than they do locally.\nBy analyzing the spectroscopy of our passive galaxies we have found that more massive galaxies have older stars on average than lower mass galaxies.  We also have found that passive galaxies in clusters are slightly but significantly older than galaxies in lower density environments.  This has significant implications for the way in which galaxy star formation is shut off in galaxies.\n\n\n\nBroader Impact\n\n\n\nRudnick has extended his intensive research-based outreach program at the Lawrence High School (LHS) into its seventh year. Four years of this program were supported under this grant.
