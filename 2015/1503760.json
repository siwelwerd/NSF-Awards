 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pace University proposes to add four new cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students to their existing CyberCorps(R) Scholarship for Service (SFS) program in cybersecurity with a multiple pathway approach to recruit and guide students through different academic programs based on their background and interests. With support for either two or three years, all Pace scholars will graduate with a Bachelor's degree, a Master's degree, a five-year combined degree, or a PhD. All scholars will fulfill core curriculum requirements in both cybersecurity and mathematics, as well as interdisciplinary curriculum requirements in either criminal justice or business management. The scholars will also be expected to complete research projects and professional development activities as outlined through competency-based advisement. With a solid background in computing and flexibility to accommodate different talents, the program will help meeting the diverse demands of government employment in the field of cybersecurity. The scholars will be able to apply not only computing knowledge but also knowledge from a relevant discipline, such as mathematics, criminal justice, or business administration. The graduates will therefore be able to conduct tasks in specialty areas defined in the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education (NICE) Workforce Framework such as information assurance compliance, network security administration, or digital forensics. \r\n\r\nThe objectives of the Pace CyberCorps project are 1) to produce fourteen to seventeen cybersecurity professionals entering the government workforce upon graduation over five years; 2) to prepare cybersecurity professionals with diverse educational backgrounds by using a multiple pathway approach; 3) to support diversity in the field of information technology by providing opportunities for students from underrepresented groups; 4) to mentor non-SFS institutions and their students through academic partnerships; 5) to strengthen collaboration between Pace and its government partners, and 6) to generate interest in becoming cybersecurity professionals among broader student populations both at Pace and at our partner institutions. The broader impacts of Pace CyberCorps include outreach activities to increase the number of students studying in cybersecurity who are from groups underrepresented in information technology; broaden the impact of the program through academic partnerships; and mentor non-SFS institutions and provide scholarship opportunities for their graduates.",
