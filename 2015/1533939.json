 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes peak demand relief for utilities, reduced\r\nfreezer operating costs for retail stores, and natural refrigerants for regulators. Unfortunately, no state-ofthe-\r\nart system simultaneously addresses all these issues. Industrial/commercial batteries remain\r\nunaffordable, refrigeration costs account for 60% of a retail store?s electricity bills and equipment\r\nmanufacturers are only realizing incremental efficiency improvements with new vapor compression\r\narchitectures. This project introduces an energy storage technology, embedded in a natural refrigerant\r\ncooling cycle, that provides load-shifting services and a 40% reduction in commercial freezer electrical\r\npurchases. More importantly, it achieves this at a 3-year payback without government incentives using\r\nnatural, near ambient, materials.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will investigate an energy storage\r\ntechnique utilizing water as the storage material in a time delayed, freeze-point-suppression refrigeration\r\ncycle. The project will focus on the internal testing, third party validation and commercial demonstration\r\nof a 10kWth system. Successful integration within low temperature refrigeration architectures requires\r\nindustrial design focused on skid/waste heat integration, validation testing to inform required part count\r\nreductions/system revisions and demonstration to monitor, learn and revise the technology in preparation\r\nfor scale up.",
