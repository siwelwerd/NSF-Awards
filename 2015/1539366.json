The Symposium will be hosted by the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, from October 4 to October 6, 2015. NAPS is a nonprofit event with technical sponsorship from IEEE and is aimed primarily at providing a forum for students to present and obtain feedback on their research in power engineering. Traditionally, the overwhelming majority of papers in NAPS are presented by students. NAPS has been supported by the National Science Foundation in the past. Support from NSF has helped to enable student participation in the past. In addition to providing subsidized accommodation for students, the symposium will foster and encourage student participation through a comprehensive student program, tours of nearby facilities related to symposium topics, and a student paper competition. Topics to be addressed in the Symposium include power system operation, power system performance, power system protection, power system control, power electronics, Smart Grid, and microgrid operation and optimization. Measures will be taken to encourage participation of women and underrepresented minorities in NAPS 2015.",
