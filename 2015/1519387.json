 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a need for curricula that address STEM standards in an integrated way. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) and the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSS-M) are research-based academic standards that were created so that U.S. states would have the option to adopt high-quality standards for their students. Each one has concepts and skills that most current curricula do not address. The NGSS include engineering design processes as required concepts and skills for students to learn in conjunction with their science content. The CCSS-M includes process standards such as modeling with mathematics. The Common Core Standards for English Language Arts include standards that ask students to learn technical communication, particularly with a connection to STEM subjects. Each of these separate standards requires realistic contexts for which to situate the learning. Teachers and principals are currently looking for curricula that meet these needs, but integrated curricula are few and far between.  The curricula (PictureSTEM) proposed by this I-Corps team integrate all of these ideas into one unit.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the PictureSTEM project is to develop an instructional module at each grade level, kindergarten through fifth, which employs engineering and literacy contexts to integrate science, technology, and mathematics content instruction in meaningful and significant ways. These transformative new models for STEM learning use picture books and an engineering design challenge to provide students with authentic, contextual activities that engage learners in specific STEM content as well as integrate concepts across traditional disciplinary boundaries. PictureSTEM units will focus on standards-based engineering, mathematics, and science content, which is different than other curricula currently available. They are research based curricula as described above. These modules have the potential to transform the way literacy and STEM are taught at the elementary level by attending to the learning goals of all areas, therefore, providing a potential framework for the development of an entire elementary curricula in the future.",
