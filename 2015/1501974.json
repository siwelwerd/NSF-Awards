 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continued growth of the U.S. grape growing and wine production industry (GWI) is challenged by its need for a knowledgeable and skilled technical workforce.  The Viticulture and Enology Science and Technology Alliance (VESTA), a collaborative, multi-institution national consortium, is expanding its capabilities to ensure that this technical workforce has the strong STEM-based knowledge and skills to take advantage of the latest advances in scientific practices and emerging technologies.  The Alliance works closely with the GWI and subject matter experts to provide readily accessible learning experiences for students many of whom live in rural communities.  VESTA provides (a) educational and learning experiences so that students, wine business entrepreneurs and industry members are able to demonstrate knowledge and skills in scientifically based practices and technologies making the US GWI globally competitive; (b) experiences that enable students to apply scientific, mathematical, enological and viticultural knowledge to resolve real-world challenges in vineyard and winery operations; and (c) well-defined career paths based on nationally validated occupational competencies.  \r\n\r\nThe Alliance uses its distance learning format coupled with field experiences in commercial vineyards and wineries throughout the country. The latter has a dual purpose of hands-on skill development for the two-year college student and a risk-free opportunity for the commercial owner/operator to assess the potential of a future employee. Through an industry-driven curriculum process and nationally validated occupational competencies, scientific advances and emerging technologies will be identified and incorporated into VESTA courses and professional development programs.  VESTA will provide just-in-time experiences wherein students address real world challenges in vineyard and winery operations through the use of Simulation Instructional Technologies.  This virtual reality learning experiences will enhance all instruction while filling a critical need when courses are out-of-sync with the seasonal nature of this industry.  In addition, VESTA will continue to demonstrate the impact that distance learning methodology coupled with hands-on industry-mentored field experiences can have on meeting the technical workforce needs of 21st century industries.",
