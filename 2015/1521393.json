 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will go beyond wearable sensors. This project is expected to yield significant societal benefits on health and quality of life, as the proposed technology will be able to support the safe powering and communication of novel wireless systems that will enable next generation applications; including, implantable or wearable biomonitoring of senior people in assisted living, pacemakers, drug delivery, artificial organs, bionics for people with disabilities and injured military personnel, and novel treatments for cancer and brain disorders. This project is also expected to revolutionize other commercial applications, such as, wireless sensors for structural health monitoring and environmental monitoring. In addition, this project is expected to broaden broadening the participation of underrepresented groups through Senior Design projects on wireless powering and outreach efforts.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Technology Transfer Research (STTR) Phase I project will generate the required technological knowledge for deriving the first miniaturized wireless power transfer systems, which can simultaneously and safely transmit power to and communicate with wearable devices and sensors, with unprecedented power transfer efficiency, bandwidth and alignment-insensitive characteristics. Therefore, this project is expected to have a significant impact on the development of new and/or conformal wearable battery-less devices that support novel biomonitoring, diagnostic techniques and therapies and enhancing our capabilities for disease prevention and treatment. This project is also expected to lead to the first generation of truly autonomous wireless implantable devices for various applications such as smart medicine activation, artificial organ enhanced performance and status monitoring.",
