 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Promoting Research and Innovation in Methodologies for Evaluation (PRIME) program seeks to support research on evaluation with special emphasis on: (1) exploring innovative approaches for determining the impacts and usefulness of STEM education projects and programs; (2) building on and expanding the theoretical foundations for evaluating STEM education and workforce development initiatives, including translating and adapting approaches from other fields; and (3) growing the capacity and infrastructure of the evaluation field. Three types of proposals will be supported by the program: Exploratory Projects that include proof-of-concept and feasibility studies; more extensive Full-Scale Projects; and workshops and conferences. The proposed research attends carefully to item 1 above.  \r\n     \r\nThis research will establish a coherent framework for the design, implementation, and analysis of within-study comparisons for evaluating non-experimental methods. It will also establish an infrastructure for conducting an ongoing quantitative synthesis of results from within-study comparison designs.\r\n\r\nThis research study will develop the methodological foundations for using within-study comparison designs (WSCs) to evaluate non-experimental methods in STEM evaluation settings. In WSC designs, treatment effects from a non-experiment are compared to those produced by a randomized experiment that shares the same target population. The purpose of a WSC is to determine whether the non-experiment can replicate results from an experimental benchmark, and the contexts and conditions under which these methods perform well in field settings. The project has two overarching research aims.",

Over the last three decades, the within-study comparison design has emerged as a method to evaluate the performance of non-experimental methods in field settings. In the traditional WSC design, treatment effects from a randomized experiment are compared to those produced by a non-experimental approach that shares at least the same target population and intervention.

There were two over-arching aims of this project.

The quantitative synthesis focused on identifying contexts and conditions under which non-experimental methods produce causal impact estimates in STEM evaluation settings.

Second, the project has yielded a database that researchers may use for providing guidance about conditions and contexts under which non-experimental methods may perform well in field settings. Currently, project staff are working with the What Works Clearinghouse to develop standards for covariate adjustment in high quality evaluation studies based on results from the meta-analytic database. Finally, the most important outcome from the project is the extension of methods development for within-study comparison approaches to systematic replication studies more generally. Methodological development from this project has been used to demonstrate requirements for the rigorous design, implementation, and analysis of replication studies. This is a critical discovery because of the current lack of consensus in the social and health sciences about what replication efforts are, and what constitutes as high-quality replication efforts. Given recent funding efforts to support and promote systematic replication studies, methodological guidance on the best ways to design, implement, and analyzing replication studies are needed. Results produced from this project have been used to guide the replication efforts for multiple large-scale studies that are currently underway in education, including the development of a crowdsourcing platform for replication results in special education, a systematic replication effort for providing coaching supports in practice-based learning in teacher education, and a replication effort to evaluate the ReadWell intervention for struggling readers.
