 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rob Coalson of the University of Pittsburgh is supported by the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Chemistry Division for computational and theoretical studies of biological ion channels and nanopores. The Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences contributes to the award.  The cell uses membranes composed of lipid bilayers to compartmentalize its contents. Specialized proteins insert into the membrane and allow transport through it as required for physiological function. For the cell membrane, the relevant membrane- bound proteins are called ion channels. They selectively pass ions through the membrane and are essential for nerve signal propagation, muscle contraction, auto-regulation of cell volume and production of biochemicals like insulin. The large Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) plays a similar role in regulating the flow of molecular material into and out of the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. Residing in the nuclear membrane, NPCs controlthe flow of large biomolecules including proteins and RNAs between the cell nucleus and its cytoplasm. The work to be undertaken here entails large-scale computer simulations of the flow of material through these biological nanopores, using an appropriate level of atomic resolution,  focusing on the molecular mechanisms that control these transport phenomena. It has importance for fundamental molecular biology, and ultimately may have relevance to medicine, as serious diseases are associated with improper function of ion channels and NPCs.\r\n\r\n  When a protein channel spanning a bilayer membrane is in its open state (i.e., is characterized by an appropriate aqueous pore), ions are driven through itby an electrochemical gradient which arises either from a concentration or an electrical potential difference across the membrane. Channel gating is a more complex process. Most gates operate on a time scale of milliseconds to seconds, too long to be simulated via brute force all atom Molecular Dynamics simulation. Understanding these processes requires the development of novel scale-spanning computational techniques. Another intriguing class of biological nanopores is comprised of large protein complexes which span the nuclear envelope in eukaryotic cells.  The size and complexity of these Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs) present major challenges to molecular modeling analysis. The work to be performed on ion channel modeling will employ a novel divide and conquer multi-scale modeling approach. Molecular level detail extracted from relatively short all-atom Molecular Dynamics simulations will be fed into coarse-grained kinetic models. In addition to calculating ion permeation through realistic 3D models of channel proteins, problems involving mechanisms of ion channel gating and the coupling between permeation and gating will be tackled. The work on NPCs entails development of physico-chemically grounded coarse-grained simulation models combined with statistical mechanical analysis. These tools will enable study of larger systems and longer time scales than can be accessed by atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulations, namely, mesoscopic scales where collective behavior of many large molecules impacts the pore's ability to select molecular cargos to pass through it.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThe Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC) perforates the nuclear membrane and allows the flow of large biomolecules between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm in eukaryotic cells.  It is the largest protein complex in the cell.  Its detailed structure has not yet been fully elucidated, but it is known that the pore region is lined with natively unfolded nucleoporin proteins. These proteins extend into the center of the pore in a polymer brush configuration. They form a tight barrier to the passage of large biomolecules.  The amino acid sequence of the natively unfolded nucleoporins includes hydrophobic repeat segments.  These hydrophobic segments bind transiently to hydrophobic grooves on the outside of special globular receptor proteins (Nuclear Transport Factors [NTFs]), which also bind biomolecules (?cargoes?) waiting to be transported into/out of the nucleus.  Transient binding of the nucleoporin (nup) strands to the receptor protein NTFs allows the NTFs (with cargo attached) to transport through the NPC in a selective manner.  The exact mechanism of the transport process is not known, although transport is remarkably efficient (transport rates of one large biomolecule per millisecond), and surprisingly robust to modifications of the configuration of nucleoporins within the pore.  The latter feature suggests that transport may be largely controlled by mesoscopic driving forces rather than minute chemical details.   This has led us to use coarse-grained models to investigate basic physico-chemical models of NPC function.  These include bead-spring models of the nup chains that are grafted to the inside of the NPC pore and interact with spherical NTFs.  Coarse-grained MD simulations of these systems have yielded insight into the way the receptor proteins interact with the nup filaments, inducing morphology changes in the nup brush and NTF diffusion through the brush barrier from one side of the NPC to the other.  In addition, statistical mechanical models (e.g., Self-Consistent Field Theories) have been utilized to assess trends in relevant equilibrium aspects of NPC function.\n\n \n\nSmart Nanoparticle/Polymer Brush Composites.  The biological NPC inspires design of synthetic polymer brush systems in which the brush morphology is modified upon binding of nanoparticles that attract to brush monomers.  In the context of an inside-grafted cylindrical brush (directly analogous to the NPC), binding of attractive nanoparticles to the polymer strands causes partial retraction of the polymer brush toward the binding surface.  This opens up space in the center of the pore.  Analyte molecules small enough to fit through the opening can diffuse through it.  The flow of larger analyte molecules is blocked.  The degree of retraction of the brush can be precisely controlled by the concentration of nanoparticles in solution.   In this way, a size-selective molecular sieve with an easily controllable aperture size can be designed. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/24/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rob D Coalson"
