 "awd_abstract_narration": "Food insecurity remains one of the most serious challenges facing humankind.  This research project will investigate dietary diversity as an indicator of household food security, and it will generate evidence of the food security consequences of agricultural value chain development.  The project's comparative approach will explore variation across national contexts, agrarian settings, and sociocultural conditions.  It will provide new insights regarding the restructuring of the global agricultural system that has occurred over the last 20 years.  Furthermore, it will reconceptualize agricultural value chains as co-produced assemblages of diverse actors, processes, and practices in which farmers are active participants rather than passive recipients of top-down policy processes.  The investigators will work with U.S. philanthropic foundations and government agencies.  They also will interact with international organizations and policy makers to contribute to capacity-building, education, and training in new methodologies to study the impacts of value chain participation on families and communities.\r\n\r\nThrough a comparative study of three value chain initiatives, this project will focus on two core questions:  (1) How has gender been incorporated by a wide range of development actors into efforts to promote a new green revolution for Africa? (2) What has been the impact of green revolution projects on household food security?  The investigators will conduct surveys, semi-structured interviews, and focus groups with key actors in a variety of value chain organizations to determine how they articulate and advance their interests in interactions with each other.  With these data, the investigators will perform a comparative analysis of policy directives, gender compositions, and organizational project and investment plans.  Through an assessment of how the state, development agencies, and markets interact with rural actors to co-produce local livelihoods, the findings will shed new light on the efficacy of such programs on poverty reduction, hunger mitigation, and human security, all of which will benefit the United States as it interacts with governments and other organizations in Africa and elsewhere.",
