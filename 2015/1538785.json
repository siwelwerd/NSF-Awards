 "awd_abstract_narration": "ACM Mobihoc has been a premier venue for publishing results on the theory and design of wireless networks and mobile computing, and along with IEEE Infocom, it serves as the top two venues that attract leading researchers in this area. The 2015 edition of this conference features a technical program with a sizable portion of papers from several U.S.-based institutions. Given the high cost of travel to this venue, NSF travel grants provided by this award will be used to defray part of the expenses incurred in attending this conference for the travel grantees.\r\n\r\nConference attendance is a crucial part of the life of a researcher. By creating new opportunities for students (especially those from under-represented groups) to attend a high-quality conference, this project will benefit the research community in several ways. The students themselves benefit from the opportunity to meet and interact with many other researchers in a favorable setting, and from attending research presentations that may be related to their research areas. The research community benefits from the improvement of the students in the pipeline, and from the introduction of new researcher perspectives. Additionally, everybody benefits from increased diversity of participants attending the conference. Given that the PI has reserved a portion of the travel funds to target under-represented groups in this area, it will increase the international exposure for such grantees.",
