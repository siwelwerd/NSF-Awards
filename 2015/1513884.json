 "awd_abstract_narration": "The public's demand for data has been growing at an enormous rate and growth is showing no signs of diminishing.  In particular, users are increasingly demanding data from wireless devices such as smart phones, tablets, and laptops.  To accommodate this demand, the number of wireless access points (APs) being deployed in high-demand areas has increased substantially and this has resulted in significant interference between nearby wireless communications, which reduces performance and can result in unmet user demands.  This research is studying the development of advanced coding, signal processing, and scheduling techniques based on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication to significantly reduce interference between competing transmissions, thereby substantially increasing the overall user demand that can be accommodated.  The project will benefit society by opening up new types of high-demand applications, such as augmented and virtual realities, to wireless users and will maintain performance for these and other applications in the face of ever-increasing data demands.  The project will also enhance education through unified courses that integrate advanced signal processing developments and wireless networking instead of the traditional approach, which treats these as separate disciplines.   \r\n\r\nThis research is investigating new nonlinear processing techniques for multicell MIMO within a framework of AP coordination for single clusters of 2-6 APs, which covers home networks and small enterprises.  To address the demands of large enterprise wireless networks, the project is also researching a hierarchical approach, which employs innovative techniques to deal with the problem of edge-node interference between clusters to scale performance across multiple AP clusters.  The project will develop algorithms, techniques, and protocol extensions in the area of performance scaling for multi-AP wireless networks.  Among the contributions are: (1) a novel non-linear precoding approach for maximizing downlink performance in an AP cluster, (2) a new algorithm for selecting groups of users for concurrent communication in a cluster and an algorithm, based on a classic algorithm from VLSI circuit partitioning, for iteratively improving the user groupings, (3) a slotted protocol that segments mobile and stationary users and allocates mobile slots on demand, (4) an approach to providing consistent access point orientation across AP clusters so as to eliminate interference between clients at cluster boundaries, (5) a loose coordination protocol executed between clusters that will allow neighboring clusters to handle interference between them without the costly overhead of exchanging full channel state information across the network, and (6) new physical-layer-aware techniques for client-coordinated access to multiple providers networks.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of this project was to produce dramatic performance increases in dense wireless network settings containing multiple access points (APs) operating on the same wireless channel within close proximity.  Network density has increased significantly in recent years due to wireless bandwidth scarcity and dense networks have been limited by congestion and interference that prevent network performance from scaling linearly with the number of APs.\n\nThis project made numerous advances in the area of coordinated, multiple access point, multi-user MIMO, which achieve the goal of substantial performance increases in dense networks.  A few of the most significant advances produced in the project are:\n\n1) Intelligent coordinated scheduling algorithms with full cooperation across multiple access points were developed and practically demonstrated.  Performance results showed that aggregate network throughput doubled, as compared to prior approaches that cooperated only to perform interference cancellation.  Throughput with our cooperative scheduling algorithms was also shown to increase linearly with up to 10 APs.\n\n2) A hybrid interference alignment (IA) and non-linear precoding scheme was developed and evaluated.  The proposed hybrid scheme applies IA only on a subset of communication paths, which makes the IA procedure significantly more compuationally efficient than traditional IA.  Non-linear precoding is then applied to deal with the remaining interference.  The combination of these two techniques was demonstrated to provide substantially higher performance with significantly lower computational cost, as compared to traditional IA.\n\n3) The slicing k-best detection method for MIMO systems was developed, evaluated, and patented.  This approach is an improvement over the well-known k-best MIMO detector, which reduces the complexity from kM^2 to k^2, where M is the number of symbols in the alphabet of the wireless system.  This approach provides particularly large cost savings for MIMO systems with a large number of antennas, sometimes referred to as massive MIMO systems, thereby providing a practical method to scale the superior performance of k-best detection to these massive MIMO systems. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/06/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Douglas M Blough"
