 "awd_abstract_narration": "Air transportation is an area where minimization of its environmental impact, including engine efficiency and reduction of jet engine noise emissions, would enable growth. This proposal is aimed at investigating, and eventually controlling, jet noise in a nozzle using a suite of computational and experimental techniques. The area of research is in transportation, an area of National interest.\r\n\r\nThis is a proposal to research the relevant fundamental physics of jet flow and then develop appropriate active control methods for jet noise reduction. The co-PIs propose to employ dual/correlated actuators for flow control. The first set will be located upstream of the nozzle exit where the actuator operating parameters will be  guided by optimal perturbation theory predictions and will introduce disturbances in the boundary layer tailored to be preferentially amplified, generating organized structures. It is anticipated that the optimally excited coherent structures will be highly energetic at the expense of other instability modes; they will thus constitute a well-defined target for the second actuator set (not normally the case for broadband turbulence in jet shear layers). The second actuator set, near the highly receptive nozzle exit, will further manipulate the organized structures, in a manner correlated to the first actuator's action, to achieve the control objective. This work utilizes actuator designs developed by the co-PIs that produce the disturbances dictated by optimal perturbation theory in an effective manner. This study will also produce fundamental knowledge about compressible flows that is broadly applicable and develop analysis tools and control methods.  Successful completion of the proposed research can have an impact on related problems in aerospace, energy, automotive and other applications where flow/noise control is important. The co-PIs propose to leverage their activities with K-12 outreach activities of the Florida Center for Advanced Aero-Propulsion (FCAAP), an FSU led multi-university, statewide Center of Excellence. The PIs are members of the College of Engineering jointly run by the Florida A&M University (an HBCU) and FSU, where the College has consistently been ranked as a top educator of African American engineers. Students engaged in this research and its outcomes will be from a culturally diverse student population. In addition, incorporation of research into teaching graduate courses is proposed.",
