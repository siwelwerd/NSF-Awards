 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is that it prepares hospitals for consumer-driven healthcare.  In 2015 44% of US consumers will be enrolled in high deductible insurance plans8.  Increasingly consumers will be deciding where to go for care.  This software provides hospitals with fast, easy access to actionable insight on how to improve patient experiences.  The result is loyal patients and families that repeatedly return to the hospital for care.  This means a strong customer base and financial security for the hospital.  The software is also expected to have a positive impact on healthcare costs.  It provides hospitals with a ?patient feedback loop? that makes it easier for hospitals to seek patient input on new ways to deliver care e.g. early morning video classes for working, chronically ill patients.  This easy access to patient feedback also helps hospitals anticipate patient problems and prevent costly trips to the emergency department or hospital. \r\n\r\nThis proposed project addresses an emerging healthcare problem?how to improve financial results while improving the patient experience.  Hospitals today rely on generic surveys mandated by the federal government to monitor patient satisfaction.  Few providers have access to feedback that allows them to identify and fix problems that matter to their patients.  This project solves the problem by developing software that is able to quickly and efficiently analyze patient stories about recent hospital experiences.  This tool not only identifies problems that need fixing from the patient?s perspective, it also highlights opportunities, e.g. how to streamline hospital discharges.  There currently is no software available for analyzing patient conversations and stories.  This research will develop a dictionary of words and phrases that patients commonly use when describing their hospital experiences.   It will evaluate alternative methods for extracting insight from patient stories to determine which approach delivers the most accurate results.  This type of software is also able to ?learn?, i.e. new words or phrases can be added to the system so the software actually becomes smarter over time.   Finally, the software will summarize and report patient feedback so hospitals know what issues are most important?from the patient?s perspective.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch Overview\n\nThis project developed a prototype for mining patient feedback.  The goal of this project is analyzing patient feedback to identify opportunities for improving their satisfaction with healthcare experiences.  The results provide information on improvement opportunities from the patient\u00c6s perspective. \n\nSpecific project outcomes are as follows:\n\nDeveloped a prototype that demonstrates the feasibility of mining patient feedback.\nDeployed the prototype within a commercial application to begin testing and using the software.\nEstablished a methodology for continuously improving the application\u00c6s performance.\n\n\nThe broader impact of the technology includes:\n\nBetter financial results.  This software allows hospitals to improve patient satisfaction ratings and optimize Medicare reimbursements via the Value Based Purchasing Program.  \nAdditional settings.  By developing new versions for different healthcare settings, the software can be used to improve patient satisfaction in large physician practices, hospice care, etc.\nNew healthcare delivery models.  One of the most significant applications of the software is developing new care models that please patients and reduce the overall cost of providing care as flat fee payment models become more wide spread.  Patient feedback on the use of technology, incentives, new care delivery models (e.g. nurse practitioner in group setting), etc. will assist in the development of consumer driven business models.  The goal: motivate patients to choose primary, preventive care versus acute episodes in emergency departments.  \nAdherence to treatment protocols.  A recent study (Tsao, 2014) using data from the Value Based Purchasing program indicates that surgical results improve at \u00e6high patient satisfaction hospitals\u00c6, i.e. lower readmissions, shorter length of stay, etc.  Feedback from chronic care patients on problems encountered in adhering to treatment protocols can be used to design new solutions and motivate patients.  \n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2015\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marykay O'connor"
