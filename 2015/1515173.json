 "awd_abstract_narration": "Humans think about numbers along a mental number line. The spatial representation of numbers has been linked to improved math abilities. It is unclear how much these spatial representations are caused by cultural training, such as learning to read from left to right. Because nonhuman animals have not learned to read from left to right, they can be used as a good model to investigate spatial representations in the absence of culture. Number and order have similar properties, so early nonhuman animal research has focused on order representations. Chimpanzees at the Primate Research Institute (PRI) of Kyoto University are some of the first nonhuman primates to have shown similar spatial representations of order as humans. In collaboration with Dr. Tetsuro Matsuzawa, the researcher will use touchscreen computers to test how memory for order and memory for spatial locations interact in the chimpanzees at the PRI. The researcher will also give similar tasks to rhesus monkeys, to test the extent to which humans, chimpanzees, and more distant primate relatives similarly think about number. Because nonhuman primates do not have cultural influences in the form of reading and math instruction, they are an ideal model in which to test how culture influences these abilities and their evolutionary history. \r\n\r\nAt the PRI, chimpanzees will work on touchscreen computers to complete order and memory tests. Most evidence for a similar spatial representation of order or number in humans and nonhuman animals is indirect and analogical, and there are almost no data from animals that is directly comparable to human data. Recent research suggests that the spatial organization of order occurs in working memory. If chimpanzees represent order spatially in working memory, then performing an order task during the delay of a spatial working memory test will interfere more with performance on the spatial memory task than with performance on a non-spatial control task. If interference effects are obtained, it will indicate that chimpanzees represent order spatially and do so using a working memory mechanism. Comparing performance of nonhuman primates and humans can help elucidate the underlying mechanism supporting memory for order.
