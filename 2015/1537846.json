 "awd_abstract_narration": "Precision parts made from a wide variety of brittle materials have broad applications in healthcare, biomedical, energy, photonics, and automotive industries. A big challenge with high speed machining of brittle materials is to achieve high surface quality. A major problem encountered in machining these materials is random crack propagation into the workpiece, resulting in surface/subsurface cracks and thus strength degradation of the machined parts. Existing techniques rely on polishing, a very slow and costly process, to achieve high surface quality. This award supports fundamental research to provide needed knowledge for the development of a novel machining process to overcome this main limitation. The new process will enable high efficiency machining of brittle materials without compromising part quality. The results from this research will generate economic and societal benefits for the U.S. This research involves several disciplines including manufacturing, laser and optics, fracture mechanics, and biomaterials. The multi-disciplinary nature will help enlist underrepresented groups to conduct research and thus positively impact engineering education.\r\n \r\nThe objectives of this research are twofold. First, the relationship between femtosecond laser parameters (e.g., pulse energy, spot size, number of pulses) and microcrack geometry (e.g., crack length, crack orientation, crack gap) will be established. This objective will be achieved by performing laser micromachining experiments to generate seed cracks inside the workpiece material. Knowledge gained from this research will be used to inject seed cracks into the cutting zone of a workpiece. Second, the relationship between process parameters (e.g., machining conditions, tool geometry, crack geometry) and part quality (e.g., surface/subsurface damage, surface roughness) will be determined. This objective will be accomplished by conducting machining experiments, assisted by numerical modeling, and assessing part quality using surface profilometery, optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and three-dimensional optical profilometry. This basic research will advance the knowledge base in machining brittle materials and enable new process developments based on controlled crack propagation.",

The major outcomes and findings are summarized below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With tight focusing of femtosecond pulses inside the material, damage in the form of modification at low pulse energy and cracks at high pulse energy can be made more than 1 mm deep from the surface (Fig. 1). However, accurate control of the depth location for the damage is complicated by the relatively long interaction tail extending downward from the focal position. One solution to this problem is to adjust the focal spot position based on the desired depth to prevent the damage from extending beyond the focal point. Nanosecond laser modification inside silicon is realized using laser pulses of 1.55 &micro;m wavelength that is transparent to silicon. The length and width of the modification increase with increasing pulse energy and repetition rate but decrease with increasing scanning speed. The aspect ratio of the modification is affected by the input beam shape.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A comparative study is conducted between machining of laser treated and untreated glass samples. Defects in the form of microgrooves on the surface are induced on the glass samples by a femtosecond laser. It is found that cutting force is significantly reduced when machining laser treated samples when compared to untreated samples. Therefore, laser-induced damage assists the material removal process by weakening the material. No subsurface damage is developed after machining laser treated samples, while subsurface cracks as deep as 2 mm are found for untreated samples (Fig. 2).

The cutting force, random cracks and surface roughness can be reduced by up to 90%, 74%, and 47%, respectively, compared to machining of untreated samples. Crack orientation relative to the cutting direction has a significant effect on cutting force, surface roughness, and subsurface crack formation. The discrete element model enables design and optimization of the new machining process for efficiently producing high quality components made of brittle materials.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>This project has contributed to a fundamental understanding of femtosecond laser-matter interaction inside transparent brittle materials and semiconductors. This project has improved our understanding of (1) laser-matter interaction inside brittle materials such as glass and silicon and (2) material removal mechanisms with seed defects during mechanical machining. In particular, new insights are gained in the following aspects: (i) For glass, a threshold value exists for femtosecond laser intensity to induce damage confined within the focal volume and a high threshold value exists for crack initiation and propagation outside the focal volume in both the transverse and beam propagation direction. (ii) For silicon, internal modification using femtosecond pulses is nearly impossible because of laser intensity clamping. Nanosecond pulses can induce internal modification easily because of more efficient energy deposition. (iii) Seed defects in the form of periodic cracks installed in the workpiece serve as effective material guides for new crack initiation and propagation under the load of a cutting tool in machining.
