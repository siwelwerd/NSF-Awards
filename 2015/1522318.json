 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ubiquitous use of computers and mobile devices has substantially increased the energy consumption of Information Technology (IT) systems. The energy footprint of data centers keeps increasing and the battery life of mobile devices is now a top concern. To address this critical challenge, green computing has become increasingly important and made significant strides over the past decade. This project proposes a cloud based GreenSoft framework that supports green software design and education. The GreenSoft framework can drastically simplify the process of obtaining software power information by seamlessly combining the concepts of Cloud Programming and Power Profiling as a Service.\r\n\r\nThe outcomes derived from this proposal will advance the state of the art and promote green software design practices, potentially resulting in millions of tons of CO2 emission reduction and a huge amount of energy savings. In addition, the proposed GreenSoft framework will provide ample opportunities for other researchers and software developers to further explore techniques that can reduce software energy consumption. This project will also promote teaching, learning, and training in sustainable computing by exposing graduate, undergraduate and K-12 students to energy-efficient software design. The rich body of minority students at Texas State University, a large Hispanic Serving Institution, will broaden the participation of underrepresented students in green software design.",
