The fields of astronomy and astrophysics continue to create new connections to physics, chemistry, biology, and computer science. Realizing these scientific opportunities is contingent upon maintaining and strengthening the foundations of the research enterprise. With the decadal survey  New Worlds, New Horizons in Astronomy and Astrophysics as a basis, the Mid-Decadal Committee, formed with this award under the auspices of the Board on Physics and Astronomy and the Space Studies Board at the National Academy of Sciences, will identify issues of concern to the astronomy and astrophysics community and provide guidance to federal agencies regarding their astronomy and astrophysics research programs in order to encourage the field?s scientific progress.\r\n\r\nThe activities of the Mid-Decadal Committee serve to disseminate information from the supporting agencies into the broader scientific community and the public, as well as provide the agency officials with community-based input. The committee will gather input from the astronomy, astrophysics, and physics communities. Additionally, members of the committee will engage with agency officials, congressional staff, and other members of the astronomy and astrophysics community on topics relevant to the study.",
