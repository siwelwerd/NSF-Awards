 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project proposes to develop cyanobacteria (blue-green microalgae) and photobioreactor (algal culture) systems that efficiently use sunlight, nutrients from wastewater, and waste carbon dioxide (CO2) to produce a sustainable, carbon-neutral source of isoprene.  Isoprene is a high-value component of thousands of terpene products including synthetic rubber, pharmaceuticals, flavors, fragrances, oils, and biofuels, and has an annual market of $2 billion. Ingredients for flavors and fragrances, of which isoprenoids are a large part, are expected to reach $10 billion annually by 2017. Currently, almost all isoprene is produced from petroleum. Because of growing awareness of the dire impacts of climate change, the development of \"carbon neutral\" bioproducts and biofuels has become a global economic and security imperative. Renewable isoprenoids will be in demand as companies seek to mitigate their carbon footprints and improve their \"green\" credentials. Some bio-isoprene is being produced by microbial fermentation, but this still releases CO2, and no company currently produces isoprene photosynthetically. Thus, \"photo-isoprene\" produced by microalgae with energy from sunlight and carbon captured from the atmosphere or industrial flu gases will offer significant benefits for society and the environment as well as important potential for business development. \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to develop Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 cyanobacteria that use CO2, sunlight, and wastewater to efficiently produce a sustainable, \"green\" source of isoprene (C5H8), a volatile, high-value precursor for numerous terpene products. Cyanobacteria capture rather than produce CO2. Synechococcus 7002 is among the fastest growing algae on earth, tolerates extreme light intensities that are lethal to many algae, grows in saline waters at temperatures up to 45\u00b0C, and is readily amenable to bio-engineering. These features make Synechcoccus 7002 an excellent platform for growth on wastewaters in arid regions unsuitable for crops, and cost-effective carbon capture and \"photo-isoprene\" production. The plan is to use a modified 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway of Synechococcus and optimized genes for isoprene synthesis to develop strains that continuously produce isoprene for weeks at rates much higher than any published for cyanobacteria. Commercialization will require further bio-engineering and photobioreactor design to maximize production and develop efficient isoprene capture. Phase I will: 1) integrate further genetic modifications to increase isoprene production 5-fold to convert 10% of captured carbon into isoprene 2) optimize photobioreactors for CO2 capture and isoprene production, and 3) develop a prototype system that captures at least 50% of the isoprene from the culture gas effluent.",

AABT&rsquo;s Phase I-IB project focused on production of isoprene, a precursor for thousands of terpene products including synthetic rubber, pharmaceuticals, fragrances, and biofuels. Mitigation of carbon emissions to combat climate change is a global economic, ecological and security imperative. To address this, the Environmental Protection Agency has mandated a 32% reduction in US carbon emissions by 2030 with an 80% reduction target by 2050. These are huge challenges that many industries are fighting. However, if carbon capture can be made profitable, then industries, the environment, and society will all benefit. Cyanobacteria can help meet this challenge because they efficiently convert solar energy and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) into biomolecules at efficiencies much higher than in land plants. This is the opportunity that AABT seeks to exploit. At the start of Phase I, AABT had already engineered <em>Synechococcus </em>cyanobacteria<em> </em>to produce photosynthetically derived &lsquo;photo-isoprene&rsquo; at 40 to 80 times rates then reported for algae.<strong> </strong>Phase I?IB goals were to 1) further increase bio-isoprene production toward commercial entry targets and 2) develop a prototype, modular photobioreactor culture and isoprene-capture system to demonstrate the feasibility of commercial isoprene production in cyanobacteria.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit. </strong>In Phase I-IB, AABT developed numerous genetic modifications to increase carbon capture and conversion into bio-isoprene. Combinations of these were integrated into more than a dozen unique cyanobacterial strains and isoprene production was increased 2.5 to 3 fold. Under appropriate conditions, AABT&rsquo;s cyanobacteria captured more than 60% of input CO<sub>2</sub>. 10% of captured carbon could be converted to isoprene. The continuing challenge for culture scale-up is to define biological and physical conditions that optimize both carbon capture and isoprene production. AABT plans to address this in culture systems from the lab- to pilot-scale in the Phase II project. Our techno-economic modeling projects 20% to 40% of captured carbon converted to isoprene as a viable entry point for commercialization. With added revenue from carbon capture credits and animal feed nutrients derived from algal biomass, the projected commercial entry point drops to about 5% to 10% of captured carbon conversion to isoprene. Phase I?IB established 40 and 100 Liter photobioreactor systems that operate in a greenhouse under natural day-night, high light intensity and temperature cycles up to 50&deg;C that are lethal to many microalgae. Gaseous isoprene is excreted from the cyanobacterial cells and real-time isoprene monitoring showed that these cultures produced isoprene continuously for at least several weeks. Isoprene added to cultures was recovered at 50% to 90% efficiency from the gas phase to demonstrate a proof-of-concept for isoprene capture. Isoprene produced from cyanobacterial cultures was captured by trapping into organic solvents, but not yet in sufficient quantity to demonstrate recovery of pure isoprene by distillation from the solvent. Efficient and economical isoprene capture systems are under continuing development and remain an important challenge that will be actively pursued in Phase II. The photobioreactors developed in Phase I&shy;?IB set the stage for a 1200 Liter, pilot-scale reactor that AABT plans to establish in Phase II at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh Biodigester as a test-bed for subsequent industrial installations.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader/Commercial Impact. </strong>Mitigation of carbon emissions is a global economic and security imperative underscored by the 2014 UN IPCC report.

The green chemicals market is projected to reach $100B by 2020 as companies seek to alleviate their carbon footprints and improve &lsquo;green&rsquo; credentials.
