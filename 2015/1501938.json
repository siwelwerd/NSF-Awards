 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is developing an adaptive learning environment for a wide range of students to attain skills necessary to work in high value manufacturing (HVM) aimed at the energy industry. Houston Community College's (HCC) Petroleum and Manufacturing Engineering Technology programs and Texas A&M University's Department of Engineering Technology and Industrial Distribution are working to create a sustainable certificate program in HVM that provides multiple pathways for community college students while meeting the critical workforce needs of a vital industry. \r\n\r\nInnovative pedagogical methods, such as i) competency-based learning and ii) skills needs assessment and provision through online learning modules, allow students an adaptive and personalized education. By incorporating the new Engineering Academy paradigm, as opposed to traditional articulation agreements, this project provides a novel pathway for community college students to transition to a four-year degree program. It also incorporates a new method for trying to ensure that HCC students who matriculate to TAMU receive reverse transfer credit for their associate degrees at HCC. HVM modules are being developed for high school students that are aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards as part of a summer program for teachers. HCC is an open-access institution where over 70% of the students belong to under-represented minority groups and over half of students receive Pell grants. Offering the HVM certificate program at HCC allows underrepresented students a pathway to these high demand STEM careers.",
