 "awd_abstract_narration": "What differentiates the individuals from under-represented backgrounds who persist in STEM-related educational pathways in college from those who opt out? The proposed research examines whether identity development is key to understanding these educational and developmental trajectories. Although research has shown that the establishment of a clear and positive identity during emerging adulthood is associated with a variety of optimal outcomes, many questions remain regarding how identity is formed, particularly with regard to developing a positive science identity and a sense of belonging with one's STEM field. The overarching goal of the current project is to better understand how identity forms during college by applying a narrative approach, in which identity is understood as developing through a subjective process of integrating life experiences into a personal and self-defining story. Specifically, the unique vantage point of narratives will be used to better understand why some students -- especially women, underrepresented minorities, and those with disadvantaged backgrounds -- disengage from pursuing STEM-related careers while others persist. By combining objective markers (e.g., gender, ethnicity, SES, educational background) with coded narratives that emerge in response to relevant experiences (e.g., in the science classroom), this study may contribute to solutions for the persistent lack of diversity in the sciences. More broadly, by examining how students engage in meaning-making about the critical transitions (e.g., leaving home, choosing a major) and contextualized experiences (e.g., academic, social, romantic) that are central to college life, the proposed research will identify the identity pathways that contribute to increases over time in other important outcomes, including maturity, happiness, and clarity of career goals.\r\n\r\nThe Identity Pathways Project is a five-year, two-campus longitudinal study that utilizes a quantitative narrative approach. The longitudinal design involves three surveys annually for four years and a final survey one year after graduation. The surveys will include repeated assessments of both narratives (transition to college, academic and relational high and low points, experiences related to major choice and future career) and standard scales of the outcomes of interest. With this design, the proposed research will be able to test the extent to which identity processes operate as mechanisms of developmental change, and more specifically, whether narratives reflecting a positive science identity are a key factor in persistence along a STEM-related career path. The two-campus design, which includes a private liberal arts college and a state university, increases the demographic diversity and allows for a more inclusive examination of identity development, especially as it pertains to career identity and STEM participation. The narrative approach to career identity has important implications for designing career counseling programs, especially those promoting STEM-related career paths among women and minorities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Identity Pathways Project (IPP) is a longitudinal study designed to examine how students\u2019 identities develop during their college years.  Across 13 waves of data collection at two different institutions, spanning from the summer before college to one year after graduation, IPP employed a novel methodology that combined traditional quantitative measures with qualitative narrative assessments. These narrative assessments focused on how students make sense of a variety of college-related experiences (e.g., transition to college, academic high and low points, major choice) and offered an unprecedented window into the meaning-making processes that characterize how identities develop during college.  Across multiple publications, conference presentations, and undergraduate thesis projects, we have used IPP\u2019s unusually rich data set to examine basic and applied questions.  Noteworthy projects and related findings to date include the following:\n\n\nNarrative self-representations and trajectories of adjustment.  In one paper (Lilgendahl &amp; McLean, 2019), we examined how representations of self in academic and relational high and low point narratives from the first year of college related to trajectories of change in psychological adjustment.  We found that positive self-representations in narratives related to increasing life satisfaction across the first year of college, especially for narratives about relationship high points.  We also found that those who entered college with elevated levels of depression and anxiety were the most vulnerable to forming negative self-views in narrating their academic low points.  A recent senior thesis project (Xu, 2022) showed that continuing to view academic low points as causing negative changes in self-concept was associated with lack of direction and increased career-related self-doubt by the end of college.  This work suggests that seeing oneself negatively in the context of academics may be particularly challenging for college students.\n\n\nIdentity trajectories of underrepresented students considering STEM majors.  One of the major aims of IPP was to use narrative methods to gain deeper insights into the persistent problem of underrepresentation of Black, Latinx and Indigenous students in STEM fields.  McLean et al. (2021) employed a qualitative longitudinal analysis of how underrepresented students who entered college considering a STEM major narrated their experiences across 4 years, highlighting narratives that focused on students\u2019 reasoning about their choice of major and how their academic experiences related to their views of themselves and their future plans.  We found pronounced individual differences in how major choice was experienced in relation to the students\u2019 developing identities, with implications for students\u2019 overall adjustment, career identity certainty, and sense of success in college.  For example, some students detailed the tensions between their own intrinsic motivation for careers other than STEM and feelings of family obligation to pursue STEM.  For others, the importance of their ethnic identity and how it was (or was not) integrated into their major was relevant to whether they continued in STEM or not.  Finally, we were struck by how much mental health played a role in major choice and academic experiences, perhaps especially for underrepresented students at predominantly white institutions (PWIs).  These results have useful implications for academic and career counseling for underrepresented students in STEM and students of color at PWIs more broadly. \n\n\nContributions to theory and research on narrative identity development.  The findings of several projects to date make important contributions to the field of narrative identity development.  For example, we found that patterns of stability and change in narrative identity processes over time are highly contextualized, depending in part on the kind of meaning-making one is engaged in, as well as the type of event upon which one is reflecting (McLean et al, 2022).  We also found evidence that the processes defined and measured by two distinct models of identity (narrative and status approaches) are largely distinct from one another (Turner et al., under review).  In a mixed-methods analysis of students\u2019 narratives about the transition to college, we found that changes in narrating this experience were closely connected to experiences of marginalization on campus and mental health concerns (Patterson et al., 2022). Such findings push scholars\u2019 methodological assumptions, as well as push scholars to more carefully consider the context of identity development.\n\n\nTo conclude, the Identity Pathways Project has yielded a rich array of novel findings that illuminate the inherently context-dependent, dynamic and integrative nature of identity processes.  To date, our work highlights the close relationship between identity and mental health during college, a relationship that requires special attention for students from underrepresented and marginalized groups.  Our data also shows the necessity of using mixed-methods and narrative assessments to fully understand the psychological experience of identity development during college.  Finally, we are proud that many undergraduate students have received valuable research training and professional opportunities through their work on IPP.  Our work on this project is ongoing and we look forward to continuing to work with our students to answer both basic and applied questions pertaining to development during college.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kate Mclean"
