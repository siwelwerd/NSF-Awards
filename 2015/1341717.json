 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Title: Collaborative Research:  Seasonal Sea Ice Production in the Ross Sea, Antarctica  (working title changed from submitted title)\r\nInstitutions: UT-San Antonio; Columbia University; Naval Postgraduate School; Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute; UC@Boulder\r\n\r\nThe one place on Earth consistently showing increases in sea ice area, duration, and concentration is the Ross Sea in Antarctica.  Satellite imagery shows about half of the Ross Sea increases are associated with changes in the austral fall, when the new sea ice is forming.  The most pronounced changes are also located near polynyas, which are areas of open ocean surrounded by sea ice. To understand the processes driving the sea ice increase, and to determine if the increase in sea ice area is also accompanied by a change in ice thickness, this project will conduct an oceanographic cruise to the polynyas of the Ross Sea in April and May, 2017, which is the austral fall.  The team will deploy state of the art research tools including unmanned airborne systems (UASs, commonly called drones), autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs).  Using these tools and others, the team will study atmospheric, oceanic, and sea ice properties and processes concurrently. A change in sea ice production will necessarily change the ocean water below, which may have significant consequences for global ocean circulation patterns, a topic of international importance. All the involved institutions will be training students, and all share the goal of expanding climate literacy in the US, emphasizing the role high latitudes play in the Earth's dynamic climate.\r\n\r\nThe main goal of the project is to improve estimates of sea ice production and water mass transformation in the Ross Sea. The team will fully capture the spatial and temporal changes in air-ice-ocean interactions when they are initiated in the austral fall, and then track the changes into the winter and spring using ice buoys, and airborne mapping with the newly commissioned IcePod instrument system, which is deployed on the US Antarctic Program's LC-130 fleet. The oceanographic cruise will include stations in and outside of both the Terra Nova Bay and Ross Ice Shelf polynyas. Measurements to be made include air-sea boundary layer fluxes of heat, freshwater, and trace gases, radiation, and meteorology in the air; ice formation processes, ice thickness, snow depth, mass balance, and ice drift within the sea ice zone; and temperature, salinity, and momentum in the ocean below. Following collection of the field data, the team will improve both model parameterizations of air-sea-ice interactions and remote sensing algorithms. Model parameterizations are needed to determine if sea-ice production has increased in crucial areas, and if so, why (e.g., stronger winds or fresher oceans).  The remote sensing validation will facilitate change detection over wider areas and verify model predictions over time.  Accordingly this project will contribute to the international Southern Ocean Observing System (SOOS) goal of measuring essential climate variables continuously to monitor the state of the ocean and ice cover into the future.",

Palmer into the early winter Ross Sea took place between April and June 2017 and was a unique opportunity to investigate the biogeochemistry of pack ice during early stages of ice formation. The comparison of CO 2 fluxes over consolidated and unconsolidated ice show that 1) sea ice acts as a source of CO2 for the atmosphere 2) largest fluxes occur at the earliest sea ice growth stages (i.e. frazil ice, unconsolidated grey ice, and pancake ice). Large fluxes are due to ongoing active rejection of impurities, high porosity of highly saline/high temperature young ice, and the absence of snow. Overall, snow appears to restrict CO2 fluxes. In some cases, fluxes over snow appear to be nil or even opposite to fluxes over bare ice. Therefore, while snow is often viewed as a transient buffer for air-ice gases fluxes, the role of snow appears to be more complicated. The new measurements of CO2 fluxes over young ice carried out during PIPERS potentially allows the completion of an annual budget of CO2 fluxes over Antarctic pack ice by filling a significant early winter gap in the seasonal cycle not examined in earlier cruises made only in spring and summer with higher ice temperatures..</p>\n<p>High sea ice production (SIP) causes high-salinity water formation, influencing the global thermohaline circulation. Coastal polynyas are regarded as the ice production factories. The calculation of polynya ice production was previously performed based on passive microwave data and a heat flux model. However, the coarse spatial resolution of passive microwave data was unable to accurately map the polynya area. Sentinel-1 SAR data with fine spatial and temporal (~2 days) resolution provide an unprecedented opportunity to accurately detect polynyas for both area and occurrence. This study used these SAR images to detect the ice production in the Ross sea polynya for 2017 and 2018, and found that the volume is only 1/2-2/3 of that from previous results, implying that previous studies might have significantly overestimated the ice production in Ross Sea polynyas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sea ice change is emblematic of our warming climate especially in the Arctic.&nbsp; In the Antarctic, sea ice is part of a more complex system involving the atmosphere, the ocean and the ice. Strong winds, called katabatics, flow off the Antarctic ice sheet over the Ross Sea, forming polynyas often considered sea ice factories. &nbsp;The PIPERS project aims to understand the basic energy fluxes between the atmosphere and the ocean and what controls on how sea ice is formed in these polynya sea ice factories.&nbsp; Satellite imagery can be used to constrain where sea ice is but it cannot measure how thick the sea ice is. So from space we know where sea ice is but not how much. Altimetry measurements, from aircraft, drones or satellites, are used to measure how thick the sea ice is over long distances.&nbsp; The IcePod is an ice imaging system developed at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University developed with support from the National Science Foundation.&nbsp; The IcePod contains multiple instruments including a scanning laser altimeter also known as a LIDAR, the prime instrument for studying sea ice. &nbsp;&nbsp;The IcePod system is mounted aboard a New York Air National Guard LC-130 aircraft.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Lamont IcePod team flew three flights across the Ross Sea to measure the thickness of the sea ice using the LIDAR, providing a regional context for the PIPERS surface and shipboard work. The flights in late 2016 and late 2017 were designed to fly over satellite tracks, measurements from PIPERS scientists on the ice surface and earlier airborne measurements.&nbsp; These measurements will help make better predictions of how sea ice forms, how it deforms and what sea ice?s role in Antarctic change will be in the future. Examples of the LIDAR data, showing the complex way the ice fractures and deforms, are included in addition to the flight tracks for the PIPERS IcePod flights.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/02/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stephen&nbsp;F&nbsp;Ackley</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1341717/1341717_10402195_1562104946148_PIPERSDragonSkinIce--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1341717/1341717_10402195_1562104946148_PIPERSDragonSkinIce--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"'Dragon Skin' Ice\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1341717/1341717_10402195_1562104946148_PIPERSDragonSkinIce--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"'Dragon Skin' Ice\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pancake Ice produced in the Terra Nova Bay Polynya under katabatic wind forcing became rafted into formations looking like scales and was coined as Dragon Skin Ice.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Stephen Ackley</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stephen&nbsp;F&nbsp;Ackley</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">'Dragon Skin' Ice</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1341717/1341717_10402195_1561128807402_PIPERS_LiDAR_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1341717/1341717_10402195_1561128807402_PIPERS_LiDAR_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"PIPERS IcePod LIDAR Ice Elevation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1341717/1341717_10402195_1561128807402_PIPERS_LiDAR_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"PIPERS IcePod LIDAR Ice Elevation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PIPERS IcePod LIDAR Ice Elevation in the Ross Sea.
