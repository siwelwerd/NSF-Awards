 "awd_abstract_narration": "1511964(Chakrabarty)\r\n\r\nRecent studies have shown that large-scale open fires emit a previously unrecognized form of soot particle-superaggregates (SAs), in quantities greater than 70% by number and mass concentration. These particles could have previous unaccounted-for impacts on human health and the environment. The objective of this research is to generate, in a controlled manner, soot SAs that mimic those from large-scale open burns, and investigate the particle formation mechanism and the emitted particle properties. Undergraduate and graduate students will participate in the research effort.  The PI will also conduct teachers training workshop for twenty school teachers over the summer.\r\n\r\nThe conventional view holds that mobility diameter (Dm) less than or equal to 700 nm, aerodynamic diameter (Da) less than or equal to  300 nm, and fractal dimension approximately 1.8 is the end-point morphology of freshly-emitted soot particles. Preliminary investigations indicate that Dm and specific surface areas of soot SAs are ten and three times greater, respectively, than those of conventional soot particles. The unusually large Dm values render soot SAs undetectable using aerosol mobility sizing instruments. Alternatively, Da of these particles, which is used for estimating the probability of deposition within lungs, are similar to those of conventional soot particles. These contradicting observations of soot SA properties have left several fundamental questions unanswered: How does the superaggregate growth kinetics in a flame depend on the process parameters such as particle volume fraction, residence time, sooting index of the fuel, fuel/air flow rates, and temperature?  How is the aggregation kinetics different in a positive gravity (upward rising) flame system? How sensitive are the superaggregate particle morphologies and properties to changes in the flame process parameters? This project proposes to answer these questions, which will bring about a potentially transformative understanding of soot SA's growth kinetics and their microphysical properties.",

A total of 12 peer-reviewed publications and a patent application have resulted from this study. A total of 5 PhD, 2 MS, and 5 undergraduate students along with 2 post-doctoral students received training on this study.</p>\n<p>We measured the evolution of aggregate packing density <strong>(<em>&theta;<sub>f</sub></em>)</strong>, defined as actual volume occupied by solid subunits constituting an aggregate relative to total aggregate volume, as it evolved from aggregates to superaggregates to gels. Since aggregates grow with a scaling dimensionality less than the spatial dimension, their <strong><em>&theta;<sub>f</sub></em></strong><em> </em>decreases with increasing size <strong><em>R<sub>g</sub>/a</em></strong><em> </em>(aggregate radius of gyration normalized by average radius of elemental subunits). Using our &ndash;g buoyancy-opposed flame system, we experimentally mapped the scaling of <strong><em>&theta;<sub>f</sub></em></strong> &nbsp;for aggregates&ndash;made of nonrepulsive soot nanoparticles (NPs)&ndash;across five orders of magnitude of <strong><em>R<sub>g</sub>/a</em></strong>. Our experiments revealed three successive growth regimes, namely diffusion-limited cluster aggregation (DLCA) of NPs, percolation of aggregates, and DLCA of percolates, with distinct crossover points occurring at <strong><em>R<sub>g</sub>/a</em></strong><em> </em>&asymp; 4 and 1&times;10<sup>3</sup>. Corresponding to these regimes, we showed <strong><em>&theta;<sub>f</sub></em></strong><em> </em>to decrease in distinct power-law exponents of 1.3, 0.5, and 1.3, respectively.</p>\n<p>We established a complete set of mathematical descriptions on the kinetics of sol-to-gel transition. We show that contrary to conventional wisdom, the sol-to-gel process essentially comprises of three distinct regimes, namely the aggregation of sol clusters parameterized with a kinetic exponent z between 1 and 2; the gelation of sol clusters parameterized with z between 2 and 5.7; and the aggregation of gel clusters with z between 2 and 3.5. The onsets of each regimes were discussed using characteristic timescales whose analytical expressions are rigorously formulated as functions of monomer-volume-fractions. Finally, we established universal power-law scaling relationships unifying the kinetics corresponding to the three regimes.</p>\n<p>We parameterized the ballistic-to-diffusive (BD) transition kinetics of aggregate-to-gel, we introduced a directional statistics formulation of the BD transition kinetics using a wrapped Cauchy distribution (WCD) function that governs the probability distribution of the relative angle between successive velocity vectors of motion. We parameterized the time evolution of the probability distribution using simple yet rigorous mathematics; the goal was to enable use of our analytical expression in any stochastic motion. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first generalized parameterization of the BD transition applicable to any stochastic system irrespective of its driving mechanism and scale.</p>\n<p>We numerically calculated the mass absorption cross-sections (MAC) values of soot superaggregates and aggregates in the Vis-IR wavelengths. Compared to equivalent-size spheres (currently used by radiative transfer calculations and in Computational Fluid Dynamics models), the MAC values of aggregates, especially in the IR wavelengths, showed percent enhancement of &asymp;150 and 400 at small and large length scales, respectively. The absorption properties of aggregates with size parameters &gt;1 surprisingly continued to remain in the Rayleigh optics regime. We explained this phenomenon using the Maxwell-Garnett effective medium theory and the concept of phase shift parameter.</p>\n<p>We investigated the capability of our -g, buoyancy-opposed flame system to synthesize non-carbon superaggregates and gels. This has potential applications in the materials science and powder industry. We demonstrated the synthesis of titanium dioxide (TiO2) aerosol gels using our methane-oxygen co-flow diffusion flame reactor operated in the down-fired configuration (fuel flow in the direction opposite to buoyancy forces). Titanium isopropoxide was fed as a precursor to the flame under different operating conditions. Control of the monomer size and crystal phase of TiO2 gel particles was achieved by adjusting the flame operating conditions, specifically the flame temperature, which was shown to significantly influence TiO2 crystal transformation and the rate of particle growth and sintering. The resulting material properties were characterized for their physical and optical properties. Results showed that the TiO2 aerosol gels had effective densities in the range 0.021 - 0.025, which is two order of magnitude less than the theoretical mass density of TiO2. The monomer size distribution, crystalline phase, and UV-Vis absorbance spectra of the gels showed distinct characteristics as a function of flame temperature.</p>\n<p>We co-developed middle school course modules on weather, climate, and energy concepts and applications. We also participated in teacher professional development from local school districts around these modules. During the 2017-18 academic year, our modules were tested at two middle school districts in Saint Louis. Approximately 700 middle school students enrolled in four middle schools were administered the modules as part of their earth sciences curriculum. Both formative and summative evaluations suggested overwhelmingly positive response. The suggestions and comments received from both students and teachers are now being incorporated to develop version 2 (revised) of the modules.
