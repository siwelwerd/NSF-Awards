The project, Retaining Emerging Alamo Colleges Talent in STEM (REACT-STEM), will support at least 20 scholars, providing each with up to $10,000/year for up to 3 years. Students from the Alamo Community College System will be recruited and provided with support mechanisms to increase retention, provide mentoring and guidance, help to find undergraduate research laboratory opportunities, and assist them in applying to PhD programs of national prominence.  The project will conduct assessments to identify the methods that are most effective in recruiting and supporting students and launching their careers in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe Retaining Emerging Alamo Colleges Talent in STEM (REACT-STEM) project will implement activities to fulfill four objectives: 1) Encourage community college student matriculation to a four-year university and program recruitment through effective advertising and interaction with existing student success programs. 2) Facilitate transfer student transition and retention at the University of Texas San Antonio through financial assistance, pre-semester boot camp, weekly Strong Transitions meetings, connections with peer mentors and connections with research PI mentors. 3) Promote academic excellence through enrollment in the Honors College, faculty mentoring, peer study connections and professional guidance and tutoring. 4) Promote STEM career development, self-efficacy, and identity by creation of Individual Development Plans, attendance at seminars, field trips to local biotech companies, career services presentations, research experiences and volunteer outreach activities. Assessment of the efficacy of these different activities will help contribute to expanding the knowledge base regarding the circumstances under which scholarship projects of this type are successful.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA common route for college education is to start at Community College and then transfer to a Four-Year Institution for the final two years and Bachelor\u2019s degree.  Nationally, nearly 80% of students attending community college have this as a goal but only 25% attempt the transfer.  Unfortunately, many students, especially underrepresented groups and STEM majors have difficulty making this transition and around 40% of those who attempt it fail to complete their education.  Reasons for this include a failure to connect with other students, faculty or campus resources; difficulty with transition into large, impersonal and rigorous courses; and financial stress.  This is a loss to the individual students and causes a STEM talent drain for the country\u2019s work force.  The goal of our project was to provide financial, social and mentoring support for a group of STEM community college transfer students and test whether this increased the likelihood of them graduating with a STEM degree and continuing on to a STEM career or further STEM education.\n    Over the course of 7 years, 29 students who had majored in STEM fields at community college and transferred to UTSA participated in the REACT program.  All had sufficient financial need that they qualified for Pell grants.  Seventeen were underrepresented minorities and thirteen were female.  They received up to $10,000/year in scholarship support and met on a regular basis, usually every two weeks during the school year.  The regular meetings gave them a cohort group going through the same transition that they could relate to.  The program directors talked with them about study skills, dealing with the campus culture, finding support services on campus, science careers and finding research experiences.  They also met with them individually to check on grades, bureaucratic impediments and general well-being.  \n    At UTSA, the overall six-year graduation rate has recently increased to 50% but in the sciences it is closer to 25%.  Part of this is that 35% of freshman science majors switch to a non-STEM major before graduation.  Of 29 participants in the program, 20 have already graduated with a STEM degree, 3 are still enrolled and 3 are on leave of absence for health or personal reasons but plan to return and graduate in STEM.  If these six attain their goal, we will achieve 90% graduating in STEM.  Three others graduated but in a non-STEM field.  Thus, only 10% switched out of STEM and the overall graduation rate of participants could be 100%.  That would demonstrate a remarkably positive effect of the program on STEM graduation and overall graduation rate.\n    In interviews with an external evaluator, the students credited the financial aid as being a major factor in their retention.  The funds decreased stress and increased their ability to focus on classes and research.  They also credited feelings of belonging due to connections with the project PIs and fellow students.  They also had an increased desire to do research and felt more connected to science and had a greater knowledge about careers in science.  Clearly, our interventions had a strong and direct influence on keeping these students enrolled in STEM.\n    A final point brings up  the importance of trust and how hard it can be to fully achieve it.  Nearly 80% of transfer students suffer \"Transfer Shock\" where their grades drop  around a half letter grade in the first semesters after they transfer.  In STEM fields, some studies have shown drops closer to a full letter grade.  This can be very discouraging to transfer students and can cause some to give up on pursuing their degree or major.  We had thought that by meeting with the students and telling them of the issues and how to avoid them, we would prevent Transfer Shock from occurring.  Instead, we had only a slight decrease in the percent who saw a dip in their grades.  However, they recovered quickly and none thought about dropping out.  When asked about this, they told us they didn\u2019t believe us when we told them about the issues, but once they were seeing it happen to them they used our advice and support to quickly recover and boost their grades.  If we want to decrease Transfer Shock, we may need to start working with the community college students before they transfer so they will trust what we tell them and respond sooner to our advice.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J.
