 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor John Welch of the University at Albany is developing new fluorine containing functional groups.  Fluorinated compounds are widely employed in life sciences and materials research.  Nearly 20% of all pharmaceuticals and 40% of all agrochemicals contain fluorine. Fluorination and fluorinated functional groups have added value and utility to materials for 75 years yet it has been increasingly apparent that these useful substituents can be accompanied by undesirable environmental effects.  Prof. Welch is training graduate students to handle extraordinarily reactive reagents to prepare novel fluorinated reactants. Prof. Welch operates and makes available to the scientific community a dedicated laboratory equipped with the necessary infrastructure for the preparation, purification and characterization of both liquid and gaseous reactive fluorinated intermediates and synthons.  \r\n\r\nThe relationship between structure and reactivity of aliphatic fluorinated hypervalent sulfur compounds is under investigation.  Although the chemistry of the pentafluorosulfanyl group is very much in its infancy, the Welch group is exploring the use of environmentally more benign hypervalent fluorinated sulfur compounds to deliver the desired effects of fluorination while mitigating the undesirable aspects, e.g., by decomposing in an environmentally benign manner.  The influence of steric demand, electronegativity and dipole moment on the physical properties, conformation, and selectivity of beta-lactams, amino acids and peptides containing fluorinated hypervalent sulfur is being explored. The role of trifluoromethyl substitution in the SF5-group (i.e. the new SF4(CF3) group) is under investigation. In comparing the SF5 and SF4(CF3) substituents, differences in selectivity and reactivity  will be examined. An effort will be made to establish whether such differences correlate with trends in dipole moment or electron-withdrawing ability of these two new, heavily fluorinated substituents.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe electronic, polar, and steric effects of pentafluorosulfanyl and tetrafluoro(trifluoromethyl)sulfanyl substitution on selectivity, reactivity and conformation were explored.\n\nSignificant Results:\n\nThe stereoselectivity of beta lactam formation was very effectively controlled by pentafluorosulfanyl (SF5) substitution.  Dipolar control of the transition state by a SF5-bearing carbon influenced the diastereofacial selectivity of cyclization in a remarkably efficient process.  The origin of this control was confirmed by computational studies of the transition state structure of the beta-lactam forming process.\n\nThe preparation of a new reagent, tetrafluoro(trifluoromethyl)sulfanyl chloride (CF3SF4Cl), from the common chemical intermediate perchloromethyl mercaptan (trichloromethanesulfenyl chloride), was very reproducible and scaleable.  The addition of CF3SF4Cl to alkenes, alkynes, enol acetates and heteroatom substituted alkenes was general and of broad scope.  Dehydrochlorination, hydrolysis and oxidation of the substituted products was investigated.  Relative to the SF5 group the CF3SF4-group has a significantly diminished dipolar effect but is very sterically demanding.  As such, this functional group was an excellent tool to dissect polar from steric effects on reactivity and selectivity.  The asymmetric synthesis of a CF3SF4-containing amino acid enabled the synthesis of an optically pure heptapeptide containing two CF3SF4-containing amino acids.  NMR solution structure methods were used to define the detailed helical structure of that heptapeptide in both aprotic polar and non-polar solvents and enabled the direct comparison with the corresponding SF5-substituted system.  In both polar and non-polar solvents, the CF3SF4-containing amino acids induced secondary structure even in this very short heptapeptide.\n\nThe influence of 2-CF3SF4-ethanol on the peptide secondary structure is particularly exciting.  The induction of coiling by the alcohol at concentrations 20% of that required for induction of coiling by trifluoroethanol or hexafluoroisopropanol suggests that coiling is very strongly favored by hydrophobic interactions as opposed to the increased polarity of those solvents.  The propensity of the new alcohol to form aggregates at even very low concentrations portends the utility of the alcohol to induce nanoparticle-decorated microbubbles useful as multimodal contrast agents (MRI, optical or PET imaging).\n\nLastly the development of a new family of tetrafluorosulfanyl containing polymers formed by unique photochemical step-growth polymerization reactions is very exciting. The polymers demonstrate excellent sensitivity to both EUV and E-beam irradiation.  Curing by UV irradiation of thin films of the photopolymer leads to remarkably hard and stiff coatings with good thermal and hydrolytic stability that may have utility in aerospace and exo-atmospheric applications.\n\nPromotion of Teaching and Learning- As few as a half-dozen laboratories in the US remain to train students in the handling of extraordinarily reactive reagents such as bromine trifluoride, chlorine fluoride or fluorine, reagents essential to fluorochemical research. The reported research sustained our ability to train students in this crucial area of chemical technology and discovery.\n\nOutreach to Promote Participation of Under-represented Groups. Chemical Literacy Academy:  While participation in laboratory research is limited, our F-STEP (Fluorochemical Science and Technology Program) initiative that began in the fall of 2020 focused on increasing the number of historically underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students involved in STEM fields.  Local high school students from traditionally underrepresented groups participated in approximately 20 Saturday morning group-centered, active learning sessions focused on fluorine chemistry in materials research.  The students were introduced to the role of fluorochemicals in coatings, water repellants and in novel materials.  The students explored the environmental impact and bioaccumulation of those materials and the associated metabolites.  The most recent cohort of students investigated the contamination of local ponds and lakes by perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).  Controversies around the regulation of fluorinated chemicals, such as coatings of coffee cups, are the subject of our weekly discussions.  Student teams were tasked to present regulatory and remediation proposals to their peers.
