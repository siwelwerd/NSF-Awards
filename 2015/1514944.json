 "awd_abstract_narration": "Learning and memory processes are believed to be similarly organized in human and nonhuman primates. Therefore, understanding human learning can be enhanced through behavioral and cognitive studies in nonhuman primates. Of particular interest are the effects of age on learning and memory, as age is indicated as a predominate risk factor for many neurodegenerative diseases. Compared to all other nonhuman primates, humans have remarkably increased life spans. This extended longevity is associated with a decline in cognitive function and increased susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer?s disease. Therefore, research that works to enhance knowledge of the mechanisms of aging, especially how it affects learning and memory, is of immense importance. This project will work to advance scientific understanding of the processes of aging through comparison with a nonhuman primate model (common marmosets).  This research will be conducted at the Primate Research Institute (PRI) in Japan where an established colony of common marmosets presently resides. Research will be completed under the guidance of Dr. Katsuki Nakamura, whose expertise in cognitive neuroscience and aging in common marmosets will be invaluable to the project.\r\n\r\nCommon marmosets have been suggested as a new model for analysis of age-related changes as this species displays markers associated with neurodegeneration. However, the effects of aging are not well defined within common marmosets. Therefore, this project will be the first to examine the effects of age on cognitive function within common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) through visual discrimination tasks and reversal learning. Four common marmosets, 10 years or older, will take part in this study. The results from this study will be compared to data collected from previous cognitive tests on a group of younger marmosets, ages 1 year 7 months to 4 years 3 months. Older marmosets are expected to not be able to complete the cognitive tasks at the same rate nor with the same level of success as the younger group. Importantly, this project will help elucidate the mechanisms of aging in relation to learning and memory.  This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).",

The goal is for the marmoset to make an association between image A and the food reward. If the association was made, then it was determined that the animal had learned the task. In reversal learning, the marmoset once again was presented the same images as during the object discrimination task. However, now the food reward was associated with Image B. In this learning paradigm, the marmoset had to learn to inhibit its first learned response, picking Image A, and learn to now pick Image B. For both learning tasks, the number of errors committed before the animal reached criterion was recorded. These data were collected from 3 aged marmosets on a series of 4 object discrimination and 2 reversal learning tasks.
