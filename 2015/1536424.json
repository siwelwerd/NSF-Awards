 "awd_abstract_narration": "Pressure gauges installed on the seafloor are key instruments for monitoring tides, offshore earthquakes and tsunamis, seafloor volcanoes, and offshore oil and gas fields.  While valuable, the instruments slowly drift, which make long-term measurements more difficult or even impossible to use.  This research will simulate seafloor pressure and temperature conditions in the laboratory, and periodically re-calibrate the instruments to determine the drift behavior.  New sensors and methods to correct the drift in place will also be tested.  The results will improve the characterization and application of pressure measurements for such important problems.\r\n\r\nPressure observations for seafloor geodesy provide important data on many seafloor deformation processes, including volcanism and tectonic deformation. Pressure observations are also relevant to rates of sea level rise and other oceanographic signals. Existing pressure sensors all drift in&#8232;time (dominated by linear and exponentially decaying functions of time), which limits their use in the aforementioned applications to relatively short period signals (days to months). Methods such as seafloor pressure campaign surveys and in-situ&#8232;calibration can effectively remove the drift, but these methods are costly and thus limited&#8232;in usage. The manufacturers of pressure gauges have proposed new sensors and methods to address the drift issue, which are significantly simpler and would be much less costly to implement. One approach uses a secondary sensor to measure only sensor drift due to residual water vapor contamination (hypothesized to be a dominant term), independent of the applied pressure.&#8232;  Another method hypothesizes that the drift rate can be measured by comparison to a one-atmosphere low drift sensor. This research will subject an array of existing and new sensors to simulated seafloor pressures and temperatures over extended periods of time (4-6 months at a minimum). The sensors will be periodically calibrated with a primary, drift free metrological standard known as a deadweight tester. Drift determinations with the new sensors and methods will be made, and compared to the estimates determined by primary standard. This experiment will determine the efficacy and uncertainties of these new methods. If these new approaches are validated, this will enable the development of new seafloor instruments, and the ocean sciences will have access to new methods that will benefit observations of important phenomena. In turn, better understanding of seafloor tectonics and volcanism will improve the assessment and response to potential geological hazards.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSeafloor tectonic processes have the potential to generate large earthquakes and tsunamis, including much of the west coast of the continental United States and Alaska.  A number of different instruments can monitor slow crustal deformation on land prior to a large event.  Tectonics occurring below the seafloor are significantly harder to study.  In particular, vertical seafloor deformation cannot be monitored with conventional techniques.  Seafloor water pressure can be used as a proxy, by measuring changes in water pressure as the seafloor rises or falls.  Geologically significant changes are quite small, on the order of a centimeter per year, or a few parts per million of the nominal water pressure at the seafloor.  Pressure gauges can measure such small changes but the gauges also drift slowly at the same rate or greater, complicating interpretation of the data.\n\n  This project developed a laboratory system to mimic the seafloor temperature and pressure for a large group of gauges.  The gauges were held at 2 degrees C. and 190 atm (2750 psi), approximating the conditions at a depth of 1900 meters.  This allowed us to characterize gauge drift without the expense or risk of seagoing experiments and without the complex signals, such as tides, present in the ocean. The gauges were regularly measured against a calibration standard (a primary deadweight calibrator) in order to determine the gauge drift.  The tests ran for 6 months with a set of 15 pressure gauges.\n\n We also tested a new method called A-0-A, proposed by other researchers, to measure and correct for the drift of the gauges.  In this particular test, the gauges were calibrated by quickly venting the pressure to the 1-atmosphere conditions of the lab and measuring the gauge reading.  In turn, the lab air pressure is monitored by a precise barometer, which has a limited pressure range but also has a very low effective drift.   This test was conducted over a six-month period.\n\n Our results show that the A-0-A method agrees very well with the calibration standard.  Other independent groups have been testing this as well, also with good results.  This is an example of the scientific method repeating and reproducing a result, which provides confidence in the claim's validity!  \n\n We have actually built and deployed seafloor pressure calibration systems, which work well for monitoring seafloor deformation.  Such systems are complex and expensive, thus limiting their use.  The A-0-A method is much simpler and conceivably will find wider use in a number of different settings.\n\n This work is also of interest to the offshore oil and gas industry.  Offshore reservoir monitoring is essential to efficient and safe resource management.  Pressure measurements are used to monitor the seafloor deformation, which is in turn is interpreted for changes in the reservoir during production. Drift-corrected pressure sensing systems would play a key role in this effort.    \n\n Understanding seafloor deformation is essential to assessing the natural hazards of our planet, and for plans for adaptation and risk management.   The most important outcome of this work is provide new tools for this scientific research, and the confidence and understanding required to use them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/12/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Glenn S Sasagawa"
