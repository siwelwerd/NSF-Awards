 "awd_abstract_narration": "The attrition of teachers from teaching is a major public policy issue. Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) teachers, in particular, leave the profession even when they are making progress toward becoming excellent teachers.  The project will identify both causes of teacher attrition and practices that support new teachers and contribute to persistence in the profession. \r\n\r\nThe project will analyze data from the newly released nationally representative large-scale, longitudinal survey - The Beginning Teacher Longitudinal Study(BTLS) - conducted by NCES. This data base follows a national cohort of beginning public school teachers through their first five years of teaching. The project will focus on the 388 STEM teachers in the sample. The project's three research questions focus on the impact of preservice teacher education and inservice professional development on the job persistence and job transitions of teachers through their first five years of teaching: 1) What are the levels of job persistence and job transition among beginning STEM school teachers over their first 5 years after entering teaching;  2) What are the types and amounts of preserve education and preparation that beginning STEM school teachers receive and what impact do these have on their job persistence and transitions? 3) What are the types and amounts of inservice induction and professional development that beginning STEM school teachers receive in their first 5 years and what impact do these have on their job persistence and transitions? The project will use Event History Analysis and other advanced statistical methods.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The Effects of Education and Professional Development on \nBeginning STEM Teacher Persistence: a Longitudinal Study\nBy\nRichard M. Ingersoll, Philip Sirinides and Gregory Collins\nThe Consortium for Policy Research in Education\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\n\n \n\nThis study, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, focuses on the career paths of STEM school teachers during their first several years after entering teaching.  \n\nThere is widespread agreement that in order to improve STEM student learning and performance, schools must ensure that all elementary and secondary STEM classrooms are staffed with qualified STEM teachers. In our prior research we have shown that one of the most important sources of STEM teacher staffing problems is teacher turnover - the departure of teachers from their teaching jobs. Our earlier research documents that if the school system is to ensure that all students in STEM courses are taught by qualified teachers, many schools, especially those in disadvantaged communities, will need to focus on improving STEM teacher retention. \n\nThis study builds on this earlier work by focusing on understanding the career paths and job transitions of beginning STEM school teachers. The focus of our study is the impact of two of the most significant areas of contemporary education research reform - preservice teacher preparation and in-service teacher induction and professional development - on the ability of schools to retain newly hired, qualified, STEM teachers. \n\nOur study focused on three sets of related research questions:\n\n1. What are the levels of attrition among beginning school teachers over their first several years after entering teaching?\n\n2. What are the types and amounts of preservice education that beginning STEM school teachers receive? What impact do these have on the job persistence and transitions of beginning STEM school teachers over their first several years after entering teaching?\n\n3. What are the types and amounts of in-service induction and professional development that beginning STEM school teachers receive in their first several years on the job? What impact does participation in these activities have on the job persistence and transitions of beginning STEM teachers over their first several years after entering teaching?\n\nThe source of data is a unique longitudinal national survey of beginning teachers, the Beginning Teacher Longitudinal Study (BTLS), conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) of the US Department of Education.  This survey followed a nationally representative cohort of beginning teachers through their career trajectories from 2007-08 to 2011-12.  It was expressly created by NCES to address the lack of such longitudinal teacher data.  Ours is among the first detailed analysis of these data.\n\nThe first part of our project focuses on establishing levels in attrition among beginning school teachers over their first several years after entering teaching and investigating the apparent discrepancy between other data sources on beginners? attrition and those from BTLS.   Our focus in this part is methodological, but we find that measurement has large substantive implications\n\nIn the second part of our project we found that the characteristics and features of pre-service teacher education and preparation have a strong bearing on the persistence and retention of new teachers. Most striking, STEM teachers who entered teaching through alternative routes are far less likely to stay in teaching.  We have found that the kinds of preparation associated with better retention is often the kind of preparation that new STEM teachers are less likely to have received.\n\nIn the third part of our study, we found a strong link between beginning teachers? participation in induction programs and their retention. But we also found that the strength of the effect depended on the types and number of supports that beginning teachers received. Unlike much previous research, the BTLS allows us to compare the persistence and transitions of STEM teachers who did, and who did not, participate in various induction and development activities over several years. Moreover, unlike most previous empirical research, we examine both the type and the duration of the supports and activities beginning teachers participated in, or received, across their first years of teaching.  Our results have been enlightening.\n\nAnswers to our research questions have large and important implications for those concerned with the design and improvement of teacher preparation programs, and of induction and professional development programs for new teachers.
