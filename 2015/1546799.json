The conference will focus attention on recent methods and advances in operator theory via a series of expository lectures on long-standing open problems in operator theory, state-of-the-art techniques, and important recent contributions to the field. The goals of the workshop are the following: (1) to disseminate mainstream trends, state-of-the-art techniques, and recent advances in operator theory to a large group of female and underrepresented graduate students and early career mathematicians; (2) to create a social environment among a diverse level of participants encouraging fruitful discussions of mathematical ideas and sharing of promising research; and (3) to initiate a network of support among participants for future research interaction.The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
