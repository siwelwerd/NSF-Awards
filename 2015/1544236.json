 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Promoting Research and Innovation in Methodologies for Evaluation (PRIME) program seeks to support research on evaluation with special emphasis on: (1) exploring innovative approaches for determining the impacts and usefulness of STEM education projects and programs; (2) building on and expanding the theoretical foundations for evaluating STEM education and workforce development initiatives, including translating and adapting approaches from other fields; and (3) growing the capacity and infrastructure of the evaluation field. Three types of proposals will be supported by the program: Exploratory Projects that include proof-of-concept and feasibility studies; more extensive Full-Scale Projects; and workshops and conferences. \r\n\r\nThis study proposes to build capacity for conducting cluster randomized trials (CRT), a design permitting causal inference that is especially important in education given the clustered nature of the U.S. school system, by fleshing out a growing database of CRT parameter estimates to include those for K-12 science teacher interventions.\r\n\r\nThe study will (1) estimate effect sizes that use meta-analysis with a reasonable plan for identifying the relevant literature, coding, and adjusting for publication bias and (2) estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and R-squared values for both 2- and 3-level CRT models across a range of covariates using a variety of data sources.",
