The potential benefits of the study include better understanding and design of combustors and higher efficiency and lower pollutant emissions. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research and be prepared as future researchers and engineers. \r\n\r\nThis proposal focuses on fundamental investigation of the effects of heat release on small scale turbulent structure and aims to provide insight and mechanisms for developing physics-based turbulent reacting models, rather than based on ad-hoc assumptions. The experimental components include novel velocity measurements, adopting an approach similar to tomography in that the velocity measurements cover the depth of the field instead of the traditional two-dimensional section in truly three-dimensional flows.  Some insight will also be shed on whether Kolmogorov's equilibrium assumption for turbulent kinetic energy cascade is valid and, if not, to what extent and in what manner the assumption should be modified by the heat-releasing reactions.   The measurements span over a broader dynamic range of scales than is normally addressed using PIV.  The proposed direct numerical simulations (DNS) and analysis are well focused on questions of the effects of heat release on turbulent energy spectra and energy transfer between different scales.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTurbulent combustion involves two-way interactions between turbulence and flames.  This work focused on the effects of the flame on the turbulent flow field, and more precisely on the energy transfer between scales.  This is one of the two pillars of turbulent combustion.  The other pillar relates to the effects of turbulence on flame chemistry and has been investigated more heavily.\n\nDesigning more efficient, more powerful, cleaner energy conversion devices requires efficient and predictive numerical tools.  Unfortunately, current engineering simulation tools rely too often on models developed for incompressible, homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. This assumes implicitly that the turbulent flow is not affected by the presence of the flame. \n\nIn this work, we challenged this assumption and quantified the effects of chemistry and the attendant heat release on the small-scale dynamics of the turbulent flow.   We derived a mathematical framework to simulate these small scales without the need to capture the entire flow field.  This new approach reproduces the same turbulence characteristics of practical reacting flows at a fraction of the cost.  Using this framework, we identified the impact of the large-scales on the small turbulent scales for a variety of reacting (and non-reacting) flows.  These results will be instrumental in developing the next generation of engineering tools.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/05/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Guillaume Blanquart"
