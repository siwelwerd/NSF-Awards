 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses fundamental physical processes that govern the behavior of helium throughout the thermosphere and also elucidates its role in understanding the behavior of other thermospheric constituents. The thermosphere is the domain for many low-earth-orbiting satellites and the constituent makeup, their transport properties, and their bulk motion contribute significantly to satellite drag. Helium has been a missing constituent in current thermosphere general circulation models and plays an important role in determining satellite drag effects in the upper thermosphere through its impact on the total mass density. Additionally helium is an excellent dynamical tracer creating the possibility of using helium observations to describe the poorly measured wind systems in the thermosphere. The project addresses ways of understanding complexity in the geospace system and will be carried out as a collaboration between the University of Colorado and NCAR. Two graduate students will be involved in the project. \r\n\tThrough this award, the implementation of a scheme to fully describe helium structure in altitude, latitude, longitude, local time, season, solar cycle and geomagnetic activity in NCAR community models will be completed. This new scheme will then be used to evaluate the processes responsible for the distribution and variation of helium. This understanding can then be projected to other gasses whose overall structure and behavior are complex but, by contrasting with helium, can be evaluated for its transport dependencies. The dynamical influences on composition also impact estimates of total mass density, where helium during solar minima can have a direct contribution. This work will lead to a better characterization of the thermosphere and can be used to improve satellite drag studies. Model output will be compared with satellite observations for evaluation.",

Although minor species in the thermosphere, helium and hydrogen become the major species when transitioning from the thermosphere to the exosphere. Thus, it is critical to properly describe their behavior in the thermosphere as it serves as the lower boundary to the exosphere. Furthermore, these species serve as dynamical tracers in the thermosphere allowing for circulations to be revealed based on their observations. The project is exploratory in describing helium?s structure and behavior for the first time in a dynamically self-consistent way by a global coupled thermosphere / ionosphere general circulation model, explanatory by projecting the fundamental physics of upper atmosphere dynamics gained by studying helium to understand dynamical behavior in more complex light species like oxygen and hydrogen, ancillary by establishing the impact of helium and oxygen on thermosphere mass density, and contributory to the CEDAR community by addressing the strategic plan in ways of understanding complexity in the geospace system and advancing Science Thrust 1 - Encourage and Undertake a Systems Perspective of Geospace and Science Thrust 6 - Manage, Mine, and Manipulate Geoscience Data and Models.</p>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">Intellectual Merit:</p>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">A fundamental focus of this research was to explain the non-intuitive behavior of helium and hydrogen in past observations of the upper thermosphere.&nbsp; These observations are primarily captured by NRLMSISE-00 and illustrate, for example anomalous behavior with helium minima on the dayside and maxima at night and seasonal behavior that place minima in the summer hemisphere and maxima in the winter hemisphere. There are other more subtle anomalies in helium and hydrogen behavior that occur with altitude, latitude, longitude, local time, and solar cycle. A thorough investigation using the NCAR TIEGCM revealed that many of these anomalies are a result of three-dimensional circulations and transport processes in the thermosphere. As a minor species, helium is strongly influenced by the behavior in the major species who determine the circulation patterns that are established in the thermosphere. The research found that in regions of convergent, mass-averaged winds, and associated downward vertical motion, helium in the upper thermosphere would be enhanced while in divergent regions helium would be reduced relative to a diffusive description. The transport processes compete with diffusive properties in the altitude range from 120-300 km and explain much of the anomalous behavior observed in helium and hydrogen. This research resolves a longstanding paradox in light species behavior in the thermosphere where downward winds produce an increase in helium and hydrogen concentrations. This research opens the door for new observations that will move us from our climatological view of thermosphere behavior to a more dynamical view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Paragraph\">Broader Impacts:</p>\n<p>This project resulted in one PhD and three Masters students graduating with degrees in Aerospace Engineering.
