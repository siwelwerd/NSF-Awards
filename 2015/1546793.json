 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2nd Workshop on Computational Network Biology: Modeling, Analysis, and Control (CNB-MAC 2015) will be held in conjunction with the 6th ACM International Conference on Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Health Informatics (ACM-BCB 2015), which will be a continuation of the first CNB-MAC workshop, hosted by ACM-BCB 2014.  The workshop will attract researchers from multiple disciplines of engineering, computer science, statistics, biology, and chemistry.  The partnership with ACM-BCB 2015 will help increase the awareness of the importance of rigorous mathematical modeling for accurate and reproducible results on deriving biology knowledge in computational biology in the big data era.  CNB-MAC 2015 will offer both a keynote presentation and a tutorial along this direction to provide future research directions for participating graduate students and post-doctoral researchers. One of the important missions of the workshop is to foster education and development of the next-generation scientists, especially women and minority, in computational network biology.  CNB-MAC 2015 will provide travel awards to encourage graduate students to participate and submit papers. Specifically, 20-30% of the awards will be allocated to encourage women and minority students.\r\n\r\nNext generation high-throughput profiling technologies have enabled more systematic and comprehensive studies of living systems.  Network models play crucial roles in understanding the complex interactions that govern biological systems, and their interactions with external environment.  The main emphasis of CNB-MAC 2015 will be on rigorous mathematical or computational approaches in studying biological networks, analyzing large-scale OMICS data, and investigating mathematical models for human-microbiome-environment interactions.  Complementary to the focus on informatics tools and learning algorithms for big data in ACM-BCB 2015 and other workshops, CNB-MAC 2015 aims to provide a synergistic scientific forum for presenting recent advances in computational network biology that involve modeling, analysis, and control of biological systems under different conditions, and systematic analysis of large-scale OMICS data.",
