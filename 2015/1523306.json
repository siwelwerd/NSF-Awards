The symposium will address a broad range of topics in colloidal and surface science that are broadly relevant to many processes of technological and biological interest.  The symposium will provide a way for leading research groups to interact with researchers across academic and scientific disciplines, and it will help junior researchers, including young faculty members and graduate students, to interact with leaders in the field. \r\n\r\nThis symposium, which will consist of a variety of keynote lectures, technical and poster sessions, will cover a variety of timely and innovative themes that are central to recent advances in colloidal and surface science.  The topics of planned sessions include self- and directed-assembly of nanomaterials, dynamics of suspensions, nanoscale imaging and spectroscopy of interfaces, the behavior of polymers under confinement, electrokinetics and microfluidics, and the role of colloidal principles in environmental systems and in nanomedicine.",
