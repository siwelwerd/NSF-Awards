 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gases trapped in ice cores have revealed astonishing things about the greenhouse gas composition of the past atmosphere, including the fact that carbon dioxide concentrations never rose above 300 parts per million during the last 800,000 years.  This places today's concentration of 400 parts per million in stark contrast.  Furthermore, these gas records show that natural sources of greenhouse gas such as oceans and ecosystems act as amplifiers of climate change by increasing emissions of gases during warmer periods.  Such amplification is expected to occur in the future, adding to the human-produced gas burden.  The South Pole ice core will build upon these prior findings by expanding the suite of gases to include, for the first time, those potent trace gases that both trapped heat and depleted ozone during the past 40,000 years.  The present project on inert gases and methane in the South Pole ice core will improve the dating of this crucial record, to unprecedented precision, so that the relative timing of events can be used to learn about the mechanism of trace gas production and destruction, and consequent climate change amplification.  Ultimately, this information will inform predictions of future atmospheric chemical cleansing mechanisms and climate in the context of our rapidly changing atmosphere.  This award also engages young people in the excitement of discovery and polar research, helping to entrain the next generations of scientists and educators.  Education of graduate students, a young researcher (Buizert), and training of technicians, will add to the nation?s human resource base.   \r\n \r\nThis award funds the construction of the gas chronology for the South Pole 1500m ice core, using measured inert gases (d15N and d40Ar--Nitrogen and Argon isotope ratios, respectively) and methane in combination with a next-generation firn densification model that treats the stochastic nature of air trapping and the role of impurities on densification.  The project addresses fundamental gaps in scientific understanding that limit the accuracy of gas chronologies, specifically a poor knowledge of the controls on ice-core d15N and the possible role of layering and impurities in firn densification.  These gaps will be addressed by studying the gas enclosure process in modern firn at the deep core site.  The work will comprise the first-ever firn air pumping experiment that has tightly co-located measurements of firn structural properties on the core taken from the same borehole.\r\n\r\nThe project will test the hypothesis that the lock-in horizon as defined by firn air d15N, CO2, and methane is structurally controlled by impermeable layers, which are in turn created by high-impurity content horizons in which densification is enhanced.  Thermal signals will be sought using the inert gas measurements, which improve the temperature record with benefits to the firn densification modeling.  Neon, argon, and oxygen will be measured in firn air and a limited number of deep core samples to test whether glacial period layering was enhanced, which could explain low observed d15N in the last glacial period.  Drawing on separate volcanic and methane synchronization to well-dated ice cores to create independent ice and gas tie points, independent empirical estimates of the gas age-ice age difference will be made to check the validity of the firn densification model-inert gas approach to calculating the gas age-ice age difference.  These points will also be used to test whether the anomalously low d15N seen during the last glacial period in east Antarctic ice cores is due to deep air convection in the firn, or a missing impurity dependence in the firn densification models.  \r\n\r\nThe increased physical understanding gained from these studies, combined with new high-precision measurements, will lead to improved accuracy of the gas chronology of the South Pole ice core, which will enhance the overall science return from this gas-oriented core.  This will lead to clarification of timing of atmospheric gas variations and temperature, and aid in efforts to understand the biogeochemical feedbacks among trace gases.  These feedbacks bear on the future response of the Earth System to anthropogenic forcing.  Ozone-depleting substances will be measured in the South Pole ice core record, and a precise gas chronology will add value.  Lastly, by seeking a better understanding of the physics of gas entrapment, the project aims to have an impact on ice-core science in general.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported the high-precision, high-resolution (~ 20 years) measurement of nitrogen isotopes in N2 and oxygen isotopes in O2 in air bubbles in the South Pole deep ice core (also known as SPICECORE).   This ice core covers the past 57,000 years, and is a valuable archive of atmospheric gases because of the extremely clean snow found at the South Pole.  The nitrogen isotopes give the thickness of the snow layer on top of the ice sheet over time, which in turn gives information about the temperature and snow accumulation rate over time.  The oxygen isotopes determine the age of the air, and assist in constructing the ice core gas chronology.  The thickness of the snow layer also apparently changes in the South Pole ice core due to variations in the surface slope over time, probably controlled by the flow of the ice sheet over bedrock bumps.  This feature is not normally seen in ice cores taken at domes, but South Pole is not on a dome, and so the ice actually has been flowing downhill throughout the time spanned by the core.  The variations in nitrogen isotopes correlate tightly with changes in snow accumulation rate inferred from the annual layer thickness, as expected.\n\nOther gases measured include the O2/N2 ratio and the Ar/N2 ratio, and the 40Ar/36Ar ratio.  The first two of these can be used to test the idea that diurnal variations in sunshine intensity are important contributors to the well-known tendency (seen in other ice cores) of O2/N2 to mirror long-term cycles in summer sunshine intensity (known as Milankovitch cycles) that have a period around 20,000 years.   South Pole has the unique property that it has no diurnal cycle in sunshine, because it is located on the Earth spin axis.  In other words, the sun stays at the same angle above the horizon at the South Pole, all through a 24-hour period.  So if diurnal variations were important to the Milankovitch-O2/N2 correlation, then we would expect this correlation to be absent at South Pole.  In fact, we do see it, quite clearly.  So we can reject the hypothesis that diurnal variations are important in creating the correlation.\n\nThe Ar/N2 also shows a clear correlation to Milankovitch sunshine, supporting the idea that the correlation has something to do with the fact that oxygen and argon have small molecular diameters, and therefore are able to leak through the ice lattice as the air bubbles are forming and pressurizing.  These correlations raise hopes that in the future, we may be able to use argon to correct oxygen for leakage out of the bubbles, and thereby reconstruct past oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/20/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeffrey P Severinghaus"
