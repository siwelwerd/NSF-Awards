 "awd_abstract_narration": "Computer models of wind flow around and across terrain are important for topics such as weather forecasting, wind energy, and air pollution.  Unfortunately, these models still struggle in complex terrain.  To address these problems, a group of US scientists is planning on joining an existing European wind energy study in order to collect a reference data set with a set of instruments that will provide unprecedented views of the flow over two parallel hills in Portugal.  This data set will likely be used in modeling studies for decades to come.  This award provides funding for the planning activities to enhance the US contribution to the campaign. \r\n\r\nThe Perdigao Field Experiment will take place in 2017 in Portugal, mainly funded by a consortium of European countries interested in wind energy resource planning.  The US component of the project would bring additional instrumentation and a more basic science focus on microscale meteorology in complex terrain.  The award that is being funded is considered a Scientific Planning Overview document and serves as the scientific basis for the campaign.  Individual science proposals will be reviewed separately.",

This project carried out preparatory work for the Perdigao campaign, which has been conceived as the largest of five field experiments under a European Union (EU) project aimed at developing a New European Wind Atlas (NEWA). The data of NEWA project support the development and/or refinement of microscale models to map wind fields for EU countries and their Exclusive Economic Zones. In 2013, a group of US investigators were invited to join and enhance the Perdigao campaign while complementing the NEWA science plans. This project (SPO) directly supported the US involvement in Perdigao, with Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL) of the&nbsp;National Center for Atmospheric Research being the hub of organizational activities.</p>\n<p>The intellectual merits of this SPO are the identification of key science gaps at microscales and development of&nbsp;instrument-deployment strategies to address them.&nbsp;Synergistic numerical simulations were also identified. The broader impacts are the fostering of partnerships between the US and NEWA participants by arranging site visits and meetings, travel to domestic and international planning meetings, US site visits of EU investigators as well as participation in an all-hands meeting held during May 10-13, 2016. The latter was convened in Vila Velha de Rodao, a town near Perdigao, and addressed a myriad of issues: instrument placement, power supply for campaign, site permits, logistics, operational details, data transmission and storage, antecedent numerical experiments, operational forecasts, data policies, community outreach, product dissemination and collaborations. These activities led to a well-organized and highly successful field campaign during May 01 - June 15, 2017, where more than 50 scientists, support staff, and graduate and undergraduate students from the EU and US participated in mapping meteorological fields at the Cobrao site in coordinated manner. Perdigao is the largest land-based field experiment that EOL has ever supported, and this project (SPO) was the cornerstone of it.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/10/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Harindra&nbsp;J&nbsp;Fernando</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1528451/1528451_10389116_1507647270548_IMG_2752--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1528451/1528451_10389116_1507647270548_IMG_2752--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Vale Cobr&atilde;o\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1528451/1528451_10389116_1507647270548_IMG_2752--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Vale Cobr&atilde;o\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Scientists and technical personnel are attempting to secure measurement sites for the Perdig\u00e3o campaign</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Laura Leo</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Harindra&nbsp;J&nbsp;Fernando</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Vale Cobr\u00e3o</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1528451/1528451_10389116_1507652672972_DSCN6051--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1528451/1528451_10389116_1507652672972_DSCN6051--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Meeting in Vila Velha de R&oacute;d&atilde;o\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1528451/1528451_10389116_1507652672972_DSCN6051--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Meeting in Vila Velha de R&oacute;d&atilde;o\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Commercial Advisor Ms. Laura Baker, Senior Commercial Advisor Pedro Ferreira and Deputy Ambassodor Mr. John Olson from the US Embassy in Lisbon participated in the Vila Velha de R\u00f3d\u00e3o meeting, May 10-13, 2016 (bottom row, counting from the middle to the right).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Laura Leo</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Harindra&nbsp;J&nbsp;Fernando</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Meeting in Vila Velha de R\u00f3d\u00e3o</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1528451/1528451_10389116_1507652847258_DSCN3558--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1528451/1528451_10389116_1507652847258_DSCN3558--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Scouting trips to the field site\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1528451/1528451_10389116_1507652847258_DSCN3558--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Scouting trips to the field site\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Discussing instrument siting strategies, September 4, 2014 field trip.
