 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for a programming-savvy workforce, the challenges encountered nation-wide in teaching programming skills, and the advent of massively open online courses (MOOCs) all stress the importance of revolutionizing existing technologies meant to support learning via unsupervised practice. The reliance on hand-designed learning experiences in Intelligent Tutoring Systems has created a bottleneck in the enhancement of such technologies. The significance and importance of this project will be the creation of a system that automatically provides programming practice problems via a tutoring system.  Parsons puzzles, which are the focus of this work, have already demonstrated improvement in programming skills.  This project will continue research on the effectiveness of Parsons puzzles and determine whether an evolutionary algorithm approach to creating Parsons puzzles is effective in producing the same or better learning outcomes.\r\n\r\nTo this end, this project will achieve two complementary goals. First, Interactive Evolutionary Algorithms will be used to autonomously design Parsons puzzles. These relatively new practice problems have already shown great promise in supporting the development of programming skills. By integrating Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development theory in the design of our fitness function, the pedagogical soundness of the evolved Parsons puzzles will be further enhanced. Second, recent breakthroughs in Co-evolutionary Algorithms will be leveraged to data-mine the underlying learners-problems interaction space. This will permit autonomous extraction of insights about the most informational interactions. Such information has the potential to provide new perspectives on the significance of both evolved and hand-designed Parsons puzzles, along with the order in which to guide students through these puzzles to ensure proper scaffolding. Quantitative and objective measures of differences in mean difficulty and number of attempts to solution will be used in comparing hand-designed Parsons puzzles and evolutionary algorithm created Pasons puzzles.",

As software tools and technology to help students learn programming concepts by working practice problems become more common, and as enrollment in computer science programs increases, it becomes increasingly important to understand how information is embedded in student-problem performance data and to leverage this understanding to create better, more response tools.\n\nOne key goal of the project was to explore how to leverage recent breakthroughs in dimension extraction in multiobjective and coevolutionary systems to address some of these challenges. This enabled us to find and isolate student performance patterns that are most distinct from one another and identify the critical and informative underlying concept objectives that most distinguish student performance. They also enabled comparing these results to our a priori understanding of where critical learning challenges exist when learning programming.\n\nIn regular consultation with our collaborators at Ramapo College and the University of Southern Florida, we refined our python-based analytical toolkit for applying dimension extraction to student-problem data and cross-validated the results with those of an independent consultant (Anthony Bucci, the originator of DECA).  Throughput the award, we conducted a number of different types of analyses:\n\nAnalysis and identification of, informatively hard problems in a variety of contexts.  That is, determination of problems within a data set that are both difficult and provide discriminating power between students.  This activity was conducted throughout both years and resulted in two conference publications and a submission to a journal (see below).\nThe design of several critical validation methods to verify the stability and consistency of the implemented approach.  This activity was conducted primarily in the second year and is included in the afore-mentioned submitted journal article (see below).\nPreliminary analysis and identification of the concepts embedded with a problem set.  This activity was conducted in the first year and resulted in one publication (see below).\nSketching of methods for extending dimension extraction to student-problem outcomes that are non-Binary (numerical scores, probabilities, or complex data structures such as sequencing within a student?s response).\nConsultation on DECA and coevolutionary systems for the USF group?s integration attempts with the described intelligent tutoring systems.  This contribution was conducted primarily during the second year and has resulted in two conference publications and a journal paper currently in preparation (see below).\n\n\nThroughout the project, we have been able to collaborate extensively with the original author of the Dimension Extraction Coevolutionary Algorithm (Anthony Bucci), who has been a coauthor on all papers.\n\nOur project has confirmed that we can apply the dimension extraction methods from the coevolutionary computation field to analyze student-problem performance to obtain useful and insightful results.  We?ve been able to provide new perspectives on the informativeness  of problems, assessment of problem difficulty, as well as begin to construct methods that can automatically learn and structure underlying concepts within a problem set.   We have also provided several mechanisms for helping to validate such approaches, including the notion of using rank correlation among bootstrapped subsets of the data to determine how internally consistent an approach might be (how sensitive to certain types of variability in the data), as well as how generalizable an approach is from semester to semester.  These (and other) verification studies have shown dimension extraction to be very consistent and generalizable, but also the methodology itself may be applicable to other student-problem analysis approaches.  Additionally, we have helped the USF team verify that the methods can be effectively integrated into an adaptive problem generation mechanism within an intelligent tutoring system.\n\nResults were disseminated via publications and presentations in the ACM SIGCSE, FLAIRS, and ICTAI conferences.  Additionally, we have a pending submission to the ACM Transactions of Computing Education journal, as well as another journal article in preparation for IEEE Learning Technologies. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rudolf P Wiegand"
