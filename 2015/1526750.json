 "awd_abstract_narration": "Handheld devices such as cell phones, tablets and wearables, are gaining\r\nrapid adoption in a ubiquitous world. Correspondingly, there is an\r\nexplosion of very demanding and interactive applications such as media\r\nstreaming, interactive games, video conferencing and social networking,\r\nthat users are deploying on such devices. Despite tremendous\r\nimprovements in the energy efficiencies of individual components found\r\nin these devices, piece-meal optimizations of hardware components are\r\ninadequate to accommodate the demanding needs of these applications that\r\nemploy multiple CPU cores, accelerators, memory systems, system\r\nperipherals and sensors, concurrently in very sophisticated ways.  Lack\r\nof coordination among system resources leads to low resource utilization\r\nand poor system-level energy efficiencies when running such\r\napplications. Rather than throw more hardware at this problem, this\r\nproject proposes VIADUCT, which allocates and orchestrates system-level\r\nresources to boost parallelism and resource utilization for these\r\nplatforms in a more energy-efficient fashion.\r\n\r\nRecognizing that many of these applications periodically process frames\r\nof data that need to flow in a pipelined manner through several hardware\r\ncomponents within soft real-time bounds, VIADUCT creates a virtual\r\nchannel per flow of such frames in an application. The channel holds\r\nresources allocated across all the hardware components, with runtime\r\ncoordination to ensure seamless frame movements without the conventional\r\ninterface inefficiencies across the components. Fine-grain scheduling\r\nand resource management leverages knowledge of high level semantics to\r\nprovide Quality-of-Service (QoS) for each flow in the most\r\nenergy-efficient fashion. The specific research contributions are in\r\nhardware interfaces, mechanisms and policies to chain the hardware\r\ncomponents for creating a virtual channel for a flow, architecting the\r\nmemory system as an efficient conduit to sustain this flow, and\r\ndesigning the system to sustain several concurrent flows. The project\r\naims to provide a holistic evaluation testbed for such platforms amongst\r\nthe broader research community, and also aims to involve\r\nunder-represented groups in the research and enhance Penn State?s\r\ncurriculum in related topics.",
