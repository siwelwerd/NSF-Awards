Some of these questions include: How do topography and vegetation jointly influence runoff generation in headwater catchments?  What are key coupling points between water and carbon cycles in complex landscapes? and What factors determine the vulnerability of freshwater-dominated coastal ecosystems to surface water salinization?  \r\n\r\nThe technician will contribute to ongoing efforts to mentor students through participation in research and to broaden participation among groups underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and will directly support an early career Native American geoscientist. \r\n\r\n***",

Earth Science's Instrumentation and Facilities program.&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of the award was to support a field-based research program in ecohydrology and watershed science.&nbsp;&nbsp;The technician's duties included managing field instrumentation, collecting and processing samples, performing laboratory activities, and managing datasets associated with a diverse set of projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a national search, the investigator hired a recent graduate from an M.S. program in Geological Sciences.&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the position was funded by NSF for three years, the investigator leveraged additional funding to employ the technician for a total of four years.</p>\n<p>The technician worked on a diverse range of research projects with the principal investigator, including an NSF Coastal Science, Engineering, and Education for Sustainability (SEES) project on saltwater intrusion, two forest hydrology projects in the southern Appalachian Mountains, water quality studies on flood-impacted landscapes, and a watershed study in Honduras.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to working directly with the principal investigator, the technician worked directly with two postdoctoral associates, five graduate students, and eight undergraduate students on research projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;To date, the technician's efforts have supported five peer-reviewed journal articles, one Ph.D. dissertation, two Master's theses, and 18 conference presentations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional products are in preparation or in review.</p>\n<p>Besides research, the technician supported several of the investigator's education efforts, including developing and teaching a module on saltwater intrusion for the university's new First Year Environmental Program and developing and leading a week-long activity for the university's engineering summer camp on water quality sensor development.&nbsp;&nbsp;The technician also participated in the investigator's outreach to American Indian tribes, giving laboratory tours and demonstrations to visiting students from tribal communities and attended meetings with tribal leaders and elders.&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the technician interacted with approximately 100 undergraduate students, 100 K-12 students, and several American Indian community members.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, the technician amplified the intellectual and societal impact of the principal investigator's work.&nbsp;&nbsp;By managing day-to-day activities associated with field sites, laboratory work, and data management, the investigator and trainees were able to focus on analysis and interpretation of results for projects based in North Carolina and Honduras.&nbsp;&nbsp;The technician's efforts also allowed the investigator to focus on scholarship associated with broader impacts in the areas of environmental policy, science communication, and implications of climate change for Indigenous peoples.&nbsp;&nbsp;In sum, the technician contributed to new scholarship
