 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) is the annual conference of the information theory society, and has been held continuously since 1954. It covers a variety of topics related to the studies on information theory, including coding, communications and communication networks, complexity and cryptography, detection and estimation, learning, Shannon Theory, stochastic processes, and emerging applications of information theory. It is considered one of the premier IEEE conferences. ISIT has also traditionally attracted a large number of students, comprising around 40 percent of the participant population. ISIT is an excellent learning opportunity for students as well as a means to establish useful research collaborations for the future. Providing some support for student in the US to travel to ISIT, especially given the long distance they need to travel to ISIT 2015, will be crucial to ensuring a vibrant student participation.\r\n\r\nThis project therefore provides student travel support for the 2015 ISIT meeting.",
