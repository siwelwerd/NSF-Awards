 "awd_abstract_narration": "Demand for nitrogen fertilizers is increasing in response to growing human population, improving diets, and expanding biofuel crop production.  Unfortunately, only about half of the applied nitrogen is used by crops, and the rest is unintentionally released to groundwater, rivers, and to the air, where it presents problems for human health and ecosystem health.  Burning fossil fuels for industry and transportation also releases nitrogen into the air, which falls on soils and water bodies.  The objective of this research coordination network is to engage a community of researchers from many disciplines, including atmospheric chemistry, agronomy, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, social science, and human and wildlife health, who individually study aspects of this issue, but whose collective, inter-disciplinary synthesis is needed to define integrative potential solutions.  A series of workshops will be convened on topics such as impacts of excess nitrogen on climate, air pollution, water pollution, and agricultural production.\r\n\r\nFraming the scientific issues of excess nitrogen in the environment in a context relevant to human and ecosystem health will increase understanding for both scientific and non-scientific audiences of the extent of the health and pollution problems associated with excess nitrogen, as well as options and trade-offs for finding solutions.",

The use of synthetic fertilizers has skyrocketed since WWII, enabling tremendous increases in crop yield, but also resulting of losses of excess fertilizer nitrogen into the air and into waterways. While we are, on average, better nourished than at any time in human history, the accompanying unintended consequences include significant air and water pollution, human respiratory health problems, climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and biodiversity loss. Scientists have studied these environmental and human health impacts since the 1970s, making incremental progress in drawing the attention of policy makers from numerous sectors, including energy, industry, agriculture, environment, and health. However, the nitrogen issue is a classic &ldquo;wicked problem&rdquo; because it cuts across government ministries, economic sectors, academic disciplines, and diverse stakeholder interests. There is no single silver bullet as a solution. Documenting stocks and flows of nitrogen in agriculture and in the environment, while essential, is not enough for policy makers to see the need for action or for civil society to develop innovative approaches to sustainable solutions.</p>\n<p>The objective of this Research Coordination Network (RCN) on Reactive Nitrogen in the Environment was to facilitate a community of researchers and practitioners from a wide range of disciplines to exchange information and knowledge, thus fostering the creative science and synthesis needed to search for well-informed and integrative mitigation strategies. A parallel objective was to promote the communication of this science and synthesis to a broad audience of scientists and nonscientists. Since its inception in 2011, this RCN convened seven major workshops on diverse topics related to nitrogen in the environment. Each workshop was interdisciplinary, gathering together individuals who, despite their common interests in some aspect of nitrogen in the environment, would not likely have had reason to meet or work together had it not been for our workshops.</p>\n<p>Care was taken to include early career scientists and students in each workshop, so that the next generation will be experienced to carry on this work. Gender representation was also a criterion, both among workshop participants as a whole and also among those with speaking and leadership roles.</p>\n<p>This RCN project contributed to advancing the search for sustainable solutions to the challenges of managing nitrogen wisely for producing abundant and nutritious food while minimizing unintended consequences of environmental pollution and human disease. By contributing to the US National Climate Assessment (2011 workshop product), integrating epidemiology with environmental science to relate air and water pollution exposures to human health risks (the focus of our 2012 workshop), partnering with the agronomic community and the fertilizer industry to create a consensus statement about improving the efficiency of fertilizer use (2013 workshop product), linking nitrogen in air pollution with economic and non-economic values of ecosystem services (2015 workshop products),&nbsp;publishing an overview for environmental studies students (2016 World Cafe product), organizing a trans-boundary regional project of multiple agriculture and non-agriculture stakeholders in Washington state and British Columbia (2016 workshop outcome), and assembling data experts from around the world to address inconsistencies in the data we use to evaluate nitrogen losses from agriculture (the focus of the 2017 workshop), we assembled the kinds of partnerships among diverse disciplines and stakeholder groups needed to address this wicked problem from multiple perspectives, with rigorous scientific investigation, and with cross-disciplinary communication and collaboration.&nbsp;The project&rsquo;s results on wide ranging topics of nitrogen in the environment were published in scientific journals, summarized in brochures for policy makers and overview papers for students, and presented at stakeholder meetings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/09/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
