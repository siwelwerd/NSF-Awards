 "awd_abstract_narration": "Catalysis is a hidden but high impact science at the heart of the energy, chemical and environmental industries.  Catalysts are perhaps best known in automobile catalytic converters, but the same types of catalytic processes are responsible for commodity chemicals such as gasoline, textiles, and fertilizer and specialty chemicals such as pharmaceuticals.  It has been estimated that catalysis accounts for over 95% (by volume) of all products and over 80% of added value in the chemical industry.  About one third of the world?s economy depends directly or indirectly on catalysis.  In spite of their immense importance, the development of new heterogeneous catalysts is still largely empirical, which is to say, time-consuming and expensive, particularly at the stage of synthesis.  A grand challenge of catalysis is precisely the ?design and controlled synthesis of catalytic structures.? Our fundamental research in transforming catalyst synthesis from an art to a science will save tremendous amounts of time and energy in the development of new catalysts for petroleum, chemical and pharmaceutical companies as well as catalyst manufacturers.  Optimized catalysts allow chemical conversions to be achieved in the most efficient, economical, and environmentally responsible manner, reducing raw material usage, energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions.\r\nThe Center for Rational Catalyst Synthesis (CeRCaS) will be the world?s first and only research center with the focus on understanding the chemical fundamentals of catalyst synthesis. CeRCaS will bring to bear powerful, complementary expertise at the University of South Carolina and Virginia Commonwealth University. The research projects which our industrial partners will help us select and refine are in three thrusts, first, The Fundamentals of Metal Deposition including in-situ observation of metal deposition mechanisms and a variety of methods for nanoparticle genesis, second, Thermodynamics and Kinetics of Solid-Solid Bonding, to be explored with theory and experiment to allow prediction of the wetting or sintering of metal oxides on support surfaces, and prediction of the size, shape and, in the case of bimetallics, composition of supported nanoparticles, and third, Precision Site Synthesis for Specific Reactions, in which nanoparticles will be synthesized with specific size, content (single or multi-metals) and morphology and so be optimized for particular catalytic reactions or to minimize the content of expensive precious metals.  Graduate students will be mentored with the practical mindset akin to an NSF Engineering Research Center.  This industrial bent will stem from two sources; first, internally, from VCU?s site Director (Gupton) and USC?s Deputy Director (Monnier) who hail from distinguished research careers in industry, and second, externally, from direct involvement of industrial research in individual research projects.  Educational outreach will include the recruitment and eventual industrial placement of underrepresented groups.  Both Universities have significant pools of women and minorities with whom to work.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Heterogeneous catalysts are used in the production of commodity and specialty chemicals, in environmental cleanup and clean energy, and in the production of active pharmaceutical ingredients.  Typical catalysts consist of small (1-10 nanometer) metal or metal oxide nanoparticles anchored in place on porous, thermally stable supports such as aluminum oxide, silicon oxide, or carbon.  Catalyst preparation is not well understood, making the development of new catalysts slow, laborious, and expensive.  The Center for Rational Catalyst Synthesis (CeRCaS) conducts research on the chemical fundamentals of the synthesis of heterogeneous catalysts in efforts to make the \"art\" of catalyst preparation into a science.    At the granting of its Phase II renewal in 2019, CeRCaS is poised to grow yet more, adding a third (joint) site of UC Berkeley/UC Davis, with fourteen members and well over $600,000 in yearly funding.\n\n The five years of Phase I of CeRCaS saw a center which started small and grew to twelve industrial members and $400,000 of funding in Year 5.  With an aggregate of $1.4 million in research dollars, CeRCaS faculty produced 43 publications (at a very healthy rate of 1 paper per $33,000), 45 presentations at national and international technical conferences, and 7 provisional and granted patents.  An example of a CeRCaS research highlight is shown in Figure 1.  A wide variety of silicon oxide-supported nanoparticles consisting of two metals (bimetallic nanoparticles) have been produced with highly desirable properties of extremely small size (about 1 nm) and very thorough alloying of the two metals.  The simple method developed for this previously impossible synthesis means that the fundamental work being done in CeRCaS can have high practical impact at companies looking to synthesize supported bimetallic catalysts. \n\n CeRCaS was twice featured in the \"Catalyzing Commercialization\" section of Chemical and Engineering Progress, the magazine of the American Institute of Chemical Engineering (see Figure 2).  The first article appeared in the January 2018 issue and described our work on the development of palladium/carbon catalysts for use in the pharmaceutical industry (of the type now being used to produce COVID-fighting drugs), and the second in April 2019 for our new, simple ways to make bimetallic catalysts for methanol fuel cells.  A general highlight of our center is the state-of-the-art instrumentation on hand to perform the detailed characterization of nanomaterials.  For example, in addition to the aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscope used to make the atomically-resolved images of nanoparticles seen in Figure 1, we have a high sensitivity in-situ x-ray diffractometer which permits the observing of previously undetectable 1 nm nanoparticles.  Data from a series of platinum nanoparticles supported on different carbon supports is shown in Figure 3 and allowed us to verify that adding nitrogen to the carbon support greatly stabilized the 1 nm Pt particles to oxidation.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bernard F Gupton"
