 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cells are the basis of our whole bodies, and also communicate with each other.  Therefore, cells contain many lessons about populations, change, and adaptations.  Developing an artificial cell product that gains entrance into the classrooms of students will benefit their learning and provide expanded choices of teaching tools.  More advance artificial cell platforms may impact applied and basic research sectors by also providing expanded choices for looking at dynamic processes. This project aims to commercialize artificial (manufactured) cells and cell platforms for educational, research, and industry needs.  The technology will include the use of 3D printers to make these artificial cells, since these printers are becoming increasingly available and cost-effective for construction purposes.  The technology developed in this project will be paired with educational and visualization software so that the artificial cells will provide hands-on experiments and testing to students, assisted by the software learning tools.  Due to the complex nature and cost of living cells, this artificial cell technology is needed to cost-effectively teach students the dynamics of cellular processes and at the same time let them carry out experiments and test ideas.  \r\n\r\nThe technological components of this project will utilize 3D printers to make artificial cells that are hollow and structured to allow for visualization and testing of the dynamic processes of cells in aqueous environments.  Plastics will be the initial materials base, since they can be 3D printed, but other materials will also be incorporated into the platforms such as dyes and chemicals that will define the dynamic processes.  The artificial cell kits will also include instructional and experimental software based on \"predator-prey\" and other dynamic processes that will guide experimentation and testing.  Constructed artificial cells will be generated initially that are large enough to be held and visualized with digital cameras without the need of microscopes.  Future generations of artificial cells will include dynamic processes for more advanced testing to include fluorescence- and microscopy- based measurements.  Ultimately a technology \"library\" of artificial cells and cell components is envisioned for learning and research tools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project utilized the knowledge of cellular dynamics combined with emerging 3-dimensional (3D) printing technology and customer feedback to generate hand-held artificial cells that may be used for educational and research purposes.  As part of this I-Corps project, the three members of the research team were comprised of Principal Investigator (PI), Entrepreneurial Lead, and Mentor.  Each contributed to interviewing over 100 potential customers who might be interested in applications involving artificial cells that could be generated using 3D printers.  The project team learned from interviews, and \"getting out of the lab\", that finances often constrain what can be used in the classroom for educational tools.  However, 3D printing is quickly advancing into these classrooms, especially as the technology becomes more feasible in school budgets.  From our interviewed potential customers our artificial cells \"evolved\", and as we went through multiple generations, we ended our project with an artificial cell that was hollow in structure, covered by an artificial membrane, and could float in water and be moved by an external magnetic source.  The cells were large enough to be held in the hand, and thus could be imaged and tracked with accessible video devices such as smart phone technology.  The broader impacts of this project included professional training of all members of the team, increasing business translation and commercialization awareness for all, and increased training in public speaking for the Entrepreneurial Lead, who is a doctoral student in the PI\u00c6s lab.  Additionally, intra- and inter-state connections were made and strengthened by team members that may promote future collaborations and commercialization ideas.  The 3D-printing culture established as part of the PI\u00c6s lab during this project has translated into new research funding that includes support for undergraduate research.  Two videos were generated from the project:  1) \"Lessons learned\" from the I-Corps experience, and 2)  a \"Technical video\" of the project.  The videos are currently available on YouTube at: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIMgbYGBAnM      and at:     \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9a_XdWLqLc\n\nrespectively.  The Lessons learned video introduces the project team and shares business practices and commercialization considerations gained by the team over the course of the project period.  The technical video provides our inspiration for developing the artificial cell and shares freely available simulation software that the PI\u00c6s research group continues to use to model and visualize cellular dynamics in brain cells. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/12/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark A Decoster"
