The NAMS annual meeting is one of the preeminent global membrane meetings. The latest developments in the membrane field from leading academic, governmental, and industrial research labs are presented for the first time for evaluation by the membrane community. The organizers anticipate a total of approximately 400 membrane researchers from all over the world representing industry, government, and academia. \r\n\r\nThe requested funding will provide partial support for student participation in the 2015 NAMS Conference. NAMS meetings provide a unique opportunity for students to share their accomplishments with peers and more senior members of the community. The feedback they receive can help direct their work and provide encouragement.",
