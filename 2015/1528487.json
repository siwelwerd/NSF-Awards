Our project investigated an important aspect of this puzzle: specifically, how partisan media contribute to attitude polarization among different groups of media consumers. To answer this question, we developed and implemented a new statistical procedure -- which we call a Preference-Incorporating Choice and Assignment (PICA) design -- that builds on the patient preference trial framework -- where participants&rsquo; preferences over treatment options are incorporated in the study design -- which is commonly employed in medical research. This experimental design used both a forced-choice and a free-choice scenario. In the first, participants were assigned to a media treatment that either supported or conflicted with their self-reported partisan preferences, or to a non-political entertainment video. In the second, participants were allowed to choose which of the three media treatments to consume (pro-attitudinal, counter-attitudinal, or entertainment).</p>\n<p>Using this procedure allowed for estimation of the degree of selective exposure (that is, participants choosing content that reinforces their preexisting partisan preferences), the degree of polarization caused by exposure to like-minded media, and the degree of persuasion across the partisan aisle due to exposure to counter-attitudinal media.
