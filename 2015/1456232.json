 "awd_abstract_narration": "The basin of the Tapajos River in the Brazilian Amazon Rain Forest is a region of exceptionally high biodiversity and pressing ecosystem threats, including some of the highest deforestation rates in the Amazon. The plant communities of the region are very poorly known, and many large areas within the basin have been little studied by botanists. This paucity of botanical information about the region impedes critical research on the past, present, and future of Amazonian plant diversity. This project will compile inventories of the plants of two protected areas in the region that are critical for the study and management of biodiversity. The primary goal is to produce an interactive open-access, web-based conspectus guide to the plants of the two areas. Project data will be shared with the global research community and Brazilian governmental agencies so that the plant resources and natural ecosystems contained within the two areas might be more effectively studied, protected, and managed. Beyond its basic scientific value, the project will advance scientific collaboration between the US and Brazil by sponsoring inter-institutional research travel by project personnel and by providing training opportunities for American and Brazilian students.\r\n\r\nThis project will produce comprehensive inventories of the vascular plants of Tapajos National Forest and Amazonia National Park. These will be the first such inventories for any comparably sized areas in southeast Amazonia. The project will combine a synthesis of existing data with intensive collecting of herbarium specimens and tissue samples for DNA-based studies. General collecting and plot-based inventory approaches will be implemented to maximize species recovery. Identification of specimens will rely on traditional morphologically based approaches, as well as DNA barcoding. The two inventories will constitute critical datasets for comparison with previously documented Amazonian floras. Project data will be useful for testing hypotheses about the distribution of Amazonian plant diversity and will contribute toward efforts to model projected floristic change. It is highly probable that the research will extend the known limits of plant distributions and will result in the discovery of significant new taxonomic diversity. A web-based conspectus flora will be supported by state-of-the-art informatics technologies and will make project data and other resources broadly available for diverse areas of research that require the accurate identification of plant species. Project data will also be shared with a wide range of international biodiversity data portals and related applications.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The Amazon Forest is the largest and most biodiverse expanse of tropical rainforest on earth. It harbors about 15 percent of the word&rsquo;s plant species, yet it continues to be one of the most botanically underexplored places. Although much of the Amazon Forest is still intact wilderness, large parts of it are approaching an ecological tipping point where increasing drought brought about by the combined effects of climate change, deforestation, unsustainable development, and wildfire are projected to cause widespread conversion of forests to degraded savannas. Some of the highest levels of ongoing habitat degradation occur precisely within regions such as southeastern Amazonia that are among the most botanically understudied and unexplored. Thus, it is highly probable that a significant fraction of the Amazon&rsquo;s plant diversity will be lost before basic steps have been taken to catalogue and study it. With generous support from the NSF, we embarked on a multi-year study of the flora of two critically important protected areas in the southeastern Brazilian Amazon. Located along the banks of the Tapajo&#769;s River, one of the largest tributaries of the Amazon River, Tapajos National Forest (TNF) and Amazonia National Park (ANP) are two of the oldest protected areas in the Brazilian Amazon and cover a combined area of 16,400 square kilometers. While ANP is strictly protected, TNF is managed for a variety of uses and is pointed to as a model for sustainable timber harvest. A substantial amount of research has been conducted in both areas, mostly notably by the Large Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment (LBA) which has been active in TNF for over two decades, but comprehensive inventories of the plants of the two areas were lacking. The primary goal of the project was to produce an online specimen catalogue and checklist of the vascular plants of TNF and ANP. Other objectives were to contribute to area management and conservation, provide specimens and data on local plant diversity for other kinds of scientific research, foster international collaboration, and expand botanical research capacity and public appreciation of the Amazon Forest for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services. The project was led by scientists at the New York Botanical Garden (NYBG), the Botanical Garden of Rio de Janeiro, and the Federal University of Western Para, in collaboration with the Brazilian governmental agencies that administer ANP and TNF. Five project expeditions were undertaken at the study sites, each supported by diverse teams of scientists, students and administrative personnel. Approximately 25 undergraduate and graduate students were involved in project fieldwork. Over 4000 project collections (16,000 specimen duplicates, including herbarium specimens, pickled material, DNA tissue samples, etc.) and 10,000 images of specimens (field images and high-resolution specimen scans) and habitats were generated by the project, while a DNA barcode library (to aid species identification) was compiled for 300 common species of woody plants. Quantitative plant inventory data collected by the project from a series of ecological transects in upland forests will contribute to ongoing research on spatial patterns of species abundance and floristic composition. Project data are increasingly available through online public data repositories, and duplicates of the collections have been distributed to the collaborating institutions in the United States, Brazil, and elsewhere. The collections fill important sampling gaps in NYBG&rsquo;s Amazonian holdings, which are among the most comprehensive anywhere. While identification of collections is ongoing, the project has already registered over 1600 species of vascular plants in the two study areas. Many of the collections represent significant extensions of the known distributions of plant species, including many new state records and several species new to science. Continually updated specimen catalogues and checklists of the floras of the two areas are available online (http://sweetgum.nybg.org/science/projects/tapajos), and are also being formatted for publication in the scientific literature. These data also underpin an in-prep conservation-focused report about the flora to be delivered to the administrators of ANP and TNF and other stakeholders. To date, five published or submitted scientific papers on the systematics, evolution and/or diversity of Amazonian plants have been based on or benefitted from project-sponsored activities and collections. The project advanced the professional development of two early-career professionals, who worked as project assistants employed at NYBG. It also provided research training and opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students in the United States and Brazil, including three research internships funded by the project and based at NYBG, two of which have already resulted in student-authored publications. Public outreach and educational activities have included an ongoing public exhibit about project research and Amazonian plant diversity at NYBG, a Climate Week public lecture about the impacts of climate change, deforestation and wildfire in the project region, several online blogs highlighting project activities and findings, and informational booths given as part of Earth Day public programming at NYBG.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Benjamin&nbsp;M&nbsp;Torke</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
