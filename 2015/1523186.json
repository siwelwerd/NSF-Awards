 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Hugh R Sharp, a 146 foot Regional research vessel operated as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. \r\n\r\nThe R/V Hugh R Sharp is a state-of-the-art, coastal research vessel that is owned and operated by the University of Delaware. The vessel can carry fourteen to twenty scientists on cruises up to eighteen days in duration, and supports projects from all disciplines of oceanography. The vessel is a regional asset, serving researchers from many institutions throughout the mid-Atlantic. The vessel typically operates in the coastal waters from Long Island, New York, to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, as well as the Delaware and Chesapeake Bays. Projects occasionally require the vessel to work as far north as the Gulf of Maine, as far south as Florida, and as far offshore as Bermuda. In 2014, the R/V Hugh R Sharp completed 193 days at sea. NSF funded projects accounted for 25% of the total sailing schedule (49 days). In 2015, R/V Hugh R Sharp is scheduled for 200 days with NSF days accounting for 17% (354 days) of the total sailing schedule.\r\n\r\nShipboard Scientific Support Equipment requested in this proposal includes:\r\n\r\n1)\tGyro Compass\t$27,000\r\n2)\tAcoustic Speed Indicator\t$7,552\r\n\t\t\t\t$34,552\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\t\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project provided funding to enhance the reliability and capability of the R/V HUGH R SHARP to support research operations at sea.  Funding was utilized to purchase and install a state of the art gyrocompass and a doppler speed log.\n\nThe ship's dynamic positioning (DP) system requires Gyrocompass input for station keeping and precision navigation operations.  A failure of Sharp\u00c6s primary gyro system could potentially disrupt days or weeks of scheduled projects, significantly impacting planned science.  Lead time for replacement parts and new systems runs from weeks to months.  Redundancy in systems supporting the ship\u00c6s DP capability is critical for mission continuity reliability.  The new gyrocompass will require minimal maintenance and should be operational for the remainder of the ship\u00c6s service life.\n\nThe R/V HUGH R SHARP has been utilizing a small paddle wheel type speed indicator to determine ship speed through the water. This data is extremely important during all towed instrument operations.\n\nThe new doppler speed log utilizes ultrasonic sensing in order to determine speed through the water. The sensor has two transducers in a single housing. Small particles present in the water pass through this beam. Sonic pulses compare the time between the two transducers to determine speed.\n\nUnlike an electromagnetic speed log or other type, this equipment does not require a sensor protruding through the ship hull; this greatly reduces the routine maintenance. Another special feature is the capability to measure own ship speeds at dead slow movement with high accuracy. \n\nIntellectual Merit:   The equipment funded by this award will help support scientific operations and data collection in the mid-Atlantic region.  The intellectual merit of these individual projects is determined by peer review at NSF.  The scientific questions posed must be meritorious enough to warrant funding by NSF.  \n\nBroader Impacts:  The number of missions supported by the HUGH R SHARP typically exceeds twenty per year, with 180-210 days at sea.  The R/V Hugh R. Sharp is truly a shared-use science support facility.  Funding for the science support equipment will help provide the research community with the most reliable, modern and capable platform possible.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/19/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jon Swallow"
