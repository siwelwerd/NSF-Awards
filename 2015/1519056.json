 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although Hispanics and Blacks make up 17% and 13% of the U.S. population, members of these groups comprised only 9% and 7% of medical school enrollees in 2013, respectively. While a portion of this trend can be attributed to recent declines in affirmative action programs across a number of states, it has also been suggested that the potential pool of minority applicants is diminished due to academic and interpersonal experiences on college campuses that ultimately discourage these students from pursuing careers in medicine. This study interrogates how cumulative changes in social resources (social support, social networks, and network-related material resources) at both the interpersonal and institutional level influence students' experiences of psychological distress and burnout, and contribute to racial and ethnic disparities in premedical attrition.  \r\n\r\nExisting research on the trajectories of premedical students of color has relied on cross-sectional survey data and institutional records limited to cursory information on students' sociodemographic characteristics, SAT scores, and grades in required coursework. Despite the utility of this information for examining academic trajectories, these data are insufficient for understanding how interpersonal and social structural factors contribute to leaks in the premedical pipeline. In order to identify where this drop off occurs and why it happens, the proposed research addresses previous methodological constraints by employing a longitudinal survey design, in tandem with in-depth interviews, to create a fuller understanding of the dynamic and complex social processes that shape premedical retention. This research holds the promise of addressing inequities in educational opportunities that pose serious consequences for projected healthcare shortages in the United States. Given the consistent finding that underrepresented minority group members who go on to medical school are significantly more likely than their peers to practice in underserved inner-city areas, these educational disparities have direct consequences for projected shortages in medical care.",
