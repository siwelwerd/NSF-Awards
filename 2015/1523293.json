 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Charles S. Stanish, of the University of California at Los Angeles, and Dr. Kelly J. Knudson, of Arizona State University, along with colleagues in Peru and the United States, will undertake research to study the development of complex societies and to investigate the role of ritual feasting events in the development and expansion of complex societies. Understanding how complex groups emerge is an enduring anthropological question, both in past and present societies. It is also relevant in a 21st Century context in which boundaries and the very existence of multiple state societies are in flux. In addition to its scholarly merits, the broader impacts of this project include 1) social and economic impacts in the El Carmen region of Peru, 2) contributions to the education and research infrastructure in North and South America, and 3) the creation of a more diverse and inclusive scientific community through educational and training opportunities for students in the United States and Peru.\r\nDrs. Stanish and Knudson and their research team will examine the role of ritual feasting events in political development and expansion. The research will be conducted in the Chincha Valley of Peru, where a complex polity called Paracas flourished around 800-200 BCE. The researchers will excavate an archaeological site in southern Peru, a sunken court complex that was likely built to host visitors from distant areas. They will then use techniques from chemistry and geology to determine the origins of the humans buried in the sunken courts and in the objects, such as plant and animal remains, found there. By determining the geologic origins of the human and animal remains found in the sunken court archaeological sites, the researchers will test the hypothesis that major feasting events were used in the past to integrate different communities and were a vital part of the development of sociopolitical complexity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research identified a large sample of organic remains from an archaeological context in the south coast of Peru. We analyzed strontium ratios in these objects.  The technical results are described in the collaborative report # 10376752. \n\nThis research demonstrated that 90% of the objects and humans interred in this 2300-year-old area were obtained from the coastal area in the same ecological and cultural zone in which this site was founded.  These data therefore describe the demographic catchment from which these objects were obtained.  The results indicate that there was little interaction with highland areas during this time. These results are surprising and support the hypothesis that there was minimal interaction with highland groups in the 1st millennium BC in this region. Prior results in highland areas indicate that the demographic catchment in similar architectural contexts was wider incorporating at least two major ecological zones.\n\nThe research contributes to our understanding of how we humans developed complex and enduring economic relationships in the absence of hierarchical states.  It likewise defines the political structure in such contexts indicating that complex economies can exist with minimal political hierarchies and organization.  The data also contribute to our understanding of human migratory patterns and landscape utilization.\n\nThe technique used in this study--87Sr/86Sr relative abundance ratios&mdash;is also used in modern agronomy to track food and animal products across landscapes and borders.  Modern base level measurements of 87Sr/86Sr have been substantially complicated by fertilizer, pollution, and processed animal feed use.  The measurement of preindustrial 87Sr/86Sr in animal and human proxies provides superb baseline measurements for any modern strontium analysis of agricultural products.   These are data that can only be obtained by systematic archaeological research.  As such, the research reported here contributes to a growing database of local 87Sr/86Sr relative abundance ratios that have wide application in ecology and agronomy as well as archaeological and paleo-demographic research. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles S Stanish"
