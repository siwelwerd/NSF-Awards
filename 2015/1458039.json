With funding from the National Science Foundation, the Forum brings together leaders from private sector, sponsors of basic, biomedical and clinical research, federal agencies, foundations, the academic community, and consumers.  Through its regular meetings and public workshops, the Forum provides a venue where its members, other leaders from the neurosciences and related disciplines, and members of the public can have important discussions about issues of mutual interest. The Forum has undertaken a broad set of initiatives, including meetings on data sharing, the BRAIN initiative, and neuroscience workforce development.  The Forum on Neuroscience and Nervous System Disorders focuses on building partnerships and enabling interdisciplinary large-scale research between the basic and applied sciences, which will be necessary to understand the brain and nervous system.",
