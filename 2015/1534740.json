 "awd_abstract_narration": "This SBIR Phase II project is developing a novel software platform for conducting analogous search that moves beyond keyword search to support innovation in the fields of science, engineering, and legal. Our patent pending technology is based on the observation that as high as 90% of new innovations are really adaptations of existing solutions.  The challenge addressed by this research is how to find these adaptable, existing solutions that are spread across many different fields of study and are described using vastly different jargon. These efforts will greatly increase the discovery of new, innovative solutions to a myriad of engineering problems. The end result will be many new inventions that could greatly improve Americans? lives in unforeseen ways, the potential to produce new jobs and tax revenues. These efforts also will benefit Intellectual Property attorneys to help protect these new inventions in all fields of science and engineering. This project supports the National Science Foundation's mission to support all fundamental fields of science and engineering. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will further develop Analogy Finder, a novel software platform for conducting analogous search to enhance innovation. The technology is based on the observation that as much as 90% of new innovations are really adaptations of existing solutions. The technology enables engineers and scientists to move beyond keyword (literal) search to analogous (semantic) search to find relevant, adaptable solutions from other disciplines. Analogous search relies on the grammatical verb noun-phrase form, which describes the essential function needed to solve the problem (e.g., reduce concussions). This grammatical form is then transformed into a set of related search phrases using synonyms, key semantic connections, and a proprietary taxonomy. The resulting search output contains more relevant, adaptable solutions to the problem at hand when compared to keyword search. The objectives and methods to be used include: incorporate a unique problem visualization process; add more data sources to Analogy Finder's search capabilities; enable Analogy Finder to search based on multiple verb noun-phrase combinations; develop new ways to organize and prioritize results; and begin identifying metrics to compare Analogy Finder's results with other search engines.",

The NSF SBIR Phase II grant made possible the implementation of the techniques in this book into a software platform that helps individuals and groups overcome obstacles to being creative thus innovate faster and more efficiently.\nFor example, people have trouble on their own finding solutions to their problem that come from distant fields. A ski company wanted to reduce vibrations in their skis so that skiers could make turns faster and safer. It took them a long time to notice the problem had already been solved in violin construction. Once the ski company found that existing solution, ski vibration was reduced.\nExperts say that about 90% of our problems have already been solved somewhere, but we have yet to notice these distant, seemingly unrelated, hidden solutions.   To solve this problem, our team created a new search engine that helps find these distant solutions, that humans, by themselves, have trouble finding.  This work was made possible by the NSF SBIR Phase II grant.\nAnother problem:  Geographically dispersed teams only have Brainstorming and electronic brainstorming to use for group problem solving.  These common techniques have unique problems that inhibit the effectiveness of remote teams.    \nA new, silent, visual problem-solving method, called BrainSwarming, uses techniques that were developed during the Phase II grant to address this problem.  The software imitates how swarms of ants forage for food together.  Just as ants mark their successful paths to food so other ants can find it quickly, BrainSwarming lets humans place their ideas on a structured diagram so that other humans can pick up an idea, add to it, and further the path to a solution.  And just as ant colonies often find multiple paths to food, so BrainSwarming diagrams let humans see multiple potential solution paths at the same time, as well as how these paths interrelate. The result is faster and more efficient innovation for any team of humans.\nThe 'liberate the truck from the underpass? diagram shows several possible solutions found using BrainSwarming to getting a truck unstuck from beneath a low bridge.  The ways of freeing up the truck (lower truck) grow downward from the top of the diagram. The available resources grow upward from the bottom of the diagram. Where the two directions connect, you have your solutions&mdash;such as deflating the tires or adding weight to the truck to lower it slightly.\nComputers can help humans overcome their obstacles to creativity.  Humans in turn must help computers overcome their own limitations to being creative.  Dr. McCaffrey?s 2017 peer reviewed mathematical proof showed that there is a limit to how creative a computer can be and that they are not capable of taking over the innovation process from humans.  Human abilities still play a key role to drive innovation. Consequently, a human-machine partnership is the best way to be the most innovative.  BrainSwarming was built to support this partnership and was also made possible by the SBIR II grant.\nBrainSwarming diagrams have been shown to help a computer and humans work together. The computer and the human team both flush out the same BrainSwarming diagram for a particular problem. The structure of these diagrams force contributors to break the problem down into its essential components and show how all the ideas are connected to each other.\nImagine IBM Watson (or any AI program) and BrainSwarming working together with humans to solve problems. The result is the best of both worlds, human creativity and AI, each helping the other be more creative.\nThe BrainSwarming platform is bringing it all together. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anthony Mccaffrey"
