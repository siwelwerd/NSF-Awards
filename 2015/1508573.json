 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nNontechnical:\r\nNanomaterials offer many advantages for electronic devices, with the potential to enable electronics that operate at lower power and are transparent or flexible.  The foremost limit to nanomaterial devices of any type is the necessary interfaces to the nanomaterial, primarily the contacts.  Contacts are essential for injecting and extracting electrical current in nanomaterials, and are the least understand aspect of such devices.  This project takes several new approaches to understanding and improving the electrical contact to nanomaterials in order to enable their use in exciting electronic applications.  A custom-built material deposition system will be used to modify the nanomaterial surface and allow for the atomically controlled growth of various contact materials.  The resultant improvement of the contacts to nanomaterials will provide the nanoelectronics and optoelectronics communities with key information for improving their device design and fabrication approaches.  From carrier collection interfaces in solar cells to contacts in scaled low-power transistors, results from this project will impact the Grand Challenges by enabling more efficient solar energy and lower energy electronics.  Further, an improved understanding of interfaces to nanomaterials will open the way for new device concepts.  This project will also be impactful in promoting educational diversity as it will be carried out by two female graduate students, one of whom is a NSF Graduate Research Fellow.  Further, the extensive interest in nanomaterials among high school and undergraduate students makes this project ideal for attracting involvement of underrepresented minorities around Duke through several established and new outreach programs. \r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\nThe ultimate limits of nanomaterial-based devices are defined by the necessary contact interfaces.  Especially when it comes to van der Waals-type nanomaterials (focus of this project are: graphene, 2D crystals, carbon nanotubes), where there are no surface states for interfacial bonding, interaction with contacts is a substantial bottleneck.  In this project, new techniques for enabling atomic layer deposition (ALD) nucleation at the contact interface will be used to improve understanding and quality of interfacial electron transport, thereby amplifying device performance.  ALD provides conformal thin films of various conducting materials with atomic layer precision.  Tuning the ALD process conditions allows for controlled alteration of metal work function and crystallinity.  However, ALD on nanomaterials is typically not possible due to the inert nanomaterial surface.  This project will use an advanced plasma-enhanced ALD system that is linked through an ultra-high vacuum load lock to a physical vapor deposition (PVD) tool with a low energy broad beam ion source.  This in situ PVD and ion beam will be used to modify the surface of nanomaterials in a variety of fashions to create nucleation sites for subsequent ALD.  For instance, varying the ion beam energy will allow tuning between surface adsorbate depositions to dangling bond creation in the nanomaterial contact areas using various constituents' including H2, N2, Ar, and O2.  The resultant contact interfaces will be characterized structurally (optical spectroscopy) and electrically (FETs).  In addition to being the first study of ALD contacts to nanomaterials, this project will yield devices with improved performance, including at scaled contact dimensions for advanced electronics.  The way will be opened for applying these ALD-formed contacts to nanomaterials in a myriad of promising applications, from high-performance transistors to solar cells.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Electronics, Photonics, and Magnetic Devices (EPMD) Program in the Division of Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) and the Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM) Program in the Division of Materials Research (DMR).",
