 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how the diversity of trees in forests is maintained is a global challenge. While the impact of invasive pests and new diseases caused by pathogens can be dramatic, the more subtle impacts of native pests and diseases are poorly understood. For example, can native pathogens and pests help promote (rather than destroy) biodiversity by limiting the most common tree species, creating room in the forest for rare species that would otherwise be outcompeted? This project will focus on the role of native pathogens, called oomycetes, in maintaining tree diversity in an old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest. Oomycetes, or water molds, are highly destructive fungus-like plant pathogens, best known for causing the Irish potato famine in the 1850s. Though well known as agricultural pathogens, oomycetes are native to and abundant in many forests. However, almost nothing is known about their ecological roles in natural forests. This project will (i) document the oomycete species present in the Wind River old growth forest in southern Washington state, (ii) determine the ability of each oomycete species to attack or limit different types of tree species in the forest, and (iii) use modern genetic techniques to explore how oomycetes may adapt to different types of tree species. By integrating all this information, the researchers will develop a better understanding of the roles of oomycetes and other pathogens in forests. This understanding will improve management of natural ecosystems and the diseases that occur within them. The project will also train undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students.\r\n\r\nAn initial census of plants and oomycetes, using both culturing and culture-independent methods, together with genotyping of the plants and oomycetes, will lead to plant-inoculation experiments that will identify the host ranges of the oomycetes. Genome and transcriptome sequencing will examine the mechanisms by which narrow host range oomycetes may adapt to genetic diversity in the dominant host plant species, and will examine more deeply how broad host range oomycetes may adapt to a diversity of plant species in their habitat.  A particular focus will be on the role of endemic broad-host-range oomycetes, and how their interactions with dominant and non-dominant host species may differ. By integrating taxonomic, genetic, genomic and functional information about the oomycetes and plants at the Wind River site, two broad hypotheses regarding possible roles of oomycetes in influencing plant biodiversity will be tested. The two hypotheses are: (A) Narrow and broad host range pathogens may reduce the fitness of dominant hosts and so promote plant species and genetic diversity.  (B) Dominant hosts may benefit from the presence of broad host range pathogens due to superior resistance or tolerance to broad-host-range pathogens. Both (A) and (B) may operate independently for different species, or even strains, of pathogens.",

While the impact of invasive pathogens and pests on ecosystems can be dramatic, the functions of pathogens and pests that are native members of ecosystems are less well understood. For example, do pathogens and pests promote biodiversity by limiting the most dominant species? Alternatively, do species achieve dominance through evolution of higher levels of resistance or tolerance to endemic pathogens. There is growing evidence that in biodiverse tropical forests, biodiversity is promoted by pests and pathogens that target the most dominant species. However, much less is known about the mechanisms operating in less diverse cool, temperate forests such as the conifer forests of the Pacific Northwest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project has focused on the role of native oomycete pathogens in an old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest, specifically the Wind River Forest Dynamics Plot in Washington state, which is affiliated with the Smithsonian ForestGEO network. Oomycetes, or water molds, are notorious agricultural pathogens that also damage many forest ecosystems, for example causing the Sudden Oak Death disease.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project conducted very detailed surveys of oomycetes in the soils, waterways, roots and leaves of trees and shrubs, and drip-water from tree canopies at the Wind River site, and some sampling at a similar site in Oregon, the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest. The surveys included culturing and DNA bar-coding experiments. In parallel, the project conducted very detailed measurements of the growth and survival all trees greater than 1 cm in diameter, as well as genetic fingerprinting of over 700 trees belonging to the 8 most abundant species at the site. A third survey examined the annual abundance of seeds and survival of seedlings at numerous sites around the forest that were treated with fungicides or left untreated.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The results revealed that oomycetes were exceptionally rare, compared to similar survey results from managed forests and younger natural forests. The few oomycete pathogens found were from broadleaf understory shrubs such as Vanilla Leaf (<em>Achlys triphylla</em>). Two new oomycete species (<em>Pythium rhizoterrae</em> and <em>Pythium aquasilvae</em>) were found. The two most common species that were found (<em>Pythium rhizoterrae and Pythium macrosporum</em>) did not appear to kill any of the conifer species tested, but did kill some non-forest plants. Overall, these data tend to support the hypothesis that a major factor in the stability of old growth conifer forests may be resistance to the endemic pathogens. At the same time, the ability of the most abundant species to kill non-forest plants raises the question of whether these pathogens help the forest resist the establishment of invasive plant species. Preliminary data from spraying of seedling plots with fungicides suggested that oomycetes and fungi might kill some seedlings survival, but further data analysis will be required to confirm this finding. Surveys of oomycetes and fungi in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest indicated that trees of the same species were more widely spaced than expected (negative density dependence) at locations where the greatest numbers of fungal and oomycete species were found, suggesting that pathogens may have a role in promoting biodiversity in this forest. The tree growth and mortality surveys at the Wind River site suggested that the principal cause of tree death was wind damage, but the role of root rotting pathogens in making trees more vulnerable to wind damage remains to be explored. Overall therefore, the project results suggest that resistance to endemic pathogens may be an important factor in the stability of old growth forests, but that</p>\n<p>further studies of other classes of pathogens such as fungi, and of insect pests, will be required to test this hypothesis more completely. Contributing non-biotic factors such as wind and drought will also need to be examined.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project has trained a new generation of molecular ecologists. Undergraduate researchers conducted much of the project research. By partnering five institutions on this project, two of them smaller undergraduate institutions, undergraduates had outstanding opportunities to participate in cutting edge research. Under the guidance of graduate students and a postdoctoral fellow, a total of 41 individual undergraduates contributed to the tree growth and mortality surveys, analysis of seed production and seedling survival, and development of new methods for characterizing disease resistance genes in conifers.
