 "awd_abstract_narration": "The oceans hold a massive quantity of organic carbon that is greater than all terrestrial organic carbon biomass combined. Nearly all marine organic carbon is dissolved and more than 95% is refractory, and cycled through the oceans several times before complete removal. Refractory dissolved organic carbon (RDOC) concentrations are uniform with depth in the water column and represent the \"background\" carbon present throughout the oceans. However, very little is known regarding RDOC production and removal processes. One potential removal pathway is through adsorption of RDOC onto surfaces of rising bubbles produced by breaking waves and ejection via bubble bursting into the atmosphere. Building on prior research, the investigators will evaluate the importance of ocean- atmosphere processing in recycling marine RDOC during a research cruise in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean. Results of the research will provide important insights regarding the coupled ocean-atmosphere loss of RDOC, thereby improving understanding of and ability to predict the role of RDOC in oceanic and atmospheric biogeochemistry, the global carbon cycle, and Earth's climate. The research will involve three early career faculty, and will provide training for undergraduate and graduate researchers.\r\n\r\nRecent results based on a limited set of observations indicate that the organic matter (OM) associated with primary marine aerosol (PMA) produced by bursting bubbles from breaking waves at the sea surface is comprised partly to wholly of RDOC rather than OM of recent biological origin as has been widely assumed. The injection of RDOC into the atmosphere in association with PMA and its subsequent photochemical oxidation is a potentially important and hitherto unrecognized sink for RDOC in the oceans of sufficient magnitude to close the marine carbon budget and help resolve a long-standing conundrum regarding removal mechanisms for marine RDOC. This project will involve a shipboard investigation and modeling study to (1) quantify the relative contributions of marine refractory dissolved organic carbon (RDOC) to primary marine aerosol organic matter (PMA OM) produced from near-surface seawater in biologically productive and oligotrophic regions and from North Atlantic Deep Water, and to (2) determine the importance of atmospheric photochemical processing as a recycling pathway for RDOC. To test these hypotheses, a high-capacity aerosol generator will be deployed at four hydrographic stations in the NW Atlantic Ocean to characterize (1) the natural abundance of 14C in PMA and in surface and deep seawater; (2) the surface tension and physical properties of bubble plumes; (3) size-resolved production fluxes, chemical composition, organic carbon enrichments, spectral absorbance, and photochemical evolution of PMA; and (4) the carbon content, optical properties, and physical properties of seawater. The importance of RDOC recycling via PMA production and photochemical evolution will be interpreted with model calculations.",

It is widely assumed that the particulate OC emitted from the oceans originates from organic matter produced by present-day biological activity in the sunlit surface ocean.  We challenge this assumption and propose instead that some if not all of the OC emitted from the oceans by bursting bubbles is very old, cycling through the oceans several times before complete removal. This is not unreasonable, since 95% of the OC in the oceans is thousands of years old, produced by biological activity long ago.  This reservoir of ancient carbon, referred to as RDOC, is massive, larger than all terrestrial OC combined.  Despite its large size, we know very little about how RDOC is produced or removed from the oceans. \n\n \n\nThe goal of our project was to determine if the bubble bursting process generated by breaking waves at the sea surface is an important process for removing RDOC from the oceans.  To accomplish this goal, we conducted a 30 day research cruise in the western North Atlantic Ocean during September and October 2016.  We produced marine particles (aerosols) during the cruise using a custom-made marine aerosol generator.  Seawater continually flowed through the generator and bubbles were introduced towards the bottom of the seawater reservoir.  The range of bubble sizes that were produced mimicked that produced by breaking waves at the sea surface.  We collected aerosols that were produced in the generator and subsequently determined the proportion of aerosol OC that was old.  \n\n \n\nDuring the cruise, we collected aerosol at four stations in the western North Atlantic Ocean.  Two stations were in biologically productive waters (coastal Rhode Island and Georges Bank) and two were in the Sargasso Sea, which had comparatively little biological activity.  At each station we used radiocarbon dating to measure the age of the OC (i.e., old or modern) in both the aerosol and seawater from which these aerosols were generated.  As a reference, we also measured the carbon collected from deep seawater, since this carbon is known to be mostly old. The basis of the method that we used involved counting how much of the naturally occurring radioactive14C isotope was in the sample compared to the 12C carbon isotope, which is the most abundant isotope of carbon found in nature.  Several other measurements were made during the cruise to allow us to better interpret the radiocarbon age of OC emitted from the ocean.  \n\n \n\nIn the Sargasso Sea and Georges Bank, we determined that a significant fraction, from 19 to 40%, of the aerosol OC emitted into the atmosphere was old.  Globally, this process removes between 2 and 20 million metric tons (i.e., 2 - 20 Tg) of RDOC from the oceans each year.
