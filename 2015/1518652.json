 "awd_abstract_narration": "The expanded Ebola Testing Unit will allow health care workers to reduce their exposure to highly contagious pathogens, such as Ebola Virus Disease, by creating a physical separation between them and the pathogen. The remote-controlled robot system will allow the health care worker to perform some tasks without having the be physically close to sources of potential infection and will, as a result, dramatically reduce their risks of contracting the disease they are treating.  The proposed system  will both reduce the risk of infection to health care workers, and will increase the quality of care that patients receive: by reducing the time requirements of donning and doffing protective clothing, health care professionals can concentrate on patient care. Ultimately, the work proposed here will save lives, both in the current Ebola outbreak, and also in future outbreaks of highly-infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nThe approach will focus on three elements: tele-operated mobile manipulation, protective equipment for easy decontamination of the robot, and a person tracking system for Ebola treatment facilities. A simulated Ebola testing unit will be demonstrated within six months.  It will integrate new hardware, address the issues of operation over wireless and identify the robot tasks in consultation with health care professionals. Protection and decontamination systems will be evaluated and the effectiveness of the complete system evaluation.  The system will then be integrated in a broader facility in collaboration with WPI.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project looked at how we might use robotics and automation in the fight against highly-infectious diseases, like Ebola Virus Disease (EVD).  In the recent EVD outbreak in West Africa, health care workers put themselves at a substantial risk of infection while treating patients.  If we can use robotics or automation to reduce this infection risk, then we can make health care workers safer and, as a consequence, more effective in their jobs.\n\nThe project asked two main questions: (1) can we use robotics and automation to figure out how infection is spreading through the treatment units and then use robots to clean these areas up quickly; and (2) does the use of remote controlled robots make patients feel uncomfortable when used in this setting.\n\nWe demonstrated a system that tracks health care workers in the EVD treatment area, and builds a model of how they might be spreading infection as they move about.  Since EVD moves in bodily fluids, the main risk is to track these fluids about as you walk.  Combining the tracker and the model, we were able to come up with a map of likely contamination, using probabilities.  We then used this map to direct a floor-cleaning robot to mop up the (simulated) infection.\n\nWe also ran a series of experiments looking at how people react to having a large remote controlled robot do things next to them while they laid on a cot.  We were able to directly measure how agitated they were by recording their heart rate and galvantic skin response, much like a lie detector machine does.  We found that seeing the person controlling the robot (1) makes the patient trust that person more; (2) has no effect on how much they trust the robot; and (3) made them less uncomfortable overall, compared to not being able to see the remote operator.  The take-home message from this aspec of the work is that we should be designing treatment units in such a way that people can see the operators of the robots, rather than hiding these operators away in some unseen location.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William D Smart"
