 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research that helps develop understanding of bilingual language acquisition ? a phenomenon that is growing as globalization increases.  It extends the use of a relatively new technique (cross-language priming) to solve a troublesome theoretical problem.  This research will help solve a long-lasting problem in Chinese syntax ? the structure of the bei construction.  Many researchers believe that the abstract structure of the bei construction is the same as the English passive, while others believe it is a separate structure.  Understanding the nature of this construction will aid in our understanding of bilingual language acquisition, and may improve language teaching methods. This research will be conducted at National Taiwan Normal University under the guidance of Professor Dong-Bo Hsu, a noted expert on priming methodology.  \r\n\r\nPrevious research has shown that the disputed Mandarin bei construction primes, and is primed by English passives; suggesting that the two patterns share an abstract structural representation.  However, it is possible that this priming effect is due to priming of noncanonical word order (theme-before-agent instead of agent-before-theme).  This research will test whether speakers of English and Chinese who are primed by sentences with noncanonical word order produce passives or bei constructions because of the effect of that word order. If the results of this experiment show no priming, then we can conclude that previous results showing priming of bei of and by the English passive do indeed indicate a shared abstract syntactic structure between the two constructions. This project will test 60 Mandarin-English bilingual children between the ages of three and five years, and a similar number of adults.  Participants will be shown a picture which will be described using either an active sentence or on in which the argument order is noncanonical (e.g., topicalization or clefting). Participants will then describe a subsequent picture.  Participants will be tested on both Mandarin prime-English target, and English prime-Mandarin target.  If participants produce more passives in response to noncanonical sentences (rather than in response to actives), we can conclude that the priming effect found in previous work was indeed due to priming of a shared abstract representation - the Mandarin bei construction does indeed share an abstract structural representation with the English passive.  These results can help to settle a long-standing debate by way of new psycholinguistic experimental methods.  This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAll sentences of human language have a structure, similar to the foundation of a building.  Like the foundation of a building, the underlying structure of a sentence can be quite different from the surface word order.  Sentences with word order that appears to be quite different may actually be very similar on a structural level, both within a language, and between different languages. These types of structural relationships between languages are of interest to researchers because they can help us to understand the relationship between two distinct languages in the mind of bilingual speakers.  \n\n \n\nI obtained an NSF EAPSI grant to travel to Taiwan to study the relatedness of the Chinese \"bei\" sentence structure and the English passive structure (e.g., \"Obi-wan was killed by Vader\") using an experimental method known as cross-language priming.  Cross-language priming works by presenting a bilingual speaker with a sentence (known as a \"prime\") in one language, and having them respond in another language.  Previous research has shown that speakers are more likely to respond to the prime with a sentence structure that is related to the structure of the prime than with one that is not, even across languages.  By presenting Chinese-English speakers with a series of English prime sentences, and analyzing their Chinese responses, we can begin to gain an understanding of whether Chinese \"bei\" is related structurally to the English passive.  \n\n \n\nDuring my work in Taiwan, I was hosted by Professor Hsu Dong-bo, of National Taiwan Normal University.  Professor Hsu is a noted expert in priming methodology, and provided invaluable guidance throughout the duration of my research project.  Upon consulting with Professor Hsu, we determined that the most productive approach to my research question would be to conduct a cross-language priming experiment with Chinese-English bilingual children.  Preschool age children are a particularly good population for this type of research, as they have not been explicitly instructed in sentence structure or translation equivalents.  \n\n \n\nIn order to conduct this research project, I worked with Professor Hsu and his research assistant Ms. Lin to develop two main components of the experiment.  First, we worked to adapt a leading measure of language proficiency (the LEAP-Q) both for use with young children, and translated it into Traditional Chinese script &ndash; the writing system used in Taiwan.  This allowed us to gain a clear understanding of the language abilities of the children who participated in our experiment.  Next, we developed a child friendly priming experiment.  Children participated in a story telling game &ndash; first they were shown a picture of cartoon animals engaging in various actions such as hugging, playing soccer, etc.  I described the picture to the children using predetermined English sentences.  Then, children were shown a subsequent, similar image, which they could describe in Chinese any way they chose.  If children produce more \"bei\" sentences in response to English passives than in response to other structures, this provides evidence that \"bei\" and the English passive have a similar structure, and are connected in the minds of bilingual speakers.  \n\n \n\nBy analyzing children\u00c6s responses, we were able to see that while children did produce more \"bei\" sentences in response to English passives than in response to other sentence types, this was not enough to be statistically significant.  This is likely due to the fact that our experiment did not provide a good enough motivation for children to produce these relatively rare sentences types.  This information is crucial both in developing follow up experiments, and to all language researchers working with children.  By discovering what types of tasks children respond poorly to, we will be better able to design experiments that are child friendly, produce useful results, and can be used by a wide variety of researchers working with ..."
