 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: REU Site: Software Security\r\n\r\nThis project offers a nine-week summer program for 10 undergraduate students to gain research experience in software security at Boise State University. During the summer program, each student works with a faculty mentor on a carefully designed research project. The recruiting effort focuses on students from underrepresented groups and academic institutions with limited research opportunities or without cybersecurity programs. At least 50% participants are selected from other academic institutions. The intellectual merits of this project are that the research experiences motivate undergraduate students to purse graduate studies in software security, an area of national priority, and that students make innovative contributions and advance the knowledge base in emerging areas of software security. The broader significance and importance is that this project allows a diverse pool of motivated students from underrepresented groups and universities with limited research opportunities to gain research experiences in software security. The process of learning how to do research, write up and present research results, better prepares students for their future field of study. By focusing on the critical area of software security, an area in which there are few trained experts, the site addresses a pressing national need by training qualified students.\r\n\r\nUnder the supervision of faculty mentors, the students work on research projects related to various software security issues. Sample projects are assurance of obligatory attribute-based access control, automated debugging of attribute-based access control policies, secure development of software-defined networking applications, and efficient symbolic execution for detection of software vulnerability.",

The participants were selected from 156 complete applications across the nation. Each application consisted of an application form, an essay, at least one reference letter, and a copy of official transcripts. Five discipline faculty members at Boise State University participated in the summer programs as research mentors. Under the supervision of their research mentors, the students conducted research projects in various areas of software security, such as access control, data privacy, software quality assurance, security test automation, and blockchain. Throughout the summer programs, the project offered several series of seminars for research training and professional development. Topics include critical thinking for research, security goals, software security, technical writing, literature review, thinking outside the box, ethical conduct of research, tips for research posters presentations, how to present research to a public audience, and presenting research to the Boys &amp; Girls Club. The participants also attended a variety of social events, such as welcome picnic, Idaho Shakespeare Festival, Payette river rafting, and cultural dinner. The REU project has resulted in 9 publications in professional journals and conference proceedings with 9 REU participants as co-authors, one poster presentation at the National Conference on Research Experiences for Undergraduates Symposium by an REU student, and 19 poster presentations at the annual Idaho Conference on Undergraduate Research (ICUR). In addition to project plan presentations and final project presentations, all participants presented their research at ICUR.&nbsp;The participants all had positive research experiences in the summer program. They enjoyed the opportunity to work on real-world projects with their mentors and peers, as well as building professional relationships with their mentors. They improved their research skills through the carefully designed hands-on research projects and activities. Through an RET (Research Experiences for Teachers) supplement, this project also provided a six-week summer program in 2017 for two female high school computer science teachers to gain research experiences in software security. After the summer program, they introduced security topics in their computer science courses.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/02/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dianxiang&nbsp;Xu</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
