 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of US-based mathematicians, especially those in early career stages, in the international conference \"Finite Dimensional Integrable Systems 2015\" held at the Mathematical Research and Conference Center in Bedlewo, Poland, on July 13 - 17, 2015. See http://www.impan.pl/BC/Program/2015.html for additional details.  The conference brings together leading experts in this important and fast-growing area of research, along with young mathematicians and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe conference is  focused on integrable systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom, the most classical and popular part of the theory of completely integrable systems that goes back to the works of Lagrange, Jacobi, Kovalevskaya, Noether, Poincare and others.  In the second half of 20th century, KAM theory and the work of its founders (Kolmogorov, Arnold, Moser) gave a new perspective on integrability problems and stimulated further progress in this area.  New powerful methods based on the interplay between a priori disconnected  branches of mathematics and physics have been recently developed: methods of complex analysis, symplectic and complex geometry, Lie theory, representation theory, and computer algebra - they are all used in the integrability theory. As a result, new integrable systems have been found, new applications of integrable systems in physics and geometry were discovered, new tools for the study of integrable systems were developed, and many questions, open for a long time, have been answered. The conference will survey recent progress in this field, present open problems, outline new directions of research, look for new applications, and foster new collaborations.",
