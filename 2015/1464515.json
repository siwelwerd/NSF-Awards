 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Synthesis program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Paul J. Fischer of Macalester College leads a research group of exclusively undergraduate students in designing and synthesizing new rhenium (Re) metal complexes for chemical synthesis applications. Specifically, the target Re complexes are anticipated to bind organic molecules (for example, benzene and naphthalene, inexpensive substances found in crude petroleum), and activate them toward reactions under mild conditions. The hypothesized results of these reactions include transformations of these abundant feedstock chemicals into more useful substances that require significantly more energy-intensive strategies to prepare using current methods. This project will provide a stimulating training ground in modern research methods for talented undergraduate students including women and African American students. This research program seeks to equip undergraduate students with the skills, tenacity and enthusiasm to facilitate their success in chemical research in subsequent graduate studies.\r\n\r\nThis project examines the feasibility and advantages of employing tris(phosphino)borates as surrogates for hydrotris(1-pyrazolyl)borate for the preparation of pi-basic fragments with high propensity to coordinate arenes in a dihapto fashion. Thermal and photochemical syntheses are being pursued to open the completely unexplored area of tris(phosphino)borate rhenium chemistry. Special emphasis is being placed on modulating the electronic and steric environment of Re fragments of tris(phosphino)borates for optimum dearomatization of aromatic substrates. Reaction products are characterized by NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) and IR (infra-red) spectroscopies, cyclic voltammetry and X-ray crystallography, the latter via collaboration with the University of Minnesota.",

The development of new strategies to modulate the electronic characteristics of metal centers within metal complexes is intellectually meritorious since these characteristics dictate metal-based reactivity. To this end, we synthesized the new tris(phosphinomethyl)phenylborates in Figure 1. This modulation strategy aims to impact the extent of the borate negative charge experienced at metals, with the CF<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;substituents expected to withdraw some of this negative charge away from the phosphorous atoms, and the CH<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;substituents expected to facilitate metals at phosphorous being impacted to a larger extent by this negative charge. While the aforementioned general impact of these substituents is long known, the novelty of the Figure 1 ligands is that the negative charge is held at a fixed distance from phosphorous-bound metals; this charge impacts the metal via a \"<em>through-space</em>\" mode. To explore this question a series of complexes were prepared containing Cr, Mo and W bound to the phosphorous atoms. To aid the electronic interrogation of these metals, these metals were introduced as metal tricarbonyl units in which three carbon monoxide molecules are bound to each metal. Figure 2 depicts the structure of the chromium tricarbonyl complex containing the CF<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;ligand of Figure 1. The differing electronic impact of CH<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;versus CF<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;at Cr(CO)<sub>3</sub>, Mo(CO)<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;and W(CO)<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;units at phosphorous was assessed as modest, yet rational, by both infrared spectroscopic and cyclic voltammetric interrogation. This is an exciting result as it uncovers a viable strategy for fine-tuning metal electronics in tris(phosphinomethyl)phenylborate complexes.</p>\n<p>A serendipitous observation while carrying out the work summarized above was that removal of a single electron from the Cr(CO)<sub>3</sub>&nbsp;units of species such as that in Figure 2 resulted in seemingly stable species in which the chromium center is formally positively charged while the boron retains its negative charge. All previous attempts to study substances with [Cr(CO)<sub>3</sub>P<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup> units in other laboratories had been foiled by the acute thermal instability of these species. Our initial inference that our species exhibited anomalous stability at ambient temperatures motivated a new research project. Scheme 1 depicts the first synthesis of any thermally stable complexes (<strong>4</strong>-<strong>6</strong>) containing [Cr(CO)<sub>3</sub>P<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup> units. The unexpected high stability of these substances is hypothesized as due to the presence of the through-space interaction of the positively charged chromium centers with the borate negative charge. The first crystal structure of any [Cr(CO)<sub>3</sub>P<sub>3</sub>]<sup>+</sup> unit is in Figure 3. Magnetic measurements, including an examination via electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (Figure 4), confirmed that these species can indeed be classified as seventeen electron Cr(I) complexes. This work illustrates the utility of tris(phosphino)borates for the stabilization of positively charged metal fragments that are very difficult to study independently, without an enforced through-space interaction with a negatively charged center. NSF support of this work has resulted in two published manuscripts in Dalton Transactions, one in 2018, and another in 2019. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts</p>\n<p>The broader impact of this work is grounded in its completion exclusively by undergraduate students as their initial exposure to an academic research environment. This work permitted five research students with extensive experience in chemical synthesis, and training in the characterization of metal complexes, both in the solution phase and in the solid-state. These students are now bringing these skills into their careers as professionals. Two of these five students have already enrolled in Ph.D. programs in inorganic chemistry (Penn) and physics (Ohio State). Two are in the process of applying to medical schools, with intended Fall 2020 matriculation. The fifth is currently working in a biochemistry lab in industry while pondering whether to pursue a graduate degree in biochemistry.&nbsp; Four of these five students are women. A second broader impact of this work with respect to the professional training of aspiring scientists is our collaboration with the University of Minnesota for obtaining cyclic voltammetric (CV) data. A graduate student (who has since earned his Ph.D. and now works in the chemical industry) of the Prof. Connie Lu laboratory contributed to this work by carrying out these CV measurements in the Lu lab. This student earned co-authorship on one of the two published manuscripts noted above.&nbsp; This research also served as a vehicle to teach scientific communication as it led to five student-presented posters at three American Chemical Society National Meetings. The PI also presented this research via three National meeting oral presentations. This research group works hard to bring projects to completion efficiently to allow regular communication of new results to the inorganic chemistry community.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/12/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paul&nbsp;J&nbsp;Fischer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1464515/1464515_10364691_1573575936124_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1464515/1464515_10364691_1573575936124_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1464515/1464515_10364691_1573575936124_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">New Ligands and Research Question</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Paul J.
