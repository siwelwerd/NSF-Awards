 "awd_abstract_narration": "Environmental flow disasters occur when hazardous material is released and dispersed into the environment by the natural processes of air and water.  Recent catastrophic examples include: the spread of oil during the Deep Water Horizon disaster, the passage of the ash cloud from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano through commercial air space, and the trail of radioactive waste from the Fukushima reactor disaster. These types of hazards are common and many have profound impacts on society. When hazardous material is released, accurate predictions of where the material is likely to go can greatly improve emergency response and significantly reduce negative consequences.  Preparedness and effective response can save many lives, untold environmental damage and enormous financial cost. However, predicting where materials go in complex environmental flows remains a formidable scientific challenge.\r\n\r\nThis project intends to transform science's environmental flow predictive capabilities by exploiting and advancing recent fundamental breakthroughs in four-dimensional (3D+time) Lagrangian methods. This research will integrate theoretical, computational, and observational approaches to develop and utilize cutting-edge Lagrangian methods with data driven modeling for the purpose of uncovering, quantifying and predicting key transport processes and structures during regional flow-based hazards in the ocean and atmosphere. This project will (i) exploit and advance mathematical methods for four-dimensional (3D+time) Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) in order to elucidate unsteady Lagrangian flow transport; (ii) test and develop LCS methods on historical data sets; (iii) produce efficient, accurate, distributed and web-based software to support LCS analysis and visualization; (iv) integrate LCS methodology into numerical models and non-Gaussian data assimilation; (v) perform field testing and a proof-of-concept, coupled ocean-atmosphere field experiment; and (vi) respond to a hazard of opportunity during the tenure of the project.",

Emergency response time remains a factor, however, due to the lack of information available to accurately forecast the location of small objects. To address the challenges of such ocean hazards, we pursued several significant advances of the state-of-the-art.</p>\n<p>Tracking modules were designed&nbsp;that recorded the position and orientation of person-sized manikins drifting in&nbsp;the ocean under realistic conditions. Our&nbsp;collaboration of groups - including the Coast&nbsp;Guard, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, MIT, Berkeley, and Virginia&nbsp;Tech - tested the methods in the Atlantic Ocean. We derived a novel numerical methodology to compute the advective transport and diffusion-reaction of tracer quantities, and demonstrated that these methods can be used for planning and interpretation of real-world ocean scenarios in real-time experiments using multiscale ensemble ocean forecasts. A key scientifc advance was the development of a new approach based on TRansient Attracting Profiles (TRAPS), which are the instantaenoulsy most attracting regions of an ocean surface flow, and therefore candidate regions for targeting search-and-rescue operations. The existence and viability of a TRAPS-based approach was demonstrated in full-scale field experiments of this project.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Multi-rotor drones and embedded&nbsp;navigation technology were used for on-demand wind&nbsp;velocity measurements. With improved&nbsp;forecasting of the wind-induced drift of objects&nbsp;and people in oceans and lakes, emergency response&nbsp;times can be improved, aiding coast guards&nbsp;around the world in their life-saving efforts. And research also advanced understanding of the vertical exchange processes between the top part of the ocean and the water column underneath. In most computational models these vertical exchanges are not explicitly resolved. This work helps improve computational capabilities, supporting an improved ability to model and predict the oceanic state, the redistribution of biogeochemical tracers, and to optimize response to hazardous spills.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Key products resulting from these outcomes include: methodology and software for locating key trapping structures ins oceanic flows; drifter trajectory prediction software; software for computing maps showing three-dimensional coherent structures in the ocean; visualization software; quality-controlled in-situ data sets ; and multi-resolution deterministic and probabilistic simulations for the Nantucket and Martha?s Vineyard region.
