 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal is to deploy a sodium lidar at McMurdo, Antarctica, in addition to the previously installed Fe-Boltzmann lidar also funded by NSF. Like radars, the LIDARs (LIght Detection And Ranging) are the devices that can examine various properties of the upper atmosphere from a large distance and at various altitudes. From a single location, these devices can scan the environments and observe polar atmosphere and ionosphere at the 80-200 km altitude within a wide sector covering thousands of square miles. They monitor an atmospheric chemical composition, temperature and other features, analyze atmospheric gravity waves, and measure vertical winds and interaction between plasma and neutral winds. The lidars also can study features and irregularities of various layers of the atmosphere, and monitor their dynamics.\r\n \r\nMany scientists are already using the data of the previously installed instrument, and the new lidar will bring another kind of measurements of airglow with high temporal and spatial resolution. Simultaneous monitoring of many atmospheric parameters enriches our understanding of atmospheric dynamics in general and gravity waves, mixing, and vertical transport in the studied region. By fully characterizing vertical constituent transport in the mesopause region caused by gravity waves and turbulence, as well as determining the differential ablation of Na and Fe, will substantially reduce the large uncertainties in current estimates of cosmic dust influx into the Earth's atmosphere. Accurate observation of these essential parameters will provide important data sets of polar atmosphere conditions and dynamics and allow obtaining new crucial information for many scientists and many areas, including weather studies, atmospheric and ionospheric studies, and others. This research effort will continue to develop the NSF-funded instrumentation network to help addressing fundamental questions of the Geospace research that have not yet thoroughly examined.",

This project represents a fruitful collaboration between the United States Antarctic Program (USAP) and Antarctica New Zealand (AntNZ) as two lidars are hosted in an AntNZ laboratory at Arrival Heights Observatory near McMurdo, Antarctica.</p>\n<p class=\"JFNormal\">These two lidars are so advanced that together they can make measurements from ~10 km up to ~200 km, detecting Na and Fe metal species, temperatures, winds, polar stratospheric and mesospheric clouds, and various atmospheric waves in the middle and upper atmosphere with unprecedented sensitivities and resolutions. Such unique data have enabled a broad range of important science studies. The lidar team has conducted extensive science investigations using the lidar data and numerical modeling, made groundbreaking science discoveries, trained numerous PhD, master, and undergraduate students along with postdoctoral researchers, promoted female scientists, produced press releases, made public outreach, and fostered international collaborations in Antarctica.</p>\n<p class=\"JFNormal\"><strong>Intellectual Merit:&nbsp;</strong>The very high-sensitivity and high-resolution lidar measurements at McMurdo have led to numerous eye-opening discoveries and some are transformative to advancing the space-atmosphere sciences. For example, in contrast to a conventional thinking that dissipating gravity waves introduce downward sensible heat flux, the McMurdo lidar measurements unequivocally reveal upward sensible heat flux in the lower thermosphere from 97 to 106 km. This result contradicts conventional thinking but demonstrates the importance of the fully compressible solutions for polarization relations of primary and secondary gravity waves. Another example is the stunning discovery&nbsp;of nearly one-to-one correspondence between thermosphere-ionosphere Fe (TIFe) layers and aurora activity, enhanced ionization layers, and converging electric fields (Chu et al., 2020). The simultaneous Na and Fe observations also reveal the striking differences between the&nbsp;thermosphere-ionosphere Na (TINa) and TIFe layers. Such findings are puzzling the science community but indicate the potential differential transport due to species mass differences. Furthermore, the simultaneous Na and Fe measurements enable the studies of Fe and Na flux ratios, which will help determine the cosmic dust entry velocities and help estimate the meteoric mass influxes. Lidar observations of the sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) in 2019, especially the vertical wind measurements, will lead to new understandings of the atmospheric coupling systems.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"JFNormal\">The&nbsp;numerous journal publications&nbsp;are only a small fraction of the important science that can be addressed by&nbsp;the unique lidar datasets. The&nbsp;McMurdo lidar project contributes significantly&nbsp;to advancing&nbsp;our understandings of the coupling from the atmosphere to geospace and space-atmosphere interactions.&nbsp;Such sophisticated lidars have become a centerpiece of the Arrival Heights Geospace-Atmosphere Observatory in Antarctica, inspiring&nbsp;multi-dimensional&nbsp;science exploration and discoveries in the complex, nonlinear, and dynamic Sun-Earth system.</p>\n<p class=\"JFNormal\"><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong>&nbsp;The McMurdo lidar project has provided exceptional trainings to many students and postdocs, and produced numerous top PhDs and the next-generation of young scientists. Six PhDs (Yu, Smith, Fong, Chen, Zhao, and Li) were produced from the McMurdo lidar projects, along with five master degrees, five postdocs (Huang, Lu, Wang, Lin, and Li), and 12 winter-over lidar scientists. Many lidar students have won NSF CEDAR (Coupling, Energetics, and Coupling of Atmospheric Regions) poster competition prizes: Four 1st-place prizes (Yamashita, Chen, Yu, and Fong), four 2nd-place prizes, and one undergraduate honorable mention (Geraghty). Lidar projects are highly interdisciplinary and cutting-edge, involving a wide range of engineering and scientific skills. Students working in Antarctica gain extensive knowledge in laser physics, electrical/computer/mechanical engineering, photonics, signal processing, and atmospheric sciences, as well as real world experience in building lidar instruments and making them work under challenging conditions. Such trainings produce scientists and engineers who are exceptionally versatile and adaptable. Many students and postdocs trained on the McMurdo lidar project have found their dream jobs, such as tenure-track faculty positions (Yu, Lu, Lin, and Li), NASA civil servant (Smith), research scientists (Huang, Yamashita, &amp; Wang), and industry lead engineers (Roberts, Fong, &amp; Chen).</p>\n<p class=\"JFNormal\">The McMurdo lidar project promotes women scientists, as&nbsp;it has helped promote three female scientists (Chu, Vadas, and Lu). The project is led by a female PI (Dr. Xinzhao Chu) who serves as a role-model for female leaders in science and engineering. Groundbreaking science discoveries&nbsp;in the atmosphere-space sciences&nbsp;stemming from the McMurdo lidar observations have earned Dr. Chu the CEDAR Prize Lecture Award in 2019.</p>\n<p class=\"JFNormal\">Numerous&nbsp;press releases and outreach activities made on the McMurdo discoveries have increased the public awareness of the space-atmosphere research and helped prompt students' interests in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.

Many students and postdocs trained on the McMurdo lidar project have found their dream jobs, such as tenure-track faculty positions (Yu, Lu, Lin, and Li), NASA civil servant (Smith), research scientists (Huang, Yamashita, &amp; Wang), and industry lead engineers (Roberts, Fong, &amp; Chen).\nThe McMurdo lidar project promotes women scientists, as it has helped promote three female scientists (Chu, Vadas, and Lu). The project is led by a female PI (Dr. Xinzhao Chu) who serves as a role-model for female leaders in science and engineering. Groundbreaking science discoveries in the atmosphere-space sciences stemming from the McMurdo lidar observations have earned Dr. Chu the CEDAR Prize Lecture Award in 2019.\nNumerous press releases and outreach activities made on the McMurdo discoveries have increased the public awareness of the space-atmosphere research and helped prompt students' interests in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.
