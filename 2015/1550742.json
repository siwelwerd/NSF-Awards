 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to evaluate the ability of observations of total column precipitable water (TPW) from ground-based Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to improve forecasts of precipitation occurring as part of the North American Monsoon (NAM). The NAM begins in southern Mexico in May and expands north and westward along the Sierra Madre Occidental, reaching the US Southwest in late July and early August.  The bulk of NAM precipitation comes from mesoscale meteorological processes, including squall lines and mesoscale convective complexes, and thus successful numerical weather prediction requires the use of a high-resolution nonhydrostatic weather forecasting model.  In addition, previous work suggests that successful prediction of NAM precipitation must include observations from the regions of convective initiation, and adequately represent low-level surges of moisture into the NAM region.  Thus, this project examines the ability of the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF ARW), integrated using a nonhydrostatic high resolution inner domain, to produce skillful NAM precipitation forecasts using continuous TPW observations from a network of GPS ground stations in the US (Suominet) and in Mexico (TLALOC-Net, a 100-station network currently under construction), with further experiments incorporating observations from the more distant COCONet network in the Caribbean.   GPS receivers detect TPW as a consequence of the delay in GPS signal propagation from the transmitter satellite to the ground-based receiver due to the presence of atmospheric water vapor. In addition to these fixed networks, the PIs will work with colleagues at the National Autonomous University of Mexico on a field campaign in which 10 GPS receivers will be deployed in Northern Mexico (in the region of convective initiation) over the 2013 NAM season.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its scientific merit, the work has broader societal impacts due to the importance of the NAM, which accounts for approximately 50-70% of the annual precipitation in northwest Mexico and the Southwest US.  The NAM impacts water supply and demand, severe weather, extreme heat, drought and wildfire during the warm season.  In addition, the work will foster collaborations between US and Mexican scientists in a research area of interest to both countries, and the work will support and train a graduate student.",

While ensemble Kalman filter techniques are not unique to this study, the associated approximations and implementation have been specifically designed for the monsoon region and for surface-based PWV data. \nThis study has successfully shown that a network of PWV observations in Northwest Mexico can have a positive impact on forecast skill for capturing the timing and amount of rainfall associated with organized weather systems during the monsoon season.  Further investigation is needed to better understand the required density of observations and their impact on forecasts beyond 24-hours that could not be addressed by this study.  PWV was measured using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers co-located with surface pressure and temperature measurements.  These networks provide high quality measurements that are inexpensive, easy to install and require less training and time of personnel than radiosonde or radar networks.  In remote areas and in regions with limited resources like Mexico, such networks are a valuable supplement to remotely sensed meteorological parameters, as they provide information every 5-minutes in all-weather conditions, filling important gaps in data available for realtime weather forecasting applications. Since this study, the National Science Foundation funded a 5-year installation of GNSS stations with meteorological packages for the Trans-Boundary, Land and Atmosphere Long?term Observational and Collaborative Network (TLALOCNet) across all of Mexico that is now providing real-time PWV to global forecasting centers.  Together with NSF?s previously funded Continuously Operating Caribbean GPS Observational Network (COCONet), moisture can be tracked from the Tropics into the monsoon region across a wide range of time and space scales. Our project represents only a start on the use of these networks to better understand the hydrological cycle connecting the Tropics to the subtropics, and the impact of these measurements on operational forecasts of hazards such as monsoon storms and hurricanes in Mexico and the U.S.  An important lasting legacy of this project are the now strong cross-border collaborations between universities in Mexico and the U.S. that focus on continued investigation of the North American monsoon. \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yolande L Serra"
