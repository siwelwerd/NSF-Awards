 "awd_abstract_narration": "The APEC Cooperation for Earthquake Simulation (ACES) is a multi-lateral grand challenge science research cooperation of APEC (the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation). ACES was originally founded to develop realistic supercomputer simulation models for the complete earthquake generation process and to assimilate observations into such models. Subsequent meetings have also broadened the topics to include simulations of tsunamis, wildfires, volcanic eruptions, mantle convection, and other geodynamically interesting topics. The founding member economies of ACES are Australia, China, Japan and the United States. Subsequently, three other economies have requested and attained membership in ACES, including Canada, New Zealand, and Chinese Taipei. This meetingwill continue the tradition of cutting-edge science in support of earthquake risk reduction. Travel support for US scientists, in particular for early career and under-represented groups, will contribute to the intellectual development of this critical field.\r\n\r\nThis workshop support will allow US students and participants to travel to the ACES Symposium on Earthquakes, Tsunamis, and other Multihazards, to be held in Chengdu, China, August 10-14, with a field trip to visit the site of the May 12, 2008 M8 Wenchuan, China earthquake during August 15-16. The meeting is a multilateral meeting of many APEC economies, whose participants are scientists and technologists interested in computer modeling and simulation of earthquake and other natural disasters. US participation is jointly supported with NASA. Products from the symposium will include a proceedings volume of peer-reviewed papers, similar to the many publications volumes produced from the previous meetings.An example of potential impact is the Global National Satellite System Tsunami Early Warning System project proposed by NASA. ACES is now playing a critical role in the leadership and implementation of this project, through its role as an approved scientific activity of the APEC Policy Partnership on Science, Technology and Innovation.",

Approximately 80 persons attended the meeting from China, the United States, Japan, India, Australia, Taiwan, and New Zealand.  Of these participants, 18 were US-based scientists.  Oral papers were from 15 minutes (contributed) to 40 minutes (invited) in duration.    In addition to presentation of papers, there was a discussion of increased cooperation between ACES and the new APRU Multihazards Hub located at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.\n\nIn addition to the regular ACES sessions, several special sessions were organized whose focus was on the development of a GNSS Tsunami Early Warning System, the April 25, Nepal earthquake, and a session to celebrate the contributions of Professor Xiang-Chu Yin of the China Earthquake Administration.  The field trip to the source region of the Wenchuan earthquake involved many meeting participants to devastated sites such as Yingsxiu Town, Bailu Town, Penzhou city, and Beichuan. \n\nThe program, details of the meeting, and summaries of abstracts are available on request and on the web site ( http://www.csi.ac.cn/ACES2015/Home/index.html ).  Sessions at the meeting are described below. \n\nAmong social events, there was an icebreaker and registration at the Jinyuan Hotel, held on the evening of August 9.  A meeting banquet and reception was held on August 10, with another banquet for the ACES International Science Board (ISB) on August 12.  The ISB held an executive session on August 11 to deal with administrative matters arising from ACES administration. \n\nIt is expected that the next ACES international workshop will be held in Japan sometime in 2017.\n\nTravel funds provided by NASA and NSF for US-based participants were disbursed according to the plans originally provided in the proposals to those agencies.  Disbursement of funds is expected to be completed by 10/31/2015.\n\nSessions at the meeting included:\n\nSession 1: Microscopic simulation\n\nSession 2: Scaling physics\n\nSession 3: Macro-scale simulation: Earthquake generation and cycles\n\nSession 4: Macro-scale simulation: Dynamic rupture and wave propagation\n\nSession 5: Computational environment and algorithms\n\nSession 6: Data assimilation and understanding\n\nSession 7: Model applications\n\nSpecial Session 1: Earthquake simulation and forecast in China: State-of-the-art and future prospective (invited-only presentations)\n\nSpecial Session 2: The lure of LURR &mdash; Celebration of Professor Yin?s 80th Birthday\n\nSpecial Session 3: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Tsunami Early Warning System: Models, Simulations, Data and Technology\n\nSpecial Session 4:  The April 24, 2015 Magnitude 7.8 Lamjung (Kathmandu) Nepal Earthquake\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/03/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John B Rundle"
