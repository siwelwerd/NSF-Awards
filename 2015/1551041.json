 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the relationship between science funding, employment, and other outcome metrics is a key national goal. This research seeks to model, visualize and understand Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) processes and networks in order accelerate innovation and develop better outcome and impact metrics. STI processes are comprised of project activities involving basic and applied research, publication, invention, and proto-typing leading to the commercialization of new products. This project develops new direct measures of the research to commercialization STI process and fills a significant knowledge gap with respect to the sequences and duration of STI activities and processes.  The research has the potential to facilitate policy aimed at accelerating innovation.\r\n \r\nThis research models and measure temporal sequences of STI activities (including research, invention, proof-of-concept, and commercialization) culminating in the launch of new products, using STAR METRICS Federal Reporter data and exploring links to patents, SBIR awards and other data sources. The EventFlow tool will be adopted to offer novel visualizations of how federally sponsored basic and applied research connects with other types of activities leading ultimately to commercialization of new products.",

Conceptually, we have organized sequences of innovation-related activities &ndash; what we call <em>Events</em> &ndash; based on the <em>products </em>they contribute to.&nbsp; That is, if we start with a specific product &ndash; a drug or medical device for example &ndash; we can trace its development backwards through FDA approvals, clinical trials, patents and research grants.&nbsp; The sequence of these related <em>events</em> creates a <em>record </em>in EventFlow (see EventFlow user interface in Figure 1).</p>\n<p>To create these EventFlow records we explored multiple data sources.&nbsp;
