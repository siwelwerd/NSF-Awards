 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is establishing a \"spiral\" laboratory framework for a computer engineering curriculum in which the key concepts are revisited at increasing levels of sophistication and interconnection. Instead of treating each course as an isolated topic, the project is developing a sequence of laboratory experiments and projects weaving through the entire curriculum, from freshman engineering to senior capstone design. This approach will help students see the \"big picture\" of the discipline and enhance their \"integration skills\" to address complex and realistic problems.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed work connects and integrates the individual courses through laboratories that incorporate three types of media: video, audio, and touch sensor. The laboratories are designed to illustrate and reinforce key theoretical concepts in various courses. Their complexities and abstraction levels gradually grow as students progress through the curriculum. Each individual project and its components eventually evolve into a complete set of IP (intellectual property) cores that form customizable I/O subsystems that can be incorporated into any FPGA (field programmable gate array) based computer system. The overall project addresses a serious deficiency - lack of integration skill - in the engineering curriculum. It uses low-cost prototyping boards and parts and can be easily incorporated into existing curricular structures. The improved curriculum will enhance students' integration skill, make them aware of the big context, and keep them interested and motivated. The project will be implemented in two institutions in parallel and its effectiveness will be evaluated.",
