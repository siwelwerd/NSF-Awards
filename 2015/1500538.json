 "awd_abstract_narration": "The long-term goals of this research address the very basis of our understanding of the world around us. Potentially, it has deep implications on the nature of particle interactions, on the question of matter-antimatter symmetry, and on cosmology. At the same time, this research is uniquely visible because the study of antimatter is accessible and fascinating to the public. Antihydrogen experiments are sufficiently simple that they can be comprehended in their entirety by graduate students. Consequently, they offer students a broad education. Experimental students learn beam and plasma physics, experimental planning and design, instrumentation, electronics, cryogenics, magnetics and software development. Along with theory development, theory students can make critical contributions to the design, operation, and analysis of the experiments. The relative accessibility of the material makes it easy to integrate undergraduate students into both the experimental and theoretical program. The research includes significant participation by members of underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe research is primarily focused on the immediate plasma and atomic physics issues surrounding improving the trapping of antihydrogen, and on the design of a third generation trap optimized for gravitational research. The physics issues will be studied with experiments at Berkeley and at CERN, with classical trajectory Monte Carlo, molecular dynamics, Vlasov codes and 3D Particle-In-Cell codes, and with analytic theory. Some of the questions that will be addressed include: achieving improved (lower) lepton and antiproton temperatures; studying how leptons interact with the background radiation field; studying how leptons interact with resonant cavities; improved plasma diagnostics; and improved mixing of positrons and antiprotons, so that more of the resultant antihydrogen can be held in a very shallow neutral trap. While the motivation for seeking answers to these questions comes from antihydrogen research, many of these questions raise novel and deep issues in plasma and atomic physics.  This research is co-sponsored by the NSF's Physics Division and the Office of International Science and Engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe big bang should have created equal amounts of matter and antimatter.  Since matter and antimatter cannot co-exist, this matter and antimatter should have mutually annihilated, leaving nothing behind.  The fact that we are here demands that the big bang must have produced slightly more matter than antimatter.   No one yet knows how this might have come about.  This problem is sometimes called one of the ?Grand Challenges? in science.\n\nOne possibility is that there are slight asymmetries in the fundamental laws of nature, particularly a violation of one symmetry principle called charge-parity-time invariance (CPT).    Researchers across many physics disciplines are testing CPT to see if it is violated.  Our particular test is to compare the spectra---the color with which these atoms glow---of hydrogen and antihydrogen; CPT demands that the spectra be identical.  Any difference in the spectra would truly revolutionize physics.  This test has the advantage that it can be done with extraordinary precision: in principle, to one part in a million trillion.\n\nWe (the ALPHA collaboration at CERN) began our research by learning how to trap antihydrogen atoms.  We first accomplished this in 2010, but only in the last few years have learned how to trap thousands of antiatoms simultaneously.   We have since been looking at the spectra of these atoms.   Atoms glow with several different colors and we have examined two of these colors to a precision up to two parts per trillion.  So far, we have not found any violations of CPT.  \n\nWe are also exploring how antihydrogen behaves under the influence of gravity.  Though few believe that this could happen, it has been speculated that antihydrogen could fall upwards rather than downwards.  There have been many, strong, indirect experiments that suggest that this is not so, but no one has ever done the simple experiment of dropping an antiatom and seeing which way it falls.  We have almost complete the construction of such an apparatus, and hope to do this fundamental test in the next few years. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/01/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joel Fajans"
