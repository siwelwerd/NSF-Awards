 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project upgrades the Emulab facility at the University of Utah, which is used by thousands of computer science researchers, educators, and students across the country. Emulab is a scientific instrument for conducting controlled, medium-scale experiments with emulated networks. It is especially appropriate for experiments that require a controlled environment, where network links can be emulated, and where human (or other external) involvement in the experiment is not required. In operation since 2000, it is a central resource in the networking and systems research communities. Hundreds of research papers and dozens of classes have been based on experiments conducted within the Emulab facilities and demand has remained high. While the fundamentals of Emulab are strong, and it is widely used, some of its aspects are showing their age and need to be updated to support cutting edge research going forward. For example, on the hardware side, approximately one-third of the PCs in the testbed are more than 14 years old: these out-of-date PCs are no longer useful for scientific experiments, while user demand for Emulab's more modern PCs exceeds their availability.\r\n\r\nThis project supports the revitalization and ongoing operation of the Emulab testbed. Hardware-related activities include replacing 168 of the oldest nodes with 160 modern multi-core, large memory nodes, and replacing Emulab's obsolete firewall with one capable of supporting current high-performance networks. Software improvements include expanded support for virtualization technologies and modernizing Emulab's web and scripting interfaces to improve ease of use. Operations activities include ensuring 24/7 Internet-based availability of the testbed and assisting users and other sites that run Emulab software.\r\n\r\nThe revitalized Emulab testbed will support cutting-edge research and educational activities, and it will enable thousands of researchers, educators, and students to perform realistic and relevant experiments that would otherwise be impossible. This effect will be magnified by the dozens of other testbed sites that run Emulab software.",

Emulab is a scientific instrument for carrying out controlled experiments on medium-scale, \"bare metal\" computer and network resources. In operation since 2000, it is a central resource in the networking and systems research communities. The open-source software that operates Emulab also manages dozens of other public-access testbeds.<br /><br />This project supported both hardware and software enhancements to Emulab.<br /><br />The most significant hardware enhancement was the addition of 160 Dell PowerEdge R430 servers to the testbed. These devices, which Emulab's users may allocate to conduct their experiments, were configured to meet the needs of a variety of activities, including experiments that require virtualization, 10Gb networking, and device-local storage. As the R430 cluster was added to Emulab, Emulab's networking infrastructure was also replaced by new, state-of-the-art equipment that supports the high-speed network interfaces of the R430s. The project supported three additional, significant hardware enhancements to Emulab as well. The first was a new, 10Gb-capable firewall appliance that sits between Emulab and the internet. The second was a new backup system, providing both on-site and off-site backups of user and administrative data. The third was a replacement for Emulab's aging (and increasingly underpowered) central control server: it was replaced by two new physical servers.<br /><br />On the software side, the project supported enhancements to Emulab in three principal areas. The first was a migration from Emulab's original web interface and scripting language to more-modern versions of these subsystems. The transition to the new interface, called the \"portal,\" made new features available to Emulab's users, e.g., parameterized and version-controlled experiment definitions, and also improved Emulab's federation with other testbed facilities, e.g., CloudLab and POWDER. The second enhancement was support for Docker-based experiment configuration: the ability to create experiments in which some or all of the networked devices are realized by Docker containers. This work, designed to help users more easily transfer work into and out of Emulab, was presented in a peer-reviewed paper at the CSET 2018 workshop. The third area of enhancement covered internal changes to Emulab's control software, including changes for compatibility with up-to-date versions of the third-party components on which it depends. This work allowed the Emulab software to be deployed on current hardware, atop a current OS, and improved the performance and security of the Utah Emulab testbed site.<br /><br />In addition to infrastructure enhancements, the project supported the ongoing operation and high availability of the Emulab testbed. Throughout the project, the Utah Emulab testbed was available 24/7 (with minimal exceptions), free of charge, to users worldwide. The project team continually performed maintenance tasks on the testbed: this included monitoring the status of the testbed facility, replacing failed components as necessary, and regularly updating the standard disk images that the Utah Emulab site makes available to its users. Another major aspect of operations was user support. The project team provided daily technical and administrative support to users of the testbed, largely through email.<br /><br />The intellectual merit of this project is embodied in the modernization of the Emulab testbed and the software that manages it. The technical work of the project involved the construction and integration of a new server cluster, as well as the integration and modification of large, complex software systems. Accomplishing these enhancements was challenging not only due to issues of scale and complexity, but also operationally: i.e., maintaining testbed availability to users during upgrades. One undergraduate student contributed to the hardware expansion of the testbed, and a second contributed to Emulab's support for Docker-based experiment configuration.<br /><br />The broader impacts of this project are primarily found in the new research that the enhanced testbed is supporting, now and in the future. As of the end of the project, the Utah Emulab site had almost 6,400 users from approximately 933 locations around the world. Through the various portals to Emulab, users ran over 10,900 experiments in the final twelve months of the project, allocating more than 62,200 physical nodes for their experiments. The R430 nodes in particular are continuously and heavily utilized. As a result of this project, the Utah Emulab testbed is equipped to support sizable experiments that seek to advance the state of the art in computer virtualization, cloud computing, and datacenter-related topics. Because Emulab is available to users worldwide, without cost to them, it enables thousands of researchers and students, and hundreds of individual research projects, to run realistic and relevant experiments that would otherwise not be possible.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/26/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Eric&nbsp;N&nbsp;Eide</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1513121/1513121_10372180_1611720436489_emulab-portal--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1513121/1513121_10372180_1611720436489_emulab-portal--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Emulab web portal front page\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1513121/1513121_10372180_1611720436489_emulab-portal--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Emulab web portal front page\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This project supported the transition from Emulab's original web interface to the \"portal\" interface, shown in this image.
