 "awd_abstract_narration": "The PI will work on the birational classification of algebraic varieties.  The minimal model program is an ambitious program to classify varieties up to birational equivalence.  To finish the program and to establish existence of minimal models, it suffices to show termination of flips.  The PI will use recent results concerning ACC for the log canonical threshold to attack termination.  A related project is to study birational boundedness of Fano varieties, especially the conjecture of Borisov-Alexeev-Borisov.  Birational geometry also offers a potential way to study vector bundles on projective space, to be used as a means to attack Hartshorne's conjectures.  Finally, the PI also plans to study the connection between birational geometry, foliations and the abundance conjecture.\r\n\r\nAlgebraic Geometry is one of the oldest and most challenging of areas of research in mathematics, which combines some very classical geometry, for example that of conic sections and the more modern techniques of algebra.  There has been a lot exciting recent work in higher dimensional geometry.  The PI will write a survey article for the Proceedings of the Royal Society on this work which is intended for a general scientific literate audience and the PI will also try to impart some of the exciting research in algebraic geometry to undergraduate and graduate students in his teaching.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTogether with Morgan Brown, Roberto Svaldi and Runpu Zong, I wrote a\npaper that characterises toric varieties in terms of log pairs.  Toric\nvarieties have a special role in algebraic geometry as they have a\nrelatively simple description.\n\nTogether with Christopher Hacon and Chenyang Xu, I wrote a paper on\nboundedness of the moduli functor of varieties of general type.\nAlgebraic varieties, the zeroes of polynomials, come in many different\nshapes.  The easiest examples are curves in the plane, which Newton\nshowed describe all possible motions of satellites orbiting the earth\nor the sun.  For quadratic polynomials we group all possible curves\ninto four basic types or shapes; circles, ellipses, parabolae and\nhyperbolae.  Hacon, Xu and I were able to show in much more generality\nthat if one bounds the degree of the polynomials then there are still\nonly finitely many different shapes.  Our results deal with curves,\nsurfaces and geometry in all dimensions.\n\nChristopher Hacon and I were recognised for our work in birational\ngeometry by the award of the breakthrough prize in mathematics.  \nA lot of this work was completed under this grant. \n\nWe described our joint work with Chenyang Xu at a meeting of all\nalgebraic geometers, which is held every ten years.  We also described\nour work to a general audience at a conference after the breakthrough\nprize.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/26/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James Mckernan"
