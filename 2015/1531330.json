 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, developing a high efficiency solar power enabled aerial instrument that incorporates sensory and processing requirements into the design methodology, focuses on the development of a (robotic) instrument that fills a niche in certain applications (i.e., small scale solar powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)). The work involves the creation of a platform for real-world information gathering applications with special focus on robust navigation, distributed sensing, and collaborative scenarios. In particular, the development of a small scale solar powered UAV provides a robotic platform capable of communication, sensory coverage, and flight endurance unattainable through traditional UAV design. Existing UAVs utilizing solar power are constrained to large aircraft designs requiring a traditional runway for takeoff and landing. In contrast, electric powered small scale UAVs suffer from minimal flight time. Additionally, aerial robots provide significant advantages over ground based systems as they are unaffected by terrain and obstacles, and provide an information-rich vantage point from the air. Conventional aerial robots are significantly limited by their flight time and therefore their deployment is severely restricted. Flight time has been the central limitation for airborne sensory information and has prevented experimental research and real-world applications from being performed. The development of a high efficiency aircraft that leverages solar energy as a resource provides a solution to the flight time problem.\r\n\r\nThe methodologies mentioned involve the incorporation of hierarchical planning methods that include high-level reasoning for the optimal number of UAVs/sensors required, and low-level reasoning for efficient sensor placement throughout the environment. Specifically, the use of solar powered UAV platforms will enable work in the areas of precision agriculture and environmental science, requiring strong demand for high endurance systems capable of supporting a variety of sensor and measurement units. (For example, timely and repetitive relevant information regarding crop health is necessary for corrective actions to be implemented.) Additionally, collaborative operation of dynamically placed sensor platforms and devices can only be enabled through the use of small solar powered airplanes like the ones to be implemented. The instrument that this project funds enables work in application areas that require continuous and repetitive operation such as Energy, Environment, Agriculture, etc. Consequently, this work addresses the\r\n- Development of a small scale solar powered platform that is capable of multi-day flight, \r\n- Experimental validation of the scaled down solar UAV instrument, \r\n- Long-term solar powered flight planning based on sensory data collected, and\r\n- Creation of benchmarks that will allow comprehensive evaluation of the small solar powered UAV instrument.",
