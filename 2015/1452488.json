 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program grant is to enable the design of innovative nonlinear metamaterials for acoustic and elastic wave control with reversible switching between pre-designed sets of complementary functionalities. The wave control strategy is enabled by the use of internal material nonlinearities as a vehicle to couple the qualitative dynamic response of the material system to distinguishing characteristics of the impinging wave. The approach will result in the first comprehensive and versatile platform to design broad families of programmable metamaterial architectures that can reconfigure their response to different external tuning parameters, or autonomously adapt their performance to evolving operational and environmental conditions. This functional switching is achieved without macroscopic shape or size changes in the material systems, thereby allowing their use as integrated structural elements. The approach is well suited for important engineering applications including vibration control, blast protection, sound manipulation, and cloaking of underwater vehicles and structures. The project will promote the use of laser vibrometry for dynamic testing of structures with complex geometries, and will develop new visualization-based teaching tools for simplifying the learning experience in the fields of structural dynamics and acoustics.\r\n\r\nThe research strategy revolves around the idea of nonlinearity-induced modal mixing. Through the generation of higher harmonics, the dynamic response of a nonlinear crystal can undergo jumps across the multiple available wave propagation modes; as a result, the system experiences a blend of mode shapes and displays a behavior that is typically associated with high-frequency regimes even while subjected to low-frequency excitations. The reversible activation and deactivation of nonlinearity is obtained either via external parameter tuning or as a spontaneous response to changes in the amplitude of excitation. The research team will model a broad spectrum of candidate metamaterial architectures, including granular crystals and soft cellular materials, with the double scope of identifying optimal configurations and providing a mechanistic insight in the observed phenomena. Experimental tests using a 3D laser vibrometer will be conducted to validate the theoretical findings and assess the measurability and magnitude of the induced wave manipulation effects.",

Mechanical metamaterials are structural materials consisting of networks of repetitive structural elements. While the individual internal elements are simple in geometry and behavior, their aggregation in space results in complex and unconventional functionalities at the global scale. Specifically, metamaterials are endowed with unique vibration and wave control capabilities. These include bandgap filtering, i.e., the ability to filter waves in certain frequency ranges, and wave directionality, i.e., the ability to channel the energy of a wave along prescribed directions. These characteristics make metamaterials appealing for applications in vibration and sound isolation, acoustic cloaking, and seismic shielding, as well as for the design of smart actuators, sensors and switches. Our project objective was to endow metamaterials with tunability, thus turning them from passive systems with a fixed set of properties to programmable devices whose response can be adjusted and tailored to evolving operating conditions. This capability will open the door to a more widespread adoption of metamaterial concepts in practical engineering applications.</p>\n<p>The overarching idea of this project was to exploit the nonlinearity embedded in a metamaterial response as the main mechanism for tunability. The signature feature of our take on tunability is that the acoustic tuning is not achieved at the expense of other important static properties of the media. Specifically, the tuning process does not alter the shape or size of the material, or hinder its intrinsic load bearing capabilities. The strategy that we have put forth is based on the notion of nonlinear higher harmonic generation, whereby the response of a nonlinear system excited at a given frequency contains frequencies that are multiples of the fundamental one. We have been able to show that the harmonics generated in metamaterials can tap into a rich and complex modal landscape available at higher frequencies, thereby activating a plethora of response mechanisms. Moreover, if the modes available at higher frequencies happen to be complementary to those available at lower frequencies, the harmonics will trigger mechanisms of response that can be highly complementary to the main character of the fundamental excitation, thus enriching the default functionalities of the media.</p>\n<p>Figure 1 reports an example of a nonlinear lattice architecture studied in the project. One can see that the second harmonic propagates along a 45-degree directional pattern that is vastly different from that of the fundamental wave, which instead travels predominantly along the horizontal and vertical directions. Interestingly, this tuning effect can be turned on and off by merely playing with the amplitude of excitation. Harmonic generation is especially evident in waveguides. In these systems, we have shown that it is possible to take advantage of particular wave propagation conditions, known as phase matching conditions, to boost the strength of the nonlinear effects. Figure 3 shows the results of experiments we have conducted on metamaterial waveguides with internal resonators. We have shown that, for sufficiently large amplitudes of excitation, an initially flexural wave can nonlinearly trigger a secondary higher-frequency axial wave. More importantly, even if the excitation is extremely long-wavelength and therefore insensitive to the periodic structure, thanks to the nonlinear mode conversion, the waveguide manages to distill and trap energy within its resonators. This result documents the ability to harvest energy even from low-frequency inputs, thus overcoming one of the limitations of classical harvesters based on metamaterial concepts. For 2D systems, our most convincing set of results has been obtained using lattices of magnets, in which the nonlinearity is embedded in the repulsive interactions between magnets. Finally, the project has allowed us to explore the opportunities posed by the interplay of cubic and quadratic nonlinearities, which we have exploited to conceptually design programmable acoustic switches, as visually summarized in Fig. 2.</p>\n<p>The project has allowed the training of two PhD students, two postdoctoral scholars and several undergraduate students. The project has also inspired didactic and outreach activities. The knowledge acquired from the project has informed the update of teaching material for an existing graduate course and the development of a new short course on the topic of wave propagation in periodic structures. On the outreach front, we have continued our partnership with local high schools, through interactive events centered on the topic of metamaterials and the involvement in a student research-mentoring program. The outreach events have involved hands-on demonstration sessions led by the PI with the assistance of undergraduate students. Similar demonstrations have been held in the department during open house events and other initiatives organized to promote STEM disciplines among K-12 students. Finally, the metamaterial prototypes fabricated for our experiments have become part of a gallery of samples to be showcased at future outreach events.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/27/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Stefano&nbsp;Gonella</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1452488/1452488_10346913_1616555936939_Complementarity_Directionality--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1452488/1452488_10346913_1616555936939_Complementarity_Directionality--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Complementarity_Directionality\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1452488/1452488_10346913_1616555936939_Complementarity_Directionality--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Complementarity_Directionality\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Nonlinear enrichment of the wave directionality in a brick-wall lattice: the fundamental wave travels vertically and horizontally, while the nonlinearly generated second harmonic travels along the 45 degree directions.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Stefano Gonella</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stefano&nbsp;Gonella</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Complementarity_Directionality</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1452488/1452488_10346913_1616555583803_Quadratic_Cubic_Interplay--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1452488/1452488_10346913_1616555583803_Quadratic_Cubic_Interplay--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Quadratic_Cubic_Interplay\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1452488/1452488_10346913_1616555583803_Quadratic_Cubic_Interplay--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Quadratic_Cubic_Interplay\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Amplitude controlled activation and deactivation of functionalities enabled by interplay of nonlinearities.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Stefano Gonella</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stefano&nbsp;Gonella</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Quadratic_Cubic_Interplay</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1452488/1452488_10346913_1616555459789_Nonlinear_Waveguide_Experiments--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1452488/1452488_10346913_1616555459789_Nonlinear_Waveguide_Experiments--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Nonlinear_Waveguide_Experiments\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1452488/1452488_10346913_1616555459789_Nonlinear_Waveguide_Experiments--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Nonlinear_Waveguide_Experiments\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Metamaterial waveguide with internal resonators exhibiting subwavelength wave trapping behavior enabled by nonlinearity.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Stefano Gonella</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Stefano&nbsp;Gonella</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Nonlinear_Waveguide_Experiments</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
