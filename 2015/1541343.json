 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bucks County Community College (Bucks) is creating a high-throughput science research network to support Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) faculty and students.  This cyber infrastructure (CI) upgrade will coincide with their construction of a new STEM building and future renovation of the current STEM facilities at Newtown (main) campus. This initiative upgrades Bucks CI to support research with a science DMZ to prioritize data transfers among systems located at Bucks, offers an outdoor high performance Wi-Fi network as a science DMZ extension, and provides Internet2 to support faculty and student research through the statewide education network.  The dedicated, advanced network allows for the speeds, packet integrity, and lack of interference from competing applications for research-based data transfer, enabling the faculty and their students to conduct their activities. Bucks' lead institution partner, the University of Pennsylvania, is aiding with design and technical services to ensure the science DMZ meets current and future needs and is sustainable by Bucks. \r\n\r\nThis next-generation infrastructure establishes a dedicated network and provides data transfer services to support broader scientific research and applications. This benefits projects investigating improved forms of image recognition, applied engineering, and other computational sciences. With the bounty of research at the University of Pennsylvania, faculty and students at Bucks have access to scientific domains at a level not previously available, extending our intellectual opportunities. Additionally, with advanced manufacturing, nursing and other science-related activity in the county and surrounding area, the science DMZ indirectly benefits the people, educational institutions, and businesses of the region.",
