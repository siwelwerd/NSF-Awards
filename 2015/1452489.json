Maio of New Mexico State University. Professor Maio is developing novel and efficient approaches to advance simple starting materials into more complex and valuable products, specifically by exploring underdeveloped methods to access functionalized enamides. Currently, few methods exist for the selective generation of these synthetic targets that are also present in a number of medicinally relevant compounds. Professor Maio is positioning this work as the key to unlocking selective syntheses for several enamide-containing macrolide natural products.\r\n\r\nAs a means to integrate these research objectives with a strong commitment to the training of future scientists, Professor Maio is developing activities to incorporate teaching and education into the research experience. These initiatives include the development of a summer workshop in synthetic chemistry for undergraduate and graduate students that focuses on advanced topics that build upon the undergraduate experience. Students acquire skills to arrive at innovative solutions to complex problems. Students learn how to safely handle new and known chemical entities, to communicate their work, and develop integrity through exposure to high standards and ethical guidelines.",
