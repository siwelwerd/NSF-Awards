The symposium will focus on dry granular materials, which are suspensions in which the only interaction between particles occurs when they contact each other.  The symposium will provide a way for leading research groups in the U.S. to interact with their European counterparts and other researchers from around the world. Participation by junior researchers will be encouraged.\r\n\r\nDry granular materials appear in a variety of important industrial and natural processes.  These materials pose special problems when they are processed in the dense state, because they can undergo a transition between a flowing and jammed state.  The characteristics of jamming depend not only on the granular material but also on the process that leads to jamming.  This symposium will cover a range of topics for such materials including packings of frictionless and frictional particles, granular suspensions, constitutive laws for dense flows, shear-induced jamming and shear thickening, and geophysical applications involving granular materials.",
