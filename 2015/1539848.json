Jackson (University of Georgia)\r\n\r\nERA-CAPS Collaborators:  Roberto Papa (Universita Politecnica delle Marche, Italy), Alisdair R. Fernie (Max-Planck-Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology, Germany), and Andreas Graner (Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research, Germany)\r\n\r\nWorldwide, legumes serve an important nutritional role as a source of protein, minerals, vitamins, and dietary fibers, and their ability to fix nitrogen (i.e. convert nitrogen in the atmosphere into a form that can be used by the plant) makes legumes natural contributors to sustainable agriculture. As domesticated crops, legumes have adapted to growth in many different environments, but the genetic basis for such adaptation is largely unknown. This project will take advantage of large gene bank collections of two legume species, common bean and runner bean, to discover the genes responsible for adaptation to new, changing, and variable environments. The results will allow better use of the genetic resources represented by these gene banks for improvement of legume crops. The project will include collaborators in the U.S., Colombia, Italy and Germany.  Exchanges of students among the participating research groups will offer opportunities to learn new techniques and integrate information across the coordinating research efforts. In addition, outreach to undergraduates from the Southwest U.S. will provide exposure to hands-on research experiences in plant genomics. \r\n\r\nIn this project, multi-location, multi-year field evaluations of large gene bank collections will be combined with high-throughput genomic tools to understand the genetic basis of adaptation in the legumes common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and runner bean (P. coccineus).  Approximately 10,000 common bean and 1,000 runner bean accessions will be genotyped using a DNA sequencing approach and tested in contrasting environments and conditions in Europe (higher latitude) and South America (near the Equator) to associate genes with adaptation to environmental variables, such as day length, temperature, altitude, and rainfall. The two Phaseolus species have contrasting life histories, reproductive systems, and population structures, providing an opportunity to compare different adaptation paths. Sequence information will be complemented with transcriptomic and metabolomics profiling on a select subset of accessions to produce datasets that will be used to build models of how common bean adapted to new environments after its dispersal from two domestication centers in Mesoamerica and the Southern Andes.  Prospectively, this information will be useful for developing new crop varieties adapted to changing or variable environments.",

Does this adaptation rely on pre-existing standing variation, <em>de novo</em> variation, outcrossing among domesticated varieties, or outcrossing with wild relatives? This project seeks to research these possibilities for the case of common bean (<em>Phaseolus vulgaris</em>), the main grain legume for human consumption. Common bean was the first crop for which more than one domestication was demonstrated: one in Mesoamerica and the other in the southern Andes (between southern Peru and northwestern Argentina). All cultivars around the world derive ultimately from one of these two domestications. From its two centers of domestication, the common bean has been disseminated within the Americas (e.g., Brazil) and beyond (e.g., Europe and Africa). This project is a collaboration with European scientists who raise the specific question about adaptation of common bean across the diverse landscapes of their continent. For the sake of comparison, we investigated adaptation of common bean following introduction of the two domesticates into Brazil. This country is the largest producer and consumer of the crop worldwide. Beans are an important part of everyday diet of Brazilians; indeed, the national dish is called after beans (<em>feijoada</em>). Here we used a newer sequencing technique called Genotyping-By-Sequencing (GBS) to evaluate genetic diversity and climate adaptation of 259 landraces (farmer varieties) distributed throughout the country, both in subtropical climates in the Northeast and temperate climates in the South (Fig. 1). Our research confirmed the prior observation that bean varieties in the country are a mix of 20% Andean domestication and 80% Mesoamerican domestication. Surprisingly, there was limited gene flow between these two gene pools. This was not because of a lack of opportunities for hybridization, because there was otherwise evidence of extensive hybridization within the Mesoamerican domesticates (Fig. 2).&nbsp; This observation is unique, and its significance is as yet unknown. Do these hybrid accessions have improved or broader adaptation compared to n0n-hybrid accessions? Further research involving multi-location, multi-year testing is needed. Further data show that there is a low correlation between genetic and geographic distances, i.e., there is high genetic diversity among physically close genotypes. This observation suggests there is a lot of movement of bean varieties among locations of the bean-growing area, which might obscure local adaptation patterns. Associations with temperature and rainfall were only significant for the rainy season variables, perhaps because the rainy season corresponds to the growing season (Fig. 3). Two chromosome regions each were identified for precipitation (chromosomes Pv02 and Pv08) and temperature (Pv04 and Pv09) (Fig. 4). Among market classes (see Fig. 1), the mulatinho class was grown in significantly drier (average of 479 mm vs. 598-687 mm) and hotter (22.4 ?C vs. 18.0-20.1 ?C) environments. The significance of these results is severalfold. 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Particularly striking is the strong differentiation between the Andean and Mesoamerican gene pools among Brazilian landraces with a low frequency of hybridization between the two gene pools. This is in contrast with findings from Europe where over 40% of bean accessions showed signs of hybridization. The reasons for this difference in differentiation are not well understood, but could be related to differences in eco-geographic race composition, farmer and consumer selection stringency, and environmental selection regimes. These results will be compared with results obtained in the European sample of the overall ERA-CAPS project to study the differences among the two introductions. This analysis shows that the main climatic variables differentiating locations within the bean-growing area in Brazil are related primarily to rainfall and much less to temperature, confirming earlier observations This observation is consistent with limited latitudinal spread of the Brazilian bean-growing area compared to its latitudinal spread. It is also consistent with the limited altitudinal variation. These results will be compared with selection regimes operating in Europe, where multiple gradients are present potentially, such as the West-East Mediterranean gradient (from the Iberian Peninsula to the Caucasus), South-North gradient (from the Mediterranean to Scandinavia), and a West-East Northern European gradient (maritime climate in the British Islands to continental climate in Eastern Europe). Finally, the results of the GWAS analyses provide candidate genes or chromosome regions that can be used to test indirect marker-assisted selection for drought and heat tolerance to develop more resilient bean varieties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/10/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Paul&nbsp;Gepts</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1539848/1539848_10362331_1562783571023_Brazilbeans--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1539848/1539848_10362331_1562783571023_Brazilbeans--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Brazilian beans\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1539848/1539848_10362331_1562783571023_Brazilbeans--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Brazilian beans\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 1.
