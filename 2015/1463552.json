 "awd_abstract_narration": "Joel Bowman of Emory University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to develop sophisticated computational approaches to model and delve deeply into the properties of water and its interactions with ions and other molecules that are important in living systems. Water is the most important substance for sustaining all life on our planet.  Humans are nearly 70% water by weight.  Water is seen in liquid, solid (ice) and gaseous (clouds) forms every day.  Although it is all around us, water is also a unique substance that has intriguing properties. Water is made from large numbers of simple H2O molecules that stick to each other by making \"hydrogen bonds.\" These hydrogen bonds help give water its unique character.   Water also interacts with many other important molecules such as proteins and ions, thereby playing a major role in sustaining life.  The Bowman group develops models of water and its interactions with other molecules and ions, and uses these models to predict and explain the results of experiments.  They work closely with leading experimental research groups. \r\n\r\nBowman and coworkers apply rigorous methods of quantum chemistry and specialized fitting methods to obtain highly accurate, non-empirical, many-body potential and dipole moment surfaces describing neat water, ion-water, and ion-pair water.  These potentials and dipole moment surfaces are used with sophisticated quantum treatments of the vibrational dynamics to obtain highly accurate and predictive observables, such as the IR spectra, vibrational relaxation, radial distribution functions, etc.  The software for the potentials, dipole moment surfaces and vibrational analysis, which is very general and can be used for any polyatomic molecule or molecular cluster will be made freely available to others in the community via a web interface.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report\n\n \n\nThis project is a theoretical and computational study of how molecules, both charged (ions) and uncharged (neutrals) bond to molecules of water.  Water is essential to life on earth and possibly also extraterrestrial sources of life.  So, the study of pure water, from drinking water to clouds and ice, and solutions of molecules in water (sea water) has been the focus of much research in Chemistry, Biology and Physics and for many years. \n\n \n\nThe approach taken in this project is physics-based, in that it uses the laws and equations of quantum mechanics to study the properties of water and solutions at the most microscopic, molecular level.  Fundamentally, water is a collection of H2O molecules and H2O is itself a collection of electrons and nuclei.  So, starting with the known forces between electrons and nuclei and the quantum mechanical Schroedinger equation, it is possible, though difficult, to obtain a precise and predictive understanding of water and solutions.  This approach is being undertaken by roughly one hundred research groups world-wide.  The research undertaken by this project has resulted in highly accurate mathematical representations of the interactions of water molecules (\"neat water\") and also ion-water interactions.  A particular focus has been on the acidic solutions.  A so-called many-body representation of the interactions o the hydrogen ion H+ with water molecules has been developed and applied in numerous calculations that are aimed directly at experimental studies of proton hydration.  This work, reported in numerous joint publications, has resulted in detailed and fundamental understanding of the hydration of environment of the proton\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joel M Bowman"
