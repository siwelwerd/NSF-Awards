 "awd_abstract_narration": "To address the national need to increase the number of STEM graduates, this NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at the University of Great Falls will support 16 academically talented students who have expressed interest in STEM careers.  Biology, chemistry, and mathematics majors will participate in comprehensive program of academic supports including (a) a course on STEM research preparation, (b) weekly professional development meetings, (c) science writing enrichment through the Learning Community, and (d) peer-led study sessions.  Initiatives to recruit and retain Native American students will be reinforced by a counselor responsible for engaging these (and other interested students) in activities that will integrate them into the life of the college. Scholarships for academically strong STEM students, who may not otherwise be able to afford college, will increase the number of STEM graduates prepared to promote innovation and competiveness in national and regional industries.\r\n\r\nThe retention strategies proposed in this project are grounded in the current literature.  The project elements are designed to promote students' intellectual growth and the development of skills that are highly valued in the workplace (communication, critical thinking, and collaboration).   Students will also benefit from early exposure to research and career opportunities.  The external evaluator will investigate the project's impact on student satisfaction, participation, and retention to graduation.  Formative evaluation will include student feedback on the effectiveness of the recruitment plan, courses, and other academic supports (surveys and focus groups).  Summative evaluation will consist of an analysis of motivation for students who persist in the project and students who do not.  The active recruitment plan includes development of a video that will be disseminated by the Office of Admissions to multiple stakeholders (K-12 schools, industry, and community partners) and made accessible through a website and the Montana Office of Public Instruction.  Project results should add to the knowledge base on effective tools for retaining a diverse community of students in STEM.  Outcomes will be presented through a university website and at Regional Lilly Conferences on teaching and learning.  A manuscript will be submitted to the Journal on Excellence in College Teaching, Learning Communities Journal, or Journal on Centers for Teaching and Learning.",
