 "awd_abstract_narration": "Power dissipation has become a fundamental barrier to scaling computing performance across all platforms from handheld, embedded systems, to laptops, to servers to data centers. Technology scaling down to the sub-nanometer regime has aided the growth in transistors per chip that has made multi-core architectures a power-efficient approach to harnessing parallelism and improving performance. The computing capabilities of these multi-core architectures can be unleashed only if the underlying Network-on-Chip (NoC) connecting the cores can provide the required bandwidth within the power budget of the chip. However, the design of power-efficient, low-latency and high-bandwidth NoCs using traditional metallic interconnects that can scale to 1000 cores and beyond, is proving to be a significant challenge of enormous proportions. Research has shown that emerging technologies such as photonics and wireless have the potential to alleviate the critical bandwidth, power, and latency challenges of future NoCs. However, hybrid NoC designs taking advantages of both photonics and wireless technologies have not been explored.\r\n \r\nThis research proposes to lay the groundwork for completely re-thinking the NoC design and proposes to explore heterogeneity of emerging interconnect technology for designing performance scalable, and power-efficient NoCs. The overall objective is to combine multiple technologies to achieve our challenging goals of (1) scalability to 1000 cores, (2) power efficiency of at least a 50% power reduction as compared to the state-of-the-art metallic interconnects, and (3) high bandwidth and low latency across a wide variety of applications. First, at the architecture level, optics will be deployed for short-range (< 100 cores) to improve local communication and wireless for long-range communication in order to scale the number of cores to 1000 by providing sufficient global bandwidth. Second, at the circuit level, hybrid transceiver architectures will be explored to integrate novel ultra-low power wireless circuits based on SiGe/BiCMOS technology with optical waveguides and ring-resonators to provide the large bandwidth desired for kilo-core designs. Furthermore, wireless communication requirements will be addressed by designing mm-wave/THz frequency broadband and directional antennas based on advanced 3D printing technology. This proposal describes a transformative and viable approach combining technology, architecture, algorithms and applications research for designing scalable and energy-efficient NoCs. The cross-cutting nature of this research will foster new research directions in several areas, spanning technology/energy-aware NoC design, novel computer architectures, and cutting-edge modeling and simulations tools for emerging technologies.",

First, we designed an architecture - called Reconfigurable Optical-Wireless Network-on-Chip (R-OWN) - to exploit the advantages of the emerging technologies while circumventing the disadvantages [1]. We utilize optics for a smaller number of cores (called a cluster) and utilize wireless technology to connect the clusters to facilitate irregular communication. In this architecture, the wireless links are made reconfigurable at runtime to incorporate diverse communication patterns. Second, we extended the energy-efficiency analysis by projecting ideal and conservative wireless energy-efficiency for 256 and 1024 core architectures [2]. For the proposed OWN architecture, we developed an on-chip communication platform for combining two diverse technologies into an integrated whole that can scale to a large number of cores. We discussed the advances and breakthroughs needed by the wireless technology to meet the bandwidth demands of on-chip communication. We simulated the design for wireless technology centered at 100 GHz with CMOS to validate the wireless designs. Third, to minimize power, area, and complexity for wireless interconnects, several novel circuit architectures relevant for the implementation of minimalist OOK transceivers have been developed, including ultra-compact oscillators based on independent-gate FinFETs and a power amplifier (PA). Fourth, by effectively merging photonic and wireless technologies, we evaluated deadlock-free routing for scalable 64 and 256 core architectures [3]. We also studied the sustainability of the design by analyzing the power savings that can be achieved by ultra-low power electrical circuits and architectures.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we explored using photonic [5-7] technology to enhance performance, energy efficiency, and scalability of emerging neural network accelerators [5-9]. We first designed an interconnection network [5] to leverage the superior properties of photonics such as distance-independent latency and ease of broadcast, and overcome the fundamental limitations of metallic-based interconnects. The shift of dataflow optimization goals (e.g., increasing spatial parallelism) due to the introduction of photonic technology was also examined. We then explored architecting analog neural network accelerator with photonic devices [6-7]. The use of Mach-Zehnder modulators for multi-wavelength multiplication and star couplers for multicasting makes our design distinct from other photonic accelerators and improves latency and energy efficiency. We aslo studied communication optimization in specific new applications (e.g., graph convolutional neural network [9]) and platforms (e.g., chiplet-based architecture [5, 10]).</p>\n<p><strong>Publications:</strong></p>\n<p>1.
