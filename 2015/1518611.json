 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urbanization is expanding at a global scale, with two-thirds of the world's people expected to reside in cities in the next 40 years. Urbanization causes many wildlife species to decline, but some species capitalize on new resources, especially food, provided by humans in urban and suburban habitats. Shifts in wildlife ecology in response to intentional (e.g., bird feeders) or accidental (e.g., garbage) feeding by humans can alter their exposure and susceptibility to infectious diseases. This can happen when human-provided food causes wildlife to gather at high densities and mix with species they naturally would not contact, increasing their exposure to pathogens. Supplemental feeding could also affect an animal's ability to fight infection by boosting body condition and immune defense; alternatively, human-altered diets might change the makeup of their gut bacteria and increase their, susceptibility to infection. This research project directly examines whether food provided to wildlife changes their interactions with pathogens, from the colonization of individual hosts to disease spread across the landscape, with associated disease risks for humans. The researchers will focus on interactions between the gut pathogen Salmonella and White Ibis in South Florida; these wading birds have recently shifted from feeding in natural wetlands to urban parks, where they subsist on leftover food and handouts from people. The researchers will use experiments, field observations and radio-tracking technology to investigate how urban diet influences Salmonella infection through changes in condition and immune defense of individual birds, and movement and flocking behaviors of White Ibis across different sites and habitat types. Mathematical models will be developed to forecast the spread of infection in relation to human feeding in urban parks.  Through the high visibility and public appeal of urban White Ibises, the researchers will involve citizen scientist volunteers in reporting their observations, and will engage in outreach efforts to educate the public on the health-related effects of feeding wildlife. This interdisciplinary project will also provide numerous opportunities for training undergraduates, graduate students, and research professionals, including individuals from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThis research represents the most comprehensive study to date of how wildlife responses to changing food resources in human-dominated habitats influence their interactions with infectious diseases. Activities integrate field studies, captive challenge experiments and mathematical modeling to address three questions: (i) How does provisioning influence pathogen susceptibility, shedding, and impacts on individual hosts? (ii) How does provisioning influence local-scale contacts and transmission dynamics? and (iii) How does provisioning alter host movements, pathogen transmission and impacts at the landscape level?  The first question will be answered by quantifying individual-level diet, immune defense, pathogen shedding and indicators of condition/health in urban and natural habitats.  The researchers will further test whether gastrointestinal microbiota depend on diet and habitat type through work with wild and captive birds. The second question will be addressed through measures of host contact, including flock size and species composition in urban and natural habitats, and by measuring the prevalence and genotypes of Salmonella. The third question will be addressed by using geospatial tracking technology and citizen science reporting to characterize the movements of ibises, and identify ecological correlates of habitat use and infection metrics. Field and experimental work will directly inform a mathematical model that links diet to pathogen spread, to predict changes in infection prevalence and impacts.  This modeling framework can be applied more broadly to understand how other wildlife species and their pathogens might respond to future urbanization and associated shifts in food resources.",

Adult urban ibis were also infected with Salmonella spp more frequently than natural ibis. We also showed that ibis that live in urban environments are eating food provided by people (either from garbage or as hand-outs) and their overall diet is different than natural ibis. This diet had an impact on their gastrointestinal microbiome (the bacteria in their gut) and lower GI bacterial diversity was correlated with higher Salmonella. In fact, urban ibis go back to the same urban sites repeatedly, and those sites were contaminated with Salmonella spp. Although the body condition of urban ibis was worse than natural ibis, they had less mites/lice, possibly because they had more time for preening, as they were provisioned with food by people.</p>\n<p>We established a captive colony of ibis to study Salmonella because it can cause mortality in young birds. Even very young ibis were infected with Salmonella, but clear it and seem to develop immunity as adults. When we tried to infect ibis that had been previously infected (but had cleared it), we could not. We also studied the impact of feeding an anthropogenic diet (mirroring what ibis are provided in urban parks) on their immunity.&nbsp;The anthropogenic diet depressed a portion of the immune system that has the ability to kill&nbsp;<em>Salmonella&nbsp;</em>in culture,&nbsp;but there was little effect on immunological measures.

This indicates that exposure to urban habitats impacts ibis health in the opposite direction of what was predicted explaining why ibis have been so successful living in cities. In the wild,&nbsp;urban young are infected with Salmonella at much higher rates than those born in natural environments, likely because their parents are feeding them food from contaminated sources. In fact, the types of Salmonella we identified in urban ibis match those that come from urban sources.&nbsp;Although we have not documented deaths due to Salmonella in either adult or young ibis, ibis serve as really good indicators of Salmonella in the environment.&nbsp;We developed a mathematical model to understand and predict the primary transmission pathways for Salmonella, which indicated that environmental sources are the greatest influence on infection.</p>\n<p>Finally, our studies will help predict whether ibis (and other urban species) will successfully adapt to living in cities on the long-term. We started comparing the productivity of urban-breeding and natural-breeding ibises and found that urban rookeries can be highly productive.
