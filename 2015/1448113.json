 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project will enable a new class of smaller, more efficient, and cheaper motors to be built. Since the motors use 43% - 46% of the world?s electricity, this has the potential to have one of the greatest impacts on overall electrical energy efficiency due to the shear amount of power this application uses. These unique windings will be sold to motor manufactures or be used in house to build motors and generators. By selling directly to existing motor manufacturers it will accelerate the penetration into the market. The market for windings is $2B and this approach has the potential for significant market share. This technology could impact wind generation, oil&gas drilling, industrial manufacturing, aerospace, mining, transportation, and any market using motors more than 20hp in size.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will develop a process that can be used to make electric motors and generators smaller, more efficient, and cheaper. This project will specifically address the ability of electric insulation of the motor windings to have high voltage capability and high thermal conductivity. This combination will allow better motor cooling and in turn higher slot current densities. These higher current densities will allow motors to be smaller which will result in more efficient and lower cost motors. The research completed in this program will show exactly how the necessary bending can be accomplished with a complex mechanical simulation of the bend as well as experimental proof of concept of the electrical insulating capability of this unique winding. Additionally, a machine design for accomplishing this winding design will be designed to show a path to the low cost that will be necessary for widespread adoption in the industry. This combination should demonstrate a high voltage withstand at a high thermal conductivity all at a low production cost.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nThe electric motor and generator market buys $80B annually and consumes more than 43% of the world\u00c6s electricity.  The size of these machines is determined by the ability to get heat out of the motor.  Much of the heat is generated in the winding through I2R heating and must escape through the electrical insulation surrounding the wires. This leads to a desire to have a winding with thermally-conductive covering that has sufficient electrical insulation and sufficient mechanical robustness.  Further, these windings must be cost effective to compete in this large market.  These formed the basis for the goals of this program.\n\n There are other improvements that can be made to improve the thermal performance of motors.  LC Drives is developing some of these approaches including in-slot cooling, but these are outside the scope of this program.  This program was focused on the development of a winding and insulation system and the associated manufacturing machine to build these windings.  A semi-automated machine is required to achieve the control necessary for quality windings.  It is also needed to achieve cost effective windings particularly if competing with random wound windings that are used on the majority of low cost motors.  The development of this semi-automated wire bending machine formed the majority of the work scope for this phase 1 program.  With this machine designed in this program, high performance, low cost windings will be able to be built that enable fundamentally smaller motors and generators.  These smaller motors and generators allow more power to be put in the same size space or the same power to be put in less space.  These are common drivers for purchase decisions of motors and generators.  Another advantage of a smaller motor is it has less inertia.  Machines that have to accelerate quickly or reverse direction are very sensitive to inertia and benefit greatly from the windings developed in this program.  For every motor and generator, there is a desire for lower cost and a smaller machine uses less iron, copper, and magnets resulting in lower cost.  Ultimately this benefit will help drive improvements developed in this program into the mainstream motor market.\n\nThis phase I and Ib program showed the feasibility of this approach and designed a semi-automated winding machine that meets the longer term manufacturing requirements for this motor construction approach.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nThe electric motor and generator market buys $80B annually and consumes more than 43% of the world\u00c6s electricity.
