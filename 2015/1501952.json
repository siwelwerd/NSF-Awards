It also incorporates a new method for trying to ensure that HCC students who matriculate to TAMU receive reverse transfer credit for their associate degrees at HCC. HVM modules are being developed for high school students that are aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards as part of a summer program for teachers. HCC is an open-access institution where over 70% of the students belong to under-represented minority groups and over half of students receive Pell grants. Offering the HVM certificate program at HCC allows underrepresented students a pathway to these high demand STEM careers.",
