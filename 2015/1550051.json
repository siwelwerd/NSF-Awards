 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the best ways to engage people in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) at a young age is through informal museum experiences. Yet, the research base on understanding how learning and engagement develops through these experiences is still emerging. Technology opens new ways to research these experiences to understand these processes better. In this proposal, researchers from Northwestern University and the Chicago Field Museum will collaborate to develop digital interactive displays to enhance the experience at various exhibits by providing additions varying in complexity from simple menu navigation, to 3D model manipulation, to fully interactive games. These will replace the typical static plaques that go along with an exhibit. In addition to enhancing the experience with the exhibits, these displays allow researchers to collect more data on people's interaction with exhibits, particularly touch screen information regarding how visitors interacted with the 3D models, games and touchscreens. The proposed research will help address questions regarding the role of games in learning, for instance, do these games provide enhanced motivation and learning, or do they limit social interaction and create small silos in the midst of a group experience? It will also answer questions about how creativity is fostered in these environments by observing interactions and combining that with the digital data collected for a fuller picture of the development of engagement and learning.\r\n\r\nResearchers from Northwestern University and the Chicago Field Museum will develop digital rails, interactive computer displays mounted on exhibit case railings that function as dynamic labels and provide enhanced experience features such as the integration of 3D modeling and games. They propose to augment the digital rails with near-field communication (NFC) tracking devices (RFID readers) to monitor amount of interaction and to link with user cell phones. They will collect NFC tracking data, computer logs of touch interaction, and interaction with mobile apps and observe visitor behavior around the interactive display cases. This early stage research study will employ design-based research to investigate this new form of interactive technology. Through iterating on observations and linking the observational data with the digitally collected data, the team will develop an understanding of the design principles for digital rails that best foster interactivity, social interaction, creativity, and learning of the material the exhibits focus on.",

Researchers from Northwestern University and The Field Museum engaged in design-based research on the use of interactive displays to help visitors learn about artifacts in the Great Hall of China, which is a 7,500 square-foot exhibit showcasing 350 artifacts from prehistoric times to early 20th-century China. The exhibit includes over 45 interactive touchscreen displays called <em>digital rails</em> spread throughout the exhibit. Digital rails allow visitors to seek additional information about the objects on display. They can select pictures of objects on the touchscreen and then select detailed stories about the objects. The central design tension with these displays is to harness the engagement of interactive digital media in a way that enhances, rather than detracts from, visitor appreciation of the authentic artifacts on display. There were three lines of research that explored the potential afforded by these displays. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first line of research pilot tested a mobile system for tracking visitor movement and enabling interactions between the digital rails and mobile devices. Visitor movements were tracked through a mobile application connected to blue tooth beacons the project mounted in the exhibit. In addition, when visitors with the mobile application are within range of a digital rail, the mobile application provides additional customized information about the exhibit. The results showed the potential of connecting the digital rails and mobile devices.</p>\n<p>The second line of research explored how visitors moved through the exhibit space and interacted with the digital rails. Visitor groups were observed as they moved through the China Hall exhibit. The movement of a subset of those visitors was tracked with the mobile application. Log data was collected for all of the digital rails. The three sources of data were generally consistent. Results showed that visitors typically interacted with roughly four of the 45 digital rails and spent around one minute interacting with the content. Researchers used these results to identify an important object in the exhibit that was the least-frequently visited. The objects in the least-frequently visited display case were central to one of the exhibit themes related to the development of social systems in the Bronze Age. This case became the focal point of the third line of research.</p>\n<p>Researchers drew upon on cognitive models of curiosity to develop and test two redesigns of this digital rail. Each design focused on a different strategy to spark visitors&rsquo; curiosity, interest, and engagement. The Big Questions redesign rotated large, provocative questions about objects in the case. Tapping on the question revealed information that answered the question along with links to additional information. This version drew upon a cognitive model of curiosity (knowledge gap) characterized by feelings of tension, frustration, and uncertainty around not knowing something&mdash;and the satisfaction one gets from sating this feeling. The questions were explicitly designed to pique visitor curiosity by highlighting unknown but obtainable information. The Timelines redesign provided an interactive timeline for visitors to explore the evolution of different Chinese characters over time. This timeline linked thematically to the objects in the case, which showed the earliest forms of writing. Visitors could seek additional information by selecting the &ldquo;tap-here-for-more&rdquo; link.&nbsp;This design drew upon an interest model of curiosity in which exploratory activity is initiated from the pleasure of finding out new information.</p>\n<p>Researchers unobtrusively video recorded 834 museum visitor groups interacting with the original or redesigned digital rails and analyzed visitor interaction and conversation. The results uncovered significant differences across the designs that suggest implications for the use of such technology in museums. Both the Big Questions and the Timelines redesigns were more likely to attract visitors to interact with the digital rail. However, in the Big Questions version, visitors were less likely to engage in interpretive talk than the Timelines or Original. Also, visitors tended to explore only one additional story screen after the attract screen. Once visitors read the answer to the question, their curiosity diminished without further curiosity inducing features. In the Timelines version, visitors were as likely to engage in interpretive talk as the original, but spent most of their time on the main timeline screen. They tended not to seek additional information related to the objects in the case.</p>\n<p><span style=\"white-space: pre;\"> </span>These results highlight the design tensions in using digital media to pique curiosity and enable conversation about museum objects. Bold, provocative questions on interactive exhibit displays might draw visitors in, but they can lead to relatively impoverished conversation. On the other hand, offering less text-heavy and more viscerally engaging displays can entice visitors to interact, but this approach can also train visitors&rsquo; attention on the displays themselves rather than on the objects they were meant to interpret.&nbsp; Future research will explore how combinations of these designs can enhance the visitor experience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/15/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Steven&nbsp;M&nbsp;Mcgee</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1550051/1550051_10389747_1513343001872_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1550051/1550051_10389747_1513343001872_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Authentic artifact with digital rail\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1550051/1550051_10389747_1513343001872_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Authentic artifact with digital rail\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A display case with authentic artifacts behind glass and an interactive digital rail (bottom).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Photo by Jessica Roberts</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Steven&nbsp;M&nbsp;Mcgee</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Authentic artifact with digital rail</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1550051/1550051_10389747_1513343153094_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1550051/1550051_10389747_1513343153094_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Screen shot of Original design\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1550051/1550051_10389747_1513343153094_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Screen shot of Original design\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Original design was based on the existing digital rail design, but with slightly modified text to match the other two conditions.
