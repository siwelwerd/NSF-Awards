 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Zhan Chen of The University of Michigan is constructing an analytical platform that combines several spectroscopic and imaging analytical techniques together for the\r\npurpose of developing a general methodology to determine the structure of surface immobilized enzymes and peptides and measure their activities simultaneously. The understanding of structure-function relationships of surface immobilized biological molecules provides\r\nfundamental knowledge for the preparation of biocatalysts for biofuel production, biosensors, and biochips with improved performance.  An outreach program developed by Professor Chen to teach surface chemistry to high school students promotes the students' interests in science. The broader impacts of this work include developing a widely applicable analytical platform, aiding in the development of better biocatalysts, biosensors, and biochips, and educating young researchers including female\r\nstudents and postdocs.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the development of a systematic approach by simultaneously applying linear/nonlinear vibrational spectroscopic and optical/fluorescence imaging techniques to elucidate the structure-function relationships of surface immobilized enzymes and peptides. An analytical platform which integrates sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy, attenuated total reflectance FTIR, optical microscopy, and fluorescence microscopy is constructed and allows for the simultaneous investigation of the structure and function of surface immobilized enzymes (e.g., beta-galactosidase and beta-glucosidase) and antimicrobial peptides\r\n(e.g., MSI-78).",
