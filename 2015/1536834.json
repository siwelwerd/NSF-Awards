 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sensors are critical components of virtually all technological systems, especially those that depend on control for safe and reliable operation. Control systems play a key role in automotive, aerospace, robotic, building, and process control applications. Safety-critical implementations have increased dramatically and will continue to grow as systems become increasingly autonomous. In the context of autonomous systems, sensors malfunctioning or failure can lead to severe degradation of performance, can destabilize the control system and may produce destructive control inputs. All of these events can severely compromise the operation of the system under consideration and may lead to tragic consequences, such as loss of human life. For these reasons, there is a compelling need for techniques that assess the integrity of sensors that are critical to a system?s operation. The investigation of such techniques is the objective of this project, which is expected to contribute to improvements to the reliability of safety-critical autonomous systems. \r\n \r\nThis project focuses on a technique for sensor fault detection called sensor-to-sensor identification (S2SID). S2SID takes advantage of freely available and unknown external or ambient excitation to identify a sensor-to-sensor model called a pseudo transfer function (PTF), which is independent of the excitation. A PTF is a time-domain generalization of a transmissibility used in structural dynamics. S2SID is performed under healthy sensor conditions in the presence of unknown excitation. Then using a validation data set, again induced by unknown external or ambient excitation, the identified PTF can be used to compute a sensor-to-sensor residual. This residual, which is the discrepancy between the predicted sensor output based on the identified PTF and the actual measurements, provides a metric for detecting and diagnosing sensor faults. Unlike frequency-domain techniques based on transmissibility operators, this project focuses on time-domain identification methods that can exploit transient signal characteristics, which can degrade frequency-domain estimates. S2SID will be demonstrated on flexible aircraft applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\nTechnological systems depend on sensors to collect data for decision making and automation.  In critical applications affecting health and safety, however, the failure of a sensor can have catastrophic consequences.  On June 1, 2009, at 2:14 AM UTC, Air France flight 447, en route from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, crashed in the Atlantic Ocean, killing all 228 passengers onboard.  The cause of this disaster, based on data from the flight recorder recovered two years after the accident, was linked to erroneous airspeed measurements.  More recently, the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 on October 29, 2018 killed 189 onboard, and the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 on March 10, 2019 killed all 157 people onboard.  It is widely acknowledged that the cause of both tragedies was linked to a faulty angle-of-attack sensor, which measures the angle between the nose of the aircraft and the flight direction.  These tragic incidents, all arising from sensor failure, emphasizes the fact that sensors are critical components of virtually all technological systems, especially those that depend on automation for safe and reliable operation. \n\nThis project developed new techniques for diagnosing sensors and detecting sensor failure.  Under healthy conditions, sensor data are used to construct sensor-to-sensor models, called transmissibilities.  Once a transmissibility has been constructed, it can be used to predict the response of one sensor based on new data from other sensors.  If a significant discrepancy is found between the predictions and the sensor readings, then the suspected sensor may indeed be faulty.  This technique was applied in numerical simulations to demonstrate its ability to diagnose aircraft rate gyro sensors.  The same technique was demonstrated in the laboratory using speakers and microphones.\n\nAn additional application of this technology is a better understanding of the challenges in active noise control.  Although active noise control is highly successful in headphones, where the relevant space is small, active noise control is much more challenging in applications involving larger spaces, such as the interior of an automobile.  For this application, a transmissibility can be used to assess the ability to suppress unwanted noise throughout the acoustic space.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/02/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dennis S Bernstein"
