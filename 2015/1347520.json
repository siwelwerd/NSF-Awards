 "awd_abstract_narration": "This purpose of this research is to lay the fundamental analytical groundwork for the study of reactive chlorine in marine air.  Reactive chlorine compounds have the potential to alter the lifetime and reaction pathways of many climate-active gases in the atmosphere.  Understanding of tropospheric chlorine chemistry is limited by a lack of in situ observations of chlorine atom precursors and reaction products.  The long-term research goal is to assess (1) the levels of Cl atoms in marine air and the photochemical processes controlling them, (2) the impact of chlorine chemistry on methane and other climate-active gases, and (3) the influence of anthropogenic pollutants on atmospheric Cl reactivity.  However, achieving that goal requires development of important analytical capability.  Accordingly, the immediate objective of this project is to develop and evaluate analytical techniques and instrumentation for measuring the levels of reactive Cl compounds in marine air.  This work will have societal impact by improving our understanding of tropospheric chlorine reactivity, particularly towards methane, and human impact on that reactivity.  It will also support the education of a graduate student at the University of California, Irvine.\r\n\r\nThis project involves the development and field testing of instrumentation for measuring key compounds in reactive Cl cycling (Cl2, BrCl, HOCl, ClO, HCl, and ClONO2) as well as ancillary measurements (HOx, NO2).  These measurements will provide an estimate of Cl atom levels.  It is expected that study will eventually lead field observations on the island of Bermuda in both clean marine air and in air impacted by North American outflow of pollutants.  The ultimate goal is to develop and validate models that can be used to quantitatively assess the impact of reactive Cl cycling over the oceans on the lifetime of methane and other hydrocarbons.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHighly reactive chlorine atoms have the potential to influence the atmospheric lifetimes and fates of many climate-active gases in the atmosphere.  In particular, chlorine atoms are highly reactive with the greenhouse gas methane.  Our understanding of chlorine chemistry in the lower atmosphere is limited by a lack of direct observations of chlorine atom precursors and reaction products.  Chlorine nitrate (ClONO2) is one such key chemical.  In this project we focused on developing an analytical method for detecting and quantifying chorine nitrate at the very low levels at which it is anticipated to occur in marine air.  If successful, this project would enable future field studies to quantify chorine cycling over the ocean.\n\nThis study examined the sensitivity of negative ion chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) as a method of detection of chlorine nitrate in marine air.  We synthesized and purified chlorine nitrate in the laboratory and constructed a gas flow system to deliver low levels of chorine nitrate in air.  The levels of chorine nitrate in the gas standard were determined by catalytically converting it to nitrogen dioxide which was quantified using chemiluminescence and cavity ringdown detection.  The air stream containing chlorine nitrate was allowed to react with either with iodide ion or hydrated iodide ion in a reaction flow tube.  The products observed indicate that the reaction proceeds via both iodide cluster formation and charge transfer.  Both pathways were sufficiently sensitive to enable detection of chlorine nitrate at parts-per-trillion levels in air.  The sensitivity for the charge transfer channel was unexpectedly large compared to the cluster channel.  \n\nThe chlorine nitrate analytical method was field tested in Irvine, California during November, 2016.  Levels of chlorine nitrate were detected in the 1-2 parts per trillion range, comparable to those projected to occur in slightly polluted marine air.  These results indicate that the chemical ionization mass spectrometric detection of ClONO2 is sufficiently sensitive for use in future field studies aimed at understanding chlorine chemistry over the world's oceans.\n\nThere are two aspects to the broader impacts of this work.  This project contributed to the dissertation research of a PhD student in Earth System Science, and to training of a postdoctoral researcher.  In the longer term, understanding chlorine cycling over the oceans will improve our estimates for the atmospheric lifetime of methane and numerous other chemicals of global significance, and improve our ability to project future changes in atmospheric reactivity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric S Saltzman"
