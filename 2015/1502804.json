 "awd_abstract_narration": "The juvenile stage of life can be particularly perilous. Immature animals must survive in the same environments as adults despite smaller body size, weaker muscles and other growth-related limitations on physical ability. Because, by definition, juveniles have yet to reproduce, one should expect strong selection for mechanisms that could potentially offset these age-related limits on physical performance, allowing individuals to reach adulthood, reproduce, and thus maintain evolutionary fitness. The proposed research will combine measures of musculoskeletal growth, physical performance, and survivorship in eastern cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus floridanus) to explicitly test broad-scale hypotheses about the adaptive nature of mammalian growth and development. Eastern cottontails are independent of their mothers by three weeks of age and experience high predation pressure during the first year of life, making them an ideal species in which to address these issues. The fundamental data collected in this study will provide a greater understanding of how natural selection operates on musculoskeletal growth and development in response to predation, providing novel insight into the process of evolution itself. \r\nThis research is organized into three specific aims. First, researchers will collect detailed measures of musculoskeletal growth in eastern cottontails, including detailed data on muscle and bone strength. Second, the investigators will generate quantitative measures of physical performance ability (i.e., acceleration and sprinting capacities) in juvenile and adult rabbits. Finally, radio-tracking data will be combined with ecological data on home range size, habitat quality and predation risk to empirically document survivorship in juvenile rabbits. These data will allow the researchers to holistically examine associations among musculoskeletal anatomy, physical performance and evolutionary fitness, as required to formally test the adaptive significance of the traits thought to promote juvenile survival.\r\nThis project will create interdisciplinary collaborations among the three institutions involved, helping to foster a network of research and training in northeastern Ohio. Funding will also provide opportunities for undergraduates to learn in vivo biomechanical and field ecology methods. Such opportunities are rare and constitute a major educational resource for students. Skeletal materials gathered during this project will be donated to local museums and schools, providing valuable public educational and research tools. Finally, the survivorship estimates generated during this research can be used to inform the policy decisions of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources in order to establish acceptable numbers for hunting and trapping throughout Ohio.",

Immature animals must accomplish the same basic survival functions as adults despite smaller body size and other growth-related limits on performance. Because, by definition, juveniles have yet to reproduce, we should expect adaptations for characteristics that compensate for juvenile performance limits, allowing individuals to reach reproductive adulthood. However, no study to date has documented the associations between <em>morphology</em>, <em>performance</em>, and <em>survivorship</em> that are required to establish these relationships; especially in the field, under real-world conditions. Understanding how physiology, morphology, and behavior interact is crucial to understanding the transition to adulthood. The primary goal of this research was to combine measures of anatomy, assessments of sprinting and acceleration capacity, and telemetry-based estimates of survivorship to explicitly test how natural selection operates on the growth and locomotor development of eastern cottontail rabbits (<em>Sylvilagus floridanus</em>).<br /><br />Rabbits were captured live using a combination of wooden traps, wire cage traps, and metal box traps. Rabbits were trapped in a number of locations within the counties of northeast Ohio. Trapping occurred mostly during peak breeding activity in the region and all work was done with appropriate state permits and approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Only independent juveniles older than one month of age and adults were included in our sample. After trapping, rabbits were weighed, fitted with a small (12 gram) VHF radio collar with mortality sensor, filmed as they ran across a computerized force plate in a rabbit run, and released. Using radio tracking equipment, we censused animals on a regular basis to determine if they were alive, and if so, where they were located. If the individual was deceased, we attempted to determine the cause of death. The data collected included rabbit running velocity, jump force, limb measurements, approximate life spans, individual home range, and cause of death (if it could be determined). These data were compiled and analyzed to correlate physical fitness with cause of death and length of life in order to quantify the relationship between anatomy and ability to survive; especially the ability to avoid predation. Juvenile rabbits exhibited adult-like percentages of relative limb muscle mass, relative limb muscle cross-sectional area, and limb muscle fiber-type distribution. As such, juvenile cottontail rabbits were able to achieve relatively heightened levels of locomotor performance for their body size.<br /><br />Mortality is typically high in rabbits, in general, and juveniles, in particular. However, early results suggest that greater levels of locomotor performance are associated with increased survivorship in juvenile rabbits, after controlling for external ecological influences on survivorship. In other words, juvenile rabbits showed physical characteristics that allowed adult-like physical performance that would provide opportunities for survival until reproduction. These data will be important for understanding how mammalian prey species with high mortality rates survive the juvenile stage long enough to reproduce. The data may also allow game managers to assess the status of rabbit populations in order to establish adequate and acceptable numbers for hunting and trapping.<br /><br />This research provided training for five undergraduate students who had interests in the fields of ecology and evolution. Students were part of a collaborative effort between three different universities in which each university focused on one major portion of the work. We would like to thank the staff of the University of Akron Field Station, Bath Parks, Summit Metro Parks, and Portage Parks for allowing access to properties for trapping and tracking rabbits.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/26/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gregory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Smith</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1502804/1502804_10162530_1472243769046_RabbitRelease--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1502804/1502804_10162530_1472243769046_RabbitRelease--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Rabbit Release\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1502804/1502804_10162530_1472243769046_RabbitRelease--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Rabbit Release\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Release of an eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus) wearing a radiotelemetry collar.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Randy Mitchell</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gregory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Smith</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Rabbit Release</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1502804/1502804_10162530_1472243844146_Rabbit51Range--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1502804/1502804_10162530_1472243844146_Rabbit51Range--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Home Range\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1502804/1502804_10162530_1472243844146_Rabbit51Range--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Home Range\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Telemetry locations of an eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Greg Smith</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gregory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Smith</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Home Range</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1502804/1502804_10162530_1472244030033_DSC_1080--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1502804/1502804_10162530_1472244030033_DSC_1080--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Rabbit Collar\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1502804/1502804_10162530_1472244030033_DSC_1080--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Rabbit Collar\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus) is fitted with a radiotelemetry collar.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Samantha Hamrick</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gregory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Smith</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Rabbit Collar</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1502804/1502804_10162530_1472244495931_RabbitRemains--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1502804/1502804_10162530_1472244495931_RabbitRemains--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Rabbit Remains\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1502804/1502804_10162530_1472244495931_RabbitRemains--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Rabbit Remains\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Remains of an eastern cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus) located using radiotelemetry (telemetry collar is circled).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Samantha Hamrick</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gregory&nbsp;A&nbsp;Smith</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Rabbit Remains</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
