 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the development of self-deploying aerial robotic systems that will enable new in-situ atmospheric science applications. Fixed-wing aerial robotic technology has advanced to the point where platforms fly persistent sampling missions far from remote operators. Likewise, complex atmospheric phenomena can be simulated in near real-time with increasing levels of fidelity. Furthermore, cloud computing technology enables distributed computation on large, dynamic data sets. Combining autonomous airborne sensors with environmental models dispersed over multiple communication and computation channels enables the collection of information essential for examining the fundamental behavior of atmospheric phenomena. The aerial robotic system proposed here will close significant capability gaps in conventional platform?s abilities to collect the data necessary to answer a wide range of scientific questions. The motivating application for this work is improvement in the accuracy and lead-time of tornado warnings.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project draws on techniques in the areas of robotics, unmanned systems, networked control, wireless communication, active sensing, and atmospheric science to realize the vision of bringing cloud robotics to the clouds. The autonomous self-deploying aerial robotic systems is comprised of multiple robotic sensors and distributed computing nodes including: multiple fixed-wing unmanned aircraft, deployable Lagrangian drifters, mobile Doppler radar, mobile command and control stations, distributed computation nodes in the field and in the lab, a net-centric middleware connecting the dispersed elements, and an autonomous decision-making architecture that closes the loop between sensing in the field and new online numerical weather prediction tools.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe objective of this project, led by the University of Colorado Boulder, was to develop self-deploying aerial robotic systems (SDARS) for targeted surveillance of supercell thunderstorms.  Targeted surveillance aims to deploy measurement platforms at the right time and the right place to improve forecasting.  For this work we hypothesized that decisions on placement and timing of observing platforms in supercells could be made ahead of time (offline) through analysis of statistical relationships between atmospheric state variables and the future intensity of a storm.  A method termed ensemble sensitivity analysis (ESA), evaluated previously for larger-scale phenomena, was adopted to quantify these relationships.  This work represented the first time that ESA has been applied on the storm scale.  Moreover, a new multivariate-sensitivity approach was developed and applied.  Results indicate coherent regions where targeted data collection by platforms such as unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) might improve storm-scale forecasting.  Results also highlight the limitations of applying ESA at the storm scale.  Uncertainties in the results could be mitigated with an alternate approach.\n\nContinuing research aims to leverage these results through numerical model experiments that evaluate the operational characteristics of UAS required to maximize their impact on forecast accuracy.  These observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) can produce more robust guidance for targeted surveillance than ESA alone.\n\nESA results were used to guide UAS-based data collection during field campaigns in 2017 and 2018.  Data collection focused in areas of sensitivity identified via the aforementioned storm-scale ESA.  These data can be used beyond the life of the award in data-denial experiments which test the impact of supplemental datasets on forecast skill and woud complement the OSSEs underway.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/21/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adam L Houston"
