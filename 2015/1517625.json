 "awd_abstract_narration": "Telomerase is an enzyme complex that copies the DNA at the very ends of chromosomes and also protects the DNA from degradation. Without telomerase, chromosomes would get shorter every time they were copied (i.e. at every cell division). This project will investigate the structure, function, and dynamics of proteins in telomerase that are essential for its correct function. The project will advance understanding of cell aging and provide interdisciplinary training for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in structural biology and biophysics. Encouragement to women and minorities to pursue careers in science will be pursued through outreach to high schools, by mentoring undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows in research, and through the UCLA CityLab program. \r\n\r\nTelomerase is an RNA-protein complex (RNP) that functions as a specialized reverse transcriptase to extend the 3' ends of linear chromosomes and is a critical determinant of cellular aging and stem cell renewal. This research project will investigate the structure and function of telomerase accessory proteins in Tetrahymena using an integrative structural biology approach that combines NMR, X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, and biochemical methods. The proposed structural studies will integrate existing information on telomerase and telomere binding proteins and provide new insights into assembly and interactions of the telomerase holoenzyme. The unified approach to structural biology used in this project will be applicable to the study of other protein complexes and RNPs.",

It contains a unique telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), a single telomerase RNA (TER) that includes a template for copying the telomeric DNA repeat (TTGGGG in <em>Tetrahymena</em>, TTAGGG in human), together required for activity in vitro, and accessory proteins important for biogenesis and function in vivo. Until recently, little was known about the structure of telomerase including identities and interactions of its component proteins. Telomerase from the model organism <em>Tetrahymena</em> contains accessory proteins p50, p75, p45, p19 (the major focus of this grant), p65, and three Teb proteins. During the course of this grant, our laboratory published two landmark structural biology papers on telomerase, from the model organism <em>Tetrahymena</em>. In 2015, we reported the first cryo-EM structure of telomerase at 8.9 and 9.4 ? resolution (Jiang et al, Feigon <em>Science</em>). Combining information from the cryo-EM map, NMR structures of telomerase RNA domains from our lab, crystal structures of p19, p45, and p65 domains from our lab and TERT and Teb1 domains from others, and models of related proteins we were able to model almost all the proteins and the RNA into the map. We identified two previously unknown proteins (Teb2 and Teb3) that form a Replication Protein A (RPA) like complex with Teb1. Based on our structural and functional analysis, we identified the p75-p45-p19 complex as another RPA related complex most homologous to human CTC1-STN1-TEN1 that inhibits telomerase and recruits a DNA polymerase for synthesis of the complementary strand; p50 as structurally and functionally homologous to the activating activity of human telomere binding protein TPP1; and Teb1 as equivalent to the human telomeric DNA binding protein POT1. This established <em>Tetrahymena</em> as an ideal model organism for studying telomerase function, due to the constitutive vs cell-cycle regulated (for human) association of these proteins with TERT. Further studies showed that while Teb1 is unique to telomerase, Teb2 and Teb3 are shared subunits with Tetrahymena RPA. In 2018 we reported a 4.8? cryo-EM structure of telomerase, the highest resolution structure published to date (Jiang, et al Feigon <em>Cell</em>).
