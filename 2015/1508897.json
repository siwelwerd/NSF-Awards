 "awd_abstract_narration": "Title: Quantum Plasmonics for Low-Photon-Number Nonlinear Optics and Quantum Circuits\r\n\r\nMetallic nanostructures can confine light to nanometer length scales in the form of surface-plasmon polaritons, which are electromagnetic waves that propagate at the interface between metallic and dielectric surfaces.  Surface plasmons can miniaturize optical devices to the nanoscale, and also generate extremely high electromagnetic intensities that create strong light-matter interactions.  These properties open up the possibility for ultra-compact active optical devices such as optical switches, modulators, and wavelength converters, that operate at very high speeds and low energies.  To achieve these capabilities, however, requires plasmonic nanostructures with a strong nonlinear optical response.\r\nRecent theoretical work has shown that when surface plasmons interact with single quantum emitters the two systems can hybridize to form new coupled modes of light and matter.  In this hybridized regime, a single plasmon can produce a nonlinear optical response, paving the way for nonlinear plasmonic circuits operating at the fundamental quantum energy limit.  To date, however, this hybridized regime remains elusive because quantum emitters typically suffer from large dephasing due to phonons and spectral wandering.  \r\nIn this program, we will investigate the interaction between metallic nanostructures and indium arsenide quantum dots to study the hybridized regime and develop ultra-fast nonlinear and quantum devices.  Indium arsenide quantum dots exhibit a spectrally pure emission making them ideal for achieving hybridization.  We will use these high quality quantum emitters to demonstrate hybridization, and explore its nonlinear and quantum optical properties.  This program could ultimately pave the way towards nanoscale photonic devices with ultra-low energy dissipation, as well as compact quantum circuits that provide exponential computational speedup and unconditionally secure communication. The program will also support an outreach effort that provides research opportunities for undergraduate and high school students.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\nPlasmonic nanostructures can strongly enhance light-matter interactions by confining light to the nanoscale in the form of surface plasmon polaritons (or simply plasmons).  Recently, it has been theoretically predicted that when a quantum emitter is placed in the high field region of a plasmonic nanostructure the two systems can hybridize.  In this hybridized regime, the emitter and plasmon form new coupled modes that take on both atomic and photonic properties.  These hybridized modes exhibit strong optical nonlinearities near the single photon level, making them a highly compelling system for developing opto-electronic and quantum devices with ultra-low power dissipation.   \r\nHybridization between single quantum emitters and plasmons has yet to be demonstrated because quantum emitters usually exhibit rapid dipole dephasing due to phonon scattering and spectral wandering. This dephasing destroys the quantum interference that creates the hybridized mode. We propose to overcome this problem using indium arsenide (InAs) quantum dots that exhibit a narrow and nearly transform limited optical emission, making them promising systems for attaining the hybridized regime.  \r\nA key challenge to coupling these InAs quantum dots to metal nanostructures is that they are embedded in a gallium arsenide matrix and cannot be easily deposited onto plasmonic devices.  We will address this challenge through a combination of device design and state-of-the-art nanofabrication techniques.  We will characterize the linear and nonlinear properties of fabricated devices.  We will then utilize the hybridized regime to demonstrate a nanophotonic optical transistor where a single absorbed control photon can switch many signal photons.  We will also utilize the hybridized regime to create an interface between a single trapped spin in a quantum dot and a surface plasmon, which could serve as a fundamental building block for nanoscale quantum circuits.  This program could ultimately pave the way towards nanoscale nonlinear photonic devices with ultra-low energy dissipation, and compact quantum circuits that provide exponential computational speedup and unconditionally secure communication.",

These nonlinearities could enable ultra-compact opto-electronic devices that operate at extremely.\n\n \n\nOur approach was to couple plasmonic nanostructures to emitters in atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides.  These materials are composed of a single atomic layer, which enables the emitters to approach the plasmonic structure within a few nanometers. We showed that plasmonic structures not only efficiently extract light from these materials but can actually induce formation of quantum emitters due to strain engineering.  The emitters form precisely in the location of high field intensity of the plasmonic structures, leading to a natural self-alignment.\n\n \n\nTo demonstrate this process, we deposited atomically thin WSe2 on a silver nanowire, which formed bright emitters along the wire surface.  By correlating emission between the wire surface and ends, we demonstrated greater than 60% coupling efficiency.   Second-order correlation measurements verified that the emitters where emitting single photons, providing a compact on-chip single photon source.\n\n \n\nOne of the limitations of using a nanowire is that it exhibited poor alignment of the optical mode with the emitter dipole.  To fix this problem, we developed two new types of plasmonic structures that exhibit much better field polarization alignment.  The first structure was a plasmonic nanobeam, that acts as a focusing antenna for electromagnetic fields.  This structure induced much stronger light-matter interactions, resulting in a pronounced Purcell effect where the optical device enhances the spontaneous emission of the emitter, along with a significant increase in emitter brightness.  The second approach utilized a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) waveguide.  Unlike a nanowire that supports a radially polarized electromagnetic mode, the mode of the MIM structure MIM structure is polarized in-plane, which is parallel to the polarization of the quantum emitters.  Using this structure, we demonstrated a similar enhanced spontaneous emission but in a structure that is compatible with planar integration of multiple photonic components.\n\n \n\nIn the final phase of the project we explored the possibility of generating chiral light-matter interactions that can couple the directionality of the emitter to its polarization.  We explored a waveguide structure called a \"glide-plane\" waveguide that exhibits a circularly polarized optical mode.  Using the strong valley-spin interactions in WSe2, we attained a directional emission which was consistent with the degree of polarization of the material.  By controlling the polarization of the pump, we could direct light to emit either in the forward or backward propagating direction.  This capability provides a new method for controlling light emission in a compact photonic structure.\n\n \n\nOur results could find use in compact low-energy opto-electronic devices.  The ability to engineer emission at the nanoscale is extremely challenging due to the long wavelength of light at optical frequencies.  Plasmonics offer a solution to this problem by enabling a compact integrated device structure that can confine electromagnetic fields at the nanoscale.  Coupling this structures to atomically thin materials provides a compelling approach to scale opto-electronics.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edo Waks"
