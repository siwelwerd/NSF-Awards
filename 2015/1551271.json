 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will investigate and develop new mathematical tools in public-key cryptography.  Such tools have been introduced in recent years as suitable for implementation on low-cost platforms with constrained computational resources; it is expected that such platforms will become more and prevalent as consumer devices become \"smart\" and connect to large networks with the emergence of the \"Internet of Things.\"  Public-key cryptography is used by each person hundreds and perhaps thousands of times daily, as it is the main security used in cellular, ATM, and other computer networks. Traditional public-key systems are based on hard problems in number theory, such as finding the prime factors of a large number.  The tools that will be investigated in this project come from abstract algebra, namely the theory of braids.  Intuitively, a braid is exactly what the reader pictures it to be: a tangled weave of strands.  Braids can be encoded symbolically, which leads to the computational problems of recognizing when two braids are the same, or when a braid can be made less complicated through simple manipulations.  Such computational problems have been turned into cryptographic protocols, and a central problem of this research is to try to understand just how difficult such problems are, from the perspective of both \"brute-force\" attacks and more sophisticated algorithms.\r\n\r\nThe problems that will be investigated in this project focus on braid groups and their applications to cryptographic systems.  In particular, there have been many cryptographic protocols proposed in recent years based on braid groups, from the original Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld key exchange to the more recent Sibert-Dehornoy-Girault authentication scheme.  Today there are various attacks on some of these protocols, but present knowledge of the effectiveness of these attacks is far from complete. The research that will be conducted in this project will help to address this issue.  The first part investigates statistics in braid groups and generation of random braids, with the goal of establishing effective security parameters for braid cryptosystems. The second part treats quantitative connections between the geometry of braids (as automorphisms of the punctured disk) and effectiveness of various algorithms relevant to braid group cryptography. The final part investigates the effectiveness of length-based attacks on computational problems in braid groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCryptography and security play an increasingly important and visible role in modern society.  Traditionally security has concerned peer-to-peer transactions between network devices with comparable computing power, such as two computers communicating over the internet, or an ATM cimmunicating with a financial server.  More recently, there has been intense interest in developing cryptography for low-cost devices with constrained computational resources on computer networks.  Examples of such platforms are RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags.  As observed as early as 15 years ago, such devices are rapidly becomingubiquitous in modern society.  In fact, one analysis estimated that \"between 20 and 50 million Americans carry an RFID chip in their pocket every day either in the form of a proximity card for entering buildings and garages or in an automobile key with an 'immobilizer' chip molded into the key's plastic handle.\"  It is expected that such lightweight platforms will become even more prevalent, as more devices become \"smart\" and connect to networks with the emergence of the \"Internet of Things.\"\n\nSecurity for low-resource devices is in practice limited to \"symmetric\" or \"private-key\" systems.  These are the most familiar cryptographic protocols, in which two parties share a secret key that can be used to both encrypt and decrypt messages.  Modern systems are \"asymmetric\" or \"public-key.\" These have the benefit of providing secure communication without the need for distributing lots of secret key material between parties, and thus are preferred for many applications. However low-resoure devices lack the ability to perform the  computations needed for  asymmetric systems, such as RSA or elliptic curve cryptography.  Thus it is of pressing interest to develop new cryptography that is appropriate for this context.\n\nIn this project, the PI studied problems related to the security of cryptography suitable for low-resource devices.  The protocols are based on a structure known as the braid group.  A braid is a collection of n strands with their ends fixed.  The strands intertwine to form a tangle. Figure 1 shows a braid with n=4 strands.  Two braids are considered equivalent if one can be deformed into the other without cutting or detaching the ends.  There is a multiplication rule for braids: two braids A and B can be multiplied to form a third by concatenating their ends together.  Figures 2 and 3 show two braids whose product is the braid in Figure 1.  Furthermore, one can represent these objects symbolically by listing the crossings from left to right, and can easily encode when two braids can be deformed into one another.  This leads to a precise algebraic object known as the braid group.\nIn recent years cryptography has been proposed based on the braid group that is suitable for secure communication between low-resourcedevices. \n\nThe PI investigated several problems in this realm, including (i) techniques to secure braids through deforming them; (ii) security of various existing protocols based on the braid group; (iii) developing new cryptographic tools based on the braid group; and (iv) complexity of structures that arise in braid group protocols.\nThe principal outcomes included the following.  First, the PI developed a better understanding of how to reduce the length of braids.  Doing so is an important feature of many braid group protocols, since their practicality and security is directly related to how many crossings a braid has.  The PI studied the complexity of various braid \"normal forms.\"  These are used both to rewrite braids for transmission across insecure channels and to mount attacks on braid cryptosystems.  With collaborators the PI developed a new cryptographic protocol that is a hybrid of private-key and public-keyschemes (more precisely it is a private key system with new features that make the so-called key distribution problem more tractable).  The PI also co-developed a new digital signature scheme based on the braid group.  The PI studied \"e-mulitiplication,\" which is an essential component of many braid cryptosystems, and developed methods to construct \"cloaking\" braids; these are braids that disappear under e-multiplication and play an important role in the security of the digital signature algorithm.  The PI also used e-multiplication to co-develop a cryptographic hash function.  The PI also investigated the complexity of e-multiplication and its relation to expander graphs.  Some of these results were published, either in journals or through onlinepreprint servers.\n\nIn addition to the scientific results, the PI developed human resources during the project.  He supervised two research assistants,one of which was an undergraduate at the time.  The first research assistant has gone on to a career in the software industry, and the second is currently enrolled as a PhD student at a top program.  He also worked with other PhD students during a summer program. Finally the PI developed a master's level course in cryptography at his home institution.  This course is currently a highly-desired course in the upper-division undergrate/beginning graduate curriculum.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/08/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul E Gunnells"
