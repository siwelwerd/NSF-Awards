 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program of the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Lane Baker at Indiana University to develop chemical/biochemical sensors which consist of lipid bilayers and ion channels suspended at the tip of a glass capillary, called ion channel probes (or ICPs). The sensor will be combined with scanning ion conductance microscopy (SICM), a probe imaging platform, to enable spatial location of the sensor on the order of 50-100 nm. By incorporating ion channels with selective responses, sensors that respond to unique analytes will be developed. The positionable ICP will be tested on porous membranes and will enable measurement of small molecules and ions at subcellular scales and will enable new studies of cellular communication. As such, it is expected that the tools developed in this work that will have broad application in chemical biology. Students trained in this project will learn state-of-the-art fabrication, measurement and characterization protocols, providing them with high level technical skills for the current workforce upon their graduation. In addition, efforts will be made to improve chemistry faculty engagement in evidence-based teaching methods.  \r\n\r\nThe proposed research will provide new routes to chemically selective imaging methods, even at single molecule levels, with scanning ion conductance microscopy. This overcomes a significant drawback of scanning ion conductance microscopy; namely, the lack of chemical information collected. The use of inherently selective and sensitive ion channels will impart chemical sensing abilities to scanning ion conductance microscopy. As described, ICP-SICM promises to increase the reliable operation, signal and time response of sniffer patches, which will, in turn, inform the biochemical process they are commonly used to study.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:  The proposed research has provided a new route to chemically selective imaging, even at single-molecule levels.  We have developed a method for using pieces of cell membranes that are translated over a sample.  When proteins in the cell membrane (ion channels) detect chemical species in the space just over a sample, a change in the electrical signal is realized which can be used to detect or measure the number of chemical species present.  Because we use ion channels, we can create sensors that work for a variety of interesting biological targets, neurotransmitters, specific ions, etc.  We have demonstrated proof-of-concept testing and then spent significant time developing hardware and scanning protocols to enable dynamic chemical imaging.  We were able to successfully validate the imaging protocols in a related system that showed the ability to measure charge at interfaces at submicron scales.  This project (chemically selective imaging and charge-selective imaging) are ongoing and we are continuing to improve the technology.  During these studies, while validating the instrument operation, we also learned new information related to the chemistry of Nafion, which is an extremely important technological polymer. \n\nBroader Impacts:  We have developed a method that will ultimately provide new routes to highly sensitive and specific detection of biological molecules and ions at interfaces.  This will advance the understanding of molecular biology, and in turn, inform efforts to improve human health and the treatment of disease.  Students trained in this project have learned state-of-the-art fabrication, measurement and characterization protocols, and have graduated from the group with high-level technical skills that they have taken to the workforce.  Several undergraduate and visiting undergraduate students were also exposed to cutting-edge measurement science in the course of this project.  In addition, we engaged in efforts to improve education at the undergraduate and graduate level, and to improve new chemistry faculty engagement in evidenced-based teaching methods.  Several new pedagogical tools were tested in introductory chemistry classes and assessed based on student engagement, performance, and satisfaction.     \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/11/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lane A Baker"
