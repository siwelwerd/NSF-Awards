 "awd_abstract_narration": "Droughts threaten the health of the nation's forest resources by reducing tree growth and increasing mortality from multiple causes including fires and insect attack. This project will determine when and where forests are most at risk from drought-induced mortality in the western USA under current and future climate scenarios. Plant drought responses will be predicted from a theory of water supply and demand that is based on the physics of water flow. When plants are photosynthesizing they are also losing water by evaporation through the stomatal pores that take up CO2 in their leaves. The lost water is replenished by a passive wicking process that pulls water from the soil into roots and up dead, water-filled xylem tubes. Drought-induced failure of this water transport limits the possible rate of water supply, which by theory is associated with reduced water demand caused by closure of stomatal pores. Consequently, prolonged droughts reduce growth and transport capacity, creating persistent metabolic stresses that increase mortality by the \"chronic stress hypothesis\".  A computer model will combine the supply-demand theory with climatic and landscape causes of drought stress, including precipitation, groundwater hydrology, and atmospheric humidity. The model and chronic stress hypothesis will be tested in greenhouse, plantation, and natural stands, focusing on trees of the intermountain west. Predictions for the region's forests will be made from climate projections. Forecasts will inform decisions on land management. Educational versions of the model will illustrate the combined roles of climate and groundwater hydrology on plant health. The project is a regionally focused trial of an approach that can be applied nationally and globally. \r\n\r\nThe goal is to identify and characterize the key hydraulic traits of plants necessary for accurate predictions of how their gas exchange, vascular performance, productivity, and risk of mortality will respond to climate change. The context is forests of the mountain west (USA), where droughts have already caused significant woody plant mortality. The backbone of the project is a model of the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum that applies mathematical approaches for soil water flow to plant xylem. Key research questions include whether the model can be accurately driven by climate and hydrology, the importance of vascular recovery via xylem refilling, and whether there is a chronic stress threshold of vascular dysfunction and consequent reduction in CO2 uptake and productivity that is reproducibly associated with mortality risk. The utility of the chronic stress hypothesis is that hydraulics can be predicted from the climate-coupled model, whereas the exact proximal cause of death is likely variable and less predictable. The integrated model and chronic stress idea will be tested rigorously in greenhouse, research garden, and natural settings, including tests of its ability to \"hindcast\" the current hydraulic status of montane woody plants in the region from known climate inputs. The model will predict the severity of droughts required to threaten western forests, and forecast the immediate impacts of future climate scenarios for the region. Forecasts will inform forest management decisions.  Educational model versions will promote understanding of the plant-climate linkage. Research versions will be available via website, because the basic approach is relevant for analyzing drought impacts on forests of any region.",

On the one hand, rising carbon dioxide levels can be beneficial by enhancing photosynthesis. On the other hand, rising temperatures can reduce photosynthesis by causing physiological stress and plant death. The project answered this climate-change conundrum by producing a physiologically-based model of plant responses to the environment. Previous models used statistical extrapolations of plant responses to past weather, and are therefore unreliable when challenged with novel future climates. In contrast, the project's new \"gain-risk\" model assumes the plant maximizes the photosynthetic gain minus the risk of physiological stress at every moment in time. This response can be reliably calculated for every set of conditions whether past, present, or future. The gain is calculated from standard equations of photosynthesis. The risk is calculated from the proximity of the plant to vascular failure caused by low pressure in water conducting tissues. The project developed this gain-risk theory and tested it rigorously with experiments in growth chambers, research gardens, and natural stands. The gain-risk model was found to predict plant responses to drought, carbon dioxide, temperature, light, and humidity as well or better than previous statistical models. The coupling between precipitation and root zone water availability was shown to be critical for model prediction. To improve prediction of root zone water, the gain-risk model was coupled to physically realistic representations of local topography and microclimate. &nbsp;These coupled models were able to explain why some trees suffered and died while others survived and even prospered despite experiencing the same overall climate. &nbsp;The validated gain-risk model was used to predict the response of US forests to 100 years of climate change. The results depended heavily on the ratio of rising carbon dioxide relative to the extent of warming. A neutral ratio existed where benefits of rising carbon dioxide were exactly offset by negative effects of warming, and no change in forest function was predicted. Actual projections straddled this neutral ratio, such that depending on which projection actually transpires, the future could see anything from greater productivity and carbon-storage capacity (\"good\") to substantial forest dieback and net carbon release (\"bad\").
