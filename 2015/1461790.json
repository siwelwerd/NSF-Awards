 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will focus on the interconnections of environmental degradation and mass violence after the cessation of armed conflict. The project will address specifically how programs designed to augment both water and food security in the aftermath of civil war may actually facilitate further conflict and violence. Water-management projects, including the intensification and expansion of irrigation schemes, well illustrate this dynamic. It is widely understood that water management issues have a bearing on post-conflict societies. However, much of the literature presumes that armed conflict contributes to the destruction of these schemes whereas peace-building efforts improve such schemes. This relationship is not so straightforward, in that many post-conflict practices may lead to renewed, but altered, forms of conflict and violence. This project therefore will provide insight into the complex dynamics of armed conflict, post-conflict rebuilding processes, and the impact on the environment. This has important implications in that resource scarcities, including that of water, are assumed to lead to more conflict in the future.\r\n\t\r\nThrough the use of recent advances in geospatial technologies, coupled with archival research, this project provides an empirically-grounded, scientific approach to the interplay of conflict and the environment. Drawing on theoretical insights developed in environmental security studies, specifically water and food security studies, this project will advance basic knowledge on deforestation that results from the construction of irrigation schemes in a post-conflict setting. Investigators will focuses on the case study of Khmer Rouge irrigation projects that were developed during the Cambodian genocide. This study is important in that it provides a real-world empirical example from which to examine actual policies and their subsequent impact on the environment. Throughout the course of this project, two graduate students will obtain first-hand research experience working in a foreign setting.",

Between 17 April 1975 and 7 January 1979 the CPK carried out a program of mass violence in Democratic Kampuchea (as Cambodia was renamed) that resulted in the death of approximately two million people. Upwards of one million died from direct violence: torture, murder, and execution. The remainder died from starvation-related causes, lack of medical care, exposure, and exhaustion. Whereas considerable research has focused on the direct violence that ensued, less research has&nbsp;<em>empirically</em>&nbsp;documented or interpreted the structures of violence related to starvation, illness, and exhaustion. In particular, inadequate attention has focused on the&nbsp;<em>geography</em>&nbsp;of specific material practices initiated by the CPK that created those material conditions that resulted in widespread mass violence. In particularly, few studies have explicitly documented the water-management projects constructed during the Khmer Rouge regime. Moreover, of these studies, most have argued that Khmer Rouge irrigation projects were poorly designed and hastily implemented; that dams, dikes, canals and reservoirs were prone to failure and led to widespread devastation. Twining (1989, 146) concedes that many scholars simply presume that &ldquo;irrigation works were often poorly conceived and built, at times contributing to erosion and disturbing natural drainage more than increasing productivity&rdquo; but at this point, it is simply not known with any accuracy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic objectives of our research was to map the dams, dikes, canals, and reservoirs designed and built during the Khmer Rouge regime from historical satellite imagery; this knowledge is significant insofar as it provides the foundation for subsequent scholarship, notably the amount of deforestation resultant from water-management schemes and the establishment of forced labor camps for agriculture. In turn, our project provided a systematic mapping of Khmer Rouge irrigation schemes with the objective of proving greater clarification of both policy and practice. Overall, throughout the four-year regime of the Khmer Rouge, over 7,000 kilometers of canals were constructed and over 350 reservoirs were built. Archival materials indicate that CPK officials were aware of and exhibited a sensitivity to hydrologic and geomorphic conditions; but in practice, these concerns were not always heeded. Based on satellite mapping, coupled with field observations, we developed a six-fold typology of Khmer Rouge irrigation schemes, based on the nature of storage and delivery&nbsp;of water, as well as the relationship of the structure to existing hydrology and geomorphology: external storage, internal storage, linked storage, segregated storage, large-scale canal systems, and topographically controlled systems.&nbsp;<em>External storage systems</em>&nbsp;involve dams, dikes, and canals, and are designed to store water upstream of the area being irrigated.&nbsp;&nbsp;External reservoirs are typically large, and no rice production occurs within the flooded areas of the reservoir.&nbsp;<em>Internal storage systems&nbsp;</em>are common throughout Democratic Kampuchea and range from very small (1 km<sup>2</sup>), to very large. Internal storage systems are designed to slowly fill an area upstream from the retaining dykes, allowing rice production in the flooded areas while still enabling water to be released via a series of floodgates for irrigation downstream. These reservoirs are bounded by earthen dikes and have one or more large canals to deliver water to areas tens of kilometers away.&nbsp;<em>Linked storage&nbsp;</em>schemes refer to situations wherein multiple dams are built along a single river or stream. The resultant reservoirs are ultimately connected to each other via the original stream and, occasionally but rarely, by canals. Linked reservoirs are typically small, with each reservoir covering no more than 3 km<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;at maximum capacity.&nbsp;<em>Segregated storage</em>&nbsp;refers to the damming of multiple tributaries of a single river. In most cases, the storage reservoirs function separately from each other and have little impact on nearby reservoirs: the flooding or draining of one reservoir will not affect other reservoirs unless a linking canal has been built.&nbsp;<em>Large-scale canal systems</em>&nbsp;are common throughout the flatlands of Democratic Kampuchea. In many places long-distance canals crossed watershed and sub-watershed boundaries. Such large-scale systems were intended to carry water for tens of kilometers, providing access to water across a wide area, before adjoining another river. Lastly,&nbsp;<em>topographically controlled systems</em>&nbsp;consist of dams (and associated reservoirs) constructed where major topographic features on the landscape have been utilized as natural barriers to water flows.&nbsp;Many small local reservoirs failed quickly, but larger ones still survive today. In short, rather than a singular approach to hydro-engineering, we provide evidence that local conditions did figure prominently in the construction of dams, dikes, canals, and reservoirs. This challenges the perception that CPK irrigation projects were ill-planned and (always) prone to failure.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 05/22/2024<br>\nModified by: Mandy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Munro-Stasiuk</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1461790/1461790_10352325_1716389436850_Reservoirs--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1461790/1461790_10352325_1716389436850_Reservoirs--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Reservoirs built during the Khmer Rouge regime\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1461790/1461790_10352325_1716389436850_Reservoirs--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Reservoirs built during the Khmer Rouge regime\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Reservoirs built during the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, mapped from historical satellite imagery.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mandy Munro-Stasiuk and Cory Coakley</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mandy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Munro-Stasiuk\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Reservoirs built during the Khmer Rouge regime</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1461790/1461790_10352325_1716389567918_Typology--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1461790/1461790_10352325_1716389567918_Typology--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Types of reservoirs\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1461790/1461790_10352325_1716389567918_Typology--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Types of reservoirs\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Types of reservoirs built during the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mandy Munro-Stasiuk</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mandy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Munro-Stasiuk\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Types of reservoirs</div>\n</div>\n</li><li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1461790/1461790_10352325_1716389282527_Canals--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1461790/1461790_10352325_1716389282527_Canals--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Canals built during the Khmer Rouge regime\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1461790/1461790_10352325_1716389282527_Canals--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Canals built during the Khmer Rouge regime\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Canals built during the Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia, mapped from historical satellite imagery.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mandy Munro-Stasiuk and Cory Coakley</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mandy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Munro-Stasiuk\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Canals built during the Khmer Rouge regime</div>\n</div>\n</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n",
