This question can only be answered by uncovering the factors that have affected species diversity over geologic time. A better conceptual understanding of these factors will enable government and conservation organizations to make more informed decisions about how to preserve modern tropical biodiversity. The project will contribute to this effort by generating a detailed picture of the climate and habitats of a 13 million-year-old fossil site in Bolivia known as Quebrada Honda. In addition to producing new scientific insights, the project will have a variety of broader impacts including: increasing participation of Bolivian students and faculty in the sciences; supporting career development of a female PhD candidate; and enhancing Cleveland research infrastructure through new collaborations. Results of the proposed research will be disseminated through a variety of media in English and Spanish including a multimedia exhibit module in the permanent exhibits of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History and an accompanying mobile app on how scientists interpret past climates and habitats.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nFew well-sampled fossil mammal sites are known from the South American tropics. Two of these sites are contemporaneous (late middle Miocene) and widely separated geographically and thus present a unique opportunity to test hypotheses about the de-velopment of South American geographic provinciality. One of these sites, La Venta, Colombia, has been studied in detail. The other site, Quebrada Honda, Bolivia, will be the focus of our fieldwork-intensive project, which will generate new data about deposi-tional environments and habitats of using a variety of geological and paleontological techniques. The main objectives include: (1) stratigraphically correlating the main fossil-producing areas at Quebrada Honda with one another to determine the manner and rate by which fossils accumulated; (2) undertaking detailed studies of ancient soils and trace fossils to reconstruct ancient land surfaces and document past environments; and (3) using ecological characteristics of mammals to deduce the habitats in which they lived. These data will produce a comprehensive picture of the ancient climate and habitats of Quebrada Honda and will be compared to data from La Venta to test whether the great differences in the mammal faunas of these two sites can be explained by differences in paleoenvironment. The observations will also be used test the recent clumped isotope-based assertion that the elevation of Quebrada Honda was more than 2 km when the fossils were deposited.",

Today, South America?s climates are heavily influenced by the Andes, the longest mountain chain in the world, which run along its western and northern margins. But the Andes are only tens of millions of years old, and for most of that time, they were far lower than they are today. Similarly, modern South American mammals are quite different from those that lived there millions of years ago. This is because South America?s mammals evolved in almost complete isolation from those on other continents for most of the past 66 million years. It wasn?t until the Isthmus of Panama joined the Americas a few million years ago that mammals like jaguars, tapirs, and llamas made their way to South America.</span></p>\n<p><span>But how, exactly, did modern South American mammal communities take shape? And in what ways did factors such as the rising Andes influence these communities over time? Answering these questions requires data from the fossil record, and our project focused on one particularly important site in South America that dates to the middle Miocene, about 13 million years ago: Quebrada Honda, Bolivia. Specifically, our project aimed to determine whether Quebrada Honda?s distinctive mammals (more than two-thirds have been found nowhere else in the world) could be explained by habitat differences in South America. In other words, could variations in environmental conditions in different parts of the continent have driven the differentiation of its mammal communities?

Nevertheless, few species at Quebrada Honda had been studied in detail, and many identifications were preliminary. A primary goal of our research was to collect additional remains of these mammals and identify them more precisely. We also proposed using two independent types of information to determine the type of habitat in which Quebrada Honda mammals were living: the ecological adaptations of its mammals and characteristics of its ancient soils, plants, and invertebrates. Finally, we wanted to study the age and geology of the site in greater detail to ensure that our age estimates were correct and that fossils from collecting sites separated by more than 10 kilometers were deposited at roughly the same time.</span></p>\n<p><span>During the course of our project, which involved fieldwork, fossil preparation, collections research, and a variety of laboratory analyses, we formally identified nine species of mammals, including six new species; at least ten other new species will be described in future publications. We extensively sampled rocks at Quebrada Honda and were able to generate seven new radioisotopic dates as well as three detailed paleomagnetic profiles. Combined, these analyses have allowed most fossils to be placed within a ~150,000-year interval. Our studies of ancient soils and trace fossils at Quebrada Honda determined that the area was a subtropical savanna during the middle Miocene that received moderate (~90-100 cm) annual rainfall. We reached the same conclusion by analyzing the ecological characteristics of the site?s mammals, giving us high confidence in our environmental interpretation. Since the other well-known fossil site of this age, La Venta, Colombia, represents a much wetter, lowland tropical rainforest habitat, different paleoenvironments are sufficient to account for the markedly different mammals found at the two sites. Based on our studies, habitat variation promoted mammal biodiversity in South America during the Miocene, and preserving a variety of modern Neotropical habitats should be a priority for conserving modern mammal biodiversity.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our project helped train 16 students in paleontological research (including high school, undergraduate, and graduate students), generated 10 peer-reviewed journal articles and four theses, and inspired a multi-author book on reconstructing ancient terrestrial ecosystems that can be used as the basis for a college-level course on paleoecology. It also supported development of a general-interest book on extinct South American mammals that won a Gold Medal in science in the Independent Publisher (IPPY) Book Awards. Life reconstructions of extinct mammals from this book were combined with fossil specimens and print and video content to create a ?pop-up? exhibit at the Cleveland Museum of Natural History that will subsequently be displayed at other public venues in northeast Ohio. These images were also integrated with field photos, maps, images of specimens, and ?selfie? videos of project participants to create an engaging open-access web site that will be an enduring resource for anyone interested in our project area and the history of South America?s mammals.
