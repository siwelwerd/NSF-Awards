 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract\r\nRecent breakthroughs in the field of spintronics, where scientists explore the spin or magnetic properties in addition to the electric properties of electrons, have created opportunities for future generations of memory and logic devices. It is found that an electrical current passing through a heavy metal such as platinum or tantalum can create, in the traverse direction, a pure spin current where electrons of opposite spin directions move in opposite directions.  This pure spin current diffuses into a neighboring magnetic layer and exerts torque on spins in the magnetic layer, leading to an effective method of controlling the properties of the magnetic layer.  The project aims towards acquiring a fundamental understanding of how a pure spin current traverses through materials and interfaces and interacts with spins in the magnetic layer.  With novel approaches in experimental detection methods that are immune to artifacts and with interface engineering, the research team can separate and quantify various contributions arising from the bulk and interface effects.  The research may also lead to new materials that provide more efficient control over nano-magnets, key ingredients in memory and logic devices.  The project, leveraging on the creation of a nanofabrication facility at the University of Delaware, also aims to train undergraduate and graduate students and professionals via nanofabrication courses and certification programs.  The educational activities also include outreach programs focusing on K-12 students.       \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nSpin-orbit interaction (SOC) driven phenomena, such as current-induced magnetization switching and domain motion in magnetic heterostructures involving heavy metals, have attracted great attention. These phenomena arise from an intricate combination of effects including the Spin Hall Effect (SHE), interfacial Rashba SOC, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI), which are strongly correlated with SOC in materials and at interfaces. It is essential to understand the underlying physics responsible for these recent exciting discoveries in ferromagnetic heterostructures in order to unleash their true potential in spintronic applications. There is a lack of experimental techniques that can unravel the entanglement of torques from the SHE and Rashba effect. With designed interfaces that are nearly transparent to spin currents but significantly modify the Rashba effect and innovative 3D MOKE spin torque magnetometers that can measure torques on magnetization at arbitrary directions, the research proposes a comprehensive experimental effort to understand the rich SOC-driven phenomena in these ferromagnetic heterostructures. The project objectives are to: (1) develop 3D MOKE spin torque magnetometers capable of measuring SO torques on magnetization at an arbitrary angle, (2) quantitatively separate the SHE and Rashba SOC contributions to the SO torques, and relate them to the interface SOC, (3) characterize and optimize DMI, particularly in structures with large voltage controlled interface magnetic anisotropy, and (4) search for new material systems that possess preferred SOC-induced effects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project aims to understand and consequently develop new layered heterostructures consisting of magnetic materials and heavy non-magnetic materials (HM) such as Ta, W, Pt for applications in magnetic memory and logic device.  These devices utilize magnetization direction, for example, south and north, to represent information \"0\" and \"1\".  To write information, one must switch the magnetization direction in one of the magnetic layer in heterostructures.  A promising approach to switch the magnetization with very low energy consumption is to pass an electrical current through the HM in the film plane that generates out-of-plane pure spin current and switches the magnetization.   The spin current represents the flow of electrons, and the flow direction depends on their spin direction.  Electrons with opposite spins move in opposite direction.  Since the number of electrons with opposite spins are the same, such a flow results in a zero charge current but a net flow of spins, which exert torques on the FM layer and switch its magnetization.   Since the magnetization direction in applications is in the out-of-plane direction, the most efficient way to switch such a magnetization is to generate spin current with spin direction also in the out-of-plane direction.  Due to the symmetry requirement, such out-of-plane spin direction is not possible with non-magnetic materials such as Ta, W, Pt, etc.  We pioneered in using a magnetic material to replace these non-magnetic materials to break the system symmetry and successfully created spin current with out-of-plane spin direction, which later demonstrated by another group to switch the out-of-plane magnetization.  To further understand the origin of this effect, whether the effect is arising from the interior of FM layer or from the interface, we demonstrated, using a single FM layer, the phenomenon is from the interior of FM layer.  We further revealed that this effect is a general and fundament phenomenon of magnetic materials, which we called \"anomalous spin-orbit torque\" (ASOT) in analogous to \"anomalous Hall effect\", another common phenomenon of magnetic materials.    Such a breakthrough resulted from our innovative detection technique, developed under this program, by using magneto Kerr rotation effect (MOKE) to quantify the torque on the magnetization from the spin current.  In addition, also from this program, our understanding of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&ndash;Moriya Interaction (DMI) via interface engineering in HM)/FM heterostructures, the charge-spin conversion in other nontrivial materials such as V, and the tuning of spin-dependent thermal properties in NiFe alloys are indispensable to this important discovery of ASOT.   The discovery of ASOT will have long lasting effect on the field of spintronics.  The study not only reveals a new mechanism but also has a significant impact in developing more efficient magnetic random access memories and logic devices. \n\nThe project was ideal to train graduate students with broad experimental techniques in vacuum deposition, cleanroom lithography operation, structural characterization, as well as in variety of measurement techniques encompassing electrical, magnetic, and optical measurements.   In most of these measurements, students had to modify the experimental setups to meet the measurement needs.  Therefore, students gained excellent training and became very competent researchers.  In addition, students also interacted with external collaborators, learning effective communication and teamwork skills.  The project also trained students in the critical understanding for spin orbit torque induced magnetization switching, an enabling technology for next generation of non-volatile magnetic random access memory and logic devices with embedded memory.  Students were constantly reminded by this ultimate goal and learned how innovative technologies are produced.   For under graduate students, the project was stimulating, exposing them with new exotic materials, novel phenomena, and new technologies that they would not learn from classroom.    During this program, four graduate students graduated with Ph.D.  Among them, two are female scientists.  The program also involved one undergraduate student and one high school student.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/02/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Q Xiao"
