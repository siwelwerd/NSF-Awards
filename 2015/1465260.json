 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information security remains a persistent and growing problem in the United States due to ever-progressing reliance on information technologies and systems to provide critical services and enable society's contemporary way of life. The economics of computing favor performance and functionality over security and may continue to do so for some time. This environment is created by graduates of education programs, programs which can be argued to be lacking in emphasis on security impacts associated with this new information age. The economics of education are also pitted against cyber security education. Cyber security education is a resource intensive endeavor that requires program refreshes on a regular basis as technology changes and advances. The level of expertise necessary to provide continual curricula development is also a barrier, which reduces the number of institutions that are able to effectively keep up with the advancement of technology.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this project is to create a sharing community of educators from institutions in the Center of Academic Excellence (CAE) program for Information Assurance and those wishing to develop better educational resources for their programs. This community will be reinforced with an online wiki maintained by the community. The mediated wiki platform will assist in the mapping of resources and tools to the Knowledge Unit (KU) system emplaced to cover the required learning areas in cybersecurity.  This wiki will allow sharing of educational materials, including texts, labs, tools, and exams. This project will reduce the level of work required from educators to build and retool classes to the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity.",
