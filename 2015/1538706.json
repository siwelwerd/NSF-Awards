 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stochastic networks are comprised of \"jobs\" in the form of packets or customers that arrive to a network and wait in buffers at different nodes of the networks until their processing requirements are fulfilled. Stochastic variability arises from randomness in arrival and processing times, as well as from routing and scheduling decisions.   Such networks are ubiquitous and arise as models in diverse fields ranging from telecommunications and service systems to biological systems.  A better understanding of these networks has the potential to lead to new algorithms that dramatically improve performance and enable the support of novel network applications.   This award supports the development of a general mathematical framework for the analysis of two broad classes of stochastic networks:  large-scale load-balancing networks that arise, for example, in web-server farms, and queueing networks that use scheduling policies involving prioritization, which are relevant for real-time scheduling in computer networks and health care systems.  The goal is to identify tractable approximations of both transient dynamics and equilibrium behavior, rigorously establish their accuracy for suitable values of network parameters, and to use them to gain insight into network design. There will be mentorship of graduate students, a multidisciplinary project for an undergraduate student and opportunity for outreach.  The project also involves interactions with industry, which increases the potential of impacting the design of real networks.\r\n\r\nStochastic networks are typically too complex to admit an exact analysis. The goal then is to obtain tractable approximations, whose accuracy can be rigorously justified in a suitable (asymptotic) regime of network parameters via limit theorems for suitably scaled state processes.   While there is a well developed mathematical theory of \"scaling limits\" for certain classes of networks, it does not cover the networks considered in this project, which involve many servers at a single node,  general service distributions and non-head of the line scheduling policies.  One of the challenges is that Markovian scaling limits of these networks are typically not finite-dimensional. The research will develop tractable infinite-dimensional Markovian representations of these systems, involving interacting measure-valued processes and infinite-dimensional Skorokhod maps, and rigorously establish scaling limit theorems.  The analysis will combine methods from different fields, including probability, stochastic analysis, dynamical systems, partial differential equations and optimization.  The tools developed will potentially be applicable more broadly for the study of analogous stochastic models arising in other applications.  Simulations will also be carried out to ascertain the validity of these approximations for finite systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit: \n\nStochastic networks arise as models in a wide variety of applications, ranging from engineering and computer science to operations research.  Since these networks are typically too complex to be amenable to exact analysis, one often resorts to more tractable approximations that can be used to provide insight into the performance, control and design of these networks.  Many-server networks, which arise in call centers, health-care centers and data centers, are typically harder to analyze than single-server networks.  While a vast body of work has been developed to study many-server networks under the assumption that the time taken to process jobs is exponentially distributed, in real applications, this assumption is rarely satisfied.  However, there were few generic methods for the study of many-server networks.  We developed novel tools to analyze various classes of networks under more realistic assumptions such as generally distributed service times and inhomogeneous time-varying arrivals.  In particular, we were able to provide insight into the following classes of networks: \n\ni) Randomized load balancing networks, which are used in cuckoo hashing, and cloud computing.  We developed a general methodology for the analysis of such networks, called the PDE method, and applied it to identify several new properties of such systems.  For example, we were able to  determine the influence of so called heavy-tailed service distributions on the transient and equilibrium performance of such networks.  The general techniques we developed have been used to analyze a variety of other networks, including  load balancing networks using other policies, but also enzymatic processing networks, and are also relevant for the study of certain grain growth models in material science.     \n\nii) Many-server networks are ubiquitious and, for example, arise as models in call centers and in health-care.  We developed new methods to study the stability and equilibrium properties of many-server networks by describing them in terms of non-standard stochastic partial differential equations.  This could potentially lead to numerical algorithms for the calculation of equilibrium distributions of these networks, which would be useful for making staffing and other design decisions in call centers and related application areas.\n\niii) Networks that use a priority scheduling policy: many real-world networks schedule jobs according to a continuous parameter, and are subject to time-varying behavior due to sudden surges in arrival or failures.   We developed a method to study the influence of time-inhomogeneous behavior in such systems.\n\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThe general tools developed in this research has applciations in several fields, ranging from operations research and engineering to biology.  The methodology developed has already been used by other researchers to study other varied models, including load balancing networks arising in data centers and enzymatic processing networks in biology.   The research is also of relevance to the computation of sensitivities of equity markets to system parameters. \n\nThe PI is strongly involved with mentoring and training undergraduate and graduate students, as well as post-doctoral fellows.
