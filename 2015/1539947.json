This Center will create a network for researchers to partner with forensic practitioners that will result in timely and effective transfer of science-based discoveries and technology to forensic scientists in the government and private sectors.Training programs currently in place through Texas A&M are accredited through the International Association for Identification thus allowing for such training being accepted globally. An undergraduate programs in the forensic sciences accredited by the Forensic Programs Accreditation Commission is also available for training future practitioners by integrating new techniques developed through the center into their curricula.\r\n\r\nThis proposed Center represents a combination of practitioner expertise and research capacity that positions the center to serve as a global platform for: 1) Conducting multidisciplinary discovery and translational research in the field and laboratory that establishes a science-based foundation associated with the forensically important phenomena of decomposition and ecological recycling of vertebrate carrion; 2) Integrating the decomposition and ecological recycling research with new discoveries in basic and applied forensic chemistry and biology to improve forensic methodology and technology; and 3) Enhancing the forensics workforce development programs already associated with each of the partner institutions.",
