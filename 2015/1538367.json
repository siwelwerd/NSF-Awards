 "awd_abstract_narration": "This interdisciplinary project will create a topology optimization-driven framework for the design and manufacture of 3D woven materials with tunable vibration damping capabilities. 3D weaving is a highly efficient manufacturing process where yarns or wires are arranged in a sequence of orthogonal patterns. Topology optimization is a computational, systematic approach for designing the micro-scale architecture of materials.  This project will integrate these two approaches to design, manufacture, and experimentally test 3D woven metallic materials whose micro-architecture is optimized to achieve targeted damping properties at elevated temperatures. Such materials would find a broad range of applications in transportation, manufacturing, power generation and most structural applications that are susceptible to fatigue and elevated temperature exposure.  It would also create a new avenue of applications for textile manufacturers. In addition to the development of this new class of materials, the project will develop Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) related activities that will train and engage graduate, undergraduate and elementary school students at a variety of levels.\r\n\r\nThis project will couple topology optimization with 3D weaving to design and efficiently manufacture micro-architected lattice materials with optimized damping properties.  Although typical 3D woven fabrics serve as preforms that are infiltrated with resin to create composite materials, this project will focus on the 3D weaving of micro-scale metallic wires that are then bonded to create porous, lightweight lattices.  These wires will be 3D woven into patterns that are dictated by the topology optimization design engine with the goal of enhancing and controlling observed damping mechanisms, including inertial damping and Coulomb damping.  Design optimization algorithms will be developed that integrate the manufacturing constraints of 3D weaving into the topology optimization methodology. Material processing in the form of wire joining and surface treatments will be developed to further exploit these damping mechanisms. Optical characterization of material architecture, including measurement of wire orientations and flaws, and experimental property measurements at temperature will inform and validate the computational design methodology and manufacturing processes, much in the theme of Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME).",
