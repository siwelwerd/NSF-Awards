 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the National Science Foundation's Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program, this Wayne State University (WSU) Noyce Scholarship Track I project will address the national need to produce a high quality teaching workforce in elementary and middle school mathematics. The \"Noyce Mathematics Fellows, TeachDETROIT\" project will prepare elementary and middle school mathematics teachers for Detroit schools at a time that United States students lag behind their international peers in mathematics achievement. This is a critical challenge, since proficiency in mathematics is essential for entry to college, access to employment, economic well-being, and participation in a democratic society. This challenge is particularly important in the city of Detroit, where student scores in mathematics on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) in 2009, 2011 and 2013 were among the lowest in the country. The project will address this challenge by preparing elementary and middle school mathematics teachers to work in Detroit schools. Wayne State University, Henry Ford College, the Detroit Public Schools, and Wayne Westland Community Schools will partner to recruit, train, and induct fifty-six (56) new elementary and middle school mathematics teachers for Detroit schools. \r\n\r\nPreparing successful teachers of mathematics is a non-trivial endeavor, especially since teacher candidates need to be proficient in mathematics.  This can be particularly challenging because, for many teachers, the mathematical subject matter is significantly different from the mathematics they learned as students. Beyond subject matter knowledge, teachers must also have pedagogical expertise for helping others to learn and understand mathematical concepts. In addition, teachers must also: (1) have the interpersonal skills and dispositions to work with students like and unlike themselves; (2) be able to design and carry out sophisticated assessments of student progress; (3) analyze data; and (4) adjust instruction accordingly. To meet these demands, teachers need substantial training over time. This project will create a model to prepare new teachers to be successful, especially in high-poverty schools with children of color, and this model will constitute an important and timely contribution to educational research. The project will provide scholarships and stipends to highly qualified candidates to support their participation in an innovative urban teacher residency program for the 15 months they are receiving preservice training. This program will blend coursework and field experiences, with the participation of outstanding mentors, in elementary and middle school classrooms. Because new teacher attrition rates are high, a crucial piece of the \"Noyce Mathematics Fellows, TeachDETROIT\" program includes continued mentoring for graduates during their first two years as teachers of record. The Noyce Mathematics Fellows will utilize social media and other forms of technology to keep graduates connected in ongoing conversations about best practices in mathematics instruction.",

A separate study showed that virtually all TeachDETROIT graduates have remained in teaching, and have stayed in hard-to-staff, under-resourced Detroit schools, in comparison to 30-50% retention rates locally and nationally. TeachDETROIT attributes these outcomes to several factors:&nbsp;&nbsp;The TeachDETROIT program is a modified residency model of teacher preparation, placing teacher candidates in carefully selected schools with high-quality mentor teachers in Detroit schools.

TeachDETROIT teacher mentors have contributed to a developing framework for culturally responsive teaching specific to the Detroit context.

In a study conducted by an external evaluator, graduates report that they were well-prepared to teach mathematics in Detroit schools in culturally responsive ways.
