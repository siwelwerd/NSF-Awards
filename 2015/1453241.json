 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to study how interactions among genes limits evolution. Using viruses that only infect bacteria, the steps that viruses take when infecting and adapting to new hosts will be studied. Understanding evolutionary limits is especially important for viruses as they can be threats to the health of humans, livestock, and crops. Successfully switching to a new host species requires multiple changes in a virus' genes, and there are many possible sets or pathways of change. Because these viruses are not pathogenic to humans, middle-school students at an  urban charter school can be involved in some of the actual experimental work during an after-school activity. This research will be furthered by a laboratory course in experimental evolution for undergraduate students, and trainees supported by the grant will be mentored and trained in teaching techniques and curriculum development as well as research methods. Through this approach, 50 New Brunswick middle school students and 40 Rutgers undergraduates will be introduced to research in viral evolution, while two junior scientists will be prepared for an academic career that combines research and teaching. \r\n\r\nThe double-stranded RNA bacteriophage phi6, which infects different strains and species of Pseudomonas bacteria, will be used to study how initial host range mutations and previous evolution (mutations fixed during specialization on one host) affects phage evolutionary pathways and emergence in different novel hosts. Experimental evolution of replicate populations will expose phages to single or multiple hosts for over 100 generations at a time. Sequencing will determine how often the same mutations were fixed by replicate lineages, or by different genotypes.  Finally, genetic crosses will create hybrid viral genotypes that will explore how interactions between mutations affect emergence on alternate strains of bacteria, and how many mutations trap a lineage by limiting its evolvability. These experiments will demonstrate how often RNA viruses must reverse substitutions that were adaptive in one environment in order to adapt to another.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHow easy or hard it is for RNA viruses to move between hosts is a major concern for understanding the health of all organisms, as RNA viruses affect almost all life.  RNA viruses have higher mutation rates and evolve faster than other organisms used to study evolution, which means that the models in evolutionary biology might be improperly tuned to predict how RNA viruses evolve.  Our work used an RNA virus (bacteriophage phi6) that only infects bacteria as a safe model to see how host shifting affects viral genomes -- both as viruses mutate to infect more hosts, and as they retreat back to infecting their old, usual host. \n\nWe found that it didn't matter which mutation our virus had that allowed them to infect more hosts. The changes that made our viruses much more successful on those novel hosts occurred in the same places in the genome regardless of which host range mutation the virus had. However, we found there was a strong effect between which host range mutation a virus had and how easy or hard it was to further expand its host range. While we previously thought host range in phi6 was only due to the spike protein (similar to how host range appears to work in SARS-CoV-2) we discovered that host range mutations can also occur in proteins involved in how our virus exits a cell (similar to Influenza).  This means that some of our bacteriophage phi6 are entering hosts and infecting them at low levels but we only notice that these viruses are capable of infecting those hosts when the virus gets a mutation to improve leaving the hosts.\n\nWe didn't only evolve our virus on novel hosts; we also evolved our virus on its usual lab host, either after a long time on novel hosts or alternating between novel and typical hosts every day.  In an experiment with daily alternation of hosts we were testing whether forcing the virus to be a generalist would lead to more genetic diversity in those viral populations than viruses solely infecting the typical lab host. This is an important topic to study because more diverse viral populations are more likely to be able to successfully infect new hosts or survive stresses such as antiviral treatments.
