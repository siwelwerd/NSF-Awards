 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is increasing interest in the Internet-\u00adof\u00ad Things where small computing devices are embedded in everyday objects and environments. A key issue is how to power these devices as they become smaller and numerous; batteries add bulk, cost, and require recharging that is difficult at large scale. This project proposes to design battery-free devices that can connect to the Internet using the WiFi networks around us. This proposed research is expected to create a pragmatic shift in the WiFi industry where in addition to providing connectivity to Wi\u00adFi device, routers can now tap into the RF\u00ad powered device ecosystem.\r\n\r\nConventional low-\u00adpower Wi\u00adFi transceivers require much more power than is available from wireless signals, making it infeasible for RF-\u00adpowered devices to literally speak the WiFi protocol. The proposed research will produce algorithms, designs, circuits, and system implementations that will enable the first communication link between RF-powered devices and off the-shelf Wi\u00adFi devices, without the need to speak Wi\u00adFi. This project will develop a range of techniques from new low-\u00adpower analog codes to Wi\u00adFi rate adaptation algorithms to push the limits on our communication range and rate. The project will also design a complete network stack that enables multiple such devices to co-\u00adexist and develop full-duplex capabilities on these battery-\u00adfree devices to significantly improve the power efficiencies of the resulting link-\u00ad and network-\u00adlayer protocols. If successful, this project would create the critical component in the vision of RF-\u00adpowered Internet of things: an ability to connect billions of RF-\u00adpowered devices to existing Internet infrastructure.",
