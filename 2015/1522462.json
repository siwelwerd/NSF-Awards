 "awd_abstract_narration": "Utah Valley University (UVU) is awarded a grant to conduct comprehensive planning for Capitol Reef Field Station (CRFS) to better support the facility's mission of research, education, and conservation (www.uvu.edu/crfs/). CRFS is located within Capitol Reef National Park, an area preserved because of its exposed geologic strata and associated variety of habitats that are home to a rich diversity of living organisms. Established in 2008 under a cooperative agreement between UVU and the National Park Service, CRFS embodies a unique partnership between a university and a national park. A strategic plan for CRFS will enhance the utilization of this station for undergraduates who are learning and conducting faculty-mentored research in a variety of STEM disciplines. The majority of students who visit CRFS are from UVU, an open-enrollment institution committed to inclusivity and access. The university serves a dual mission as both a regional, comprehensive university and as a community college. UVU is in the uncommon position of having the field station resources of a comprehensive university while serving a high proportion of community-college-going students who are underrepresented at field stations across the nation. Over 40% of UVU students are either first-generation college students or ethnic minorities. Strategic planning will enhance this field station's ability to provide meaningful experiences to a diverse group of individuals. Further, in addition to benefiting UVU undergraduates, the proposed planning process will lead to a better understanding of field stations, like CRFS, that are located in U.S. national parks and run through university partnerships.\r\n\r\nAs part of the planning effort, UVU will conduct a survey among other similar field stations to determine how they maximize opportunities and minimize challenges associated with university-national park partnerships. Selected survey participants will be invited to a conference at CRFS to meet with UVU faculty and Capitol Reef National Park personnel. CRFS staff will then visit the field stations of key conference participants, some of whom will be hired as consultants. The consultants will assist in the development of CRFS's strategic plan. The products of the strategic planning process will include: 1) a written 5-year plan for research, education, and conservation activities at the station; 2) a document detailing what additional facilities and infrastructure are needed and a 5-year plan for seeking funding for these needs; 3) a data-informed presentation on field stations in U.S. national parks with university partnerships at the Organization of Biological Field Stations meeting; and 4) a peer-reviewed manuscript submitted for publication.",
