 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award supported by the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI), the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF), and EPSCoR programs, Professor Jessie Carrick from Tennessee Technological University and colleagues Daniel Swartling, Jeffrey Rice, William Carroll and Xuanzhi Zhan will acquire a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a broadband nitrogen-cooled cryoprobe. This spectrometer will allow research in a variety of fields such as those that accelerate chemical reactions of significant economic importance, as well as allow study of biologically relevant species. In general, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most powerful tools available to chemists for the elucidation of the structure of molecules. It is used to identify unknown substances, to characterize specific arrangements of atoms within molecules, and to study the dynamics of interactions between molecules in solution or in the solid state. Access to state-of-the-art NMR spectrometers is essential to chemists who are carrying out frontier research. The nitrogen-cooled probe will provide a significant increase in sensitivity relative to standard NMR probes. The results from these NMR studies will have an impact in synthetic organic/inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research performed by undergraduate and graduate students. The new instrument will have a significant and immediate impact on the research training and teaching endeavors of faculty in the departments of Chemistry as well as Chemical Engineering and an interdisciplinary Environmental Sciences Program. The presence of a reliable instrument equipped with a sample changer will allow much greater student access to a spectrometer in the teaching laboratories than an old, low-field instrument currently at this university. The PIs indicate that the instrument will be utilized by students in the sophomore organic courses, the advanced analytical laboratory, and an advanced organic spectroscopy course. Special emphasis will be directed to women and other historically underrepresented students in STEM.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesizing bis-1,2,4-triazine ligands, including conformational and subsequent complexation studies with simulated actinides for potential remediation of used nuclear fuel; (b) structurally characterizing fluorescent proteins for nerve regeneration and wound healing; (c) developing solution phase structure approaches for dynamic molecules; (d) studying conformations of arrestin proteins; (e) developing green chemistry methodology; and (f) studying thiosemicarbazone ligands as potential anti-cancer therapeutics.",
