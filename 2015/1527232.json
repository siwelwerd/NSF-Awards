 "awd_abstract_narration": "An estimated 13% of crops are lost globally to plant diseases. Disease detection, identification, and tracking is performed today by crop scouts, a process that is expensive, slow and difficult, and is impractical to expand to cover all crops. The project involves developing AI-drones that work side-by-side with farmers and identify specific diseases and assess their progress.  The use of intelligent drones for crop monitoring will allow farmers to respond quickly to emergent diseases, nutrient stress, and other potentially devastating damages without the prohibitive expense of hiring a crop scout. This ability could increase productivity, and may also help predict, track and respond to epidemics for national and global food security. In addition, this technology will also be used for ongoing collection of precise plant performance data for breeding resistance.\r\n\r\nThe central hypothesis of this proposal is that drones equipped with trained Convolutional Neural Networks can provide a transformative increase in actionable crop disease identification. A secondary hypothesis is that the proposed phenotyping at the individual plant level will also provide unprecedented resolution of data for future modeling, breeding, and data-driven yield optimization. In order to test this hypothesis, we will develop a UAS platform to collect images over university owned experimental crops, and aim to develop AI to identify pathologies at an accuracy that is on par with human experts. The UASs will consult human experts in ambiguous cases and gradually learn to make decisions autonomously. The key challenge will be development of AI that can reliably diagnose disease with a good accuracy of detection to false alarms. Automatic identification of disease is a challenging machine vision task given the complexity of images, exacerbated by variable lighting and weather conditions, and navigation/stability control.",

In the United States and parts of Canada, northern leaf blight (NLB), a fungal leaf disease of maize, has progressively become more severe in the past 5 years.

When breeding for NLB resistance, the visual scoring of gray-brown necrotic NLB lesions at multiple time points throughout the growing season is essential, but this effort is very time-consuming and prone to discrepancies between different human raters. To this end, our team of plant pathologists, plant geneticists, and computer scientists made great strides towards developing a non-destructive, image-based phenotyping system that allows for rapid and accurate detection and quantification of NLB lesions. Deep learning algorithms were trained on expert-generated or crowdsourced data to accurately detect and segment individual NLB lesions at high spatial resolution in field images taken by unoccupied aerial vehicles (UAVs). We also trained a deep learning algorithm to detect grassy weeds in UAV imagery collected from maize fields.

The integration of these trained deep learning algorithms with UAVs has the potential to allow for more precise selection of resistant plants in breeding programs and monitoring disease outbreaks in growers' fields.
