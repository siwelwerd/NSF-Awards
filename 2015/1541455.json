This project i) enhances the connectivity between the two physical locations of the university to an ultra-high-speed 100 Gbps backbone, ii) upgrades the connectivity among the core research buildings to 10 Gbps high speed optical links, and iii) establishes dedicated 10 Gbps connections for research to external regional entities that amplifies existing research collaborations among multiple disciplines and foster new opportunities.\r\n \r\nThis project provides an enhanced platform for solving a variety of single-, inter-, and multi-disciplinary problems across several fields of science and engineering. The project particularly assists and promotes the following research activities: end-to-end campus network performance management, large data movement service research, chemical fingerprinting and sequencing research, computational physics and electronic structure research, and human balance and ambulation research. The project broadly impacts both interdisciplinary research and education throughout the university at both the graduate and the undergraduate level.",

The enhancement also includes upgrading connectivity between core research buildings from 1-gigabit to 10-gigabit optical links. The research core buildings include Flarsheim Hall (FH) and Spencer Chemistry &amp; Biological Sciences (SBS) on the Volker campus and the Health Sciences, the School of Medicine, and the School of Dentistry on the Hospital Hill campus. Although the Volker campus has access to external research entities via 10G network connections, research traffic uses logical tunnels that are shared by other outgoing regular traffic. DaRWiN establishes dedicated 10-gigabit connections for research to external regional entities.</p>\n<p>In Phase 1, the UMKC Internet Service (IS) has completed the acquisition of&nbsp;<em>one&nbsp;</em>100G (10 x 10G) mux-ponders for our two existing optical nodes between the campuses. The ultra-high-speed 100 G backbone wave (10 x 10Gb mux-ponder cards) between Hospital Hill and Volker campus was in place. All hospital hill network traffic on the original Cisco optical network has been migrated to the new Fujitsu optical network. <em>Five&nbsp;</em>10G waves, along with&nbsp;<em>sixteen&nbsp;</em>10G multi-rate XFP style optical transceivers and&nbsp;<em>five&nbsp;</em>10G capable distribution switches are purchased for an enhancement of the building up links to 10G. The UMKC's IS has completed high speed \"<em>research wave\"</em>&nbsp;connection installations among four research core buildings in both campuses including Flarsheim Hall (1,008 data jacks), Health Sciences Building (2,592 data jacks), School of Dentistry (1,824 data jacks), and School of Medicine (1,050 data jacks). In Phase 2, the UMKC Internet Service (IS) has completed the acquisition of two Fujitsu 8X1G mux-ponder wave cards, which have more benefits than a single 10G wave from the cost and flexibility point of view. They installed one 8x1G mux-ponder Card between UMKC Newcomb Hall to 1102 Grand (mux-ponder Port 1 of 8 for Digital Town Square, mux-ponder Port 2 of 8 for UMKC School of Pharmacy-Springfield, mux-ponder Port 3 of 8 for Spare Optics, and other 5 port are Available for Future Use) and installed another 8x1G mux-ponder Card between UMKC Newcomb Hall to Level3 (mux-ponder Port 1 of 8 for GPeNi, mux-ponder Port 2 of 8 for InstaGENI, mux-ponder Port 3 of 8 for Spare Optics, and other 5 port are Available for Future Use). All the original external links have been freed for the day-to-day network traffic. All the research traffic has been moved to the new Fujitsu optical network. The UMKC's IS has completed high speed \"<em>research wave\"</em>&nbsp;connection installations among two research core buildings in Volker campus including Flarsheim Hall and Spencer Chemistry &amp; Biological Sciences (SBS) buildings. Upgrading core network switches to support 10G, we have migrated all the research core building (Med, Dental, SBS, SCB, Newcomb, &amp; HSB) uplinks over to these mux-ponder 10Gb channels. Also, we created a science DMZ and an intelligent network monitoring and management system based on&nbsp;PerfSonar. Currently, UMKC Network Architecture operates two PerfSonar servers. One PerfSonar server is testing from UMKC's Internet Edge to the external domains including MOREnet's Kansas City PoP Site, St. Louis PoP Site, Springfield PoP Site, and Mizzou's Research Network. Another PerfSonar server is testing the gateway from UMKC's Datacenter to UMKC's Edge PerfSonar node.</p>\n<p>This allows UMKC researchers to move data faster than ever before, enhance existing research collaborations and foster new opportunities. This project provides an enhanced platform for solving a variety of single-, inter-, and multi-disciplinary problems across several fields of science and engineering. It particularly assists and promotes the following research activities: end-to-end campus network performance management, large data movement service research, chemical fingerprinting and sequencing research, computational physics, and electronic structure research, and human balance and ambulation research. The development broadly impacts interdisciplinary research and education connecting researchers in SCE with researchers at the School of Dentistry, the School of Biological Sciences and the College of Arts &amp; Sciences.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/24/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sejun&nbsp;Song</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541455/1541455_10386958_1551003163229_fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541455/1541455_10386958_1551003163229_fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"DarWiN\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541455/1541455_10386958_1551003163229_fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"DarWiN\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">DarWiN Outcomes</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">sejun song</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sejun&nbsp;Song</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">DarWiN</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541455/1541455_10386958_1551003364268_current--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541455/1541455_10386958_1551003364268_current--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BeforeDarWiN\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541455/1541455_10386958_1551003364268_current--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BeforeDarWiN\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UMKC Network Before DarWiN</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">sejun song</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sejun&nbsp;Song</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BeforeDarWiN</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541455/1541455_10386958_1551003433637_darwin-year1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541455/1541455_10386958_1551003433637_darwin-year1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"yearoneDarWiN\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541455/1541455_10386958_1551003433637_darwin-year1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"yearoneDarWiN\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">DaRWiN Phase 1</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">sejun song</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sejun&nbsp;Song</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">yearoneDarWiN</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541455/1541455_10386958_1551003497875_darwin-year2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541455/1541455_10386958_1551003497875_darwin-year2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"yeartwoDarWiN\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1541455/1541455_10386958_1551003497875_darwin-year2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"yeartwoDarWiN\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">DaRWiN Phase 2</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">sejun song</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sejun&nbsp;Song</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">yeartwoDarWiN</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
