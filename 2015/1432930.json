 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate change can be understood as a change in the radiative budget of the earth; the radiative budget is sensitive to the chemical makeup of the upper-troposphere/lower-stratosphere (UTLS) region. The chemical makeup of the UTLS region remains poorly understood at scales important to chemistry models because of the difficulty in getting high temporal and spatial measurements at high altitude. Deep convection, such as the severe thunderstorms observed throughout the central United States in the summer months, is an efficient transporter of gases from the surface to the UTLS region and, therefore, is a significant source of uncertainty in UTLS composition.\r\n\r\nThe research focuses on two primary objectives, both of which are important for improving our understanding of deep convective mass transport: 1) Improvement of the Algorithm to Estimate Deep Convective Transport using Radar Reflectivity, and 2) Impact of Variable UTLS Structure on Storm-Scale Deep Convective Mass Transport. Objective 1 will utilize the unique dataset provided by the 2012 Deep Convective Clouds and Chemistry (DC3) campaign to further improve a radar-only convective transport algorithm previously developed by the PI's research group.  The radar-only algorithm was developed to allow cloud-scale convective transport estimates in the absence of dual-Doppler radar coverage or in situ chemical measurements. The DC3 campaign data is unique in that dual-Doppler radar coverage is co-located with a wide range of in situ chemical measurements, allowing extensive testing of the radar-only algorithm, and leading to additional improvements (e.g. objective storm maturity estimates). Objective 2 will utilize an idealized cloud-resolving model with identical storms to quantify the impact of varied UTLS structures on deep convective transport. The idealized soundings represent archetypal UTLS structures that have been observed in recent case studies and are hypothesized to strongly impact the irreversible transport, specifically a tropopause inversion and a double tropopause.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nThe algorithm development (objective 1) will allow for cloud-scale convective transport estimates using the NEXRAD radar network. Previously, cloud-scale transport measurements were only available in focused campaigns. The investigation into the impact of the UTLS structure on deep convective transport (objective 2) will allow for an improved understanding of the dynamical role of the tropopause region on convective evolution and transport. The impacts of varied tropopause structures on transport have been observed, but it is difficult to quantify the impact and/or understand the dynamical influences, as the storms themselves (e.g. CAPE, storm morphology) varied significantly in cases observed.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe ability to use the NEXRAD radar network to estimate cloud-scale convective transport (objective 1) in the central U.S. is very important for constraining the convective contribution in chemical transport models. Previously, transport models have had to rely on satellite measurements (which are not cloud scale in at least one of dimension, i.e. x,y,z,t) or on aircraft or dual-Doppler measurements, which are limited to case studies. This feedback to the modeling community will allow for improvements to the convective transport parameterizations. The improved understanding of the impact of tropopause structures on deep convection (objective 2) is also important for constraining transport models, because often the tropopause regions is only poorly represented in regional models. This study will quantify the need for improvements to UTLS representation.  This project also has educational impacts, as several graduate and undergraduate students will be trained over the course of the project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMass transport in deep convection refers to the large amount air from near the surface of the earth that is vacuumed up by severe storms and ejected into the atmosphere approximately 10 km above the surface.  By studying deep convective mass transport, this grant provided more information on how severe storms work, and how the forecasts of deep convection can be improved.  The most significant outcome of this proposal was the extensive use of the already existing U.S. NEXRAD radar network for research.  This grant made unique use of the information on the storm vertical structure available in the radar observations.  This grant compared the observed vertical structure to the forecasted structures to understand when and why our storm forecasts are not as accurate as possible.  We also developed a new classification scheme that uses the vertical structure to better identify storm elements, like the intense convection zone (convective core) and the high-altitude cirrus outflow (anvil).  The figure shows an example of an intense squall line observed across Nebraska, with strong isolated storms spanning from Kansas into Texas (panel a).  Panel b shows the newly developed classification scheme (Storm Labelling in 3 Dimensions; SL3D), with dark blue indicating convective cores and lightest yellow showing anvil outflow.  We used this classification system to calculate the level of maximum detrainment (LMD), or the altitude at which severe storms eject most of the air pulled up from the surface (calculated using anvil near convective cores, blue color in panel c).  When we compare the LMD to the forecasted maximum storm altitudes, we learn a lot about how much mixing occurred between the storm and the background environment.  Quantifying the amount of mixing in severe storms will help us build better forecasting and climate models. \n\nAnother reason the altitude of the LMD is important is to quantify mixing between the troposphere (where weather happens) and the stratosphere (location of the ozone layer- and ozone hole).  These two air masses are separated by a layer called the tropopause.  During a severe storm, the tropopause gets pushed out of shape, and it becomes difficult to define.  This grant analyzed different algorithms for calculating the tropopause location and published recommendations on the best methods for deep convective transport research. \n\nIn addition to the valuable scientific outcomes, this grant provided several graduate and undergraduate students research experience.  These students presented their research at national conferences and published in national scientific journals, giving them the opportunity to hone their scientific communication skills.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/12/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gretchen L Mullendore"
