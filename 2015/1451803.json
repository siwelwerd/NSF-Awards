 "awd_abstract_narration": "Executive function refers to a range of abilities involved in focusing and maintaining attention, and planning actions to achieve goals.  The mastery of these abilities influences children's cognitive and social success.  Research suggests that infants' movements, such as reaching, crawling and walking, may be important for the development of executive function.  The purpose of this research is to examine the effect of locomotor experience on the development of executive function in typically developing, pre-crawling infants.  The research uses new technology that lets a baby \"drive\" a robot by leaning in the direction that the baby wants to travel. This gives babies an early opportunity to develop enhanced locomotor experience which may accelerate the development of executive function.  If enhanced locomotor experience also enhances executive function, this may provide an important avenue of support for individuals with conditions that involve motor impairment, such as Down syndrome, developmental coordination disorder, spina bifida, and cerebral palsy, who often exhibit poor executive function.  \r\n\r\nFive-month old infants will be randomly assigned to an experimental group that drives the robot during each session or to a control group that does not. Infants will complete twelve 20-minute sessions, followed by a battery of tasks including versions of a Visual Cliff, Means-End, A-not-B, and Switch Task that assess aspects of executive function using eye gaze technology. The hypothesis is that infants who have experience with independent locomotion using the robot will show higher levels of executive function than those without this experience.\r\n\r\nFindings from this research will provide insight for understanding basic mechanisms involved in the development of executive function. The outcome of this research may also provide a rationale for reconsidering the role of mobility experience for very young children with delayed or limited independent locomotion.  Because the research is being conducted at an undergraduate-oriented institution, the project will provide significant hands-on research experiences for numerous undergraduate students.",

These skills, related to success in school, work, and relationships with others, begin developing in infancy and continue for the first decades of life.\nSome researchers believe that the ability to move independently fosters the development of executive function in infants, however past studies were correlational, based on observations when infants began crawling and walking. In this experimental study, we controlled independent mobility in infants by using an assistive mobile robot.  \nSixty pre-crawling infants were randomly assigned to a Locomotor or Non-locomotor group. Infants participated in twelve 16-minute play sessions over 8 weeks, beginning at 5 months of age. In each session, both groups experienced a free play period, a directed-reaching period, and a second free play period.

The robot moved toward the toys when infants leaned to reach the toys (see figure 1).  For Non-locomotor infants, all toys were within the infant's reach for free play and directed-reaching periods (see figure 2).

We used their eye movements to assess performance on cognitive tasks that measured executive function. We hypothesized that Locomotor infants, with experience using the mobile robot, would perform better on these tasks than Non-locomotor infants, who did not have mobility experience. \nThis study addressed three research questions:\n1)    Did Locomotor infants learn to drive the mobile robot toward a goal?\n2)    Were there differences between the Locomotor and Non-locomotor groups in the cognitive tasks?  \n3)    For Locomotor infants, was mobility experience related to scores on the executive function tasks?\nTo answer the first question, we measured the amount of time during free play periods when Locomotor infants drove toward a goal.  We also recorded their ability to drive to toys offered to them beyond their reach.  We found that the amount of time that they moved in a goal-directed manner during free play periods increased over time, while movement that appeared to be non-intentional decreased.  Infants? also increased in their ability to drive to toys that were offered to them beyond their reach. \nTo answer the second question, we measured eye gaze and pupil dilation in six tasks with infants in both the Locomotor and the Non-locomotor groups.  We found that Locomotor infants performed better than Non-locomotor infants on three of these tasks.  In the cat puppet task, Locomotor infants visually fixated longer on a video of a dancing cat than did Non-locomotor infants. In two other tasks, the A not B object permanence task and the rule switch tasks, infants learned to anticipate an action that repeated on one side of the screen.  When the action was shifted to the opposite side of the screen, the gaze tracker was used to identify whether infants were able to correctly anticipate this change in future trials.  \nNo differences were found between groups on for the three remaining executive function tasks: looking duration, means end knowledge, or traversibility of a visual surface.  In the looking duration task, infants watched as a hand puppet moved; we hypothesized that longer looking would indicate better executive function. In the means end knowledge task, infants watched a tower of blocks move steadily from the left and behind an obstacle, then continue, to reappear on the right side of the screen.  When this was repeated and the block tower reappeared on the left side of the screen rather than the right, we anticipated that infants with better executive function would look for a longer period of time.  The third task, traversibility of a visual surface, showed a dog moving toward a visual cliff. We anticipated infants with better executive function would demonstrate pupil dilation as the dog approached the cliff. \nIn answer to the third question, we found a relationship between the amount of time infants spent moving on the robotic device during free play in the final five sessions and their scores on the rule switch task, but not on other measures of executive function.  \nData from this study suggest that self-guided mobility (in this case provided with an assistive robot) advances the development of executive function.
