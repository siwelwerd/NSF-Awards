 "awd_abstract_narration": "Three emerging technologies provide unique opportunities for denser cities throughout the developed world: vehicle sharing, electric vehicles, and autonomous systems. Bringing these technologies close together can help enable joint mobility-on-demand and urban-logistics services. This project focuses on the co-development of design and algorithms to enable new concepts that will serve this purpose. The Persuasive Electric Vehicle (PEV) is a tricycle navigating in the bike lanes. The PEV can autonomously drive itself to its next customer; it can also deliver packages to its customers who order goods online. \r\n\r\nOn the algorithmic front, the project will investigate (i) provably-safe algorithms for autonomous navigation in bike lanes, and (ii) algorithms for high-performance routing and rebalancing for joint mobility on demand and urban logistics. On the design front, the project will investigate (i) the vehicle-level designs that can best embrace the relevant CPS technologies, and (ii) the system-level designs and urban planning practices that can help enable the PEV concept. The PIs will collaborate with the City of Boston and participate in the Global City Teams Challenge, where they will demonstrate the PEV concept and its potential impact on future smart cities.",

We observe a strong trend in the U.S. and elsewhere that younger population is increasingly choosing to live in urban centers, and choose not to own cars. They choose to live in walking or biking distance to where they work, shop, and socialize. Many studies show that dense urban areas fuel innovation, increase productivity, while enhancing the quality of social life.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project developed new mobility and logistics concepts that can serve dense urban areas leveraging the emerging autonomy technologies and new urban design concepts. For this purpose, we developed a new concept, called the Persuasive Electric Vehicle (PEV). The PEV is a urban tricycle that navigates in specialized, dedicated lanes, such as bike lanes. Each PEV drives to its next customer fully autonomously, and can be summoned by a consumer smartphone app. Once a PEV reaches the customer, the customer rides the PEV to his/her destination and leaves the PEV anywhere at a bike lane. The PEV then drives to a charging pod or to its next customer. At off-peak times, the PEVs can help carry packages and enable rapid urban logistics, e.g., same-hour delivery of goods. The autonomy embedded in the PEV enables a new transportation that is radically different than the existing bike sharing or car sharing systems, where vehicles must be taken from and left to a station. The PEV concept completely eliminates stations, and makes the system more available to the end-user. The PEV also carries important design elements. It is a three-wheeler which makes it easy to ride, thus more accessible. It has an enclosure, which enhances safety. It also utilizes its electric motor to decrease the effort required for the ride.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have designed, built and demonstrated a PEV system. The demonstrations included a display in Washington D.C. and full-scale demonstrations in Cambridge, MA, Andorra, Andorra, and Taipei, Taiwan. The project developed and combined results in autonomy as well as urban planning and design. The resulting system helped us understand what autonomy-enabled transportation systems of the future tailored for dense urban centers may look like.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A project demonstration is available here:&nbsp;https://youtu.be/guekCZ3rHi0</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/07/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sertac&nbsp;Karaman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523401/1523401_10362272_1504793318412_PEV_Rendering--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523401/1523401_10362272_1504793318412_PEV_Rendering--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"PEV Concept Design\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523401/1523401_10362272_1504793318412_PEV_Rendering--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"PEV Concept Design\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PEV Concept Design</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Lin (MIT)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sertac&nbsp;Karaman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">PEV Concept Design</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523401/1523401_10362272_1504793380207_IMG_20161121_213057--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523401/1523401_10362272_1504793380207_IMG_20161121_213057--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"PEV's built at workshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523401/1523401_10362272_1504793380207_IMG_20161121_213057--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"PEV's built at workshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PEV's built at workshop</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Lin (MIT)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sertac&nbsp;Karaman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">PEV's built at workshop</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523401/1523401_10362272_1504793480364_ScreenShot2017-09-07at5.06.52PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523401/1523401_10362272_1504793480364_ScreenShot2017-09-07at5.06.52PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"PEV Demonstration at Taipei\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523401/1523401_10362272_1504793480364_ScreenShot2017-09-07at5.06.52PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"PEV Demonstration at Taipei\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PEV Demonstration at Taipei</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Michael Lin (MIT)</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Sertac&nbsp;Karaman</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">PEV Demonstration at Taipei</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
