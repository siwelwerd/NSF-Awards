 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funding for the workshop \"Analysis in Lyon\" which occur at the \u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure de Lyon,  October 26-30, 2015.  \r\n\r\nThis workshop focuses on recent developments in Analysis, especially in the field of partial differential equations. The topics to be covered in the workshop are gradient flows, regularity theory for optimal transport, Ricci curvature flows, pressureless gas dynamics, fractional diffusion, and kinetic theory.  This award gives young researchers without other funding the opportunity to participate in this workshop.    A (partial) list of confirmed speakers includes L. Caffarelli, W. Gangbo, S. Serfaty, F. Lin and C. Villani.  The organizing committee will strive to make this opportunity known to target groups through a variety of media.\r\n\r\nThe workshop website is at: http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/marco.mazzucchelli/analysis-lyon2015/",
