 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports research that will use water samples, creep meter data, and computer models to understand the hydrology of the Longitudinal Valley Fault in eastern Taiwan. Faults can exhibit two behaviors--stick-slip behavior, characterized by earthquakes, and aseismic slip, known as creep. The Longitudinal Valley Fault exhibits both behaviors with a magnitude 6.5 earthquake in 2003 and yearly creep occurring almost exclusively during the rainy season. This seasonal motion is extremely unusual and, unlike most unpredictable faults, provides information about the processes occurring within faults. Dr. Jian-Cheng Lee, who maintains the Longitudinal Valley Fault observatory, has used the seasonal motion on the fault to make testable predictions about the depth, source, pressure, and pattern of water circulating within the fault. In collaboration with Dr. Lee, this study will sample the water chemistry and temperature of springs along the fault to more directly measure the processes inferred from fault motions.\r\n\r\nThis study will involve sampling hot springs, which are directly measuring the conditions within the fault. These new observations will be integrated with creep and well log data to create a 3D hydrologic model for fault movement. Tritium (3H) concentrations measure if water postdates subaerial nuclear tests and the amount of mixing with deeper fluids. Deuterium and oxygen isotope ratios can be used to trace the source elevation of groundwater due to the systematic changes in the isotopic composition of rain.  Thermobarometers use the temperature dependence of chemical reactions with bedrock to record the pressures and temperatures experienced by groundwater. These measurements constrain the depth and speed of groundwater circulation near the fault as well as source of this groundwater. This study will then use the open-source United States Geological Survey program HYDROTHERM to model 2-phase advection of heat, pressure, and water through a fault zone. This NSF EAPSI award support the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan.",
