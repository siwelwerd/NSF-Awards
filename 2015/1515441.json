 "awd_abstract_narration": "Changing one?s residence is becoming ubiquitous; at the same time, the psychological literature portends a bleak future for the residentially mobile.  Mobility has been found to predict anxiety, stress, and most strikingly, feelings of anticipated loneliness.  In short, a mobile mindset causes a severe threat to belonging.  Most of the existing research on mobility has focused on culturally westernized samples from the United States?a relatively individualistic and geographically large region. No studies have explored how the culture or geographic size of a region may influence the psychological impact of residential mobility.  The present work, to be conducted with Dr. Bobby Cheon at Nanyang Technological University, aims to address this gap in the literature.  Singapore is an ideal location for this research, as it is economically and linguistically similar to the United States, but is relatively small in geographic size, as well as immensely culturally diverse.\r\n\r\nCultural differences in responses to threats to belonging are robust.  For example, following an instance of being misunderstood, Western participants became more approach-oriented, whereas East Asian participants became more withdrawal-oriented.  In this way, although mobility may motivate participants from individualistic cultures to seek affiliative opportunities, and thus demonstrate heightened attention to positive, acceptance cues, participants from collectivistic cultures may become motivated to avoid further rejection, and thus become more attentive to negative social cues.  The present work will employ a cultural neuroscience approach to explore this question. Singaporean participants will be randomly assigned to either a mobile or stable prime condition. They will then complete an emotional face perception task consisting of positive and negative social stimuli while EEG is recorded. We plan to focus on the activity of the N170, an ERP component that has been found to be particularly active during the structural encoding of facial stimuli. This NSF EAPSI award is a fellowship to a U.S. graduate student funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Singapore.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResidential mobility (the act of changing one\u00c6s residence) is becoming more and more prevalent, with advances in technology and transportation.  However, research exploring the effects of moving remains impoverished.  Brandon Ng completed research to understand and explore cultural variation in the attitudes toward, and psychological consequences of, residential mobility.  With support from the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institute (EAPSI) fellowship program, he lived in Singapore for two months and conducted research under the direction of Dr. Bobby Cheon at Nanyang Technological University.  During his time working with Dr. Cheon, Brandon gained a wealth of experience in research theory and methods, networking with other faculty members and researchers, and laying the groundwork for future collaboration.\n\nSeveral lines of research were investigated.  In one line of work, Singaporean participants were recruited to come to the lab and were asked to report their attitudes toward moving in Singapore&mdash;for instance, how stressful moving would be , how much uncertainty they would experience, how positive or negative the experience would be, etc.  Notably, participants answered these questions for two different types of moves&mdash;a move that required them to move within Singapore and a move that required them to move outside of Singapore.  Interestingly, Singaporeans perceived both types of moves to be distressing and detrimental to their social resources.  However, their attitudes were particularly strong for moves outside of Singapore, as opposed to within Singapore.  Singaporeans may have distinguished between the two different types of moves, since Singapore is a relatively small geographic space and people are very well-connected by public transportation.  In the United States, however, which is much more geographically large and less well-connected (sometimes even neighboring towns in the USA feature people with drastically different norms, practices, and values), people may perceive both types of moves to be equally difficult and stressful.  To make a full cross-cultural comparison, similar data are currently being collected in the United States.\n\nThe results of this work vastly inform existing literature on residential mobility in social psychology, which is still in its nascent stages.  Moreover, the majority of work that has been conducted looking at the psychological impact of residential mobility has taken place in the United States.  Virtually no work has looked at attitudes toward, or the ramifications of, moving in other cultural contexts.  As the world becomes more globalized and interconnected, and people move in greater frequencies (either out of necessity or to pursue opportunity), research examining residential mobility\u00c6s impact on mental and physical health will become more and more relevant and timely.  Beyond informing existing scientific knowledge on residential mobility, the present investigation will also help policymakers, employers, and society at large better understand the psychological consequences of moving.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/15/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brandon W Ng"
