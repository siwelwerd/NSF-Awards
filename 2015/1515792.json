 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomical observations are now probing the early stages of the universe, in which galaxies developed and merged, and the formation of the structures in the universe at the present era was set in motion. An important part of this story is the chemical evolution of galaxies. The formation of the elements in the first stars and their subsequent dispersal are powerful tracers of structure formation and evolution in the early universe. The elements are synthesized deep in the interiors of stars well beyond the reach of direct observation. For this reason, understanding their synthesis and the environment which enables it is clearly in the realm of theory. Although stellar evolution theory is one of the oldest branches of computational science, it has only recently become possible to accurately simulate\r\nsome of the key events and processes inside stars that give rise to the heavy elements that are injected back into the interstellar environment rather than being swallowed up in collapsed objects. These events can be quite brief in some cases, lasting only years, days, or even seconds in the case of explosive phenomena. The brevity of these events makes it possible for us now to simulate them in full 3-D detail. This project aims to build a new and powerful capability to simulate these events by coupling together 3-D simulations that cover brief time intervals with 1-D simulations spanning much longer times.\r\n\r\nThis project will simulate processes deep inside stars of the early universe that involve hydrogen ingestion events caused by mixing of material across the boundaries of convection zones. In 1-D stellar evolution simulations, these give rise to rapid hydrogen burning, with enormous energy release and causing nucleosynthesis by neutron capture from neutron fluxes intermediate between the slow (s) and rapid (r) processes. This is the intermediate, or i-process nucleosynthesis that is targeted in this study. Accurate treatment of the convective boundary mixing that drives this i-process requires full 3-D simulation. In some cases that will be addressed, it is possible to simulate the entire event in 3-D. In others, the 3-D simulations performed at intervals as part of a coupled 1-D and 3-D stellar evolution calculation will serve to recalibrate the coefficients in approximate 1-D models for dynamic mixing processes. Such coupled calculations will use these periodic model recalibrations to validate the use of the models as the calculation progresses. When unacceptably large revisions of model \"constants\" are indicated, a recomputation with 3-D recalibrations taken at shorter time intervals will result. This new process called autocorrecting modeling involves periodic generation of large amounts of 3-D data from simulation codes. This data generation is followed by a detailed analysis of the data in terms of 1-D models. The results of this analysis are then fed back into the 1-D stellar evolution computation. In the process of carrying out the simulations a large database of results from 3-D simulations of convective boundary mixing in stellar interiors will be generated. This database will be organized so that the simulation codes can mine it automatically, comparing it to a variety of potentially useful 1-D models of the mixing process. This database, together with the tools that mine it, analyze it, and display results, will be unique. It will represent a significant investment, not only in our time developing the simulation codes and data analysis and visualization tools, but also in computer time on one of the most powerful computing systems in the world. A broad impact of this project will therefore be this database and tools that make it useful in stellar evolution research. The project will result in the development of new, automated techniques for data-enabled science but in addition to these techniques an important outcome will be the data itself which will be made available to the community on-line in a useful format. The hydrodynamics simulations will enable the clarification of the nucleosynthetic yields of the i-process in early generations of stars. The PI will work with the NuGrid collaboration to see that the results become incorporated into data sets that are available to the community for chemical evolution simulations of galaxies and structures in the early universe. The PI is also collaborating with the scientists at NSF?s Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA). A further impact of this work will be to perform the detailed simulations that allow the assessment of the impact of these new rate measurements on nucleosynthesis, so that it can be compared with observables such as spectra of metal-poor stars in globular clusters and isotopic compositions of pre-solar grains.",

We have been concentrating so far on hydrogen ingestion flashes, in which unburned hydrogen-rich fuel is brought into the convection zone above the helium burning shell.&nbsp; The ingested hydrogen reacts with carbon in the convection zone to set off a sequence of nucleosynthesis reactions that is called the i-process, since the neutron fluxes that result are intermediate between the slow and rapid s- and r-process nucleosynthesis.&nbsp; In the beginning of our project on Blue Waters, we simulated hydrogen ingestion events in evolved stars, and during the last year we have been gearing up to attack the more challenging problem of the potential merger of multiple nuclear burning shells in massive stars. &nbsp;This has involved detailed studies of the ingestion process, particularly in massive star contexts, as well as the aggressive development of a new simulation code.&nbsp; Our results on i-process nucleosynthesis are important as inputs for the study of the chemical evolution of galaxies in cosmology.&nbsp; Our new work, just begun, with massive stars has potentially large impacts on the conditions just before those stars explode, and hence also on the injection of heavier elements from these explosions into the surrounding interstellar medium.</p>\n<p>Our work to date simulating hydrogen ingestion flashes exploits the PPM gas dynamics method coupled with the PPB moment-conserving advection scheme for the multifluid volume fraction.&nbsp; PPB delivers more than double the resolving power of the PPM scheme for the single, very important variable representing the volume fraction of entrained fluid.&nbsp; Together with the already high resolving power of PPM, we are therefore able to obtain very accurate results on a uniform grid.&nbsp; We must simulate a great many large-eddy overturning times in the convection zone above a nuclear burning shell in order to accurately approach a nonlinear, global oscillation of burning of ingested hydrogen (which we have called a GOSH) that increases the hydrogen ingestion rate by as much as two orders of magnitude.&nbsp; We are able to cover this long approach to the violent ingestion event because our PPM code scales to nearly 14,000 nodes on Blue Waters, at which scale it advances the simulation by roughly 20 time steps per second.&nbsp; Thus the millions of time steps we need to simulate an ingestion event accurately are practical on Blue Waters with our code.</p>\n<p>We have been turning our attention to massive stars, where the ingestion of material from above a burning shell of, for example, oxygen can allow the convection zone above that burning shell to eat its way outward in radius until it reaches the carbon burning shell above it.&nbsp; A merger of these two burning shells can then result.&nbsp; Simulating this process is very challenging.&nbsp; We have been studying the relevant ingestion process in considerable detail over the last year with the goal of alternating between 1D and 3D simulation in order to span the time necessary in leading up to a shell merger.&nbsp; Our 3-D simulations would keep models used in the 1-D intervals that stitch one 3-D run to the next validated as good descriptions of the full 3-D results.&nbsp; This work is illustrated in the Figures.</p>\n<p>We have devoted an enormous effort during the last year and a half to the development of a completely new code.&nbsp; This code adds a 3-level AMR grid that will enable us to contain multiple nuclear burning shells and their respective convection zones in a single simulation.&nbsp; It is designed to scale also to 14,000 nodes while running roughly twice as fast per node as our older code by exploiting 32-bit precision and GPU acceleration.</p>\n<p>We are producing a database of detailed simulations that investigate the phenomenon of convective boundary mixing at unprecedented accuracy for convection zones which extend over ranges in radius of more than a factor of 2 (see <a href=\"http://www.lcse.umn.edu/\">www.lcse.umn.edu</a>).&nbsp; Global convection modes play an important role in these situations, making simulation difficult and costly.&nbsp; Convective boundary mixing plays an important role in stellar evolution.&nbsp; In particular, in ingestion events that we study, it can have a dramatic impact on nucleosynthesis, which in turn affects galactic chemical evolution.</p>\n<p>We have carried out our simulations on Blue Waters because of its special ability to enable our simulation code to be run at a sufficiently large scale that our large computations can each be completed in less than one week.&nbsp;
