As many users nowadays carry a mobile device (e.g., a smartphone), authentication approaches beyond the often-criticized traditional password leverage auxiliary information that can be received by, displayed on, computed by or sent from these omnipresent personal companions. Such multi-factor authentication schemes have the benefit of relying on a combination of \"something the user knows\" with \"something the user has,\" but are typically only tied to data stored on or sent to the auxiliary device, rather than to the device itself. The goal of this research is to enable practical authentication based on hardware characteristics of consumer-grade mobile devices by transforming the idea of \"something the user has\" from intangible software artifacts to physical properties of the device, without the need of dedicated internal or external hardware or circuitry in place.\r\n\r\nThe project focuses on a novel authentication modality based on inherent physical hardware properties in the form of device-specific, unavoidable and unclonable manufacturing imperfections of the smartphone's digital camera sensor. These \"sensor fingerprints\" can be extracted from probe images displayed to and captured by the user's smartphone in an authentication protocol. At the technical level, a major requirement of an effective sensor-based authentication scheme is leakage-resistance, i.e., adversaries shall not be able to infer the authentication modality from public images acquired outside of the authentication protocol. In this framework, the project integrates techniques for leakage-resistant fingerprint generation and verification, fingerprint re-use across multiple authentication instances, efficient fingerprint storage, and fingerprint quality assessment. By putting ideas from the area of media forensics on the map of an established field of security research, the project will pave the way for novel perspectives in both domains.",

Such multi-factor authentication schemes have the benefit of not simply relying on \"something the user knows\" by also requiring \"something the user has\".

To address this challenge, the goal of this project has been to enable practical authentication based on hardware characteristics of consumer-grade mobile devices by transforming the idea of \"something the user has\" from intangible and easy-to-copy software artifacts to unique physical properties of the device, without the need of dedicated security hardware or circuitry in place.</p>\n<p>As a technical solution, we have proposed a novel authentication modality based on inherent physical hardware properties in the form of device-specific, unavoidable and unclonable manufacturing imperfections of the smartphone's digital camera sensor. These \"sensor fingerprints\" can be extracted from probe images displayed to and captured by the user's smartphone in a visual code authentication scheme and are a convenient surrogate to verify physical possession of a previously registered mobile device. Yet camera fingerprints are particularly prone to spoofing attacks: a relatively small number of public images (obtained for instance from popular photo sharing websites) is sufficient for an attacker Eve to obtain a user Alice's fingerprint estimate. We mitigate this problem by introducing the notion of fragile camera sensor noise fingerprints. We utilize that Alice has full control over her camera, while Eve can only access the data made public by Alice. Under the reasonable assumption that Alice decided to share only JPEG images with the public, this asymmetry suggests an authentication scheme that resorts to the portion of camera fingerprints that is lost during JPEG compression. With access to raw sensor readings, Alice is always able to present a viable fingerprint, but restricting Eve's access to JPEG images prevents her from doing the same. For a prototypic implementation, the project has combined these ideas with a QR-code based authentication protocol, for which we were able to demonstrate that both the information embedded in the QR code and the camera fingerprint can be reliably extracted and verified by the authentication server from as little as 5% of the data that would normally be transmitted to communicate a digital image of the QR code itself. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first practicable approach to achieve sensor-augmented device authentication, which actively undermines spoofing attacks by design.
