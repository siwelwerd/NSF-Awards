 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Delaware State University (DSU) seeks to create the Cyber Infused Mathematics Initiative (CIMI) to establish inverted classes for introductory mathematics courses using a student-centered approach that blends online mastery learning and in-class inquiry-based instruction within a scientific problem solving context. Currently, 89% of freshmen students at DSU place into a non-credit, developmental mathematics course. Not being able to take the introductory mathematics and other gatekeeper courses reduces student persistence and retention. The main goal of the CIMI is to improve retention of STEM students, particularly between the freshman and sophomore year by creating a supportive culture of active learning. \r\n\r\nThe project seeks to transform mathematics instruction at DSU to improve students' learning outcomes and engagement with STEM topics; to increase the passing rate of STEM freshman enrolled in College Algebra; to increase the number of students retained in STEM majors from the freshman to sophomore year; to increase the number of students who graduate in STEM majors; and  to develop a cadre of interdisciplinary faculty committed to implementing best practices in the teaching of introductory mathematics.  Mathematics and science faculty will collaborate first to revise the College Algebra course which serves the majority of entering STEM freshman. They will then adapt the approach to Trigonometry and Calculus I, the mathematics courses STEM students take after completing College Algebra. This project will produce an empirically based model that bridges the gap in student preparation between developmental and college-level mathematics coursework, as well as link professional development with changes in instructional practices and students' mathematical practices at the college level. The project will examine undergraduate students' mathematics learning and achievement in the context of a historically black university, where 81% of the undergraduate students are from racial and ethnic groups traditionally underrepresented in STEM. The project is guided by an on-going evaluation.",

Second, CIMI was designed to improve students\u2019 performance in their mathematics classes and persistence in their chosen STEM major.  The mathematics was embedded in a scientific PBL story to encourage student persistence and engagement in the problem-solving process.   As students engaged in the process of solving the PBLs, it would reveal the usefulness and relevance of learning specific mathematics topics in their scientific field of study. \n\nDuring each summer of the project, mathematics and science participated in the Mathematics Teaching Institute (MTI), a multi-day (3-5) professional development workshop.  Teachers received training on research recommended effective teaching practices, using technology in the classroom, and designing PBLs. The goal of MTI was to establish a more consistent approach to student-centered instruction emphasizing the eight Mathematical Practices as defined by the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) and the integration of scientific inquiry.

Each semester College Algebra and Trigonometry students engaged in 3-5 PBLs as in-class group activities.  Calculus implemented 2-3 PBLs, but as take-home group projects.\n\nIn general, course pass rates fluctuated but remained similar throughout the life of the CIMI.
