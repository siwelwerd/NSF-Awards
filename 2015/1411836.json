 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the question of how viruses, which depend on the infected host cells for making virus proteins, use the host cell protein-producing machinery, the ribosome, in a manner that is highly efficient. The research will exploit and extend the novel discovery that the genetic material of a virus contains specific structures that can bind to the ribosomes and that thereby allow them to be quickly and efficiently reused. Key outcomes of this project will be broadly applicable   in many fields, including in biotechnology to enhance the efficiency of protein production. The outcomes may also lead to novel approaches to control a variety of viruses that infect plants and animals. This project will provide educational and research training opportunities for high school students, college undergraduates, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. The outcomes of the research will be presented at scientific conferences, taught in introductory courses to biology students, and used to introduce undergraduates and high school students to the life cycle of viruses. The principal investigator will work with Advanced Placement students at DuVal High School (98% under-represented minority students) to prepare them for college, serve on the board of the National Academy of Sciences partnership with the entertainment industry and will also serve as a scientific consultant for programming by the Discovery and National Geographic Channels.\r\n\r\nThe plant virus \"Pea enation mosaic umbravirus\" has a bipartite positive-strand RNA genome containing two 3' proximal T-shaped structures (kl-TSS and 3'TSS). These structures are critical for translation of the uncapped viral RNAs into proteins. 3'TSS is an example of the long-known, better-studied tRNA-like structures found in viral RNAs, but the existence of the kl-TSS was unsuspected and came to light during previous research. The newly found, internal kl-TSS, with its three-way branched secondary structure, binds to 40S, 60S and 80S ribosomes and can simultaneously engage in a long-distance interaction with 5H2, a coding region hairpin located near the 5'Untranslated Region (UTR). The 3'TSS is also likely to connect with 5H2, and the whole system will be exploited to learn how different tRNA-mimics interact with ribosomes to enhance translation. Specifically, a novel \"pick-up and delivery\" hypothesis will be evaluated, i.e., the idea that multiple TSS may be connected via RNA:RNA interactions with the ends of virus-encoded Open Reading Frames (ORF), to gather ribosomal subunits downstream of an ORF at the end of translation and relay them back to the 5'UTR for another round of translation. In addition, it will be tested whether the kl-TSS can enhance translation of capped mRNAs produced from expression constructs. These experiments will inform our understanding of how this novel and possibly widespread use of tRNA mimicry operates to enhance translation and to control plant virus life cycles. The project will also lead to the development of expression cassettes with enhanced translation of encoded proteins with potentially extensive agricultural as well as laboratory applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of this project were to develop new insights into how RNA viruses translate their genomes.  Major outcomes of the project include the discovery of a new type of infectious agent (similar to a virus but not a virus) and discovery of a new RNA element associated with how many plant RNA viruses translate their genome.  The new infectious agent is an RNA that is related to umbraviruses but is missing several regions that are critical to umbraviruses and virtually all other plant viruses.  Plant viruses encode a replication enzyme, a packaging protein, a protein that suppresses the immune system of the plant and proteins that allow the viral RNA to transit from cell-to-cell and long distances through the plants vascular system.  These latter proteins were thought to be essential for all mobile infectious RNAs.  Our new infectious agent, termed an \"independent mobile RNA or iRNA\" only codes for a replicating enzyme.  This paradigm-shifting RNA makes over 20-fold more polymerase than a normal virus and its infection is limited to a plant?s vascular system.  Unlike every plant (and animal) virus, this iRNA has no host-range restriction that we can determine (i.e., it infects every plant tried so far).  Because it is symptomless in all citrus trees, we are developing its use as a vector to deliver anti-bacterial agents into the veins of trees to combat diseases like citrus greening, which has no cure and is a threat to every citrus tree world-wide.\n\n \n\nA second major outcome is the discovery of a new RNA structure that controls translation in a substantial number of important plant RNA viruses.  Many plant viruses contain RNA structures in their 3? untranslated regions that enhance translation, termed 3? cap-independent translation enhancers (3?CITEs). Numerous studies have revealed that different 3?CITEs enhance translation by interacting with proteins necessary for ribosomes to start translation at the other end of the viral genome.  Since viral translation and replication cannot occur at the same time, we hypothesized that somehow, the bound proteins must be released from the 3?CITEs before replication can begin.  We have found a nearly ubiquitous RNA structure near different 3?CITEs that are capable of controlling translation.  These elements, termed \"CAS\" interact with an important region in the 3?CITE, which should prevent the interaction of critical translation proteins with the 3?CITE.  CAS have been characterized for three different viruses and surprisingly are also absolutely essential for translation as well.  These findings open up a new level of understanding of how plant viruses control the critical switch between translation and replication.\n\n \n\nA third major outcome was solving a 20 year mystery for how some messenger RNAs (the RNAs that are the blueprints for proteins) are able to evade a mechanism in cells that degrades RNAs with long stretches of sequence past where the ribosomes stop translating, a process called Nonsense Mediated Decay or NMD.  We discovered that a stretch of unstructured RNA was sufficient to keep the RNA from degradation, and this is how some viruses also protect themselves from degradation.  We also discovered a second, possible connected, role for unstructured RNA: it can serve as an internal ribosome entry site to translate internal protein coding regions of a virus.\n\n \n\nAdditional major outcomes include discerning how a virus without an apparent CAS controls the switch between translation and replication.  Working with single RNA molecules, we discovered that the after the replicating enzyme is made, it interacts with a site near the 3?CITE, which disrupts the structure of the CITE clearing ribosomes that bind to it and setting up the template for replication.  In addition, we made the novel discovery that a virus with three 3?CITEs uses only two to translate the genome of the virus, but uses all three to translate a shorter virus-derived \"subgenomic\" RNA.  We also showed that the universally accepted idea that connecting the two ends of a virus help more ribosomes to load onto the genome for translation was completely wrong.  Rather, connecting the ends allow more of the viruses to be translated, thus enhancing the amount of protein made by the virus population.  \n\n \n\nBesides the iRNA broader impacts,  we developed a new, free to download computer program for drawing RNA that far surpasses what is currently available, and should be extremely useful for all RNA biologists.  In addition, the PI Anne Simon gave numerous presentations to lay audiences on her contributions to the science of the popular TV series \"The X-Files\", and engaged daily with thousands of fans on social media to promote science (concentrating on the importance of vaccines and agricultural biotechnology).\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anne E Simon"
