 "awd_abstract_narration": "Information, beliefs, diseases, technologies, and behaviors propagate through social interactions as a contagion. Understanding of how these contagions spread is crucial in encouraging beneficial and healthy behaviors and discouraging the ones that are destructive and damaging. Rigorous, mathematical understanding of complex social contagions is not just an abstraction, but will guide applications from healthcare to word-of-mouth advertising. The technical content of this project is inherently interdisciplinary, and its lessons will apply to related fields such as probability, economics, sociology, and statistical physics. The research efforts are integrated with the educational and outreach activities of the PIs, who have strong records of broadly disseminating cutting-edge research to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students through teaching, outreach programs, and personal mentoring. \r\n\r\nThis project will transform our understanding of social contagions by: 1) Developing a suite of technical tools to enable improved understanding of specific complex processes; 2) Determining how various parameters of cascade and social structure together impact the chances of a cascade's success or failure; and 3) Obtaining empirical evidence to both corroborate the theoretical findings, and uncover the space of realistic setting for certain parameters. \r\n\r\nMany existing models of contagion assume that increasing the number of infected (or affected) neighbors marginally decreases the chance of infection. Many contagions, such as adoption of expensive new technology, fail to have this property, but instead have more complex rules for infection.  This leads to different spreading behaviors even on the same networks. Motivated by sociology research findings, this project will greatly enhance our understanding of social contagions in three aspects. First this project will provide rigorous study of the spreading behavior of a simplified theoretical model called k-complex contagions and its interactions with structures in the underlying graph such as tie strength, unusually influential nodes, and community structures. Second, this project presents a general model for studying cascades that is both theoretically tractable and practically motivated. The general model generalizes most previous theoretical models of complex and simple contagions and includes homophily and environmental factors on cascades. Finally, this project will use post-hoc analysis as well as real world social experiments to verify the veracity of the model and fit the parameters in different settings.",

Understanding of how these contagions spread is crucial in encouraging beneficial and healthy behaviors and discouraging the ones that are destructive and damaging.\n\nComplex contagions describe diffusion of behaviors in a social network in settings where the effect of having multiple infected neighbors can be greater than the sum of their effects.  That is, the marginal influence of an additional infected neighbor is sometimes increasing (nonsubmodular).  This can creates a synergistic effect.  It has been argued that complex contagions better model behavioral changes such as adoption of new beliefs, fashion trends or expensive technology innovations. This has motivated rigorous understanding of spreading of complex contagions in social networks.\n\nThis project transformed our understanding of social contagions, and particularly complex cascades, in three main ways:\n\n1) Determining how various parameters of cascades and social structure together impact the chances of a cascade?s success or failure;\n\n*  Showing certain properties facilitate the spread of complex contagions, for example: skewed degree distributions, a network structure built over time, and distributions of weak-ties that are neither too random nor concentrated.\n\n*  Illustrating how complex contagions change the nature of influence: seeds should be placed in clusters, the problem is computationally hard, but developed heuristics are successful.\n\n*  Better understanding consensus in a flexible framework called node dynamics which generalizes other models.

In particular, we develop new tools to show how mean-field approximations relate to the actual discrete process.  Our tools allow the analysis of Markov processes with no stationary distributions, which was a large gap in the prior literature.  Our tools obtain tight bounds for a large range of previously inscrutable problems.  Moreover, our analysis has promise of translating to very different problems, such as stochastic gradient descent, an essential element of modern machine learning.    \n\n3) Obtaining empirical evidence to both corroborate the theoretical findings, and uncover the space of realistic setting for certain parameters.
