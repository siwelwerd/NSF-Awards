 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase I project seeks to improve and expand the technology of recyclable thermosets by creating a new class of high performance, cycloaliphatic polyamines that retain an acid-cleavable bond. If successful, this effort will lead to a new class of high-performance composite resins which can be recycled.  Increased energy efficiency is leading transportation to rely on lightweight, thermoset composites. But the intractability of traditional thermosets limits the value of recycled composites, and adoption in industry. Industry composites recycling experts estimate the overall scrap cost for the composites industry is between $500 and $750 million a year. Post-manufacturing scrap can range from 5 to 50 percent of the input materials. The global auto composites market alone represents an estimated $4 billion by 2017, while a small volume, composite car line represents roughly 400 metric tons of polyamine curing agent.  In the Phase I effort, we will design and synthesize novel, recyclable cycloaliphatic polyamine structures and further formulate them with various epoxy resins to meet the performance and processing requirements for transportation composites manufacturing. Doing so will help composite manufacturers improve costs and meet regulatory compliance for recyclability and manufacturing waste disposal. \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit of this project will be an expanded knowledge base and chemistry platform for synthesizing and formulating recyclable thermoset resins. Cyclic structures, by nature, provide higher structural rigidity of a molecule. This rigidity translates to an overall higher mechanical performance of a material. For example, composites of higher mechanical strength, glass transition temperature, and faster cure speed can be achieved. New cyclic structures will complement the initial generation of aliphatic polyamines, and enable applications previously unattainable by recyclable aliphatic structures alone, such as transportation composites. Our team has identified and pre-screened target cyclic scaffolds for synthesis. Successfully synthesized molecules will be further screened for physical properties and recyclability. Candidate molecules will then be formulated into full resin systems and optimized for an high pressure resin transfer molding (HP-RTM) process, to meet the processing and cost needs of automotive manufacturers. Partners in the automotive and aerospace industries will aid in testing and evaluating the performance of the formulated material. By creating new recyclable molecules that \"mimic\" other major industrial classes beyond aliphatic amines, the addressable market for these materials will be expanded and the adoption of recyclable thermoset composites will be accelerated.",

Traditional thermoset plastics are not recyclable, and therefore create a waste problem, which is further compounded when combined with fiber reinforcements like fiberglass or expensive carbon fiber in a composite. To solve this problem, Connora is developing a novel class of recyclable polyamines (\u00e6Recyclamines\u00c6) with the ultimate goal to be drop-in replacements for standard thermoset epoxy curing agents.  Therefore Recyclamines must be on par with performance, and cost of standard amines, with the added feature of recyclability.  The focus of Connora\u00c6s Phase I project was to demonstrate the performance feasibility of Recyclamines in automotive composites, targeting specifications from a global automotive leader.  To address these requirements, Connora specifically must improve current Recyclamine performance by optimizing molecules and formulations, ultimately creating a better product line that will exceed performance, cost, and recyclability expectations.  The completed goals of the project included:\n \nDesign and synthesis of improved Recyclamines with respect to chemical properties\nWe successfully designed and synthesized novel Recyclamines (Scaffolds 1 &amp; 2), which were the first Recyclamine structures of their kind. Scaffold 2 demonstrated proof of concept of high performance properties, while maintaining recyclability.\n \nPhysical characterization of Recyclamines to demonstrate high performance\nConnora developed a lab-scale assay using Differential Scanning Calorimetry to simulate high-volume manufacturing in High Pressure Resin Transfer Molding (HP-RTM) conditions.  With this assay, iterative formulations and critical processing information could be estimated at lab scale, without the intensive resources from an HP-RTM production line.  The correlation of our assay with actual in-trial HP-RTM results provided the necessary calibration to guide future development work toward hitting the automotive specifications.\n \nFormulation of Recyclamines for a relevant application in automotive composites\nTo demonstrate \"real world\" feasibility of Recyclamine, a 5-day trial was performed at an HP-RTM facility. From the analysis, the mechanical properties of the developed Recyclamines increased environmental performance while maintaining physical properties.  We were also able to test the performance of our recycled fibers in \u00e6near-virgin\u00c6 woven form, by remaking HP-RTM panels from fully recycled carbon fiber sheets.  This experiment demonstrated, for the first time, an example of truly recyclable, \u00e6cradle-to-cradle\u00c6 composites.\n \n \nBROADER IMPACTS\nThe function of any material is dictated by its structure.  The underlying premise of this project is that the development of \"smart\" molecules will be key to the development of future materials with fundamentally new performance.  R&amp;D in new molecular building blocks for plastics and materials has all but stopped in major chemical corporations.  The R&amp;D expenditures of the top 10 global companies are only in the low-mid single digits (1-4%).  For comparison, R&amp;D investment in the semiconductor industry is typically 30%.  This project highlights how basic R&amp;D into molecular design, can have reaching implications on energy efficiency and waste reduction of commodity materials.  Consider plastics, which comprise 12% of waste generation in the U.S.  The perception of plastic by the typical citizen is most likely that of thermoplastics, which is encountered in everyday life in the form of packaging, bottles, casing materials, toys, etc.  Little waste is created in the manufacturing of such consumer products because most common thermoplastics are recyclable, so for economic reasons, any manufacturing waste will be fed back into production.  It is rather unfortunate that so many of these products, post-consumer, find their way into the environme..."
