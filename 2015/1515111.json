 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aluminum 2139 is a copper-based aluminum (Al) alloy that is used in the aerospace industry and has an attractive mixture of strength and toughness.  Traditional welding methods cause copper containing Al alloys to crack, which is unacceptable for structural components.  However, this can be circumvented by melting the joined area of two plates clamped together and using a rotating tool to stir this softened area until the softened area from both plates have mixed.  This is called friction stir welding.  Research conducted at Michigan State University (MSU) has demonstrated that the welded region is weaker than the unwelded base metal region.  In an effort to improve its performance, the friction stir welded region will undergo post-weld heat treatment (PWHT).  The unwelded region will undergo high pressure torsion (HPT) to investigate how high pressure processing affects the performance of this alloy.  This work will be performed in collaboration with Professor Mitsuo Niinomi at the Institute for Materials Research (IMR) at Tohoku University in Japan.  The IMR personnel have notable expertise in HPT as well as related data characterization and analysis.\r\n\r\nThe total material strain, the microstructural phases present and their volume fraction, microstructure and dislocation structures, and hardness of the HPT treated samples will be characterized in this study using EBSD, x-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy imaging, and Vickers hardness testing. Mechanical tensile testing will be performed.  The PWHT experiments will be grouped as: solution treatment, solution treated and artificially aged, and artificially aged.  These samples will then be polished and characterized at Tohoku University using EBSD, x-ray diffraction, and Vickers hardness testing.  This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Al 2139-T8 is a Cu-based Al alloy that has Mg and Ag constituents added.  This alloy has an attractive mixture of strength and toughness.  However, there are some issues that arise when using Cu-based Al alloys.  One issue is that friction stir welding (FSW) Cu-based Al alloys lead to a significant decrease in strength in the welded region.  Another issue is that although these alloys have a good strength-to-weight ratio, they are lower in strength than that of steel alloys used in the same applications.  The primary goal of this research was to understand how processing affects the relationship between the microstructure and the mechanical properties.  During the EAPSI fellowship, two projects were conducted: post-weld heat treatments (PWHT) and high pressure torsion (HPT). \n\n In the first project, PWHT were performed on the FSW region in an effort to increase the mechanical strengths of that area.  These experiments were performed at the Institute of Materials Research at Tohoku University in Sendai, Japan.  Upon feedback and data gathered, the original PWHT conditions were changed to exclude solutionizing treatments and to only focus on a variety of artificial ageing conditions.  The four heat treatment conditions were chosen based on information found in literature for similar Cu-based Al alloys.  Vickers hardness testing and conventional tensile testing were performed to analyze the changes in the mechanical properties.  Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) were performed to characterize changes in the microstructure.\n\n In the second project, HPT experiments were performed with the collaboration of Dr. Yoshikazu TODAKA\u00c6s laboratory at Toyohashi University of Technology.  The HPT experiments were conducted on annealed, unwelded samples.  This alloy was previously processed using a T8 temper prior to receiving it for the sole purpose of improving its strength.  Therefore, this alloy was annealed before the HPT experiments was performed in order to remove the T8 temper processing and weaken the alloy.  This allowed for an objective analysis of how HPT affected the mechanical properties.  Upon further review of the original testing parameters, Dr. Hakan YILMAZER suggested that the original conditions be modified to a lower number of revolutions (N=1, 2,4, 8) and a higher applied anvil pressure (5GPa).  These changes provided more significance to the experiment in that higher revolutions lead to grain growth in Al alloys.  The purpose of the experiment was to refine the grains to submicron dimensions at N=1 and then slowly track the changes with each increase in revolution.  The increases in the original revolutions were too coarse (N=1, 5, 10, 20) for this analysis and could lead to grain growth.  In addition, the increased applied anvil pressure was a standard used in that lab for the PI\u00c6s specific sample dimensions.  High resolution SEM, EBSD, and transmission electron microscope analyses revealed that the HPT processing greatly altered the microstructure.  Conventional tensile testing and Vickers hardness demonstrated changes in the mechanical properties.\n\n The EAPSI Award enriched the PI\u00c6s dissertation research by granting the opportunity to network and perform research with other professionals in the field of materials science and engineering.  Today\u00c6s economy is global and it is important for the PI to understand how research is performed by different research groups early in her career.  The data acquired will provide a better understanding of processing-microstructure-property relationships of Al-Cu-Mg-Ag alloys, specifically Al 2139-T8.  The information has been communicated via conference presentations. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/11/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Uchechi Okeke"
