 "awd_abstract_narration": "Two Doppler lidars, a newly developed iron (Fe) Doppler lidar and an existing sodium (Na) Doppler lidar will be operated simultaneously at Table Mountain near Boulder, CO, to acquire vertical profiles of neutral atmospheric horizontal and vertical winds, temperatures, and Fe and Na densities in the mesosphere and thermosphere to study coupling and transport processes between 80 and 150 km. The thermospheric metal layers themselves involve the coupling between ion and neutral metal layers, and the neutral winds and temperatures derived from these layers are two critical parameters needed for advancing our understanding of the space-atmosphere interaction region. The neutral wind and temperature data in the mesosphere and thermosphere will help validate global models that cover the lower and upper atmosphere (e.g., WACCM and WAM). The simultaneous measurements of Fe and Na layers and their fluxes will provide crucial information on the thermospheric metal layer formation, differential meteoric ablation, and cosmic dust velocity distribution. This work will lead to improvements in quantitative estimates of the cosmic dust input that has implications for a variety of geophysical processes throughout the polar atmosphere and Southern Ocean.\r\n\tSpecifically, the dual lidar observations, along with correlative studies and model simulations, will be used to: (1) Characterize the recently discovered thermosphere Fe and Na layers above Table Mountain to determine how frequently they occur, how high they extend, how long they persist, and what mechanisms cause them to form; (2) Characterize neutral winds and temperatures in the 100-150 km region of the thermosphere by using the thermosphere Fe and Na layers as tracers. Explore coupling and transport processes via comparison with the Whole Atmosphere Model (WAM) simulations; and (3) Make simultaneous measurements of wave-induced vertical heat fluxes and the dynamical and chemical fluxes of Fe and Na in the mesopause region (80-105 km) to quantify the differential meteoric ablation of Fe and Na, constrain the various cosmic dust velocity distribution models, help validate the University of Leeds chemical ablation model (CABMOD) and significantly improve estimates of the global influx of cosmic dust. \tThis project will provide research opportunities for a postdoc and a graduate student.",

The PI, Co-PI, and their postdocs and graduate students conducted creative science studies and data analyses, which led to new science discoveries and new methodology development. The PI trained several PhD students along with postdoctoral researchers, promoted a female scientist, produced press releases, and fostered international collaborations for comparative lidar studies between Boulder and Beijing.</p>\n<p class=\"JFNormal\"><strong>Intellectual Merit:&nbsp;</strong>The very high-sensitivity lidar measurements made at Boulder, Colorado have led to several eye-opening discoveries. For example, the discoveries of the thermosphere-ionosphere Na (TINa) layers with regular occurrence before dawn and after dusk provide a new way to study the ?thermospheric gap? region between 100 and 200 km. First, such regular occurrence of TINa layers and their correlation to sunrise time have opened a new chapter in the studies of meteoric metal layers as such phenomena have never been observed before. Second, these layers provide tracers for profiling temperatures and winds in this gap region that is otherwise very difficult to measure. Third, these layers and the profiled temperatures and winds provide a natural laboratory for investigating the plasma-neutral coupling and the atmospheric dynamics associated with tidal and gravity waves in this important geophysical region.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"JFNormal\">Several new methodologies developed during this CEDAR project have paved the way for making unprecedented studies in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. For example, the interleaved method initially proposed and developed by Gardner and Chu (2020) and then further developed by Jandreau and Chu (2022) has enabled the measurements of sensible heat and meteoric Na fluxes being extended from 78 to 110 km, which basically doubled the past measurement range of 85-100 km. Such extension of high-quality lidar measurements has led to the discovery of positive sensible heat flux from ~97 to 106 km over McMurdo, Antarctica, which contradicts the traditional thinking but highlights the importance of the fully compressible solutions for polarization relations of primary and secondary gravity waves. It is fair to state that this CEDAR&nbsp;lidar project has made significant contributions to advancing our understandings of the atmospheric coupling and wave dynamics.</p>\n<p class=\"JFNormal\">This CEDAR project helped foster international collaborations with lidar colleagues in China for comparative studies between Boulder and Beijing. As these two locations share similar geographic latitudes but quite different geomagnetic latitudes, such comparative studies lead to new understandings in the space-atmosphere interactions.</p>\n<p class=\"JFNormal\"><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong>&nbsp;This CEDAR lidar project has provided exceptional training opportunities to two postdoctoral research associates, John A. Smith and Xian Lu, which helped launch their research and faculty careers. Dr. John Smith had the opportunities to work on one of the most sophisticated lidars ? the MRI Fe Doppler lidar, learned and developed many key skills. He was recruited by NASA Langley and became a Research Scientist (civil servant) at NASA. Dr. Xian Lu had the opportunities to analyze the high-resolution and high-quality STAR Na Doppler lidar data, and published several high-quality papers using the vertical wind and temperature measurements at Boulder. She was recruited by Clemson University and became a tenure-track Assistant Professor at their Physics Department. By now she has earned her tenure and become an Associate Professor at Clemson University.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"JFNormal\">This CEDAR lidar project has helped recruit and train three PhD students, Yingfei Chen, Jackson Jandreau, and Gary Sutliff. They all have made significant progress in their PhD research. Yingfei Chen made crucial contributions to the discoveries of TINa layers with regular occurrence and correlation with sunrise time. Jackson Jandreau developed an altitude interleaved method and won the Outstanding Student Presentation Award (OPSA) at American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting 2021. Lidar projects are highly interdisciplinary and cutting-edge, involving a wide range of engineering and scientific skills. Students and postdocs working on such lidar projects gain extensive knowledge in physics, electrical, computer and mechanical engineering, photonics, signal processing, and atmospheric sciences. Such trainings produce scientists and engineers who are exceptionally versatile and adaptable. They typically have a wide variety of employment opportunities upon graduation or completion.</p>\n<p class=\"JFNormal\">The press release and outreach activities made on the discoveries of TINa layers over Boulder, including the Denver 9 News TV report, has increased the public awareness of the space-atmosphere research and helped prompt students? interests in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.
