 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rapid human development has placed increasing stress on water, energy and agricultural resources. This growing stress has strengthened interdependencies between these sectors and intensified management complexity. A deeper understanding of the integrated nature of food-energy-water (FEW) systems has led to an increased awareness of how technological and institutional changes, directed at increasing productivity or efficiency in one system, can impact the economic, political and environmental security of the whole FEW system. The introduction of inexpensive pumping technology, for example, can lead to short-term gains in agricultural productivity but may quickly deplete groundwater resources, especially in the absence of strong governance of groundwater withdrawals, and undermine the security of the whole system. FEW management issues also emerge from the complexity of managing the system to address multiple interrelated and competing needs. Appropriate application of both technological and institutional solutions to FEW system challenges is critical to the successful management of each sector and across the system as a whole. FEW system managers must know when and how technological innovations need to be balanced with appropriate institutional change and vice versa. However, the relationships between technological and institutional approaches to addressing FEW system challenges and the ramifications of solution implementation across all sectors are poorly understood.\r\n\r\nWashington State University will host a three day conference to examine technological and institutional innovation within FEW system contexts and identify specific knowledge gaps requiring further scientific study. This workshop will move beyond understanding only the physical interdependencies within FEW systems; instead it will seek to 1) identify factors driving both technological and institutional innovations and their adoption, within and across FEW systems, and 2) characterize the implications of these interactions for policy and broader institutional design. Participants will be drawn from academia, industry, and government and will represent a diversity of disciplines, professions, and areas of FEW expertise. The diversity of experts in this workshop will be one of its primary strengths, fostering a synthesis of knowledge by creating an environment where specialized perspectives and insights from individuals can be integrated to better understand the couplings between technology and institutions across FEW systems in general. To facilitate such an endeavor, best practices learned from the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis and other successful interdisciplinary synthesis efforts will be employed.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHuman health and well-being are critically dependent on three interconnected resources; food, energy, and water (FEW).  However, the growing global population has placed an unprecedented strain on the availability and quality of FEW resources.  Recognizing this growing sustainability problem, the NSF called for the scientific community to \"stimulate debate, discussion, visioning and collaboration across research communities, and enable a higher appreciation, visualization and understanding of food systems and their couplings to energy and water systems\".  Our workshop responded by convening an interdisciplinary team of experts to examine where opportunities for new technology, better policies, and integrated management can be fostered and adopted in systems with tightly coupled FEW resources. \n\nFood, energy, and water systems interact with each other in complex ways, making management difficult.  For instance, prioritizing large-scale, mechanized farming has significantly increased agricultural yields but requires substantially higher water and energy inputs to grow, harvest, process, and distribute food.  Given this tight coupling across resources, it is expected that a wide range of technological (e.g. products or processes) and institutional (e.g. legal or policy-based) solutions will emerge to support and advance sustainable FEW management.  Understanding how these solutions complement, contradict, substitute for, or complicate one another is critical for managing trade-offs and resolving resource conflicts. \n\nThe diversity of participant expertise in our workshop ranged from environmental governance and resource economics to civil engineering and biology and allowed us to explore the FEW system through a diversity of lenses.   In doing so, we were able to identify four areas of cross-cutting challenges and opportunities where future FEW research can guide development of productive, integrative and insightful solutions. These four areas are summarized below and are publicly-available in more detail in our white paper: https://swwrc.wsu.edu/seattle-few-workshop/.\n\nDefining the FEW nexus. There is a clear need for a standard vocabulary of key FEW terms to reduce confusion and more easily share information across disciplines. This common \"language\" will be necessary for adequately describing and interpreting FEW characteristics and processes, and will help scientists develop specific, quantifiable indicators to measure interactions of important biophysical processes and human actions.  This common FEW understanding will be critical for developing new technological and institutional solutions for greater FEW sustainability.\n\nCoordinating across sectors and scales. Individual food, energy and water systems encompass a broad spectrum of people, products, equipment, processes, laws and policies that often do not align across the greater FEW landscape.  When these mismatches occur, \"friction spots\" can develop where management strategies for one sector conflict with those of another.  Identifying and re-aligning these mismatches through increased coordination and cooperation can help reduce this friction, smoothing the way for new technological or institutional innovations, like optimized management of wind and water power generation for conjunctive production. \n\nFacilitating data-intensive research. Poor technological and institutional support hinders the collection and measurement of FEW system information and our ability to access and use large volumes of existing data.  This situation creates barriers to FEW innovation and greatly hinders policy makers and resource managers who rely on such data to make informed decisions about sustainable resource use.  Greater support for the storage, management, and analysis of large-volume or confidential data is needed, as well as new training programs to teach students and scientists how to use these resources in an ethically and responsible way. \n\nUnderstanding resilience in FEW system..."
