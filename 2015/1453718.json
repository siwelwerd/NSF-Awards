 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vast and distributed nature of communication networks makes them inherently vulnerable to attack. This research focuses on combating active attacks, in which a malicious intruder acts to subvert the natural behavior of the system. These attacks include distributed denial of service attacks, wireless jamming, man-in-the-middle attacks, and Byzantine attacks. This research takes an information-theoretic approach to characterizing the fundamental trade-offs between security (degree of protection against attacks) and performance (achievable communication rates among legitimate users) in communication networks. To this end, this research effort investigates (i) secure strategies including polytope codes and hash-based verification, (ii) analytical tools for deriving bounds on fundamental limits, (iii) solutions for combating the unique challenges of attacks in the wireless environment, such as fading, mobility, and asynchronism, and (iv) applying attack-resilient strategies to timely applications such as distributed storage systems and the smart grid.\r\n\r\nIf left unchecked, active attacks could significantly undermine the reliability of  networks of connected devices just as they are becoming increasingly vital to modern society. This research provides new techniques to bolster the resilience of communication networks in the presence of these potentially damaging attacks. In addition, this project incorporates efforts to educate and engage students of all ages in thinking about the security problems in their lives. These efforts include security competitions for undergraduates, an outreach program for high school students, and a graduate course.",

An active adversary is one that takes action to influence the operation of the remainder of the network.

Thus, a significant amount of the work in this project focused on the specific characteristics of wireless networks. In particular, the project studied (i) broadcast, where a single device transmits a signal that is simultaneously received by multiple receivers, (ii) multiple-access, where multiple transmitters simultaneously send signals to a common receiver, (iii) interference, where multiple transmitting signals are near enough that the corresponding receivers overhear each other, and (iv) fading, where the quality of the communication channel changes over time in a random manner.

In particular, suppose that a transmitter and receiver can share a short string of bits (a \"key\") prior to communicating their primary information. This shared key can dramatically improve the devices' ability to communicate without being disrupted by the attacker, in some cases even if the attacker is very strong. This theme is echoed in many results, cutting across different network settings or different regimes of the active adversary problem. In some cases, the main challenge was to establish that a shared key can in fact be set up between transmitter and receiver; once it is set up, the communication is straightforward.

This means that the wired network, while apparently simpler than the wireless network, is actually sufficient to understand in order to understand the more complicated, wireless network. This way, one can leverage all that is known about wired networks, including a great deal of theoretical and practical knowledge on transmitting large amounts of information through such networks, and apply that knowledge with little overhead to a wireless network, even if it contain active adversaries.
