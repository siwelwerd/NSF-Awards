 "awd_abstract_narration": "This multi-university institutional transformation project, led by the University of Kansas, will both implement and study a model to improve STEM education within seven universities. The ultimate goal is to propagate widespread adoption of evidence-based instructional methods in order to improve undergraduate STEM learning and educational outcomes for both STEM and non-STEM students. Five American institutions funded by this grant, as well as two unfunded Canadian institutions, will test local adaptations of the model on their own campuses. The model is derived from research on institutional change and quality improvement, and builds on an extensive successful initiative (known as the Science Education Initiative, SEI) at two of the partner institutions the University of Colorado at Boulder and the University of British Columbia. The core approach is to support \"embedded expertise\" in STEM departments to catalyze course transformation and build intellectual communities within and across institutions, in order to share in the development of course reform.  The other participating institutions are the University of Texas at San Antonio, Indiana University, the University of California, Davis, and Queens University in Canada.  \r\n\r\nThe model of transformation involves embedding STEM education experts (specially prepared postdoctoral scholars or faculty leaders) in departments. These experts will collaborate with department faculty to guide and support the implementation of research-based educational practices in STEM courses. This extension of the SEI model supports change with a smaller infusion of resources by developing communities of scholars around course transformation across departments and institutions. These communities broaden the impact of the embedded experts by expanding support and opportunities for reflective practice for faculty, contributing to the development of a shared vision, and encouraging a critical mass of faculty engagement within departments needed to produce meaningful changes in the teaching environment. Seven research universities that have been actively collaborating through the Bay View Alliance will each implement and evaluate variations of this model on their own campuses. The network serves two functions: 1) to build a community for intellectual exchange and collaboration on evidence-based teaching as a key component of the intervention itself, and 2) to permit a test of whether the intervention model can be localized to different institutional contexts to yield widespread STEM reform.  A combination of quantitative and case study evaluation methods are planned to identify the various dimensions and conditions that signal initial readiness, successful approaches, and sustainable outcomes in participating institutions.",

The TRESTLE initiative aimed to further our understanding of how to create scalable change on an institutional level, deepening the return on investment in STEM education reform and impacting teaching in higher education broadly. Student success in STEM fields is an essential component of economic growth, so the primary target of this work has immediate application to a broad societal goal. Improved teaching in STEM courses also has the potential to provide a better exposure to science for many citizens, increasing general scientific literacy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the 7 TRESTLE campuses used a variation of the same model to support educational transformation on their campus. The TRESTLE model had 3 main elements:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Embed experts</strong>&nbsp;to catalyze department-level course transformation by collaborating with faculty colleagues on integrating evidence-based and inclusive pedagogical practices into undergraduate courses.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Build communities of scholars&nbsp;</strong>around evidence-based course-reform, within departments, across departments, and across campuses (i.e., through the cross-campus TRESTLE network).</p>\n<p><strong>3. Generate evidence and accessible documentation&nbsp;</strong>of the methods and impact of course transformation and share within the multi-level communities</p>\n<p>All campuses used some form of discipline-based educational specialists (DBESs) embedded within departments as catalysts of change. These DBESs had expertise both in the STEM discipline and in effective teaching. &nbsp;Departments developed proposals for course transformation in response to competitive calls, fostering shared vision and goals. Awarded funds were used primarily to hire DBESs, who collaborated with faculty to identify course learning goals, to design and implement new practices, and to assess student learning. The project also supported community building through events and collaborations on campus and across campuses, with the intention of amplifying the work and spreading teaching practices broadly.</p>\n<p>The University of Colorado Boulder had previously housed the successful Science Education Initiative (SEI; <a href=\"http://colorado.edu/sei\">http://colorado.edu/sei</a>) which formed the foundation of the TRESTLE initiative. Thus, the TRESTLE initiative at CU Boulder focused on building on prior work by deepening instructional expertise among faculty previously engaged in the SEI, initiating new departments and faculty into this instructional work, and forging strong connections between STEM departments by engaging faculty broadly and publicizing the work. The CU Boulder TRESTLE initiative did this through the following mechanisms.</p>\n<p><strong>Course transformation grants.</strong> A total of 6 course transformation grants (typically $10,000) were awarded to a total of 10 PIs in 6 departments. These were open to those with existing expertise in instructional reform, or those Course transformation grants provided support for incorporating research-based practices into a new or existing course. Final award reports are public on the TRESTLE website.</p>\n<p><strong>TRESTLE Scholars. </strong>A new faculty learning community was initiated, termed TRESTLE Scholars, focusing on a specific area of instruction (such as group work, or assessment). Scholars met biweekly for one semester. A total of 6 Scholars groups were offered and included 47 participants and 11 facilitators. Each created a group product and a facilitator reflection, archived on the website.</p>\n<p><strong>Mini seed grants.</strong> To help seed new ideas that might lead to a bigger transformation, mini grants of $1000 were offered to jump start initiatives. A total of 4 mini seed grants were provided to 5 PIs, and final reports are on the website.</p>\n<p><strong>Discussion group.</strong> To engage faculty broadly and give an opportunity for sharing ideas informally, a monthly drop-in discussion group was created. A total of 18 sessions were offered and over 20 participants from multiple departments participated.</p>\n<p>All products of the grant are available on the website for CU Boulder (<a href=\"https://www.colorado.edu/csl/trestle-0\">https://www.colorado.edu/csl/trestle-0</a>) or TRESTLE Central (<a href=\"http://trestlenetwork.ku.edu\">http://trestlenetwork.ku.edu</a>). Early results show that course transformations have maintained, and many of the faculty involved in the initiative have continued to lead educational work on campus.
