 "awd_abstract_narration": "Claude Shannon?s ?A Mathematical Theory of Communication? is the landmark event that paved the way for the development of modern communication systems. Shannon analyzed the fundamental redundancy that must be added to data in order to achieve reliable communication in the presence of noise. Since then his vision has guided the practical design of virtually all aspects of modern communication systems such as forward error correction, spectrally-efficient communication, multiuser and inter-symbol interference, multiple-antenna systems, opportunistic communication, and joint compression/transmission. However, while feedback is present in virtually all modern communication systems, the field of information theory has had relatively little impact on how feedback is employed in practice.  The proposed work will advance knowledge by developing a more complete understanding of how feedback should be employed in communication systems and what quantitative improvements in delay, complexity, and transmitted power one can expect from its effective use, under realistic delay constraints such as those found in high-speed wireless data. In summary, the successful completion of the project is expected to contribute new mathematical tools, designs, viewpoints, and models to the field of information theory.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to bring the insight, design guidance, and performance bounds for which information theory is known to bear on the design of systems with feedback. By providing new design principles and feedback codes, this research has the potential not only to advance basic science but also to improve the efficiency and reliability of our communications infrastructure, including consumer technology such as WiFi and smartphones. Given the proliferation of personal communication devices, such improvements would augment the efficiency with which crucial resources such as energy and radio frequency bandwidth are currently utilized.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe next generation of wireless communication networks is predicted to interconnect not only billions of people, but also up to 1 trillion sensors, products, machines, and devices.  This project has addressed a number of important new technological approaches that can enable the explosive demand for communications capacity that such interconnections will entail, as well as the variety of quality of service that such heterogeneous applications will require.  These approaches include emerging techniques such as the forward caching of content to the network edges in order to mitigate network demand during peak periods; sensors that can harvest energy from their surroundings so as to operate without the need for changing batteries or being connected to a power source; the use of unmanned aerial vehicles to provide wireless coverage for emergency response and related applications; and a variety of other methods designed to make wireless networks more efficient and to enhance their ability to handle the needs of such massive numbers and variety of end-user devices.  Modern society relies very heavily on wireless communication networks for a great many of its functions, and so the work of this project, toward improving the capabilities of such networks, is quite important to society. \n\n In pursuing this research agenda, this study has made use of a range of analytical methods, including game theory, machine learning, statistical simulation, optimization theory, etc.  Expanding the applicability of these methods has the potential to impact other fields, as their use here may suggest their utility in problems of a similar nature arising in other fields, and particularly those involving other critical infrastructures.\n\nFinally, this study has involved a number of early-career scholars (graduate students, postdoctoral scholars and early-career professionals), and their participation has provided them with opportunities to improve their research and communications skills, and to build their professional networks among themselves and with senior visitors and other collaborators involved in this work.  Thus, the study has also contributed to the future of the field through the development of human resources to assure that the field remains vital in the future.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Harold Vincent Poor"
