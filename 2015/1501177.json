 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Tulsa proposes to add four new cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students to their existing CyberCorps(R) Scholarship for Service (SFS) program in cybersecurity with a strong background in computer science, engineering, business and law. The program integrates rigorous, hands-on learning with research, professional development and outreach activities. The students will serve as summer interns to gain practical experience and will join federal agencies or other eligible entities upon graduation. The Tulsa Program offers multiple technical and interdisciplinary tracks, each characterized by a focused, yet flexible, program of study. The intense \"MacGyver Track\" imparts reverse engineering and cyber operations skills geared for the intelligence community. Other tracks prepare students for research, operations and project management. The interdisciplinary M.B.A. and Law Tracks combine business and law classes, respectively, with six cyber security and systems courses. The common thread is the \"Teaching Hospital Model\" -- hands-on courses involving real-world projects with law enforcement, the intelligence community and critical infrastructure owners and operators, and strong collaboration with embedded government personnel. \r\n\r\nThe program components are designed to have a broad and lasting impact. Existing efforts to engage members of underrepresented groups and non-traditional students will be intensified, and arrangements to accept community college graduates will be expanded. CyberCorps(R) students will collaborate on real-world projects with federal agency personnel to gain practical experience and enhance internship and job placement prospects. Other innovative aspects of the proposal are (1) diverse studies, ranging from computer science and chemical engineering to business and law, all built around a strong cybersecurity core; (2) flexible program components that prepare students for careers in intelligence, research, operations, project management, enterprise security, and law and policy; and (3) integration of traditional, non-traditional and underrepresented students in an inclusive and collaborative learning culture. The project will also offer sustained mentoring and student involvement in community service and outreach activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe University of Tulsa's Cyber Corps Initiative supported by NSF Grant DGE 1501177 has made significant contributions to the national effort. A total of 127 participants were supported. Four participants left the program due to illness or trauma. Two participants with OPM-approved fulltime job offers opted to join the private sector with the scholarship payback penalty. The remaining 113 departed students are highly-skilled professionals with solid backgrounds in computer science and engineering, strong specializations in cyber operations, cyber defense and digital forensics, and a deep commitment to serve. All of them have gone on to make a difference in their professional careers. Upon completing their programs of study, the eight current students will join their colleagues with the federal government or other OPM-approved organizations, and also go on to make a difference.\n\n\nIn a tight fiscal environment, the Tulsa Program has provided exceptional value. Budgeted for 47 students (32 at Tulsa and 15 at partner universities and community colleges), the grant has partially or completely supported 127 participants to date -- 170% additional participants -- by conserving and rebudgeting NSF funds, accelerating student graduation and using research grants and private scholarships to support students, while ensuring that their scholarship obligations are met.\n\n\nThe Tulsa Program was national in its scope, drawing students from 22 states and the territory of Puerto Rico. A total of 119 participants left the program, including the four participants who dropped out due to illness or trauma, and one M.S. Computer Science and two Ph.D. Computer Science students, all non-traditional traditional students, who joined OPM-approved entities before completing their degrees.\n\n\nThe 112 program graduates include 12 B.S., 71 M.S., 8 M.E. and 21 Ph.D. degree recipients. Sixteen of these graduates earned two degrees (B.S. and M.S. degrees or M.S./M.E. and Ph.D. degrees). All the program graduates received fulltime job offers. In fact, the students averaged more than two job offers each. All 21 Ph.D. graduates and several non-traditional students secured positions at GS 13 or higher.\n\n\nA unique feature of the Tulsa Cyber Corps is the focus on Ph.D. research projects that often address real problems in cyber operations and cyber defense, critical infrastructure protection and digital forensics. Some of the research has produced solutions to hard problems of national and international significance. In many cases, the research results have been operationalized by government and industry entities. A remarkable statistic is that the 21 Ph.D. graduates include six members of underrepresented groups (four females and two African-American males), eight non-traditional students and one veteran.\n\n\nThe Tulsa Cyber Corps Program has achieved 100% placement results for summer internships.  In fact, all the participating students received internship offers during the pandemic summer of 2020. Some students were able to work remotely. However, most internships were cancelled that summer and the students took courses and worked on research projects instead. The fulltime placement results are also exceptional. The following are the placement details for the participants:\n\n\nDeparted Student Fulltime Positions (113): Intelligence Community (57); U.S. Navy (21), Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (13), National Laboratories (11); U.S. Air Force (4); State Community Colleges (2); U.S. Army (1); Defense Information Systems Agency (1); Department of Justice (1); Tribal Agency (1); Federally-Funded Research and Development Center (MITRE) (1).\n\n\nContinuing Student Summer Internships (8): U.S. Secret Service (5); U.S. Navy (2); Intelligence Community (1).\n\n\nThe student body was diverse -- 29.9% females, 37.8% members of underrepresented groups, 26.0% non-traditional students and six veterans (4.7%). Furthermore, 14.2% of the participants were educated at community colleges.\n\n\nGrant supplements were received to enable the Tulsa Cyber Corps Program to serve as a \"teaching hospital'' for students from the University of Arkansas and University of Texas at San Antonio, and for students from regional community colleges. The goal was to provide exceptional academic, research and capstone project opportunities in cyber defense and cyber offense, and enable the students to benefit from the internship and fulltime opportunities available to University of Tulsa students.\n\n\nIn the university program, students completed one year of studies at their home institutions and transferred to the M.S.

In the community college program (two supplements), students undertook one year of studies at the participating community colleges and transferred to the B.S. IT or CS programs at Tulsa. Collectively budgeted for 15 students, the supplements supported a total of 19 transfer students.\n\n\nThe two ''teaching hospital'' programs were successful at increasing diversity. The eight university students included three females and one Hispanic-American male (50% members of underrepresented groups); in addition, there were two non-traditional students, one of them a veteran. The nine community college students included three females and one African-American male (44.4% members of underrepresented groups); in addition, there were two non-traditional students, one of them a veteran.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/26/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: SujeetShenoi\n"
