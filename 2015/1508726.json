 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Chemistry Division is funding Professor Isiah Warner and colleagues at Louisiana State University to develop novel composite materials derived from a Group of Uniform Materials Based on Organic Salts (GUMBOS) in combination with select polymers for detection and molecular weight determination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). These GUMBOS-based composites are designed to provide selectivity for a general class of compounds or for a small group of closely related compounds. These composite materials have distinct advantages for rapid and sensitive sensing of compounds such as benzene, methanol, and other compounds important to environmental measurements. The broader impacts of this work are addressed scientifically in that the further development of the QCM will advance its use in many other fields where both molecular weight and chemical property information is desired. In addition, the research team is known for its recruitment, retention, and mentoring of STEM students and professionals that represent diverse populations, many of whom come from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThis research is based on the discovery that by use of certain viscoelastic materials as sensors, the ratio of two parameters (delta-f/delta-R) simultaneously acquired during QCM Measurements can provide molecular weight estimates of absorbed molecules. The research is divided into three distinct areas: 1) examination of the detailed characteristics of the composite materials such that this information will be used to design and develop pure ionic liquids, GUMBOS, and composites for selective determination of certain classes or structures of analytes; 2) detailed studies of sensor arrays which will allow comprehensive characterization of mixtures of volatile organic compounds (VOCs); and 3) development of the QCM for detection and analyses of VOCs separated by use of gas chromatographs and a novel portable QCM.",

These compounds have a variety of applications in many areas, e.g. cancer therapy, protein extraction, dye sensitize solar cells, and many others. Ionic Liquids (ILs) are often defined as organic salts with melting points less than 100 degrees Celsius (C). In our group, we have developed solid state analogues of ILs that are defined as a <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">g</span></em></strong>roup of <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">u</span></em></strong>niform <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">m</span></em></strong>aterials <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">b</span></em></strong>ased on <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">o</span></em></strong>rganic <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">s</span></em></strong>alts (GUMBOS) with melting points that range between 25 degrees C and 250 degress C. Due to their ionic structures, both ILs and GUMBOS can be synthesized through a simple ion exchange reaction using various combinations of cations and anions. This facile synthesis produces structural variations that allows for changes in characteristic physicochemical properties; thus, provides a direct avenue for tuning of a particular property for a specific application. Specifically, in this project these ionic compounds were applied for detection and discrimination of volatile organic compounds (VOCs).</p>\n<p>VOCs include a wide group of organic substances that volatilize at room temperature and pressure. These VOCs are commonplace in many areas of society. From common household cleaning products to vehicle exhaust emissions, many VOCs can cause deleterious health and environmental effects. For this reason, detection and discrimination of VOCs in different samples is important. Recent modes of detection of these compounds include colorimetric or optical devices; however these methods often lack specificity for different variations of these gaseous compounds. To resolve this issue more expensive, time consuming techniques such as gas chromatography-mass spectrometry can be used. An easy, faster alternative is the use of an electronic nose (e-nose) model where different VOCs are exposed to several sensors at the same time, and each sensor, ideally, will generate specific response patterns. Eventually sensor responses are analyzed using pattern recognition techniques, specifically, statistical techniques such as artificial neural networks (ANN), linear regression, analysis of variance (ANOVA), principal component analysis (PCA), or discriminate analysis (DA) to discriminate or identify the vapor (Figure 1).</p>\n<p class=\"p\">In this project, a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) that uses a quartz crystal resonator (QCR) to monitor frequency changes was employed as a device to build an e-nose model for detection and discrimination of VOCs. Traditional coatings for these QCRs are typically expensive, non-reusable materials. To obtain analyte specific response patterns with reusable capabilities, a variety of ILs, GUMBOS or a composite of IL/GUMBOS with a polymer were used as coating materials over the QCRs. Upon exposure to different VOCs, response patterns were established, and resultant datasets of frequency changes were coupled with some of the previously mentioned statistical techniques to develop sensor arrays that are capable of determining the type (class) and identification (molecular weight) of different VOCs (Figure 2). Results from these investigations have been presented at several national conferences, such as the American Chemical Society and National Organization for the Professional Advancement of Black Chemists and Chemical Engineers. These results will also be disseminated in top-tier peer-reviewed journals, one of which has already been published in <em>Talanta</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"p\"><span>Research efforts have also been focused on miniaturization of a QCM. Currently, QCMs are designed as large bench-top displays with bulky dimensions that are not appropriate to measure samples on a field site. Samples from these field sites must be meticulously prepared, recorded, and brought to a laboratory setting. By designing a mini-QCM device, analyses may be conducted quickly on-site. With this new technology, there would be a significant elimination of error by minimizing sample preparation. Moreover, detection of hazardous VOCs on the field could be possible, e.g. toxic VOCs in an explosion site, explosive VOCs in the battlefield, or in a split zone in the industry or road. In this project, a mini-QCM device was developed. The dimensions of this device are similar to a smart phone and the device can be fully operated with a 9V battery, allowing for easy transport and handling in the field (Figure 3). This device was tested using several VOCs and the results were comparable to those obtained with the commercial bench-top device. Ongoing steps in the miniaturization process are the design and construction of a chamber where the QCR is placed for contact with the vapors.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/04/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Isiah&nbsp;M&nbsp;Warner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508726/1508726_10376485_1572289862569_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508726/1508726_10376485_1572289862569_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1508726/1508726_10376485_1572289862569_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Schematic of QCM based sensor array.
