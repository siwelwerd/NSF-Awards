 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project \"Breaking the Silo - Mathematics as a Common Language in Science\" at Mississippi State University (MSU) will provide both financial and academic support to students majoring in Chemistry, Math, or Physics at MSU.  Focused intervention in the early stages of undergraduate gateway courses such as General Chemistry, Calculus and Physics can have enormous impact in retaining students within STEM fields and enhancing the chances of student academic success. This project will focus on student-centered tools, learning approaches and mentoring interactions that can be utilized throughout a student's four-year college degree. This integrated approach will support deserving students from Mississippi and the Southeastern United States to pursue and complete degrees in the physical sciences and enter science careers.  Recruitment efforts with special attention paid to underrepresented populations, as defined by ethnicity and gender, will promote a diverse and capable workforce.\r\n\r\nSpecific objectives of this project will include (1) Supporting students financially to pursue physical science degrees through scholarships; (2) Supporting students academically to complete a Bachelor's degree in the targeted majors of Chemistry, Math or Physics; and (3) Supporting students through career development strategies to pursue careers in the physical sciences.  Student support will be developed as a cohesive, integrated plan that includes academic tutoring support for science and math classes, a focus on the development of study skills and time management strategies and co-registration in both gateway science courses, and a 1-credit hour course on Mathematics as a Common Language for the scholarship cohort.  Mentoring workshops and career development activities will be a continued focus in addition to research experiences for undergraduates. Assessment and evaluation of the project will be both formative and summative.  An external evaluator will coordinate and evaluate survey instruments and achievements to assess projected outcomes and the level of achievement of the stated goals of the project. Lessons learned and effective practices that emerge from the program evaluation data will be disseminated widely to the STEM education community and help increase widespread understanding of the attributes and practices of successful student scholarship and support programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSSTEM-Breaking the Silo: Mathematics as a Common Language in Science\n\nOverview:\n\nThis S-STEM Scholarship program ran from 2015-2021 at Mississippi State University and worked to support and mentor students in the majors of Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics toward careers in the physical sciences.  Overall outcomes of this program include the financial support of 32 students for multiple semesters, the development of a one-credit hour course that stressed mathematical foundations and critical thinking skills and institutional support toward undergraduate student research experiences. Of the 32 supported students: 16 graduated in their designated major and moved on to graduate school or STEM careers, 2 graduated from majors not supported by this program, 8 are still active undergraduate students in a designated major and 6 left the university without degree. \n\nOf particular note for this program were the following learning outcomes.  The first cohort of this program included students with lower mathematical skills as the principal investigators proposed that mentoring and academic support activities would encourage student success.  Five out of seven students in that first cohort left university without degree as the rigors of the STEM fields were too difficult.  Subsequent admitted students had stronger math skills and were uniformly successful.  The large cohort of supported students encouraged peer mentoring and support, even though that meant lower scholarship awards.  And research experiences were crucial to engage students within their field and support continued focus toward a physical science career.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Seth F Oppenheimer"
