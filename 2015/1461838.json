The project will use three approaches: (1) analyzing the statistical characteristics of TPVs based upon downstream impact, (2) isolating and identifying important physical processes important for TPV development and maintaining TPV intensity as they approach the waveguide through controlled numerical modeling experiments, and (3) diagnosing key uncertainties to identify specific methods of improving process representation in numerical models.  Experiments will be conducted using the atmospheric version of the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) and parallel simulations using the Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (ARW) model with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART).",
