 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, methods will be developed to allow direct observation of the movement of a protein, KORRIGAN1 (KOR1), in plant cells.  KOR1 functions in the formation of cellulose fibers, which are the primary constituents of plant cell walls. Cellulose fiber deposition that is controlled by KOR1 influences cell growth and biomass production.  KOR1 travels from one compartment to another inside cells before it finally reaches the cell surface where cellulose fibers will ultimately be deposited.  To visualize the dynamics of KOR1 in plant cells, this project will apply fluorescent-timer (FT) technology, in which each KOR1 protein is labeled with a time-sensitive fluorescent tag.  Because FT changes its color over time, fluorescence images of cells expressing FT-tagged KOR1 will allow visualization of the age and location of KOR1 inside of the cells.  This will reveal the route of KOR1 transport through the plant cell.  By observing how KOR1 transport changes under different biological circumstances, these studies will reveal how certain factors influence the paths that proteins travel within cells.  This is a novel research tool/approach in plant biology that can change the way the scientists view proteins in any plant cell.\r\n\r\nIn plants, distribution of KOR1 among different subcellular domains, such as trans-Golgi network (TGN), plasmamembrane (PM), tonoplast (TP), as well as the cell plate in case of the dividing cells, is scrupulously maintained. Dysfunction of KOR1 is often associated with increased targeting to TP.  This project aims to visualize the dynamics of KOR1 transport beyond analysis of endpoint locations.  Two transport processes relevant to KOR1 biology will be studied.  First, transport route/kinetics and a redirection mechanism of de-novo-synthesized KOR1 will be analyzed by tracking the age of KOR1 after induction of protein expression.  Next, KOR1 age information will be used to dissect the multiple targeting routes of KOR1 to the cell plate during cell division.  These systems will serve as models for further dissection of various factors that quantitatively affect KOR1 transport.  The interdisciplinary team will optimize FT technology for plant cell biology as a whole fluorescence analysis package, including FT with characterized in planta maturation time, compatible fluorescent subcellular markers, and automated image-processing pipelines. The experimental platform established in this project will serve as the basis for further investigation of multiple factors that affect KOR1 transport, including protein N-glycosylation pathways and interactions with cellulose synthase complex.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFluorescence protein (FP) fusions are popular tools to characterize protein behavior in the living cell.  FP fusions provide a simple way to gene expression pattern, quantify protein levels, and the most importantly, positional information of proteins in the host cell.  On the other hand, conventional FP fusion analyses typically produce only endpoint results after cells reached steady state in GFP distribution.  In order to study pre-steady-state transport and cycling of proteins in the plant secretory system, we combined inducible protein expression system and a tandem fluorescent timer protein (tdFT) and applied this technology to visualize transport of Arabidopsis thaliana KORRIGAN1 (KOR1) protein.  KOR1 is a membrane-anchored endo-beta-1,4-glucanase involved in cellulose biosynthesis, and provides a link between N-glycosylation, cell-wall biosynthesis, and abiotic stress tolerance.  After insertion into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), KOR1 cycles between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and the plasma membrane (PM), but compromised KOR1 proteins are sorted to tonoplasts.  \n\n            We tested various fluorescent timer configurations including monomeric timer, and tandem dimer FT proteins, and concluded a tandem dimer of monomeric superfolder GFP (msfGFP)-mStrawberry fusion produces an adequate time-dependent fluorescence signals during the time course of KOR1 transport.  Using tdFT-KOR1 image analyses, we calculated relative age of KOR1 at various subcellular locations, and revealed multiple route for KOR1 to reach its final locations. Structurally-compromised KOR1 courd be sorted by quality control mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and be sent to TP without reaching PM, whereas quality control mechanism at PM/TGN also sort KOR1 to TP, likely when proteins are damaged. We found N-terminal dileucine motif and C-terminal proline-rich motif of KOR1 is important for retaining KOR1 at PM-TGN cycle, which is in turn vital for maintaining root growth under salt stress.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/11/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Hisashi Koiwa"
