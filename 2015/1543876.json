An international workshop on \"Domain Decomposition Methods for Partial Differential Equations\" will be held at Dalhousie University at Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada during August 3-8, 2015. Driven by the urgent need to develop robust and efficient numerical techniques to simulate challenging problems, this workshop strives to bring together researchers in theory and application. It will provide a platform of interaction and collaboration between computational mathematicians and application researchers. The workshop will disseminate recent progress in DD research and promote its further development. This award provides support to defray expenses of US-based participants, including students and junior researchers, particularly those from under-represented groups. \r\n \r\nThe workshop consists of three distinct but uniquely connected components. The first component is a two-day short course on DD methods for partial differential equations. The second one features research level talks given by mathematicians specialized in theory and researchers from application fields. The third component presents breakout interactive sessions for the short-course participants, DD experts, and applied researchers. The US-based participants from mathematics and engineering will attend the workshop and give presentations. The activities of the workshop, including abstracts, short-course notes, and talk slides will be made available on the workshop website: www.math.mun.ca/anasc/ddworkshop.html.",
