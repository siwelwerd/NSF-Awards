 "awd_abstract_narration": "Efforts to improve and enhance silicon technology is a present challenge in the field of nanotechnology and materials science. In that respect, the investigation of novel materials that can be produced with thickness equal to a few atomic layers, for example transition metal dichalgoenides, might lead to breakthrough solutions for several electronic and optoelectronic applications.  The synthesis and electrical transport properties of these advanced nanomaterials can lead to potential improvements in a wide variety of digital and analog circuits in electronics, such as broadcast receivers and wireless communications. In this project, two dimensional atomic layers of tungsten diselenide (WSe2) will be prepared and characterized structurally and electrically. This research will be carried out under the mentorship of Professor Li Song at the National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory at the University of Science and Technology of China, offering an opportunity to work with a noted expert in state-of-the-art laboratory facilities such as a cleanroom for microelectronic device nanofabrication. \r\n\r\n2D nanomaterials have become of particular interest given their electronic properties, surface homogeneity, and their ability to be functionalized and doped in a variety of different ways. In particular, atomically thin WSe2 is known to exhibit a relatively high charge carrier mobility and a direct band gap, unlike graphene?s zero band gap. The chemical vapor deposition method to synthesize layers of WSe2 can be investigated by fine-tuning the growth parameters. Using an array of methods, including high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, the WSe2 thin films can be physically and morphologically characterized. Then, various electrical and optical transport properties, such as the field effect mobility of charge carriers and photoelectronic properties, of these devices will be investigated. This project will analyze the exact nature of the relation between layering and electrical transport properties and enable new insight into the integration of monolayered WSe2 as metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors in electronic nanodevice applications. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.",
