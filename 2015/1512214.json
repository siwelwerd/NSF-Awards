 "awd_abstract_narration": "1512214 / Egolfopoulos, Fokion N.\r\n1512771 / Blanquart, Guillaume\r\n\r\nThe principal investigators propose to investigate how fluid flows (typical in devices such as combustor in engines and power plants) can be better modelled by using the state-of-art computer simulation techniques with the help of advanced laser-based measurements.  The potential benefits of the study include better understanding and design of combustors and higher efficiency and lower pollutant emissions. Both graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research and be prepared as future researchers and engineers. \r\n\r\nThis proposal focuses on fundamental investigation of the effects of heat release on small scale turbulent structure and aims to provide insight and mechanisms for developing physics-based turbulent reacting models, rather than based on ad-hoc assumptions. The experimental components include novel velocity measurements, adopting an approach similar to tomography in that the velocity measurements cover the depth of the field instead of the traditional two-dimensional section in truly three-dimensional flows.  Some insight will also be shed on whether Kolmogorov's equilibrium assumption for turbulent kinetic energy cascade is valid and, if not, to what extent and in what manner the assumption should be modified by the heat-releasing reactions.   The measurements span over a broader dynamic range of scales than is normally addressed using PIV.  The proposed direct numerical simulations (DNS) and analysis are well focused on questions of the effects of heat release on turbulent energy spectra and energy transfer between different scales.",

Modeling such devices with increased degree of confidence is of paramount importance as their performance can be optimized in terms of efficiency and emissions. The main outcomes of the completed research were new experimental approaches to resolve a wide range of turbulent scales and (for the first time) essential insight into fuel effects. More specifically, a multi-camera approach was developed with each camera focusing into a progressively smaller field of view. In that way, velocities could be measured simultaneously with variable spatial resolutions.  This is an important advancement, as it allows for probing very small scales that cannot be resolved in simulations of real devices and thus provide data that can be used to validate assumptions involved in those simulations.  The second major outcome of this research was the characterization of fuel effects on turbulent flames.  A unique facility has been developed at the University of Southern California that allows for investigating highly turbulent flames for fuels ranging from light gaseous to heavy liquid practical ones.  The experimental investigations convincingly suggest that knowledge obtained for simple gaseous fuels, such as for example methane, may be only partially applicable to flames of heavy fuels given that these two different classes of fuels behave differently both chemically and physically.  Additionally, it was not possible to scale the results obtained for fuels with vastly different chemical classifications, using established approaches such as for example using the laminar flame speed as a scaling parameter.  In summary, the completed research provided results that are in many ways relevant to applications, granted at atmospheric pressure. Extending such investigations at higher pressures is a major recommendation based on what has been learned.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/23/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Fokion N Egolfopoulos"
