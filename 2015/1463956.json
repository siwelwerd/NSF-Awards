The purpose of the short course is to provide an advanced survey of the present state of knowledge of polymer glasses. It is designed for advanced graduate students, faculty and industrial researchers who are working in the general area of polymer physics and who have a need to deepen their understanding of glass-forming polymers and their extensive applications.",
