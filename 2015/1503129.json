 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intermediate waters in the modern ocean play an important role in global heat, salt, and nutrient transports, and have been at the heart of many explanations of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the deglaciation. Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) is crucial in setting the pCO2 of the past but because it upwells and sinks at virtually the same temperature, it is not capable of driving significant poleward heat transport. Intermediate waters, on the other hand, contain a large component of subtropical waters that must cool before sinking to sub-thermocline depths. Here temperature contrasts can be large between source waters and sinking waters giving rise to globally significant heat transports.\r\n\r\nThis research will monitor the radiocarbon content and temperature of intermediate waters from the LGM through the deglaciation in the North Atlantic, using existing deep sea coral samples collected from the New England Seamounts. The research team will measure the U-series ages, radiocarbon content, and clumped isotope composition of the fossil corals to constrain the characteristics of intermediate waters over the past ~25,000 years. This time series will help constrain the role of intermediate waters in glacial and deglacial climate change. Models have predicted, and a few studies have found, intermediate depth warming during Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1), and the resulting data will be uniquely suited to investigate the rate and heat content of the intermediate circulation since the last glacial period. Funding supports the training of a PhD student, as well as outreach via public lectures and short videos on the links between the oceans and climate.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWe examined the existing collection of fossil deep-sea corals at Caltech for their record of past deep ocean circulation and temperature changes.  With over 15,000 individual corals in the collection, we first had to screen over 500 promising specimens for their ages, using inexpensive radiocarbon dating. From this group we precisely dated 117 corals with U-series disequilibrium techniques at Caltech and 52 of these were radiocarbon dated using the full precision methods at UC Irvine. These coupled U-series and 14C ages free radiocarbon from being a chronometer and instead let us measure the past ocean 14C content.  This tracer is a direct measure of past ocean circulation pattern and rate as it changes from the glacial maximum over the deglaciation.  To improve the information content of this record we also measured over 40 corals for their clumped isotope temperature estimates.  Together the radiocarbon and temperature data let us map, at unprecedented resolution, the history of intermediate waters in the North Atlantic and South Pacific off of Tasmania.  Our data show a deep ocean that has much larger tracer gradients than the modern ocean, including a warm-old water mass that does not exist today.\n\n \n\nThese tracer data can be interpreted in light of the evolving density structure of the past deep ocean.  At the last glacial maximum a more stratified, two-cell, circulation pattern allowed the ocean to store more carbon away from the atmosphere, and hold CO2 at low values.  This colder climate and deep ocean structure is quite stable until forces during the deglaciation disrupt the temperature and salinity forcing at high latitudes.  During this change from cold-glacial to warm-modern, the upper cell/intermediate ocean becomes more connected with the deep interior and releases CO2 in two abrupt steps.  We developed simple, but dynamically driven, models of the overturning circulation to show how certain states of temperature and salinity forcing of the deep lead to stable circulation and certain forcing patterns lead to unstable behavior.  The key to the climate moving completely from the stable glacial state to a stable modern state seems to be the release of CO2 by the combined response of the circulation and the high-latitude biological pump.  Our next step is to include a full carbon system in our simple model to better understand how this non-linearity in climate comes about at glacial terminations where the system abruptly shifts gears.  More corals from the South Atlantic at intermediate depths would help us understand how the Atlantic and Pacific connect and separate during deglaciation as the system warms up.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/22/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jess F Adkins"
