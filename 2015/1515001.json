 "awd_abstract_narration": "Studies have been showing for some years that the size of a supermassive black hole in a galaxy is correlated with the size of the galaxy itself, perhaps unsurprisingly, but also with the appearance (the 'type') of the galaxy.  However, the black hole mass is normally calculated by studying the motions of stars in the galaxy, and recent work suggests that the presence of a bar in the galaxy causes a significant perturbation in the stellar speeds, which has not been taken into account.  This leads to a bias that over-estimates the mass and can hide the effect of galaxy type.  This award supports development of a new numerical method that does not suffer from this problem.  Comparison with other methods and careful checks throughout the work will lay the foundations for future better understanding of the co-evolution of galaxies and their central black holes.\r\n\r\nThis project will work to correct this confounding factor in understanding how the co-evolution of black holes (BH) and galaxies depends upon the host galaxy's morphological type.  Recent studies show that the unique orbital structure of a bar makes significant changes in line-of-sight velocity profiles, but although nearly 60% of spiral galaxies with existing dynamical BH mass measurements contain bars, all of those estimates were derived using axisymmetric models that do not account for the bar.  The resultant systematic over-estimation bias can mask dependencies on host galaxy morphology.   This study will (a) develop the first stellar dynamical orbit superposition code capable of accurately determining BH masses in barred disk galaxies; (b) run high resolution self-consistent N-body simulations of bars and generate mock kinematic datasets for validating the new code; (c) improve the BH mass measurements in several barred galaxies; and (d) obtain the first stellar dynamical BH mass measurements for two nearby galaxies with independent reverberation mapping (RM) estimates.  Building a new code is crucial because: (1) the predicted over-estimate is comparable to the scatter and thus can mask genuine differences in BH growth mechanisms; (2) using stellar dynamics to confirm RM BH estimates is important for future high redshift estimates where only RM is possible; and (3) accurate BH masses for specific galaxies are critical for modeling the accretion physics of X-ray emitting gas.\r\n\r\nThis multi-faceted project, involving N-body simulations, code development, and the modeling of real data, will give the graduate student involved the broad and strong technical skills necessary for a successful career.  Other activities will provide future elementary school teachers with strong STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) foundations through the university's school of education, involve non-science major undergraduates through a newly-developed course, and use a summer camp to inspire high school students to pursue STEM disciplines in college.",

They appear like solid structures rotating with a constant angular (pattern) speed, but are made up of billions of stars which traverse the bar on a variety of different orbits in a coherent manner. Supermassive black holes (SMBH) are found at the centers of almost all galaxies. They play a vital role in the evolution of galaxies, yet much is still unknown about how they grow. Bar are thought to be important for driving gas towards a SMBH, since they are efficient at extracting angular momentum from the gas. Previous simulations showed that a massive SMBH can significantly weaken and even destroy a bar, possibly staunching the flow of fuel to the SMBH and limiting its size and impact on its host galaxy. On the observational and modeling side, it was realized that the measurement of SMBH masses in barred galaxies by previous modeling codes lead to significant biases.

A code (NAFF) previously written by the PI was adapted to automate the classification of bar orbits using these fundamental frequencies. Large samples of orbits were classified visually and numerically to show that bars comprise of three primary families of orbits - two rotating families of tubes and a family of box orbits ? making them fundamentally like triaxial elliptical galaxies modified by rotation. We compared the properties of the Milky Way?s bar to the orbit families to investigate the origin of the X-shaped/peanut-shaped bulge seen in the Milky Way and other disk galaxies. We showed that all the box-like orbits (see figure 1) contribute to the X-shape. Over 20% of the total mass in the bar is associated with the X-shape. In addition, orbit populations in bars with SMBH are not significantly different from bars without SMBH.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As bars evolve they inevitably experience a buckling instability where the bends and arches out of the disk plane. Buckling arises when the velocity dispersion of stars along the bar exceeds their velocity dispersion perpendicular to the disk by a factor of 1.7-3. In previous simulations without SMBH or where the SMBH starts to grow late, the buckling instability weakens the bar considerably, allowing the growing SMBH to weaken it even further. By simulating disk galaxies with SMBH grown at different rates and at different times during the formation and evolution of the bar, we showed that the growing SMBH can suppress buckling because the SMBH scatters stars making the velocity dispersions more isotropic. Consequently, a black hole that grows along with the bar becomes much stronger than when the black hole grows after the bar is fully formed. This implies that bars can fuel the growth of blackholes with no risk to themselves.</p>\n<p>Another major accomplishment was that the team developed a new code (FORSTAND) to model real galaxies of any morphological type by superposing orbits.

The code measures numerous properties of the observed galaxy: the mass of the SMBH, the mass/light ratio of the stars, the pattern (angular) speed of the bar and the types of orbits that make up the nucleus (Figure 2). Notably, the code recovers the pattern speed with greater than 10% accuracy making it superior to existing methods. FORSTAND can measure pattern speeds even in galaxies that are viewed nearly edge-on. Other methods only work on nearly face-on galaxies.
