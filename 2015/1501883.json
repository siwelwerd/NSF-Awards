 "awd_abstract_narration": "A growing need exists for energy storage systems that enable efficient energy management and resiliency.  This growth is expanding the demand for qualified technicians to install and maintain battery energy storage systems.  The Battery Energy Storage Systems Education and Training Initiative (BESS-ETI) is convening experts from the electrical engineering and energy storage industries to create a robust education and training program for electrical workers and technicians.  The portable curriculum and interactive web-based learning exercises created by the project will enable the expansion of energy storage training at community colleges and electrical worker training programs.  This project is contributing to the attraction of a diverse electrical workforce through the expansion of outreach education and training assets supporting teachers in the Philadelphia community.  This project is also supporting the revitalization and expansion of domestic manufacturing by reducing barriers to the deployment of much needed battery technologies in the energy sector and includes a nucleus of manufacturing partners in Reading, Pennsylvania, which is a distressed economic region.\r\n\r\nA key source of innovation and emphasis in the project is the advancement of blended learning methods that utilize immersive web-based interactive learning settings and a remote laboratory in which operation and monitoring of real energy storage systems and micro grids are made accessible to instructors across the nation.  An important contribution of the project is the demonstration of how scalable and mastery-based active learning and remote laboratory tools can improve learning outcomes including safety procedures, measurement and verification, and systems diagnostics.  The project will use quantitative and qualitative data to assess cognitive (knowledge and understanding) and affective (confidence) outcomes for students' pre- and post-exposure to the BESS-ETI curriculum.  Internal and external evaluators will conduct formative evaluation towards continuous improvement of the BESS-ETI program and an external evaluator will conduct summative evaluation of project outcomes.",

This project defined the fundamental skills and foundational knowledge required for the installation and maintenance of grid-interactive energy storage systems. The initial phase focused on the development of a job task analysis to define the requirements for the curriculum and a corresponding credential through significant interaction with the industry. Following the detailed job task analysis, a blended learning curriculum was developed which embeds interactive labs along with instructor-led content. Custom training equipment was designed to support the interactive educational experiences. A series of train-the-trainer sessions were conducted to develop qualified instructors to deliver the curriculum. A detailed instructor's guide was developed to support the trainers. In addition, an Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) standardized task analysis was created along with a cognitive and performance exam for certification, along with a Performance Evaluator Checklist.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In addition to the detailed approach to developing the educational content, research was conducted into the potential value of leveraging immersive technologies to embed interactive learning activities throughout the curriculum. A virtual reality (VR) educational module for the soft shutdown process of a battery energy storage facility was developed to experiment with the pedagogical value of a virtual learning simulation. The VR learning experience was particularly engaging for students. It provided a means for the learners to gain more realistic experience with the virtual facility while not having to encounter safety hazards with a real physical facility. The learners also retained valuable sequence information through increased geospatial interaction with the virtual facility. Finally, the team developed a virtual reality representation of the physical testing and training equipment to explore the potential for leveraging VR for certification testing.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Broader impacts of this project include the cultivation of the emerging market of energy storage systems by providing the training resources for safely installing grid-interactive energy storage systems. The project also demonstrated the value of leveraging virtual reality to support the training of the electrical workforce in a safe, yet realistic, simulated environment. The project also built the capacity for broad adoption of the training through the train-the-trainer program. In addition, the demonstration of the value of leveraging VR for training can support the widespread adoption of VR for workforce training across disciplinary boundaries.&nbsp; By using the VR learning experience, such learning activities can be offered at remote sites that do not have access to the specified laboratory equipment, thus affording the dissemination of such to reach many more workers throughout the United States.
