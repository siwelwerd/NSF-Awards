 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasingly, a robust cyberinfrastructure (CI) is the foundation for advanced research opportunities. Investment in personnel resources is no less important, and the role of cyberinfrastructure engineer (CIE) is a critical component in ensuring a comprehensive approach to providing research support services and advancing the research agenda. The addition of the CIE role at the Colorado School of Mines is a key element in efforts  to provide comprehensive support services through an integrative approach to the Mines research community. The CIE serves as partner, architect, integrator, and catalyst to advance efforts in scientific inquiry. Positioning the CIE within the central IT organization provides opportunities for strong collaboration and partnership between operational units that implement and support the various components of CI and faculty researchers. \r\n \r\nDirect engagement by the CIE in specific activities with researchers, the library, and students through multiple approaches (such as providing resources to manage data as an institutional asset) will have a positive impact on scientific inquiry at Mines.  This approach will facilitate increased utilization of existing cyberinfrastructure as well as ensure a strong focus on researcher needs when designing the next generation of CI.  Impacts include increased partnership between researchers and cyberinfrastructure architects and implementers that advances scientific inquiry within the institution and across the scientific community, as well as learning opportunities for the next generation of STEM researchers. Additionally, by sharing the experiences and successes of the inaugural CIE, Mines will contribute at the regional and national level to the growing professional community of cyberinfrastructure engineers.",
