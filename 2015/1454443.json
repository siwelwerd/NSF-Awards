 "awd_abstract_narration": "1454443 (Lau)\r\n\r\nThis project is about advancing the understanding of the fate and transport of metal nanomaterials in water. While increasing applications of both natural and engineered nanomaterials posit a technological panacea, they constitute a potential health threat. The behavior of metals, many of which are toxic even in trace quantities, is an important topic as population growth puts pressure on the world's drinking water resources.  Relatively little is yet known about the interdependencies between the biotic and abiotic aspects of metal transport.  This study hypothesizes that the extent and kinetics of nanoparticle deposition are a function of the surface characteristics of organics.  The project will use a combination of state-of-the-art microgravimetric, spectroscopic, and microscopic tools to extend current knowledge of deposition of nanoparticles on solid surfaces.  Understanding nanoparticle deposition is a critical step in developing contaminant sequestration strategies. The results will provide insights for the water industry, so treatment processes and technologies can be improved to provide safe drinking water.  The results of this study would also provide greater knowledge of the behavior of nanoparticles that is ultimately crucial to the development of robust geochemical models for better predictability and management capability.\r\n\r\nTo increase awareness of the connection between nanomaterials and the environment, broader impact activities will target students at different levels (K-12, undergraduate and graduate) as well as STEM teachers and industry practitioners.  Results of this research will be disseminated by engaging the general public through a hands-on activity at the annual NanoDays organized by The Discovery Museum in Acton, MA.  This hands-on activity will depict what could happen to nanoparticles when they are released into different aquatic environments.  Findings of this study will inform consulting engineers, utility personnel, and regulators on its relevance to water sustainability.  Despite improvements over the past decade, underrepresented minorities still face significant institutional and cultural barriers pursuing STEM.  By increasing their participation in STEM education and careers, America will be better equipped to lead the world in science and innovation. This study will recruit and train students from underrepresented groups through UMass' STEM Diversity Institute.  Findings from this study will not only be learned by students enrolled at UMass but also available to other college students around the world.  An educational article on environmental behaviors of nanomaterials will be submitted for publication in the Knowledge Project of Nature Education, a new division of Nature Publishing Group.  The Knowledge Project is an online, openly accessible library of peer-reviewed educational science content for college students.",
