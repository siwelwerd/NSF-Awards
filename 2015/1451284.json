 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of NSF's Advancing Informal STEM Learning program, Science Learning+ (SL+) is a partnership among US and UK foundations. SL+ makes grant awards that take transformational steps to inform, improve, and advance the knowledge bases, practices, and design of informal STEM learning experiences and environments.  The long-term SL+ goals are to broaden participation in STEM and to better understand, strengthen and coordinate STEM engagement and lifelong learning.   \r\n\r\nThis Science Learning+ Planning Project will develop a prototype assessment tool (based on a mobile technology platform) to map STEM learning experiences across different learning ecologies (e.g. science centers, mass media, home environment) and to develop research questions and designs for a Phase 2 Science Learning+ proposal.  The tool will focus on the impact of the learning ecologies on knowledge, interest, identity and reasoning rather than emphasize learning in a specific content area.  The proposing team will develop and conduct a small scale usability study during the planning period, which will inform what is proposed in the Phase 2 research.\r\n\r\nA key focus of the planning period will be to identify and develop the theoretical constructs (i.e., outcomes) to be measured by the prototype App.  As a starting point, the project will start with four of the six strands identified in Learning Science in Informal Environments (National Research Council, Bell et al., 2009): (1) interest triggered by a STEM experience; (2) understanding scientific knowledge; (3) engaging in scientific reasoning; and (4) identifying with the scientific enterprise.  Discussion among the project partners during the planning process will revolve around how these strands should be measured in the Phase 2 research across ecologies. \r\n\r\nThe measurement tool will assess the goal(s) that people set as they engage in STEM learning within each ecology and will measure the individuals' duration and level of engagement. The project will strive to utilize measures that: (1) are nonobtrusive; (2) are embedded in STEM experiences; (3) can be used across ecologies; (4) can be scaled for other ecologies than the ones examined in Phase 2 research; and (5) will be easy to use by researchers and practitioners.",

STEM education is the primary driver for helping children become adults with STEM skills.  Unfortunately, although interest in STEM is common in early childhood, a steady decline occurs in the number of students engaging in STEM courses and activities through secondary school and beyond.  How can children?s interest in STEM be maintained and what factors predict which children will continue to be engaged in STEM?  Toward answering these questions, we developed an instrument, the STEMwhere app, to measure informal STEM learning across time and context.  The STEMwhere app measures several kinds of informal STEM learning, including interest in science, engagement in science, and identity as a scientist. \n\nTo evaluate the potential of the STEMwhere app as a research tool, thirty-one children ages 7 to 14 used the app for two-months to check-in during STEM activities and to answer eight questions about each activity. The results demonstrated that most STEM activities occurred in the home and consisted of hands-on activities, and they illustrated unique relations between the different aspects of informal STEM learning.  For example, increases in interest were related to setting goals to have fun with science and to subsequent increases in engagement with science activities.  Moreover, by analyzing when and why children checked-in to the app, we were able to develop a new measure of STEM engagement.  In particular, some (but not all) children had bursts of multiple check-ins pertaining to a single STEM topic, such as a child who repeatedly checked-in to report about engaging in activities relevant to weather (which included reading books, watching videos and recording weather phenomena).  Figure 1 illustrates the check-ins that children made to the app (across the 2 months of the investigation) as well as the bursts of STEM activity on shared topics.  The latter \"topical runs\" are highlighted in the shaded boxes.  The figure illustrates that many children were actively engaged in informal STEM learning across the course of the investigation; six children also demonstrated topical runs, which illustrates extended interest and engagement with a single STEM topic.  Moreover, parents reported that the use of the STEMwhere app increased interactions with their children about science.  Thus, using the app may have an unexpected but positive benefit of promoting scientific discussion and engagement in families.\n\nOur results serve as both a proof-of-concept for the STEMwhere app for measuring STEM learning in informal settings and provide novel findings that contribute to our understanding of where and how informal science learning occurs.  Accordingly, the STEMwhere app promises to have a broad impact by allowing research teams to collect and share large data sets about where and how children engage in STEM activities.  The most recent version of the STEMwhere app is freely available and can be adapted by individual investigators to explore factors that lead to developing STEM skills and an interest in life-long STEM engagement.  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/11/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bradley J Morris"
