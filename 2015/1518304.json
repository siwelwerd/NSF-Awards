The research will constrain important properties of Europa's atmosphere, including the presence of H2O vented from a subsurface ocean. To accomplish its goals, the project will model the Europa plasma sheet to determine plasma diffusion probabilities, lifetimes and mass loading rates.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include training of undergraduate and graduate students.
