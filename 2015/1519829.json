One of the premier international scientific conferences is held every five years in Hawaii.  The purpose of this location is to attract scientists and engineers from the Pacific Rim countries as well as the rest of the world.  This symposium, taking place at Pacifichem 2015 conference, will be an interdisciplinary study of the photochemistry of water disinfection and advanced oxidation of chemical contaminants using sunlight and engineered ultraviolet light. The emphasis is on collaborations between researchers performing fundamental work in water treatment, agencies that identify critical environmental needs, industrial providers of water treatment solutions, and applications of treated water in developing countries.  This symposium will bring leaders and students with international perspectives across a wide range of backgrounds and disciplines in the area of photochemical and photobiological processes in environmental engineering.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual relevance of the symposium is tied to the unique demographic of the Pacifichem conferences. Two main themes will make up this symposium: (1) Disinfection Applications, where a major issue to be considered is the photochemistry of short wavelength UV inactivation of organisms; and the impact of this work on UV disinfection science, commercial applications, and the regulatory community. This will include fundamental research on pathogen inactivation for safe water under sunlight in natural systems. Practical aspects of reaction chemistry and system design appropriate for developing countries and indigenous communities will be a focus. (2) Oxidation and Photolysis processes for UV treatment of emerging contaminants in water, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products, UV treatment for a range of potable reuse applications, specific technologies for UV water treatment and synergies between treatment options such as ozone and UV. Water treatment issues specific to geographic regions will be highlighted.",

There were many young scientists and engineers who had an opportunity to interact closely with international experts and gain support for their career work.  Fundamental advances in the base knowledge of UV disinfection and oxidation science were reported and shared among participants to keep up with state of the art research.\n\nThe interactions between academic, practitioner and industrial participants have led to collaborations that will help to improve the industrial development of UV technology resources.  Specifically, in the emerging area of UV LEDs, there were a lot of important exchanges at the conference regarding new developments that will support industrial development but also create partnerships with academics to develop this new sustainable technology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/02/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karl G Linden"
