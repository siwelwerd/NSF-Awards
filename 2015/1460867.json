 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation and the Department of Defense's Award to Stimulate and Support Undergraduate Research (ASSURE) Program supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of North Carolina - Charlotte for the summers of 2015-2017. Ten undergraduates are selected for the NanoSURE REU program each year.  Participants join interdisciplinary research teams which focus on ongoing collaborative projects with faculty members from the Interdisciplinary Ph.D. Program in Nanoscale Science.  Targeted student participants range from rising freshmen through rising seniors and include students who belong to undergraduate populations where research opportunities are limited, or who are from underrepresented groups.  Activities include a 10-week undergraduate research experience, workshops and seminars, outreach training and activity, and various social/cultural activities.\r\n\r\nThe primary broader impact of the NanoSURE program is the advancement of nanoscale science research opportunities at the undergraduate level and the development of a diverse workforce able to meet the multi-disciplinary challenges of the nanotechnology field.  The REU site provides a mentor-guided research experience to students from underrepresented groups (women and minorities) and students from institutions in which access to research training is limited [HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), PUIs (Primarily Undergraduate Institutions), and community colleges].  The direct involvement of rising freshmen in the research experience stimulates this group of students to pursue college degrees in STEM disciplines.  The NanoSURE REU site also partners with the Discovery Place of Charlotte, NC to provide training in scientific outreach and an opportunity for REU students to disseminate science to the general public.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe UNC Charlotte NanoSURE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site provided interdisciplinary training in nanoscale science for a total of 30 undergraduate students during the period August 2015 - July 2019.  This project was designed to respond to the national need to advance nanoscale science research at the undergraduate level and contribute to the education and training of the nanotechnology workforce of the future.  Participants worked with faculty mentors from the Departments of Chemistry, Physics and Optical Science, and Mechanical Engineering and Engineering Science on research projects that created opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations that are relevant to the field of nanoscale science.  The objectives of the program were: (1) to actively recruit a  diverse population of undergraduate students to participate in on-going research experiences in nanoscale science and engineering with faculty members committed to undergraduate mentoring; (2) to introduce students to a variety of nanoscale science research methods, breakthroughs, and challenges early in their college experience to direct their career paths into nanoscale science related fields of study; (3) to engage students in interdisciplinary research opportunities that encourage communication and cooperation across traditional discipline boundaries; (4) to enhance the student experience by providing workshops, seminars, and social activities that will positively impact their professional development and encourage their participation in graduate studies; and (5) to develop scientific communication skills by providing many opportunities to disseminate results to each other in team meetings, to the public through a collaboration with a local science museum, and ultimately by submitting a summary paper in a peer-reviewed journal format and participating in an annual undergraduate research symposium. \n\nThe scientific merit of this award includes the publication of 7 manuscripts in the area of nanoscale science.  Undergraduate students from a range of experience levels were selected including rising freshmen (4/30 = 13%), rising sophomores (5/30 = 17%),  rising juniors (9/30 = 30%) and seniors (12/30 = 40%).  This program was unique in that special emphasis was placed on recruiting undergraduate students who were early in their college experience in order to retain their interest in fields related to nanoscale science. All four of the rising freshmen participants are completing degrees in or have recently graduated from a STEM field.  At this time, 20 of the 30 students have graduated.  Currently, 50% of the graduating participants have entered a post-baccalaureate program in a STEM or health field.  In addition, several of the REU participants went on to receive national awards/recognitions including a Gates Millenium Scholarship and Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship. \n\nA significant broader impact of the NanoSURE REU program has been the success in expanding the access to research opportunities to participants that traditionally lack such opportunities, with 30 out of 30 participants (100 %) meeting at least one of the following categories: traditionally underrepresented minorities ? African American or Hispanic (14/30 = 47%), female students (17/30 = 57%), or students with limited opportunity to do STEM-field research (18/30 = 60%, which includes PUIs (10), HBCUs (1), community colleges (3), and incoming first-year students (4)).   \n\nA supplement to this grant was funded by the EHR directorate in response to the NSF 16-067 ?Improving Graduate Student Preparedness for Entering the Workforce, Opportunities for Supplemental Support\".  The goal of this supplemental request was to enhance the career preparedness of doctoral student Margaret Kocherga by providing a STEM education-related training in cooperation with UNC Charlotte?s NanoSURE REU site and the Charlotte Teachers Institute. The scientific merit of the supplement was that the graduate student worked closely with two K-12 teachers during Summer 2017 to develop more efficient organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on new fluorescent compounds.  The broader impact of the supplement was the collaboration between the graduate student and teachers to develop and assess new curriculum modules for K-12 classrooms based on the Summer 2017 research activities.  The activities also prepared the graduate student for a career path that combines chemistry/nanoscience research with K-12 STEM educator research/training    \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/24/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas A Schmedake"
