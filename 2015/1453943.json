 "awd_abstract_narration": "Atmospheric tides originating in the lower atmosphere are an important driver of ionospheric variability and thus of the longitudinal and local time variability of ionospheric plasma density. The overarching objective of this project is to better understand the major sources of, and processes responsible for, the multi-scale temporal variability of the atmospheric tides from the troposphere to the ionosphere dynamo region. This will advance our understanding in cross-scale coupling processes of the upper atmosphere to the lower atmosphere through the transformation and transport of energy, mass, and momentum by atmospheric waves and ultimately, result in a better space weather forecasting capability. \r\n\t\r\nIn particular, the project will examine: i) the inter-annual variability of the atmospheric tides from the lower to upper atmosphere and their coupling processes to the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the stratospheric Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO), ii) the seasonal variability of the atmospheric tides from the lower to upper atmosphere, and iii) the day-to-day variability of the atmospheric tides from the lower to upper atmosphere and its coupling with the Stratospheric Sudden Warming (SSW) events. The data employed are from an advanced dynamics-chemistry coupled Global Circulation Model, the extended Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (eCMAM). The analysis period covers 1979-2010.\r\n\r\nThis project will be led by a female assistant professor in a growing program of atmospheric science at the University of Louisville, which is attracting minorities and women. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in space-weather related research. Outreach activities will expose K-12 students and high school teachers to atmospheric science.",
