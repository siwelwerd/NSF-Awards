 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical summary:\r\n\r\nCobalt (Co), in the form of thin films, is a critical magnetic material with widespread applications in magnetic data storage devices, microelectromechanical and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS/NEMS), as well as environmentally benign wear and corrosion resistant coatings. Yet, the mechanical properties of Co films, either in face-centered-cubic (fcc) or hexagonal-close-packed (hcp) form are poorly understood. The principal investigator's recent studies show that high-density stacking faults (SFs) - atomic planes that disrupt the ordered arrangement of atoms - can be introduced into fcc and hcp Co. These SFs may drastically enhance mechanical properties leading to higher strength and ductility of Co. The aim of the project is to elucidate the effect of the density of SFs and systematically investigate the mechanical properties of Co with SFs. The investigators have existing collaborations and their expertise nicely complements each other. The collaboration provides students with the opportunity to gain complementary knowledge in experiments and simulations through mutual visits, lectures and seminars at the participating institutions. The investigators also have arrangement for graduate students to visit the Department of Energy - Center for Integrated Nanotechnologies to access advanced microscopy facilities. The knowledge derived from this project can be incorporated into curricula at both institutions. The co-investigator can leverage successful outreach programs at University of Houston to broaden participation in engineering. The principal investigator can recruit a minority graduate student through the \"Pathway to Doctoral Program\" from minority institutions. Both investigators continuously supervise undergraduate students and encourage their students to attend major conferences.   \r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical summary:\r\n\r\nThe objective of this project is to investigate the deformation mechanisms in fcc and hcp Co with high-density SFs. The ultimate goal is to understand the significance of SFs in governing the mechanical properties of metals, and improving the strength and deformability of Co. The investigators combine experiments and molecular dynamics simulations to perform the following major tasks: (1) understand the nucleation of SFs and the formation of intercepted SFs in fcc Co, and tailor the density of SFs in fcc and hcp Co; 2) examine the deformation mechanisms in fcc Co, including dislocation-SF interactions, size effect and work hardening, via a combination of in situ nanoindentation and atomistic modeling; and 3) investigate the deformation mechanisms in hcp Co with high density SFs and understand nucleation mechanisms of deformation twins in hcp Co. This project could reveal the significant role of SFs in mechanical behavior of metals. Furthermore, the combination of novel nanomechanical testing tools with molecular dynamics simulations fills in the knowledge gap through comprehensive interrogation of the deformation mechanisms in fcc and hcp Co with SFs at the atomistic level.",
