This is important in order to understand the impact of human activities on Earth's atmosphere, and to determine the stability of the composition of the atmosphere in the past. How humans have impacted Earth?s atmospheric composition is important for developing accurate predictions of future global atmospheric conditions. In addition to training students, the investigators will support continuing education of high school science teachers on Long Island through specifically tailored, interactive seminars on various topics in earth science, atmospheric sciences, physics and biology. A pilot program at Mount Sinai School District, near Stony Brook University will be the first implementation of this program.\r\n\r\nThe investigators plan to reconstruct historical variations in the sources of atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) from measurements of the concentration and stable isotopic abundance of carbon monoxide ([CO], 13CO and C18O) in the South Pole Ice Core, which is being drilled in 2014-2016. The goal is to strategically sample and reconstruct the relative variations in CO source strengths over the past 20,000 years. These will be the first measurements to extend the CO record beyond 650 years before present, back to the last glacial maximum. Both atmospheric chemical processes and variations in CO sources can impact the CO budget, and variations in the CO budget are useful in identifying and quantifying chemistry-climate interactions.",
