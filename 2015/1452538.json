 "awd_abstract_narration": "Caribbean staghorn coral was one of the most common corals within reefs of the Florida Keys several decades ago. Over the last 40 years disease, bleaching, overfishing and habitat degradation caused a 95% reduction of the population. Staghorn coral is now listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act of 1973. Within the past few years, millions of dollars have been invested for the purpose of restoring the population of staghorn coral within Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Significant effort has been placed on maintaining and propagating corals of known genotypes within coral nurseries for the purpose of outplanting. However, little is known about the individual genotypes that are currently being outplanted from nurseries onto coral reefs. Are the genotypes being used for outplanting resilient enough to survive the three major stressors affecting the population in the Florida Keys: disease, high water temperatures, and ocean acidification? The research within the present study will be the first step in answering this critically important question. The funded project will additionally develop a research-based afterschool program with K-12 students in the Florida Keys and U.S. Virgin Islands that emphasizes an inquiry-based curriculum, STEM research activities, and peer-to-peer mentoring. The information from the present study will help scientists predict the likelihood of species persistence within the lower Florida Keys under future climate-change and ocean-acidification scenarios. Results of this research will also help guide restoration efforts throughout Florida and the Caribbean, and lead to more informative, science-based restoration activities.\r\n\r\nAcropora cervicornis dominated shallow-water reefs within the Florida Keys for at least the last half a million years, but the population has recently declined due to multiple stressors. Understanding the current population level of resilience to three major threats - disease outbreaks, high  water temperatures, and ocean acidification conditions - is critical for the preservation of this threatened species. Results from the present study will answer the primary research question: will representative genotypes from the lower Florida Keys provide enough phenotypic variation for this threatened species to survive in the future? The present proposal will couple controlled laboratory challenge experiments with field data and modeling applications, and collaborate with local educators to fulfill five objectives: 1) identify A. cervicornis genotypes resistant to disease, 2) identify A. cervicornis genotypes resilient to high water temperature and ocean acidification conditions, 3) quantify how high water temperature and ocean acidification conditions impact disease dynamics on A. cervicornis; 4) determine tradeoffs in life-history traits because of resilience factors; and 5) apply a trait-based model, which will predict genotypic structure of a population under different environmental scenarios.",

In response to this continued degradation, many organizations have invested significant resources into coral restorations efforts; however, most of the threats causing coral loss remain unabated. To combat this challenge, scientists, restoration practitioners, and managers have been developing intervention strategies to integrate resilience into restored populations. One approach includes screening coral genotypes for tolerance to major threats, eventually upscaling the inclusion of these resilient corals into active restoration. However, little is known about whether there are tradeoffs associated with these resistant traits. For example, heat tolerant corals may be less fecund or disease resistant genotypes may grow more slowly due to the allocation of limited energetic resources. The current NSF CAREER award studied a subset of Mote Marine Laboratory?s broodstock of <em>Acropora cervicornis</em> genotypes that have been outplanted throughout Florida?s Coral Reef for over a decade to characterize phenotypic response to high temperatures, ocean acidification conditions, and white band disease exposure. The study also measured growth among the genotypes tested and quantified fecundity to determine whether there were tradeoffs for corals that were more robust against these known threats. Additionally, experimental studies were repeated using the same, or altered, methodologies to quantify the phenotypic plasticity of each genotype. The fecundity and average growth of each genotype tested was also quantified. The data collected were amalgamated into a population-based model that projected population structure under different disease outbreak scenarios. The disease exposure study showed that disease resistance among tested <em>Acropora cervicornis</em> ranged from 0 ? 100% after exposure to white band disease under ambient conditions. When the corals bleached from anomalously warm water temperatures the variance among genotypes reduced; predominantly corals were 100% susceptible when bleached. However, two genotypes showed complete disease resistance whether bleached or not. These two genets also possessed a unique microbiome, devoid of an obligate intracellular parasitic bacterium that dominated the susceptible coral genotypes. Subsequent studies exposed genotypes of <em>Acropora cervicornis</em> to four treatments for two months (control, ocean acidification, high temperature, high temperature &amp; ocean acidification). These studies showed that coral genotypes varied in their level of heat tolerance and resistance to ocean acidification, and there were no significant tradeoffs associated with the resilience to these two threats. Combined exposure to high temperature &amp; ocean acidification conditions showed synergistic negative responses for at least some traits. Repeat exposures of the same genotypes to the same treatments the following year, however, indicated that phenotypic response was plastic, although general rankings of resistance among genets were relatively consistent under high temperature or high temperature &amp; ocean acidification conditions. Additionally, shortening the exposure, but increasing the rate of temperature change within the experimental design, eliminated the variation in heat tolerance among genets and caused disease-related mortality thus highlighting the need to thoughtfully test methodologies to ensure confident phenotypes prior to interpretation. Finally, fecundity also varied by genotype with the two most disease resistant genets having significantly higher fecundity than the other genotypes measured. These results indicate that there may be a conferred level of robustness within certain genets making them more likely to survive current and future ocean conditions, while also overly contributing to the reproductive potential of the restored population. The population model results, which integrated fecundity and growth metrics, indicated that under normal conditions, future population levels would be higher when outplanting more disease susceptible genotypes than resistant. However, introducing disease outbreaks effectively crashed the population structure when only susceptible genotypes were outplanted. Thus, higher ratios of disease resistant to susceptible genotypes should be used for restoration when and where frequent disease events are expected. Our results of the phenotypic variation testing and applied population model support the importance of considering genetic variation and phenotype testing in restoration efforts to best support the rehabilitation of Florida?s Coral Reef.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The present NSF CAREER award also developed a research-based after school program (RAPS) for middle and high school students in the Florida Keys and St. Croix, US Virgin Islands that focused on coral reef research and conservation.
