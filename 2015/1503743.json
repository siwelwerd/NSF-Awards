The conference will bring together and promote young researchers at the forefront of different subfields of probability relating to Sherman's work, mainly, statistical physics and probability. Both of these topics are extremely active in the mathematical community and have enjoyed many recent breakthroughs. Therefore ideas and materials resulting from the meeting will be of interest to scientists studying a wide range of mathematical topics.\r\n\r\nThe majority of participants are recent doctoral graduates, including eight postdoctoral researchers and four assistant professors. Furthermore, two of the speakers are still Ph.D. students. Some of the main impacts of this conference will be on these young researchers, providing them a venue to showcase their work and to interact with others in a range of career stages.\r\n\r\nConference website: http://pages.iu.edu/~rdlyons/sherman/2015.html",
