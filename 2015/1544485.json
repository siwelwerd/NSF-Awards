The workshop provides a platform for scientific collaboration, the results of which will benefit those working to develop more effective auditing and accounting practices.  \r\n\r\nDr. Hugh Gusterson of the George Washington University will organize a workshop to explore \"roboprocesses\", the highly scripted social algorithms that mediate Americans' relationships with commercial and government institutions. Bringing together fifteen anthropologists from a range of subdisciplinary approaches, the workshop would explore how different auditing and accounting practices become routinized and regimented through in a range of contexts: standardized public school testing, health care software, credit and financial evaluation, national security algorithms and homeland security, criminal sentencing and deportation protocols, the promulgation of statistical indices by international aid agencies, and the automated standardization of the American agricultural system. The project will advance scientific understandings of accounting, bureaucracy, and audit culture.",

The workshop brought together contributors to an edited volume on \"roboprocesses.\"  Roboprocesses are highly scripted social scenarios, often structured by computerized algorithms, that are increasingly salient in the contemporary United States.  These scripted roboprocesses standardize assessments of people, subject assessments and interactions to rigid (often binary) structuring and evaluation, and reduce the space for improvisation and discretionary judgment in interactions between individuals and institutions.  Examples include \"three strikes and you?re out\" laws, standardized tests in schools, the protocols for calculating consumer credit scores, and the scripted evaluations doctors use when assessing patients. \n\nThe workshop brought together authors of individual chapters in the edited volume with expert discussants selected from the local anthropological community in Washington DC.  The purpose was to create for those writing chapters a shared engagement with a body of theoretical literature and with a common set of meta-questions, thereby increasing the functional integration of the published volume; the workshop also gave authors the benefit of expert critique of their individual chapters.

In order to maximize the time available for discussion, the chapters were electronically circulated before the workshop, so that author presentations could be brief and the time for discussion greater.\n\nThe chapters presented were:\n\nRoger Lancaster of George Mason University on the protocols of incarceration in the contemporary United States.\n\nSally Merry of New York University on the construction of global statistics to measure economic development, human rights and educational performance.\n\nMiguel Diaz-Barriga and Margaret Dorsey of the University of Texas on the rise of surveillance protocols on the Texas- Mexico border.\n\nSusan Terrio of Georgetown University on the protocols used by U.S. immigration courts to evaluate unaccompanied undocumented minors.\n\nCatherine Lutz (Brown University) and Anne Lutz Fernandez (a public school teacher) on the use of standardized tests in the U.S. public school system.\n\nJoseph Masco of the University of Chicago on the rise of algorithms of risk assessment in surveillance of domestic threats in the United States.\n\nRobert Gehl of the University of Utah on the algorithmic sorting by internet search engines and social media sites of consumer behavior.\n\nAlex Blanchette of Tufts University on the standardization of the U.S. pork farming and food production system.\n\nNoelle Stout of New York University on the protocols through which the U.S. mortgage industry assessed the claims of distressed homeowners after the housing bubble burst in 2008.\n\n \n\nDiscussants included: Richard Grinker of George Washington University, Brett Williams of American University, Fida Adeley of Georgetown University, Michael Barnett of George Washington University, Khaled Furani of Tel Aviv University, Joel Kuipers of George Washington University, Andrew Bickford of George Mason University, Johanna Bockman of George Mason University, Amy Best of George Mason University, and Ed Liebow, the executive director of the American Anthropological Association.\n\nThe workshop was open to academics who wanted to attend and some graduate students from George Washington University and George Mason University sat in on the workshop, making helpful contributions to the discussion.
