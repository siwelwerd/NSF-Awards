 "awd_abstract_narration": "The southern Great Basin is among the most arid regions in North America. It has almost no\r\nperennial streams, but does have >1,000 springs. These springs are islands of aquatic habitat\r\nin an ocean of desert. Remarkably, many of these isolated springs contain diverse aquatic\r\necosystems and even endemic species of fish, spring snails, and other aquatic organisms. The\r\npresence of many aquatic species that can only survive in water is evidence that the springs\r\nare remnants of a perennial drainage system, and the presence of endemic species requiring\r\nintervals in the million-year range for genetic divergence are evidence that at least some\r\nof these springs have never desiccated over the geological time scale. Aquatic biogeographical\r\npatterns thus inform the geological and hydrological history of the region.\r\n\r\nThis is a project to expand the already-large regional biogeographical database and to use the combined\r\nnew and preexisting data to test models of tectonic and paleohydrological evolution of the\r\nsouthern Great Basin. The PIs will focus on two timescales: that of the extensional breakup of\r\nthe region from the late Miocene to the present and that of glacial/interglacial climate cycles.\r\nExtensive work has been done to understand the extensional history of the region, which started\r\nin the eastern portion of the study area at ~14 Ma and migrated westward to the Sierra Nevada\r\nfront, driven by plate-boundary dynamics. They will simulate this evolution using a regional\r\nquasi-3D kinematic/tectonic-geomorphic-hydrologic coupled model that fully couples movement\r\nalong faults, mass distribution, magmatism, isostatic compensation and flexural deformation\r\nwith hydrology and surface geomorphic processes, including erosion and deposition. The extensional\r\nfragmentation of the hydrological system will be studied and groundwater flow, necessary to\r\nsimulate the resulting development of springs, will be an integral part of the regional tectonic-geomorphic-hydrologic model.\r\n.\r\nModeled paleohydrologic histories will be tested against biotic data (aquatic biota inventories,\r\nmicrobial and macrofaunal DNA, and genetic divergence times) with island biogeography theory.\r\nThe PIs will test for relations of hydrologic fragmentation chronology with endemic species and\r\nfor ecosystem diversity with spring resilience, as inferred from groundwater ages and climatically\r\ndriven modeling. They will use these results to assess and improve their tectonic/paleohydrologic models.",

The larger, highly multidisciplinary research project is investigating the processes that control or influence the hydrological resilience of desert springs and their associated fauna (fish, snails, benthic macroinvertebrates [BMI], and microbiological communities). Specifically, the larger project is testing hypotheses on the role of geological forcing, namely tectonic extension, on the endemism and biodiversity of desert spring systems in the southern Great Basin. Endemism describes the situation when an organism is restricted to a specific geographic location, in this case, organisms that are restricted to springs. Biodiversity describes the variety of different organisms in an ecological setting, in this case, desert springs.</p>\n<p>The major goals of this project, award EAR 1516127, were: (1) characterizing the hydrogeology and geochemistry of modern springs, (2) quantifying their relationship to landscape (geomorphic) metrics and geological characteristics, and (3) establishing metrics which define spring ecological resilience in terms of hydrogeology and geology. The results from this research are being used to test and inform coupled tectonic/hydrogeologic/ecologic models of the study area. The project provided training in hydrogeology for one Ph.D. student (now completing a postdoc), one M.S. student (now employed at the US EPA), and ten undergraduate students.</p>\n<p>One portion of the research was completed in the Panamint Mountains of Death Valley, California. Despite being located in the rain shadow of the Sierra Nevada, the Panamint Range hosts well over 180 springs that are representative of desert springs. The results of the research show that nearly all of the springs depend upon recharge from snowmelt along the crest and high-elevation regions of the mountains; recharge from rainfall is small in comparison. Furthermore, recharge rates are higher at high elevations and lower at low elevations. Thus, these springs are strongly connected to recharge occurring at high elevations and none of the springs are supported by regional groundwater flow associated with the Death Valley Regional Flow System. These findings highlight the dependence on snowmelt for many of the mountain springs in the region and this dependence on snow makes them extremely sensitive to changes in recharge associated with decreasing snowpack. Over one-half of the springs sampled have residence times less than 500 years and only seven springs have residence times greater than 1000 years. Residence times are shortest at high elevations and generally increase with decreasing elevation. These findings suggest that high-elevation springs are the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, whereas low-elevation springs are less vulnerable but not immune.</p>\n<p>The other, larger portion of this research was completed on springs emerging in the Spring Mountains (west of Las Vegas, NV), Death Valley, and Owens Valley (including the eastern Sierra Nevada, White, and Inyo Mountains). In Owens Valley, the response of vegetation surrounding springs to the 2011-2017 California drought was compared to the residence times of the springs. We discovered that springs that discharge a large proportion of old groundwater (&gt; 100 years) showed greater resistance to the effects of the 2011-2017 California drought. In comparison, springs that discharged a higher proportion of young groundwater (&lt; 100 years old), showed increased drying and desiccation. This study is one of the first to show with field data that groundwater residence time is an important control on the resistance and resilience of desert springs to the effects of severe droughts. In a separate study in Owens Valley, we found that subtle differences in geology along the eastern Sierra Nevada, namely the presence or absence of carbonate roof pendants, imparts distinct geochemical fingerprints of springs and this, in turn, translates to unique BMI and microbiological communities. Thus, we infer that changes in recharge or water partitioning in the high elevations where the roof pendants are located will directly affect the community structure of springs located at low elevations along the mountain front and in the adjacent valley. Finally, the dataset collected across the study area was used to determine if there are broader relationships between community structure and groundwater chemistry and residence time. That work shows that high-elevation springs with short residence times tend to exhibit more geochemical variability, tend to be geochemically immature, and they primarily host stress-intolerant organisms. In comparison, low-elevation springs with longer residence times tend to exhibit less geochemical variability, tend to be more geochemically evolved, and they primarily host stress-tolerant organisms. These findings provide valuable insight into the geologic processes that have led to spring persistence over long time scales and the hydrogeochemical processes which have affected the endemism and biodiversity of desert springs. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/05/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Marty&nbsp;D&nbsp;Frisbee</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1516127/1516127_10382519_1641411027244_Big_Spring_Ash_Meadows_NWR--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1516127/1516127_10382519_1641411027244_Big_Spring_Ash_Meadows_NWR--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Big Spring, Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge, NV\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1516127/1516127_10382519_1641411027244_Big_Spring_Ash_Meadows_NWR--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Big Spring, Ash Meadows National Wildlife Refuge, NV\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The vulnerability of desert springs to the effects of climate change can be described by the landscape placement of the spring (where in the landscape it emerges) along with its hydrogeochemical composition and residence time.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Marty D.
