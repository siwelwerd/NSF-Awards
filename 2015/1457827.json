 "awd_abstract_narration": "In high-elevation mountain environments, the ranges of many alpine plant species are limited by a short and cold growing season. Beyond these limits no vascular plants survive, but microbial life thrives. Warmer spring temperatures and earlier snowmelt could allow alpine plant species to expand into these unvegetated areas. This research will examine whether some plant species will benefit from soil microbes as they expand their distribution in response to climate change. The interactions of plants with the high elevation soil microbes will be examined to test whether microbes increase the ability of plants to withstand cold, drought, and low-nutrient stress.  The research will advance ecological science in the context of understanding the impacts of climate change on biodiversity and changes in species distribution on the landscape. The project also will contribute to secondary school education through curriculum development.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the influence of a key biotic interaction, between plants and soil microbes, on the ability of plant species to track climate change and expand their range uphill in high montane systems. Recent methodological advances will be used to develop experiments to quantify mechanisms that underlie plant-microbial associations and to include results in habitat distribution models. The research includes (1) observational work on distributional patterns of both plants and soil microbes (bacteria and fungi) in a spatially-explicit grid at the upper edge of plant distributions into unvegetated sub-nival areas, (2) manipulations of plant-microbial interactions via inoculation experiments combined with dual-RNA transcriptomics to assay gene expression to describe interactions among plant and microbes and (3) field manipulations of growing season length and plant-microbe associations to quantify the effects of microbial facilitation into previously plant-free zones. Partnership with Rocky Mountain National Park will enable the project to collect data relevant to management concerns and participate in outreach programs, and Science LIVE, an interactive web-based tool, will be used to develop high school curriculum modules.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of this project was to understand how plants and microbes move up in elevation as global warming causes earlier melt out of snow packs and glaciers in the mountains of Colorado.  The research was conducted near the continental divide in the Green Lakes Valley, an area that is undergoing upward movement of plants in response to global warming.  The study focused on the interactions between plants and microbes because many plants depend on microbes to help them grow in natural environments and many soil microbes rely on carbon inputs from plants.  Long-term data sets were used to quantify the extent of upward movement of plants over the past several decades, and field and greenhouse experiments were employed to test the effects of microbes and growing-season length on the ability of plants to survive at higher-elevation sites.  Results of these studies indicate that there is an optimal growing season length for plant survival in this system and that microbes were more important for plant survival during years with suboptimal growing season lengths.  Mathematical models (Species Distribution Models) also showed that the presence of bacteria improved the ability of the models to predict the distribution of plant species across this changing landscape.  In addition, experiments showed that plant diversity and abundance were important determinants of soil microbial diversity in soils being colonized by plants.  The results of this project have broad societal implications because the ability of plants and microbes to colonize lands opening up due to earlier snow melt has direct effects (by stabilizing land and taking up excess nutrients) on drinking water quality and quantity in the Western United States.  This project provided educational opportunities and training for over 40 people including high school students, undergraduate students, graduate students, lab and field technicians, and postdocs working together on daily basis.
