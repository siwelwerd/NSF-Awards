This project seeks to explore strategies for engineering more tolerant microbes in support of enhanced chemical production.  Novel enzyme pathways will first be engineered to enable the individual biosynthesis of four aromatic products that are currently derived from petroleum. Their alternative bioproduction will ultimately help to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and gas. The materials and strategies developed in this project will ultimately benefit not only the production of renewable aromatic chemicals, but also a broad range of other useful bioproducts, including biofuels. \r\n\r\nIn addition to expanding the number and diversity of conventional petrochemical replacements that can be synthesized microbially through the creation of enzyme pathways, this project further seeks to explore strategies for engineering more tolerant microbes in support of enhanced chemical production.  Novel enzyme pathways will first be engineered to enable the individual biosynthesis of four aromatic products: styrene, (S)-styrene oxide, (R)-styrene glycol, and 2-phenylethanol.  To counter the inhibitory effects associated with microbial chemical production, strategies will be explored to improve tolerance and productivity by actively excreting toxic products from cells as they are synthesized.  This will be achieved with the aid of both native and heterologous efflux transporter proteins. Finally, novel gene circuits will be engineered to control the expression of efflux pumps only if and when needed by the cell, thereby allowing cells to conserve valuable resources for further chemical production. The development of novel, aromatic-inducible gene circuits to control transporter expression will demonstrate how self-actuating control strategies can be used to maintain maximal host fitness by affording cells the ability to sense and respond to dynamic changes in their environment and intrinsic metabolism. The close integration of the research with educational and outreach activities will be a key component of this project.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology.",

As these products are currently derived from petroleum or extracted from plant biomass, their alternative microbial synthesis helps to improve the sustainability of their production.  Meanwhile, as these products are synthesized from sugars derived from plant biomass, the proposed approach will have further positive impacts with respect to the reduction of atmospheric CO2 levels.  To counter the inhibitory effects associated with the microbial production of these aromatic compounds, as well as inhibitory products in general, multiple strategies were also explored to improve tolerance and productivity .  As the major approach, we explored the utility of both native and heterologous efflux transporter proteins to actively excrete toxic products from the cell via the creation and screening of a comprehensive transporter library.  Promising transporter candidates were identified for several of the aromatic targets of interest, and continue to be explored for their ability to improve production.  To better understand the inhibitory effects of aromatic chemicals and how Escherichia coli cells reacts to their presence, the transcriptomic response to styrene was characterized via RNA sequencing.  Uniquely, the cellular response to styrene was characterized as a function of the exposure source, namely endogenous production versus exogenous addition.  Finally, to further improve production of aromatic chemicals using cellulosic sugar mixtures, several mutations were investigated in E. coli to relieve carbon catabolite repression caused by sugar mixtures, as well as to increase the production of essential pathway precursors.
