This conference brings together a host of international authorities to explore topics that lie at the interface of harmonic analysis, complex analysis, and operator theory. The topics of the conference are of wide interest in several areas of mathematics and also have impact outside of mathematics. In particular, the completeness problems are related to solution of Sturm-Liouville and Schroedinger differential equations, of importance in mathematical physics, and model spaces have important applications in control theory, of interest in engineering.\r\n\r\nThe conference will focus on recent progress in function theory, model spaces, completeness problems, and Carleson measures; in particular, on two recent stunning developments in the area: Poltoratski's research into the completeness of eigenfunction solutions to certain differential equations and Lacey's work on Carleson measures. Bringing together seasoned researchers and promising young mathematicians to address research challenges in this area is likely to lead to important new questions, inspire further research and new collaborations, and lead to new breakthroughs. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work. \r\n\r\nConference web site: http://www.mittag-leffler.se/?q=150629",
