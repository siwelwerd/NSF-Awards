 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plant cells are bound by a rigid cell wall, yet animal cells rely only on a plasma\r\nmembrane and the underlying meshwork of cytoskeletal fibers, called actin filaments, for support and stability.  As the cell boundary, the plasma membrane both enables and restricts any shape changing process.  Adherence of the plasma membrane to the actin meshwork beneath generates resistance to deformation but also allows cells to maintain complex shapes.  Non-muscle Class I myosins are motor proteins capable of binding both plasma membrane and actin filaments; therefore, they may link the plasma membrane to the actin cytoskeleton.  That Class I myosins are structurally conserved from yeast to humans is indicative of their functional importance.  However, their precise role in processes involving membrane deformation, such as cell migration and phagocytosis, remains elusive.  In collaboration with Dr. Nils Gauthier, an expert in membrane-cytoskeletal interactions at the Mechanobiology Institute at the National University of Singapore, this research will evaluate the participation of Class I myosins in membrane-cytoskeletal adhesion during physiologically important processes that involve membrane deformation.  \r\n\r\nIn this project, the strength of membrane-cytoskeletal attachment in macrophages (cells of the innate immune system) lacking Class I myosins will be measured using a calibrated optical tweezers system, which uses a focused laser to measure forces applied to microscopic objects.  Cells will then be subjected to tests on cell motility, cell traction and cell spreading to assess membrane deformation ability.  These experiments will also be performed on macrophages expressing truncated myosin constructs to further our understanding of the roles of the individual protein domains.  With the expertise of Dr. Gauthier and the specialized core facilities of the Mechanobiology Institute, this work will shed light on the workings of an ancient motor protein and its role in moving the plasma membrane. This award is funded in collaboration with the National Research Foundation of Singapore.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to elucidate the biomechanical capabilities of two actin-dependent motor proteins, myosin 1E and myosin 1F.  A cell\u00c6s skeleton or \"cytoskeleton\" is composed of three different types of protein fibers, which act like scaffolding to provide support.   Myosins move along one of these fiber types (actin) to help in intracellular transport and cell shape changes.  Mutations in myosin Is result in health issues ranging from hearing loss to kidney dysfunction.  A key feature of myosin I is the ability to interact with both actin and the cell membrane, effectively acting as a \" membrane linker\".  Myosins 1E/F are unique among the eight types of myosin Is (A-G) in humans due to their additional protein domains.  Their \"linker\" status has yet to be determined and little is known about the physiological role of these proteins, despite their being highly expressed in many cell types of the body.\n\nUsing the state-of-the-art equipment at the Mechanobiology Institute at the National University of Singapore, we have discovered that myosin 1E/F indeed contribute to the adhesion of the plasma membrane to the underlying cytoskeleton.  Without these proteins, membrane-cytoskeletal linkage is impaired and tension in the plasma membrane is reduced.  Altered membrane tension can affect a cell\u00c6s ability to function properly as membrane tension regulates cell motility and endocytosis.  Our next step is to uncover how this biophysical role of myosin 1E/F is important for actin-based activities within the cell.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sarah R Barger"
