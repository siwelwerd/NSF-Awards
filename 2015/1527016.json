 "awd_abstract_narration": "Crowd stampede is one of the most harmful collective human behaviors. In incidents throughout history, panic due, for example, to the outbreak of fire or the unexpected discharge of firearms has been a greater hazard than the original triggering events. This project supports fundamental research on the influence of human-robot interaction on crowd dynamics, towards the design of dynamic robot control algorithms to assist humans and prevent panic in emergency situations. The ultimate goal of this research will be reconfigurable robot guides that can respond to a variety of needs. These include different types of emergency evacuation, as well as non-emergency situations involving mass movement of crowds, such as at parades, concerts, or other large public events. The project integrates research with educational activities through robot-centric education and short course development. To engage the younger generation with science and technology, the project will partner with a university educational center and a community college for various outreach activities.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the project is to investigate human-robot interaction in crowd dynamics, develop optimal feedback control to regulate human flow distribution, and design robot-assisted emergency evacuation algorithms. The research will advance the state-of-the-art in human-robot interaction, and fill a gap in robotics research by experimentally validating and measuring the interaction forces governing human-robot interaction in crowd dynamics. The proposed robot motion primitive design leads to new approaches for learning-based robot motion planning to efficiently engage humans. The project validates the use of dynamic robot guides in real human-robot interaction experiments in indoor environments. Simulation validation in benchmark environments such as shopping-malls and campus buildings will also be performed, and the efficiency of alternative robot-assisted evacuation strategies will be evaluated. While primarily for intelligent robots, the research results are anticipated to be cross-cutting and applicable to other areas such as transportation, communication, and control.",

The \"fast-is-slower\" effect defines the phenomenon of jamming at an exit or a bottleneck, caused by people rushing to the exit. Originated from the transportation community, it is known that modification of pedestrian facilities can increase efficiency and safety. For example, adding \"obstacles\" can stabilize flow patterns and make the flow more fluid; adding zigzag-shaped geometries and columns can reduce pressure in panicked crowds. However, modification of infrastructure is often expensive and not easily reconfigurable in real time. In this project, we have proposed a new robot-assisted pedestrian flow regulation scheme that uses a mobile robot to dynamically interact with moving pedestrians for the purpose of achieving flow regulation in real time.</p>\n<p>We first conducted robot experiments to characterize human-robot interaction (HRI). We deployed a mobile robot moving in a direction perpendicular to the pedestrian flow in a uni-directional exit corridor, and installed a pedestrian motion tracking system to record the collective motion. We analyzed both individual and collective motion of pedestrians, and measured the effect of the robot motion on the overall pedestrian flow. The experimental results have shown the effect of passive HRI, where the pedestrians' overall speed was slowed down in the presence of the robot, and the faster the robot moves, the lower the average pedestrian velocity becomes. Experiment results have shown qualitative consistency of the collective HRI effect with simulation results using existing social force models.</p>\n<p>Based on the passive HRI, we formulated the robot-assisted pedestrian regulation problem as to find the optimal robot motion frequency such that the average pedestrian speed reaches a desired level. We proposed an adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) based learning algorithm that takes the measurement of pedestrian flows from a surveillance camera as input, and outputs the motion frequency for the robot. The ADP method solves the optimal control online and is the type of feedback control. The ADP learning architecture consists of a critic network and an actor network. Utilizing function approximators of neural networks, the actor network generates the control signal, and the critic network estimates the value function that is the sum of discounted rewards from the current time to the infinite horizon future.&nbsp; The error function of the critic network is defined as the temporal-difference (TD) error.

Special attention was paid to monitor the crowd pressure, the quantity measuring the critical crowd conditions that may evolve into crowd accidents.

The robot motion planner is trained end-to-end using a deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which avoids hand-crafted feature detection and extraction, thus improving the learning capability for complex dynamic problems. Simulation results have demonstrated that the robot is able to find optimal motion decisions that maximize the pedestrian outflow in different flow conditions, and the pedestrian-accumulated outflow increases significantly compared to cases without robot regulation and with random robot motion.</p>\n<p>The project integrates research projects with education activities through robot centric undergraduate and graduate education.
