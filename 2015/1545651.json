 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) programs provide undergraduate students with rich and meaningful research experiences. As \"apprentices\" to professional scientists, these students receive hands-on mentorship that enables them to attain a high level of scientific sophistication within their field of study. All of these program require students to present results of their research at local on-campus venues, however, REU students benefit greatly from attending specialized meetings where they can meet national and international experts in their field. Moreover they directly benefit by working with their REU mentor in preparing a meeting presentation and, under their mentor's guidance, making connections at national-level conferences with other professionals. It is this \"at meeting\" networking, facilitated by the REU Mentor, that is often the key component to REU students meeting their future graduate advisor and/or employer. \r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed Student and Mentor-Student Travel Scholarship Program is to provide travel support for students and student-mentor teams who have completed research supported by the Diretorate of Biological Sciences and the Division of Ocean Sciences to attend a national-level meeting. This program builds on the results of a prior award that supported student travel scholarships to scientific conferences for 240 students. Results from previous travel scholarships showed significant learning gains for the students who received travel support. Moreover the travel scholarship program supported a significant number of underrepresented minority students and students from primarily undergraduate institutions. These scholarships enabled the students to attend scientific meetings and present their research, and improved their opportunities to meet future scientific advisors or mentors. This award will continue the successful student scholarships and includes a novel focus on supporting student-mentor teams with the goal of further enhancing the networking capacity for students who attend national meetings with their advisors.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Biological Sciences Research Experiences for Undergraduates Leadership Council (BIO-REU LC), supported, through this award, travel schoalrships for BIO REU students and faculty mentor-REU student teams to present their research at scientific meetings following the completion of their summer REU experience.  The program supported travel, registration, etc. of 113 undergraduate students and 36 faculty mentors from across the US who shared their research with scholars in their disciplines.  Through this experience students were deep engaged in a critical culminating experience - presenting their research to scholars in their field.  Scholarship awardees gained significant professional development experiences including networking.  Students supported by the program include over 35% undrerepresented minority students and 80% female students.  Participation in these meetings by diverse students ensures that diversity of the biological sciences is maintained and expanded and that scientific societies engage young scholars in the importance of communicating their research.  Assessment of student learning gains following the meeting showed that the expereince provided students with stronger connections to their disicpline and provided them the confidence and connections to remain in the sciences upon graduation.  The program supported students whose research was representative of the broad interdisciplinary nature of the biological sciences.  Moreover the scholarships engaged students from small primarily undergraduate institutions and community colleges who would otherwise not have access to participating in a major scientific meeting.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robyn E Hannigan"
