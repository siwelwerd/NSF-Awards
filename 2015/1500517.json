More information of the conference can be found at the website http://aip2015.fips.fi/. The NSF support from this award will allow a financial package for US students and postdocs to participate in the conference and the summer school, and will significantly enhance the ability to recruit an outstanding and diverse group of researchers to work  in the area of inverse problems.",
