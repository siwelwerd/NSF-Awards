 "awd_abstract_narration": "Metal matrix composites consist of at least two distinct materials where a continuous metallic material is combined with other materials.  Various types of materials, such as another metal, a ceramic, or an organic compound, typically in the form of particles and fibers, are added to the metallic material to change or improve the overall material properties.  Most of the manufacturing methods used for production of metal matrix composites, however, have limited capabilities in controlling these particles and fibers and typically result in a less than ideal distribution of them.  This EArly-Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) study is motivated by such limited capabilities in creating custom structures by existing manufacturing techniques for metal matrix composites. This award supports a novel concept of using an electromagnetic force to control the particles and fibers to create custom composite structures that can potentially enhance and tailor the performance.  The project will help strengthen US leadership in advanced manufacturing of composite materials and contribute to various application technologies that involve control and shielding of electromagnetic field such as telecommunications, radars, waveguide materials, antennas, medical devices, and magnetic storage materials.\r\n\r\nThe innovative concepts of Field-assisted Composite Manufacturing (FCM) allow construction of custom reinforcement architectures through: (i) a uniquely designed mask layer made of a magnetically shielding material that can manipulate electromagnetic field patterns in microscale resolution; and (ii) the layer-by-layer (bottom-up) manufacturing approach integrated with metallurgical processing (top-down) that can accomplish a fine control of the microstructure, while efficiently building large structures.  The research team will establish a fundamental basis for the FCM by performing experiments to evaluate the novel concept of mask patterning to arrange and orient nanoparticles/fibers on a substrate sheet to achieve a custom designed microstructure after consolidation, and by developing a multiphysics numerical model that can predict particle and fiber orientation under an electromagnetic field.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of this project was to advance metal matrix composite (MMC) manufacturing that is capable of producing custom microstructures through a novel Field-assisted Composite Manufacturing (FCM) using magnetic forces.  The followings are the outcomes.\n\n Intellectual Merits: \n \nThe project demonstrated that directly patterned magnetic fields could be used to control deposition of ferromagnetic nanoparticles.  The results showed a promising potential to control the deposition of nanoparticles with resolution of at least several micrometers.\nThe proposed magnetic field assisted method is capable of controlling the deposition of \"nonmagnetic\" nanoparticles when mixed with magnetic nanoparticles.  If successfully developed, its impact on various industrial applications involving manipulation of various nanoparticles would be significantly broadened.\nA numerical model was developed to predict magnetic flux densities formed from patterned magnetic source.  The model accurately captured flux densities within the protrusion as well as overall variation surrounding the setup.  The tool can be used to optimize the design of the magnetic pattern to achieve the desired nanoparticle pattern deposition.\nThe novelty and significance of the project are the following: (i) FCM overcomes limitations of existing metal composite manufacturing by enabling fabrication of composites with custom microstructures, i.e., local and gross control of reinforcing particle and/or fiber distribution, configuration, and orientation (for fiber), through the use of magnetic field and mushy state reaction synthesis; (ii) FCM will provide a platform to advance the current knowledge on metal matrix composite microstructure-property relations and lead to advanced composite designs involving multiscale, hierarchical architectures; and (iii) multiphysics modeling will establish a scientific basis for understanding the motions of the fibers and particulates in a liquid suspension and the mushy state of material, which can be applied to many other material processing techniques.\n \n\n Broader Impact:\n\nThe broader impact is the following: (i) Capability of FCM to custom design and create nano/micro-architectures is unmatched by any existing process and may revolutionize MMC design and manufacturing.  The platform will serve as a tool to advance composite design by providing a means to experimentally synthesize and verify fracture and failure theories that were only possible by computational methods.  (ii) The project will advance various technological application areas that involve control and shielding of electromagnetic field such as telecommunications, radars, waveguide materials, antennas, medical devices, magnetic storage materials, etc.  The FCM can expand to broad range of materials, which include ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, and diamagnetic materials. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yung C Shin"
