 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ecological sustainability depends critically on the ability of world food production to manage increasingly limited natural resources (such as arable land and water) with new techniques that both enhance environmental stewardship and increase farm productivity.  To make agriculture more productive and the productivity gains sustainable, growers are increasingly turning to environmental sensor measurement, data acquisition, and data analysis. To date, however, these tools have failed to achieve widespread use by smallholder agricultural concerns.  Importantly, individual growers and ranchers are underserved by many recent advances in the commercial and research sectors that make data analytics consumable as simple \"black box\" end-user products. Current decision support offerings for these constituencies are variously limited, proprietary, complex, costly, require that growers relinquish control over their data,  or are not widely available.  This project therefore investigates a comprehensive research, educational, and outreach program called SmartFarm, which couples new scientific research in computer science, agronomics, and precision agriculture with novel outreach and educational pathways that enable our youth and communities to transform and ensure agriculture sustainability. The research will bring new computing technologies to growers that are easy to use,  facilitate data privacy and control, and enable farm-focused, data-driven analysis and decision support that helps growers increase their yields sustainably.  In addition, the educational and outreach plans will introduce  technically adept youth, who are increasingly ecologically conscious, to the challenges and rewards associated with computer science and precision agricultural science so that they are adequately prepared and inspired to participate in the global challenge of increasing sustainable food production.\r\n\r\nTo address the problem of sustainable food security and food safety, this project investigates unifying cyberinfrastructure and agriculture analytics to enable precision, agronomics-driven farming by individual growers unlike what is available today.  The proposed system, called SmartFarm, integrates disparate environmental sensor technologies into a customized, open-source, cloud-based data appliance with new analytics that provide growers with a secure, easy to use, low-cost data analysis and decision support system.  Using open-source private cloud platforms, this data appliance can be hosted at a range of scales including personal, private clouds on-farm, large-scale public clouds, or in some combination of the two.  The research program will facilitate new knowledge in: (i) multi-analytic agricultural applications for farm control, dynamic decision support, and emergency response; (ii) self-managing, extensible private cloud systems; (iii) robust sensing and data acquisition techniques, application programming interfaces, and processing engines tailored to the needs of farmers and ranchers; and (iv) private and hybrid cloud software architectures for precision farming that are code and data compatible with public cloud industry standards.  The outreach and education efforts will expose students to cross-disciplinary research and educational activities that train them as new agronomists in new technologists in precision agricultural.",

The SmartFarm DAQ (data acquisition) hardware takes measurements from sensors using various protocols. The board also supports local data storage and wireless data transmission via different wireless communication modules. The SmartFarm DAQ software consists of two main parts &ndash; the DAQ firmware and the SmartFarm OS (operating system). The firmware controls sensor data collection, sleep scheduling, power management, over-the-air firmware updates. The SmartFarm OS is a Linux operating system that has a web-based user interface pre-installed to program the DAQ boards over-the-air, and it also can be used to show DAQ board status, sensor data, and alerts. The SmartFarm OS is hosted on an open-source base station. The base station was utilized to perform as a gateway for the public cloud-based decision support system or a private cloud hosting machine. The base station posts measurement data from the SmartFarm DAQ nodes to the cloud with user inputs, and wirelessly programs the board via the wireless network as needed. A website was created on the base station, and it allows users to easily update the SmartFarm DAQ board from the site, and monitor sensor status and data. The project also developed an autonomous, four-wheel independent driving robotic platform which was used as a data collection platform to collect various agricultural data using the SmartFarm DAQ system. The data can be streamed to the SmartFarm base station for further data analysis and decision making or it can be analyzed right on the robot for real-time decision making.Seven undergraduate students and two graduate students directly worked on this project, and more than fifty students involved in the project to some extent. The SmartFarm project has provided students with senior projects as well as graduate thesis research and experience with precision agriculture, data acquisition systems, IoT development, web server development, embedded systems development, open-source technologies, and wireless sensor network technologies. The project provided cross-disciplinary research and educational activities which trained them as new agronomists in new technologists in precision agriculture. Research of their respective SmartFarm projects was presented to UCSB and Fresno State at the collaborative meetings, where the students and faculty were able to engage in students' work and contribute to the SmartFarm project. The students have had the opportunity to attend different events, presented their findings and ideas, and gained exposure to industry trends and insights as well as networking opportunities in precision agriculture, irrigation technologies, unmanned aerial systems for farming, and soil measuring technologies. For example, students were also able to present their work at the 2017,2018, 2019 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) CA-NV section meetings. Some students presented their papers and posters at 2018, 2019 ASABE International meetings. The ASABE meetings included the opportunities for students to network with industry professionals as well as fellow undergraduate, graduate and doctorate students. Students were also encouraged to present their SmartFarm project work on the Cal Poly campus to peers, college sponsors, and donors.Through the outreach and education efforts, the project has exposed the developed technologies to more than one thousand farmers and growers via different events, such as World Ag Expo, international and regional ASABE conferences, university events, and field days.
