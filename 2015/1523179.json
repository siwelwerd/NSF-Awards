ACM CCS is the flagship event of the ACM Special Interest Group of Security, Audit and Control (SIGSAC). Its acceptance rate is around 15-20%, which makes it a highly selective conference.\r\n\r\nThis grant provides support for 32 students to attend ACM CCS and associated workshops. Preference will be given to undergraduate students participating in the poster session, and students with papers in the conference or associated workshops who do not have other sources of support. Participation by women and underrepresented groups will also be encouraged.",
