 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to understand expert secondary mathematics teachers' knowledge for teaching exponential functions. In particular, the study examines how mathematics knowledge for teaching is used by teachers as they are teaching students' and the factors that influence their interactions with students. The project is recruiting teachers in order to observe their teaching of exponential functions units in Algebra II, Pre-Calculus, and College Algebra courses in high schools. They will conduct classroom observations throughout the teaching of the unit and conduct interviews with the teachers before and after each unit. The project builds on other frameworks for understanding mathematics knowledge for teaching. Other studies have focused more frequently on elementary or middle school teachers. The contribution of this work is to understand the mathematics content teachers are using in high school in their work with students. Exponential functions are a common topic in the three high school courses and a foundational topic for students' learning of algebra and calculus. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.\r\n\r\nThe research questions for the study focus on the decisions expert teachers draw on while making decisions related to teaching exponential functions, the mathematics knowledge for teaching they use to make decision, and the factors that influence the quality of those decisions and students' opportunity to reason mathematically. They are recruiting expert teachers who have taught the courses for at least two years and are recognized as high quality teachers. The data collected include video data from classroom observations and pre-observation and post-observation interviews. The questions to be asked in interviews focus on teachers' decision-making and will probe for their mathematics knowledge for teaching. Mathematics knowledge for teaching includes how teachers' knowledge that supports their planning, instruction, and assessment of students' mathematical reasoning. The study also provides a research methodology that could be used to study mathematics knowledge for teaching in other secondary mathematics topics.",
