 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program in the Division of  Chemistry is funding Professor Petra Reinke at the University of Virginia to develop novel, ultrasmall catalyst particles that consist of carbon (carbides) chemically bound to a metal. These particles, with diameters of less then a few billionths of a meter, havea wide range of potential applications, from catalysis, where carbide-based particles can substitute for expensive noble metals, to molecular electronics. The project addresses two challenges, which are critical bottlenecks for the use of carbide-based nanoparticles: First, the synthesis of stable carbide-based nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution, which can be adapted to maximize performance, and second, understanding the impact of geometric and electronic structure on chemical reactivity. Outreach activities, and the development of a web-based, student-designed nanotechnology resources are integrated with the research program. \r\n\r\nNanoparticle curvature, as a control parameter for molecule adsorption geometry, has the potential to function as a powerful tool in driving bottom-up assembly. The present proposal targets the size regime where molecule size becomes comparable to the diameter of a metallic or semiconducting nanoparticle on which it is adsorbed. The proposed work targets two areas, first, the synthesis of stable ultra-small nanoparticles (nanospheres) as model systems, and, second, the study of molecule adsorption. The nanospheres are formed by a solid-state reaction between fullerenes, which serve as the carbon scaffold, and a metal substrate. The mechanism of nanosphere formation will be studied to control composition, bonding and surface structure. The mechanisms of nanosphere synthesis, and the adsorption of coronene on these nanospheres will be studied mainly with scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy. Synchrotron-based photoelectron spectroscopy will be applied to elucidate bonding, and adsorption-induced changes in the molecule. The experimental work will be integrated with (i) statistical image analysis, (ii) simulation of tip convolution for curved surfaces, and (iii) simulation of metal-molecule interaction and nanosphere formation with DFT (density functional methods).",

Most of our attention has been given to the conversion of relatively small molecules such as ammonia, or methanol where the catalyst particles are large compared to the reactants and surface processes can be often be understood by considering isolated reaction sites. In contrast, many processes which deal with complex hydrocarbons and large aromatic molecules add to complexity through the comparable size of catalyst and molecule. Our work asked a deceptively simple question: what is the role of geometry, and electronic structure in the case of large molecule adsorption and reaction; how much do steric effects influence the molecule adsorption? We studied the adsorption of aromatic hydrocarbons (pentacene, coronene) on surfaces with controlled corrugation, and electronic structure created by the metallization of fullerene molecules on W(100), and Mo(100) surfaces.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit:</p>\n<p>The complex problem posed by the experimental study of molecule adsorption on corrugated surface was pursued using established surface science tools such as Scanning Tunneling Microscopy, and Spectroscopy, which offers atomic resolution of topography and electronic structure, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. We established the control of local electronic structure through fullerene molecule metallization (incorporation of metal atoms in the fullerene carbon cage forming nanospheres) which is achieved by annealing. This works exceptionally well for C<sub>60 </sub>on W surfaces, where the surface corrugation follows the molecule shape even after metallization. On Mo surfaces C<sub>60</sub> will disintegrate before metallization, which at the same time is a path of relevance to organic solar cell degradation. Model experiments for coronene and pentacene use variable electronic structure, but flat surfaces, including Au(111) as a metallic model surface, and WS<sub>2</sub>, as a semiconductor surface. The complexity of molecule-surface interactions is often surprising and was evident for coronene on Au(111) where small molecule tilts were uncovered using new approaches to image analysis. The complexity is only increased when coronene and pentacene molecules are adsorbed on a nanosphere surface: no single, unique adsorption geometry dominates, but molecules tend to agglomerate in depressions or conform to the nanosphere curvatures. It is likely that defects embedded in the nanospheres are more important than both, the nanoscale topography, and the specific electronic structure. Overall this project illustrated the power of new methods for image analysis, which can ascertain even subtle variations in molecule organization, and quantify modulations in electronic structure. However, the systematic analysis of corrugated surfaces remains challenging and cannot be expressed well by a single parameter such as mean roughness. The behavior of highly corrugated surfaces, or aggregated catalyst particles with respect to large molecules tends to be controlled unique sites such as crevice sites, or defects - molecules will tend to seek out these sites, which will control performance, and steric effects might become dominant. &nbsp;The localized view of a single, well defined atomic adsorption site has to be discarded.</p>\n<p>Broader Impact:</p>\n<p>Training and professional development: This project supported several graduate student throughout the lifetime of the award, and student achievements are demonstrated via their post-graduation employment as CTO of a start-up company, and research scientist at Northwestern University.
