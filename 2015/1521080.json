 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum entanglement, a quantum mechanical phenomenon that quantifies the interdependence of spatially separated parts of a system, has become a fundamental concept in physics with broad applications, ranging from quantum information, to quantum metrology, to the classification and understanding of condensed matter systems.  A vital part of this project, which is to develop new methods to investigate the dynamics of entanglement, is to establish a close connection between the theoretical effort and experimental realizations of long-range interacting systems with a particular emphasis on arrays of trapped ions in self-assembled crystals. In these systems it is possible to engineer long-range interactions that depend on the internal states of the ions (spin) by adjusting the frequency of laser beams that illuminate the ions and impart a spin dependent force. The scope of the research effort can be placed in the context of \"quantum simulation\": experiments will be conducted to simulate models whose dynamics is difficult to access by existing numerical methods, and approximate methods capable of reproducing the observed dynamics will then be developed. This work will lead to a more fundamental understanding of spin dynamics and entanglement in complex quantum systems, and will contribute towards the realization of new classes of quantum materials and technologies. Moreover, it will train and provide research experience to a graduate student and a postdoc. They will have the opportunity to work with the NIST/Boulder experimental ion trap group, in addition to the theory groups at JILA and the University of Colorado at Boulder and thus will be exposed to a highly collaborative atmosphere. \r\n\r\nThe overall goal of this project is to develop new methods capable to describe the dynamics of entanglement in systems made of many particles with two internal degrees of freedom (spin), that interact and crosstalk at long distances. The investigators will allow the possibility that the spin system also exchanges energy and information with an external reservoir (open system). The intellectual focus of the research will be divided in three main thrusts: (i) Hamiltonian dynamics, (ii) Dissipative dynamics with single particle decoherence and (iii) Driven-dissipative dynamics with more complex many-body decoherence. Thrust (i) plans to investigate the development of entanglement and correlations in spin 1/2 XXZ models with arbitrary coupling constants after a quench, starting with easily preparable and high fidelity product states. Thrust (ii) will delve on the interplay between local Markovian decoherence and many-body interactions in these systems. Thrust (iii) will study the interplay between elastic interactions and collective dissipative couplings, in the presence of external driving sources. These are challenging goals but the synergy of interests and abilities of the investigators -- with expertise that spans the different but complementary areas of quantum optics, condensed matter, and theoretical and experimental atomic physics-- will allow the group to delve into a broad range of problems, which would be difficult or unfeasible for a single investigator program.",
