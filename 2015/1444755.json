 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract SES-1444755\r\n\r\n\r\nUrban areas are vulnerable to extreme weather related events given their location, high concentration of people, and increasingly complex and interdependent infrastructure. Impacts of Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, and other disasters demonstrate not just failures in built infrastructure, they highlight the inadequacy of institutions, resources, and information systems to prepare for and respond to events of this magnitude. The highly interdisciplinary and geographically dispersed Urban Resilience to Extremes Sustainability Research Network (UREx SRN) team will develop a diverse suite of new methods and tools to assess how infrastructure can be more resilient, provide ecosystem services, improve social well being, and exploit new technologies in ways that benefit all segments of urban populations. Starting with nine network cities (six continental U.S. and three Latin American, home to over 35 million residents) and expanding in future years, the vision of the UREx SRN is to co-produce the knowledge needed to promote resilient, livable cities in a future that will look very different from today. The extreme events that this project will focus on include urban flooding, coastal storms, regional droughts, and extreme heat waves. These events are already occurring with shocking frequency in U.S. and global cities. Infrastructure is viewed as an important line of defense against hazards and disasters, yet current urban infrastructure is aging and proving inadequate for protecting city populations. The UREx team will link SRN scientists, students, local practitioners, planners, industry, NGOs, and other stakeholders across >25 institutions and >70 collaborators to co-produce data, models, images, stories, and on-the-ground projects that show how a new resilient infrastructure can be developed. Infrastructure that is flexible, adaptable, safe-to-fail, socially equitable, and ecologically based will enhance urban resilience in the face of a higher incidence of extreme events, more culturally diverse communities, and continued urbanization pressures. Ultimately, the UREx SRN will help accelerate knowledge generation and application to encourage innovative strategies towards urban sustainability. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Urban Resilience to Extremes Sustainability Research Network (UREx SRN) will develop a novel theoretical framework for integrating social, ecological, and technological system (SETS) dimensions for conceptualizing, analyzing, and supporting urban infrastructure decisions in the face of climatic uncertainty in a more holistic way. The primary research question is: how do SETS domains interact to generate vulnerability or resilience to extreme weather related events, and how can urban SETS dynamics be guided along more resilient, equitable, and sustainable trajectories? The foundation of the network is eight working groups (WG) who will work together to answer this question. Network activities include: assembling comparable datasets for the cities; doing advanced climate and hydrological modeling and downscaling; conducting comparative analyses; further developing the SETS conceptual framework; experimenting with new visualization and computation approaches for representing the data and the SETS framework; using these products in participatory modeling and scenario analysis for each city; and developing the science and practice for transitioning infrastructure to meet 21st century resilience and sustainability goals. Continual network and educational evaluation will allow realignment and adjustment of the work based on iterative assessments. The program will develop a suite of interactive educational activities spanning institutions across the network, and including local practitioners as well as university students and young professionals. Working Groups include integral educational, communications, and diversity-enhancing activities for graduate and post-doctoral fellows, early-career researchers, and city professionals aimed at developing a model for co-producing effective and robust decision-support tools and educating the next generation of scientists and practitioners to carry out this work. These programs are expected to be especially attractive to Hispanic students and practitioners due to the project's focus on understanding the increasing cultural and intellectual connections of the U.S. and Latin America.\r\n\r\nThe strategic goals of the UREx SRN are to:\r\n1)Build a network of cities, institutions, and student, post-doctoral, and faculty researchers to explore resilience of cities to extreme weather related events;\r\n2)Develop novel theoretical frameworks that express a vision of sustainable, integrated urban infrastructure that is flexible, adaptable, safe-to-fail, socially equitable, and ecologically based;\r\n3)Work with practitioners and decision makers, as well as a cadre of graduate and post-doctoral fellows, to co-produce knowledge that facilitates data-driven visioning and ultimately transitions to a sustainable future for urban infrastructure and, by extension, the fabric of urban social-ecological-technological sustainability; and \r\n4)Create a model for incorporating assessment, learning, and adjustment in response to evaluative feedback in a large, transdisciplinary, multi-institutional, multi-national research network.",

The objective of the research was to learn how cities can develop infrastructure that is resilient in the face of expected increases in frequency and magnitude of extreme weather-related events but also provides ecosystem services, improves social well-being, and exploits new technologies to benefit all segments of urban populations. Co-production, a process of knowledge creation via collaboration among disciplines and with stakeholders outside academia, was a core activity involving researcher and practitioner teams in each city. Engagement with stakeholders improves science because researchers learn what challenges practitioners face and how they deal with them. The UREx SRN developed and promoted the social-ecological-technological systems (SETS) approach, which recognizes urban infrastructure as systems of social, ecological, and technological elements and their interrelationships. Through the creative co-production of more than fifty scenarios (future visions and pathways) across network cities, concern for equity and strategies using green (and hybrid) infrastructure and safe-to-fail concepts were emphasized. International collaboration allowed comparison of scenario visions across diverse contexts, showing that resilience to extreme events takes different forms depending on climate, governance, and social-cultural factors. The network grew in size, complexity, and connectedness (Fig. 1), leading to new projects, collaborations, and actions on the ground. A strong practitioner network and a network of early-career scholars developed within the broader UREx SRN. In total, 23 postdoctoral scholars, over 80 graduate students, and 43 undergraduate students, including 28 REUs, participated in the network.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Intellectual Merit:</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The SETS framing for urban infrastructure resilience has been adopted widely, appearing in numerous articles and forming the foundation for at least two new grants (SETS Convergence and NATURA; Fig. 2).

These scenarios represent positive visions of the future co-produced in workshops that are built upon urban planning documents and other preliminary workshops in each city. Differences among scenarios are evident based on place (local culture, climate, types of extreme events), but they also share some similarities; for example, in each city, at least one scenario centered on distributional, representational, or recognitional </span><span>equity.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Research across the cities</span><span> featured opportunities for comparison and knowledge exchange.

Even more importantly, this comprehensive, epistemologically diverse framework has been used to promote action; e.g., a Manifesto produced by local NGOs for the city of San Juan (PR).\nThe UREx SRN co-produced 54 scenarios of urban sustainability, resilience, and equity with practitioners from the cities of New York, San Juan (PR), Valdivia (Chile), Baltimore, Phoenix, Hermosillo (Mexico), Syracuse, Portland (OR), and Miami. These scenarios represent positive visions of the future co-produced in workshops that are built upon urban planning documents and other preliminary workshops in each city. Differences among scenarios are evident based on place (local culture, climate, types of extreme events), but they also share some similarities; for example, in each city, at least one scenario centered on distributional, representational, or recognitional equity.\nResearch across the cities featured opportunities for comparison and knowledge exchange. For example, several cities used the same methods to explore impacts of and strategies for dealing with extreme heat: NYC (2017), Hermosillo (2017), San Juan (2019), Portland, and Baltimore. Research on heat in Phoenix led to development of Heat Action Plans by local communities and the Healthy Urban Environments (HUE) Initiative funded by Maricopa County. Indeed, the value of the network is evident in the numerous projects that have been funded at both local and national levels (Fig. 2) to carry on the work begun in the UREx SRN. The inclusion of Latin American cities has energized new collaborations, emerging networks (for example, through NATURA), and student research experiences (RULA IRES).\nBroader Impacts:\nThe UREx SRN developed numerous outreach products in addition to traditional academic publications (seven books, 25 book chapters, &gt;200 journal articles). Graduate students completed 23 theses and dissertations based on UREx SRN work, including research in Latin American cities. One outcome of the San Juan work was a story map illustrating each of the scenarios as well as the benefits of green infrastructure. The Future Cities Podcast is an award-winning podcast that was created and run entirely by UREx graduate fellows, and is still producing podcasts on a monthly basis.\nCommunication of project outcomes to the practitioner network and their communities was an important motivation. Each city received a scenarios report, but also a guide to scenarios and numerous one-page fact sheets (for example, \"What is SETS?\"). Partially supported by UREx, Innovation Dialogues and Labs were held in San Juan, Baltimore, and Miami to co-create data visualization platforms on coastal resilience accessible to local communities.\nTraining, mentorship, and program evaluation were integrated into the project. Best practices documents for mentoring, collaboration and inclusion, authorship, and data management were developed by network participants. Equity and science communication trainings and a science policy course in Washington, DC were offered. A virtual Early-Career Symposium (Fig. 3) was held (2020-2022). Nearly 20 reports evaluating the educational program indicated a high degree of satisfaction among graduate and postdoctoral fellows. REU fellows were distributed among institutions but participated in a series of Zoom meetings throughout the summer.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nancy B Grimm"
