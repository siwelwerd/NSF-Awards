 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is an established need in the United States to increase the number of American scientists in the workforce.  This NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project will improve the completion rates for math, computer science, biology, chemistry, physics, engineering and earth science transfer students from Southwestern Illinois College.  Approximately, 50 scholars will participate in a two-year project that includes (a) targeted recruitment, (b) intensive mentoring and advising, (c) specialized cohort building activities and (d) exposure to career and transfer opportunities.  As a new model for thorough, results-driven student support and mentoring the project will act as a template for future retention projects throughout the institution.\r\n\r\nThe approach for this project, which is grounded in relevant theory and research, recognizes that multiple factors contribute to low STEM enrollment and completion rates among financially needy students.  These factors will be addressed through a curriculum that focuses on self-efficacy in STEM, identification with and opinion of STEM fields, and development of metacognitive skills in STEM subjects as well as structure academic and social supports.  The program will be evaluated by an education researcher using a logic model that captures the program's theory of change, outputs and activities, midterm outcomes, and long term outcomes.  Formative evaluation will address student progress, use of support services, and satisfaction (journaling).  Student attitudes will also be assessed using a standardized instrument (STEM-CIS).  Summative evaluation will be performed using a logic model (inputs, outputs, mid-term outcomes, and end outcomes).  Internal dissemination of the results of evaluation will be done through the institution's annual newsletter.  Results will also be reported at meeting of the National Science Teachers Association and eventually submitted to the Journal of College Science Teaching.",
