 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project intends to expand and mature the extramural STEM program Cyber Adventurers through collaboration between the California Polytechnic State University, California State University Monterey Bay, Hartnell Community College and the Lyceum of Monterey. The project seeks to include Cybersecurity topics appropriate for its target audiences: middle school, high school, and undergraduates early in their career. The project seeks novel ways to bring Cybersecurity topics into existing curricula at the K-12 and undergraduate levels to address the widening gap between the supply and demand for qualified Cybersecurity professionals. The developed Cybersecurity lessons will be accessible to a broad audience and synergize with existing programs in formal and informal education contexts. This intervention will inform students early in their education about careers in Cybersecurity; help to understand the value of digital assets and related Cybersecurity issues; create activities to engage students in Cybersecurity lessons typically reserved for advanced computer science majors; and present Cybersecurity as an interdisciplinary concern relevant to a variety of STEM fields. The Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program funds proposals that address Cybersecurity from a Trustworthy Computing Systems perspective; a Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences perspective; and proposals focusing entirely on Cybersecurity Education.\r\n\r\nThe project will design activities that synergize with existing K-12 STEM programs. It will increase interest in those existing programs, diversify those programs, engage new audiences, and educate that Cybersecurity is relevant across a variety of STEM fields. The collaboration network of two K-12 schools and three post-secondary schools will unite interested practitioners and researchers, and will facilitate community building among STEM stakeholders in the Central Coast region of California. The dissemination strategy has the potential to impact and inform other projects at the national level.",
