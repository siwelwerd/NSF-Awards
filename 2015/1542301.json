 "awd_abstract_narration": "This funding establishes a new Research Experience for Teachers (RET) Site at the University of Pennsylvania. The primary objective of this RET site is to involve middle school teachers in the School District of Philadelphia in summer research experiences that emphasize robotics.  The teachers will spend six weeks in the summer participating in research experiences and developing classroom modules and materials which will be implemented in their classrooms during the academic year. The project is led by the General Robotics, Automation, Sensing, and Perception (GRASP) Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania.  The GRASP Lab is known not only as a leader in robotics research but also for its significant outreach and impact on K-12 education.  The RET Site project involves a partnership between the university, the school district, the Mayor's Office of Education, and industrial associates.  The teachers will continue to receive classroom support for related activities in their classrooms during the academic year including establishing FIRST LEGO League clubs in the schools. This RET Site project will develop a community of teachers who are passionate about robotics and who can translate this excitement to their students through engaging, high-quality inquiry learning experiences.  \r\n\r\nThe project is anchored by a research area this is compelling and exciting for teachers and middle school students and by a faculty team that has demonstrated expertise in both research and education.  The goals of the project are to: provide a quality research experience for middle school teachers in the field of robotics and automation; increase understanding of science and robotics; increase teachers' abilities to apply scientific and engineering methods to problems; increase the opportunities in underserved Philadelphia schools to prepare students for the engineering and scientific workforce; and develop teachers into STEM leaders.  The site features projects that are teacher accessible as well as connected to current research and practice.  The RET site includes sound evaluation and dissemination plans that will provide models for integrating robotics concepts into the middle school curricula.   Teachers will develop and hone their research, communication, and presentation skills, all of which are essential to their professional growth and success. The project will build the technical capacity of teachers so they are capable of developing and implementing new, exciting robotics learning activities at their schools. The project team will disseminate the project materials through the TeachEngineering digital library and a GRASP's engagement web site that will be shared with a wider audience of teachers at annual workshops and conferences.",

Teachers created research posters and presented findings at the RET Symposium each year. They were paid an $8,000 stipend and $2,000 in self-selected classroom materials for participation in the program, but participation in the study was voluntary.</p>\n<p>A major outcome of this RET is our forthcoming paper, on track for submission to an archival (peer reviewed) journal in early summer 2019. This paper first surveys the teacher professional development literature to inform a categorization of the variabilities in RET program design and outcome. Applying that theoretical background to a systematic selection of the prior literature leads to a taxonomy with four major trunks of design and a slight recasting of a previously developed framework for judging RET outcomes. We document the huge variability in past RET programs by populating almost every dimension of the taxonomy with examples from the literature that exhibit substantial differences in focus or intensity of treatment, corroborating our contention that there is substantial opportunity for more rational design of RET programs. We then take the opportunity to review within our newly generated taxonomic framework the particular program forming the subject of this report, designed and implemented under the support of this grant. We use that analysis to propose a theory of action for RET programs that we believe can form the basis for much sharper future efforts to develop an empirically founded rational framework for RET design.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Analysis of the past literature reveals that our RET design was unusual in placing an emphasis on aspects of the research process teachers undertake that is at least as intense as their exposure to subject matter content.&nbsp; Mixed methods analysis of our outcomes demonstrates that our RET elicited substantial gains not only in teachers' subject matter knowledge but in their self-efficacy regarding rigor as well as their motivation and capacity to shift their teaching practice toward a more inquiry based and rigorous student experience.

Specifically, we propose that our RET design triggered a critical cognitive process, forging the \"aha\" moment, wherein teachers derive meaning from their rigorous, authentic science experience and alter their conceptual understanding of their subject matter, thereby shifting their pedagogy. Explicit presentation -authentic engagement in a structured research process - conveyed the nature of science, pushing teachers to view their students as \"capable beings,\" to devalue mere content, to choose more difficult modalities of teaching, increasing the student-centered inquiry-based practices in their classrooms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We believe that our study offers the first proposed theory of action in the RET literature which should be subject to further rigorous empirical study. However, the taxonomy developed in our study also underscores how unusually costly in mentors time our design is relative to prevailing practice. Engaged with our the 27 middle school (grade 6-8) math and science teachers from 15 Philadelphia public-schools were 22 PhD students, 7 faculty, 5 master's students from the University of Pennsylvania involved over the 3 years, with additional mentors from industry. These high program costs add substantial urgency to addressing the causative components in the design-outcome relation. Distinct outcomes can be readily measured, but it seems less clear how to distinguish (much less ascribe pedagogical value to) their appearance in synergy as our study suggests. We believe that the taxonomy emerging from our study can be of further help in guiding a more careful future review of the scientific literature on human learning capable of credibly informing some very few design combinations that are likely to be fruitful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In our three years of inspiring work with a talented, hard-working, intelligent pool of urban public school district educators, we have come to appreciate the inherent value of a challenging research experience that respects the capabilities of those individuals and their enduring and enthusiastic interest in improving their practice. Our results show that this approach, while certainly frustrating and resource draining, paid dividends for participants and their instruction. For, in turn, teachers wishing to enact similar rigorous, learner-centered, inquiry-based experiences face the same levels of frustration and resource taxing. Quality, meaningful learning is hard work for all involved - learner and teacher both. Provided the taxonomic structure and theory of action we have developed herein, we encourage a closer look at professional development programs that aim to develop teachers' conceptions of math and
