 "awd_abstract_narration": "Although vehicle-to-vehicle communications is often seen as a means of preventing accidents and improving safety, the resulting vehicular networks may also prove to be a new and cost-effective way to provide Internet access.  This requires access to spectrum.  Policymakers around the world face difficult questions regarding spectrum access for vehicular networks, including how much spectrum should be available for non-safety uses of vehicular networks such as providing Internet access, whether vehicular networks should share spectrum with other kinds of applications, and if so, what forms of spectrum-sharing are most appropriate.  This project lays the groundwork for research that will inform these important spectrum policy decisions. \r\n\r\nResearchers in this project gather empirical data from an actual vehicular network deployment consisting of over 900 vehicles that are equipped with Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) devices, and use that data to construct models of vehicular networks.  This includes data on vehicle movement, signal strength and propagation, the Internet traffic generated and received by actual users, and resulting traffic flows.  This data forms the basis of a packet-level simulation constructed using open source NS software. Subsequent research projects will use those models to quantify both the cost and the benefit of various spectrum policies, including sharing-among-equals as occurs in typical unlicensed spectrum bands, and multi-tier spectrum-sharing as has been proposed for the 3.5 GHz band in the United States.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThere has been growing interest in connected vehicles, i.e. wireless communications systems that enable communications with automobiles.  In 2016, the U.S. Department of Transportation even proposed mandating a particular connected vehicle technology known as Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) in all new cars, primarily to support safety applications.  While others have been focusing on safety aspects, this project investigates connected vehicle systems using wireless mesh networks as a means of providing Internet access to mobile devices.\n\n \n\nWe find that these wireless mesh networks can be a more cost-effective way of providing Internet access than typical cellular systems in some scenarios.  Internet traffic can be offloaded to vehicular mesh networks where possible, and mobile devices can fall back to macrocells where necessary.  If the Department of Transportation were to adopt DSRC as proposed in 2016, then DSRC-based vehicular mesh network would be cost-effective in the most densely-populated cities such as New York, Boston and San Francisco within just a few years.  Over time, the approach would become cost-effective in regions that are less densely populated, although this approach for Internet access will probably never be of great value in sparsely-populated rural areas. \n\n \n\nTo enhance road safety, local and state governments are expected to spend billions of dollars deploying roadside infrastructure for connected vehicles.  If those government agencies entered into some form of public-private partnership with commercial Internet service providers to deploy infrastructure for both safety and Internet access, then costs could be shared.  In this research, we analyzed different cost-sharing strategies and terms, and estimate the impact of these strategies on government savings, reduction in the cost of providing Internet service, and overall social welfare.  Under the rules proposed in 2016, we estimate that governments could save about one fifth to one fourth of the total cost to deploy safety infrastructure nationwide in the U.S., if cost-sharing terms are set to maximize government savings.
