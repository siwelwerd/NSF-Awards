 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the 17th International Conference on Random Structures and Algorithms held at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, July 27 - 31, 2015.  Random Structures and Algorithms is a biennial meeting, initiated in 1983 at Adam Mickiewicz University, in Poznan, Poland.  The aims of these conferences are to present recent research results and to identify and explore directions for further research in random discrete structures, randomized algorithms, and broad areas of applications of probabilistic methods in discrete mathematics, computer science, and related fields.  For more information see the conference website: http://rsa2015.amu.edu.pl/\r\n\r\nRandomness continues to play a fundamental role in demonstrating the existence of combinatorial structures with desired (optimal) properties as well as in the design of practical and efficient algorithms for problems in combinatorial optimization and computing. The Random Structures and Algorithms conference is established as a key locus for the exposition of trends and breakthroughs in the development of probabilistic methods and their application in discrete mathematics and computer science.  The choice of the plenary speakers at the conference  highlights important themes ranging from classical topics such as Ramsey theory, cryptography, phase transitions in random graphs, and combinatorial designs, which have seen recent exciting progress, to modern topics including hypergraph container theorems, cloud computing, hardness of approximation for optimization problems, and algorithms in high dimensional computing and social networks.",
