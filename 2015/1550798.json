The current states of the technological/industrial research on heat/mass exchangers and the associated challenges and limitations in developing next-generation heat exchangers were identified and discussed, in addition to the different technological sectors related to the heat/mass exchangers, such as additive manufacturing, material science, advanced materials, etc. This valuable exchange of experience and knowledge lead the attending researchers, program managers, and application engineers to integrate a clear view of the impact of the most recent research and development efforts, and in turn, allowed to coordinate work and establish a critical path for technology development. Future work was defined by critical recommendations to enhance and develop technologies, materials and standards and to emphasize the path forward and further developments. The development should start with the design methods of the heat exchangers. The technology of Exhaust Heat Recovery Heat Exchangers need to be focused on. Developments should also include the fitting and joining technologies, while improving the joining time and lowering the costs. Critical roles were also highlighted by the workshop, such as the role of design, materials, and manufacturing technologies in reducing the refrigerant charge requirements, and therefore it was concluded that realizing the new refrigerants being developed are projected to be very expensive. It was also described that the transformative technologies are not enough for the development of the heat transfer domain, unless guided by innovative solutions and realistic and ambitious goals. One of the most important outcomes of the workshop is defining the cross-disciplinary approach (a combination of innovative heat/mass transfer designs, materials, and manufacturing technologies coupled with component and system level optimization tools) that should be followed to enhance and manufacture next generation heat exchangers. The workshop outcomes entailed the technological sectors related to the heat/mass exchanger research, for this it was emphasized that the focus on additive manufacturing research is a new way to achieve innovative enhancements in heat/mass transfer domain and to overcome the current limitations and challenges. Development of additive manufacturing should include the standards also, as they will facilitate adoption of additive manufacturing technology around the word. Human resources of involve in additive manufacturing should be increased, for this more students should be educated about additive manufacturing and more engineers should be involved in this revolutionary technology. The field of additive manufacturing is fast evolving and close interaction with the experts in the field will facilitate tracking progress of significance to real world applications. The role of material science, material selection/enhancement, and material science computational/experimental detection methods was also highlighted in this workshop which allows for future work to focus on them as to acheive critical developments.
