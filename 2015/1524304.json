 "awd_abstract_narration": "Slab breakoff, in which a slab detaches from a subducting plate and sinks into the mantle, exerts a first-order control on the geodynamic evolution of collisional orogenic belts because breakoff fundamentally alters the forces along the convergent margin. Modeling indicates that observable characteristics of breakoff within a collisional orogen include subduction of an ocean basin before collision, a transient pulse of accelerated rock and surface uplift in the belt, a decrease in convergence rate over the breakoff and an increase above adjacent parts of the slab that remain attached. However, geologic observations of this process within continental collision zones are not well documented. This University of California Davis and University of Michigan research team, in collaboration with their international partners, in explores the idea that the recent geological history of the Greater Caucasus (between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea) is a consequence of this process. The project will advance desired societal outcomes by: (1) development of a globally competitive STEM workforce through the training of several U.S. graduate students, involvement of undergraduate students in research, and training of graduate students from Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan; (2) increased partnerships between academia and the hydrocarbon industry and strengthening of existing collaborations and the development of new collaborations with scientists in Armenia and Georgia, Taiwan, and Canada. The project would provide the graduate students with rich international research experiences. The project is supported by the Tectonics Program and NSF's International Science and Engineering program.\r\n\r\nThis research project will test the hypothesis that the Greater Caucasus reflects the transient geodynamic response to recent slab breakoff beneath the western portion of the range. This event follows the Oligocene to Pliocene closure of a remnant ocean basin, subduction of which presently continues beneath the eastern half of the range. The research team will carry out a field investigation of this little-studied orogen using structural mapping and balanced cross-sections, sediment provenance studies using U-Pb analyses of detrital zircons and (U-Th)/He analyses of apatite, bedrock low-temperature thermochronometry, and neotectonic investigations. They aim to constrain the magnitude of Cenozoic shortening across the Greater Caucasus along three orogen-perpendicular sections, and to derive the exhumation history of the Greater and Lesser Caucasus from low-temperature thermochronometry. Integration of these data with detrital provenance and lag time analyses of adjacent sedimentary basins will capture the geologic response to a transient geodynamic event and record perhaps the first evidence for slab detachment at the subduction-to-collision transition in an active orogen.",

In the eastern Greater Caucasus of Azerbaijan, the mountain range is constructed by the deformation of the continental crust of the southern edge of Asia. This deformation is caused by an oceanic plate colliding with, and being shoved under, the southern margin of Asia (subduction). In the western Greater Caucasus, in Georgia, the oceanic plate has been completely consumed, and the Greater Caucasus mountains are constructed by deformation driven by the collision of two continents, Asia and Arabia (continental collision). The transition from subduction to continental collision is an expected part of the plate tectonic cycle and must have occurred during mountain building episodes throughout geologic time. &nbsp;However, the transient nature of this transition means that there are only fleeting opportunities to study this process. Our research group used tools including geologic mapping, absolute-age dating, and mineral cooling age data to understand the rates of mountain building in the Greater Caucasus, the timescale over which subduction transitions to collision, and the spatial patterns of deformation within the Greater Caucasus. We find that the transition occurs geologically rapidly (over a few million years), that deformation is concentrated at the interface between the oceanic and continental plates, and that the rate of mountain building has been rapid over the past 5-7 million years.</p>\n<p>Complementary work, with similar approaches, was undertaken in the Lesser Caucasus Mountains of Armenia. In contrast to our observations from the Greater Caucasus, the Lesser Caucasus are largely tectonically quiescent in the present-day. Deformation in the Lesser Caucasus is primarily associated with the Pembak-Sevan strike-slip fault, with little evidence of active mountain building processes taking place away from this fault.&nbsp; In combination with our work in the Greater Caucasus, we observe that in the subduction-dominated segment of the Greater Caucasus, deformation is concentrated in a narrow band along the southern margin of the Greater Caucasus. Our results can be applied to understanding the evolution of ancient mountain belts and inform the earthquake hazards assessment for Azerbaijan and Armenia, which historically have experienced catastrophic damage from earthquakes.</p>\n<p>As part of this research project, we developed software to analyze the distribution of mineral grain ages in sedimentary strata, to discriminate provenance (source area from which sediment is derived).
