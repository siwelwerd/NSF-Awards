This workshop will bring together strategic and knowledgeable experts from academia, government agencies, and industry, including the semiconductor and other information technology companies. The workshop will include overview presentations and roundtable discussions directed toward comprehending the barriers and approaches to enabling a future IT revolution. Participants will be asked to identify Grand Challenges and key scientific challenges related to nanoelectronic devices and future IT systems. By carefully assessing the scientific/technological challenges for future information technologies, the workshop will provide important documented inputs to the research community and to industry and government agencies that invest in long-term research. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will provide an excellent opportunity for intellectual pursuit and discernment of important and limiting scientific challenges related to new approaches for information processing. Exploratory research indicates the potential for economically viable new devices, circuit and system architectures, and algorithms to take computing far beyond the limits of today's technology. Examples of IT topics to be explored include: (i) Ultimate Connectivity and Internet of Things; (ii) Intelligent ?nano-nodes?; and (iii) Semiconductor technologies for big data, such as exascale computing, and new data storage technologies. Some potential Grand Challenges include: (i) Guaranteed data security, from the smallest sensor nodes the largest data centers; (ii) Ubiquitous wireless communication for billions of connected Nanosystems; (iii) Intelligent sensor nodes, powered solely by energy harvested from the environment; and (iv) Continued exponential advances in energy efficient high-performance computing. A technical report will be generated based on the information gathered at the workshop and will be made publicly available.",
