 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this CAREER Award, the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the Division of Chemistry is supporting the research of Professor Christopher J. Hennigan at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.  Professor Hennigan is characterizing  the effects of acid-catalyzed reactions on the atmospheric transformation of volatile organic compounds into secondary organic aerosol (SOA).  SOA is a ubiquitous and highly abundant component of fine particle mass in the atmosphere, contributing to aerosol effects on human health and climate.  This research bridges the apparent disagreement between laboratory and ambient studies on the role of particle acidity in forming SOA.  These studies seek to achieve an improved representation of SOA formation in models and thus, may lead to improved predictive capabilities of ambient aerosol loadings.  Professor Hennigan is integrating the research with educational activities that broaden access of underrepresented groups to research in environmental chemistry.  This will be facilitated through the Meyerhoff Scholars Summer Bridge Program, and through the organization of outreach that connects high school students with undergraduates pursuing environmental chemistry research.\r\n\r\nIn this work, new methodology is being developed for the fast, near real-time measurement of particle acidity.  The result will be an automated system that provides the best combination of high time resolution and accuracy of any aerosol pH measurement or estimation method to-date.  The system is being deployed to characterize the effects of acid catalysis on the gas-particle partitioning of semi-volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere.  The ambient measurements will span multiple seasons to capture a diverse array of meteorological conditions and source influences. The work seeks to provide a detailed understanding of a process in which biogenic emissions are transformed by anthropogenic pollutants in the atmosphere. This has implications for understanding the broader impact of human activities on changes in air composition and quality and consequential impacts upon climate.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAtmospheric particles, or aerosols, exert important effects on Earth?s climate system by scattering and absorbing incoming solar radiation and by controlling key properties of clouds (e.g., cloud lifetime and brightness).  Aerosols also impart detrimental effects on human health.  Aerosols have diverse chemical compositions, but almost always contain a complex mixture of organics, most of which are secondary (that is, they are formed in the atmosphere from the reaction of gaseous precursors).  Particle acidity, or pH, plays a determining role in many chemical and physical properties of particles and their effects.  The objective of this proposal was to study the effects of particle acidity on organic aerosol formation.  We focused on organic compounds formed through the uptake of soluble gases to the liquid water contained in clouds, fog, and aqueous particles.  We set out to characterize processes that laboratory studies had previously identified as important, but which had not been demonstrated in the ambient atmosphere.  This work involved a combination of thermodynamic equilibrium modeling, highly time-resolved atmospheric measurements, and laboratory experimentation.  A number of key project outcomes were achieved:\n\nParticle acidity (pH) is extremely difficult to measure directly, so prior studies employed an array of proxy methods to estimate the acidity of particles.  Our work showed that many of the most widely used proxy methods have little or no correlation with pH, the parameter that actually matters for atmospheric processes.  We provided guidance to the research community on the most accurate methods for calculating aerosol pH and the methods that should be avoided.\n\nThe urban heat island (UHI) is a widely observed phenomenon whereby urban environments have higher temperatures and different relative humidities than surrounding suburban and rural areas.  We conducted a series of modeling exercises to investigate how the UHI impacts particle acidity in urban areas.  We found that particles in urban areas are systematically more acidic (lower pH) than surrounding suburban and rural areas.  Although this finding is widely applicable to most urban areas, the effects follow strong seasonal and daily cycles that will vary by location.  We conducted separate modeling exercises to investigate the effect of water-soluble organic carbon compounds on particle pH.  We characterized an array of different organic compounds on the pH in areas with extremely different particle characteristics.  We found that in both the eastern U.S. (lower particle loadings, highly acidic particles (pH ~1)) and Beijing, China (extremely high particle loadings, moderately acidic particles (pH ~4-5)), water-soluble organics have a very modest effect on particle pH.  This is explained by offsetting effects whereby the organics alter the hydrogen ion activity coefficient and simultaneously the aerosol liquid water content.\n\nWe carried out extensive atmospheric measurements to characterize organic aerosol compounds formed through uptake of water-soluble gases to aqueous particles in the eastern U.S.  We found that isoprene (emitted from trees and vegetation) and NOx (emitted from motor vehicles and power plants) exert unique effects on the organic aerosol formed in this region.  Specifically, we found that the isoprene/NOx ratio is a good predictor for the volatility of water-soluble gases formed through atmospheric oxidation reactions.     \n\nFinally, we helped advance the tools used for atmospheric measurements.  We performed a detailed characterization of a mist chamber for the collection of water-soluble organic gases.  We found a strong quantitative relationship between the mist chamber collection efficiency and the gas solubility (expressed as the Henry?s law constant).  This work has influenced other research who apply this measurement technique. \n\nOverall, our results have advanced understanding of aerosol processes and the human activities that alter aerosol abundances in the atmosphere.  This project supported two PhD students and numerous undergraduates.  The project resulted in six peer-reviewed publications, and more than 20 presentations at national conferences.       \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher Hennigan"
