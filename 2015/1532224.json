 "awd_abstract_narration": "X-ray computed tomography (CT) is an approach to nondestructive examination of objects based on reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) images of the external and internal features of an object from a series of two-dimensional X-ray images taken at a large number of viewing angles.  Medical CT imaging is commonly used as a diagnostic tool, and similar approaches using higher X-ray intensities can allow very detailed imaging of non-living samples for a wide range of research applications across many fields of science and engineering.  This Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) award supports the acquisition of a high-resolution, 3D X-ray microscope capable of producing images with three-dimensional resolution smaller than 1\u00b5m (about 100 times smaller than the width of a human hair).  This system will be located in the Stanford Nano Shared Facilities, a core facility providing researchers across Stanford University and from nearby institutions with state-of-the-art instruments for specimen characterization and analysis.  This instrument will advance innovative research by investigators from multiple disciplines across Stanford's Schools of Earth Energy & Environmental Sciences, Engineering, Humanities & Sciences, and Medicine, as well as investigators from San Jose State University and the California Academy of Sciences, a museum, educational center and research facility in San Francisco.\r\n\r\nThe high-resolution X-ray microscope will improve Stanford's ability to conduct leading-edge research in materials science, earth science, and life science by filling the gap in length scale (0.4 to 40 \u00b5m) within which no equipment currently at Stanford can generate non-destructive 3D tomography images. It will support leading-edge basic research in materials science, earth science, and life science. Researchers will use the instrument to analyze the microstructure of shale rock, which contains pores and other features at a range of sizes, enabling studies on more efficient extraction of petroleum and sequestration of anthropogenic carbon dioxide.  The ability to image large samples with high resolution at a long working distance will be exploited to study silicon microparticle anodes coated with self-healing polymers for optimal design of longer-lasting batteries.  The instrument will be used for high-resolution imaging of inner-ear bones and the tympanic membrane of mammals ranging from mice to humans to aid in more detailed modeling of the mechanics of hearing and development of novel devices for correcting hearing abnormalities.  Researchers on improved fabrication of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) devices will use the microscope to nondestructively examine the internal structure of devices designed to minimize or eliminate fatigue (repeated loading) failure, dramatically extending the useful life of devices and sensors for a wide range of applications.  The dual-energy imaging capacity will allow simultaneous collection of high-resolution images of cartilage, bone and vasculature in a single scan, providing new insights into the processes of skeletal development and healing.  Researchers at the California Academy of Sciences will take advantage of the instrument's high-resolution, phase contrast imaging capabilities for detailed examination of tissue interfaces as part of studies on the anatomical and physiological effects of evolutionary miniaturization.  Through these and many other projects, this instrument will become a key part of Stanford University's research infrastructure and enhance the scope and impact of research across a wide range of science and engineering disciplines.",
