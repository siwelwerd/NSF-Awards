 "awd_abstract_narration": "In partnership with the ATE Center for Advanced Automotive Technology (CAAT), other ATE Centers that focus on transportation or energy, and regional and local employers, Rio Hondo College in California will further develop and offer a newly created Electric/Hybrid/ Fuel-Cell Technician Associate Degree. The project will build on the expertise and partnerships the institution has developed with local schools, companies, Workforce Investment Boards (WIB's), the State of California Employment Development Department (EDD), the Governor's Green Team, and the California Energy Commission. It will create and evaluate improved models for work-based learning tools to assure students are more successful and to increase diversity in the technical work force. The project will integrate high-performance electronics, computer management skills, and advanced technology diagnostic skills that make students highly employable while assisting the diverse high school population in the service area served by the college. It will encourage students to continue their education and attain two and four year technology degrees. \r\n\r\nThe project will develop a clear and defined pathway that will allow articulated high school students from diverse backgrounds to enter a new form of automobile and energy technician training. It will also create the career pathway to an Associate of Science degree that is transferable to articulated universities in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) areas of Mechanical Engineering or Electrical Engineering, degrees not commonly associated with the automobile technician in the past. The project will integrate a high-performance STEM based energy curriculum using innovative teaching strategies at the college and  high school and university partners. It will track students in the new Hybrid/Electric/Fuel-Cell Technician program to assure that they graduate with sufficient learning and work experience to qualify for employment as an Electric/Hybrid/ Fuel-Cell Technician and will use manufacturers' supported industry certifications and technical training for faculty. Industrial partners will provide internships and supervised work experience for technicians that allow graduates to be successful when they secure employment. The project will demonstrate significant improvement in the STEM learning using interdisciplinary and applied approaches to areas of Career and Technical Education (CTE). Problem solving and technical skills will be enhanced by this curriculum as it will integrate work-based skills, clearly defined career pathways, and stackable certificates that industry demands from employees. A Summer Energy Academy for 13 year old students brings teachers and students together to build and test the latest alternative energy technology.",

Evaluate and make changes to get students through the program in two years.</p>\n<p>A complete review of the existing Alternative Fuels Technology degree and existing Certificate of Achievement (CoA) to ensure that all data and responses to evaluations using faculty and industry representatives covered all the outcomes. This degree and CoA are now 3 years old.</p>\n<p>Using all the information, evaluation reports, 20156,2017, and 2018 with suggestions from the advisory committee, the decision to proceed with the separate new Certificate of Achievement TESLA program. Leaving the existing Gaseous fuels degree in place and the second Electric Vehicle/ Fuel Cell degree to keep technology current in both areas, the third COA will allow RHC students to complete the specific training for the area of technology they wish to employee in.</p>\n<p>The new CoA path will be implemented this August 2018 as a minor addition to the two-year programs.</p>\n<p>Using the outside evaluation team from use The Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering (ATMAE) for program accreditation, the student success and two-year program completion has been developed and are showing success.</p>\n<p>Outcome 2. Aligning student needs and tracking student information.</p>\n<p>The automotive advisory team, the State of California GO-Biz advisory team, and the review of the ATMAE provided the direction for our next steps.</p>\n<p>Because the National Automotive Technicians Education Foundation, (NATEF) no longer supported the alternative fuels programs, RHC needed a source to get curriculum advice. RHC contacted Cal State LA who we articulate with to find our programs were out of date and agreed to work on a new career path to the university.</p>\n<p>Finding that the universities use The Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering (ATMAE) for program accreditation, RHC applied for 3 programs to get ATMAE support.&nbsp;The automotive, alternative fuels, and the Honda programs were accredited by ATMAE and have passed the two-year review as of December 2018.</p>\n<p>Cal State LA will allow RHC students with the completed Alternative Fuels degree to use 12 units of the lower A.S. degree as elective units towards the Mechanical or Industrial B.S. degree now that the program carries the same accreditation as the university. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The final part of this outcome was to align student access in the following way:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Student web access to a schedule that conformed to a two-year track.</li>\n<li>Student access to a councilor who was CTE trained.</li>\n<li>Student job placement while attending and after graduation from program.</li>\n<li>Following up after student has been employed.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To address these findings RHC created the Rio Hondo student Automotive Linked-in site. <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6695819\">https://www.linkedin.com/groups/6695819</a> where we currently have 100 students with professional profiles.</p>\n<p>RHC hired Brad Pollak company, two times to conduct a job search workshop. Part of this workshop is to create a linked-in profile. Mock interviews, and employment resume training.</p>\n<p>Workshops created by the CTE councilors on creating a linked in profile and how to maintain each semester. A second workshop targets students on how to market their skills through the use of social media.</p>\n<p>RHC is one of several pilot programs at the state level for soft skills improvement. The first program piloted by the state office is the New World of Works training and faculty certification. <a href=\"https://www.newworldofwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/21st-Century-Skills-Competencies-Attributes-Traits-Final-2017.pdf\">https://www.newworldofwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/21st-Century-Skills-Competencies-Attributes-Traits-Final-2017.pdf</a> . This training was funded by the Career Technology Education Department, (CTE) for 35 faculty to be certified and licensed to add soft skills training to the existing course curriculum. These are a series of videos and exercises that give students electronic badges. These students can add these achievements to the linked-in profile.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To target veteran recruitment, the PI has been voted to the board of directors for the Foothill Workforce Investment Board.
