SEAM 2015 will again span a broad swath of analysis, featuring four plenary speakers who will address topics in operator theory (Brett Wick), harmonic analysis (Ciperian Demeter), geometric combinatorics (Joshua Zahl), and harmonic analysis and number theory (Lillian Pierce). The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.\r\n\r\nConference web page:  www.math.uga.edu/~lyall/seam2015/",
