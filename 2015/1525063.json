 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phenology, the study of seasonal biological events, tracks the effects of both year to year climate variability and long-term environmental change on both local and global ecology. It has considerable potential for serving as a base for research studies by undergraduate classes and developing cross-campus studies. Several recent studies, including the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (2014), and Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education (a 2011 document representing the views of over 500 biology faculty and administrators) cite the importance of undergraduate research for retaining science majors and helping students better understand key concepts and develop crucial competencies. Four institutions, the University of North Carolina at Asheville, Appalachian State University, East Tennessee State University, and Warren Wilson College, are combining forces to create common gardens and to develop modules that can guide students' research studies to address potential impacts of global change at multiple levels of the biological hierarchy, from genes to ecosystems. The cooperating institutions are unique in character, diverse in their student bodies, and located in varying climate zones.  The project will contribute to our knowledge about ecological issues and will expand the ways in which institutions can combine forces to increase the STEM knowledge and competencies of their students. Environmental change issues to be investigated include monitoring effects of invasive exotic removal techniques on herbs, shrubs, vines, and trees within the areas studied (studies for lower division courses), and exploring questions about the spread of potentially invasive exotic plants, using a combination of GIS (Global Information Systems) mapping, herbarium collections, and online databases (upper division courses).  \r\n \r\nThe collaborating institutions will create and beta-test modules, identify and mitigate barriers to successful implementation of curricular changes, and disseminate curricular changes. The modules will have a direct impact on the learning of over 2000 undergraduates per year, including non-STEM majors. They will be developed and partially administered by undergraduate and graduate research students, and will be instrumental in developing pedagogical expertise for faculty members. The ability of modules to impart botanical knowledge while encouraging higher-order cognitive processes, advancing quantitative literacy, teaching analytical techniques, honing scientific communication skills, cultivating positive student attitudes towards plants and STEM, and improving persistence and graduation in STEM majors will be assessed using a mixed method approach (quantitative and qualitative data collection). Results will begin to document the effects of global change on an understudied but important bioregion while developing a future workforce with solid STEM training.\r\n \r\nThis project is funded jointly by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, Division of Biological Infrastructure and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education, in support of efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Education: A Call to Action http://visionandchange.org/finalreport/.",

Yet plants are underappreciated, so much so that the term &ldquo;plant blindness&rdquo; was coined by biology educators and botanists in 1998; this term acknowledged that plants are often overlooked and understudied compared to animals. Nonetheless, the ability to apply a plant biology lens to studies of biodiversity, conservation, and invasive species management, while gaining quantitative analysis and scientific writing, are important skills for both future scientists and a literate non-science citizenry. This project explores ways to address these issues, using authentic research models to engage students with field based activities that encourage utilization of scientific inquiry to answer biological questions</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Traditional models of undergraduate research rely on a direct apprentice model, in which sole, silo-ed research scientists mentor small groups of students. This approach, however, is not readily scalable. To make authentic research opportunities accessible to a broader array of students (including historically underrepresented groups like first generation college students and students of color), the CEREUS (Consortium Exchanging Research Experiences for Undergraduate Students) project implemented multiple immersive, botanically-infused, classroom-based research modules spanning multiple scales (from molecules to ecosystems; Figure 1) of biological organization. We designed modules to be transferable across different types of institutions and class levels, ranging from introductory to upper-level life science courses.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Over the course of this project, hundreds of<em> </em>undergraduates in upper- and lower-division courses were exposed to these modules at three different types of higher education institutions: public liberal arts, private liberal arts, and public research universities. Participants developed an understanding of plant biology through a variety of activities, including using common genetic laboratory protocols to investigate genetic diversity in native plant populations, estimating carbon sequestration in southern Appalachian deciduous forests, and monitoring phenology, the timing of life history events like leaf color change. Students&rsquo; data were subsequently contributed to the National Phenology Network Nature's Notebook Citizen Science database, presented at scientific conferences, or published in peer-reviewed journals. CEREUS modules provided opportunities for students to gain experience in field techniques, statistical analyses, and technical writing forms used by STEM professionals. Module participants have subsequently joined the research laboratories of CEREUS personnel, secured prestigious internships with agencies like NASA and NSF, and enrolled in STEM graduate programs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By developing common gardens and tree walks on campuses, we significantly expanded hands-on opportunities for students and community members. This has been particularly valuable in demonstrating to university stakeholders the need to expand teaching beyond traditional classrooms. The project helped investigators forge stronger relationships with the grounds and landscape personnel at the three universities, raised the visibility of botanical research on campuses, and encouraged faculty to work with administrators to sustain hands-on botanical activities through development and implementation of plant infrastructures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Assessment data from all three types of institutions revealed that engaging in this type of learning increased student appreciation for plants and sense of belonging to the scientific community. Modules were also shared with the STEM educational community at regional and national meetings, as well as at a multi-day regional workshop hosted at UNC Asheville. Collectively, these classroom-based botanical research modules will be applied at CEREUS institutions and beyond to train a new generation of scientists to apply skills in critical thinking, data analysis, and clear communication to address the challenges associated with global change.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/25/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jennifer&nbsp;R&nbsp;Ward</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1525063/1525063_10397615_1574699710235_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1525063/1525063_10397615_1574699710235_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1525063/1525063_10397615_1574699710235_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
