 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the international conference \"Arithmetic 2015: Elliptic Curves, Diophantine Geometry, and Dynamics\" to be held at Brown University in Providence, RI from August 11 - 15, 2015.  The conference will bring together experts, young researchers, and graduate students working in the broadly-defined areas of arithmetic geometry and number theory.  It will provide an opportunity for graduate students and young researchers to interact with leading experts and to learn about recent results.  The conference is expected to attract approximately 200 participants.  It will feature 23 distinguished invited speakers along with a poster session highlighting the work of graduate students and recent Ph.D.s.  The grant will support the participation of approximately 30 graduate students and young faculty, as well as several of the invited speakers.\r\n\r\nThe study of elliptic curves, diophantine geometry, and arithmetic dynamics are all modern extensions of the classical, even ancient, study of integer solutions to polynomial equations.  Among the many important concepts in the field, two principal ideas lie close to the heart of all three topics: the study of rational points on algebraic varieties, and the theory of arithmetic height functions.  The conference will foster collaboration across these different areas of arithmetic geometry and number theory by focusing on these two unifying themes.
