 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supoorts the initial development of the US hub of Future Earth Secretariat.  Future Earth seeks to harness the insights and capacity of the global scientific community, development professions, and stakeholders to address these global problems. The Future Earth effort is based on the recognition that modern environmental problems can not be solved by physical science alone and rather requires the coordinated efforts of environmental scientists, social scientists, and stakeholders to meet the societal challenges\r\nof global environmental change and a world transition to global sustainability. Future Earth seeks to advance a new way of doing science by directly emphasizing the co-design and co-production of knowledge with those who most need scientific information to make effective decisions to help manage a changing environment. The Future Earth programme is organized around three major themes: Dynamicplanet; Global Development; and Transformations toward Sustainability. Under the auspices of these three themes, the Secretariat will support workshops and other efforts to foster the co-design of research to enhance transdisciplinary efforts to inform solutions and decision making. The secretariat will also develop programmes and initiatives to educate the next generation of inter-disciplinary professionals on how to integrate global sustainability with human prosperity and will actively engage the public through an extensive communication and outreach effort.",
