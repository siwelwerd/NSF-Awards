 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project develops wearable and functional hand orthoses for stroke survivors, to act as both assistive and training devices. For daily living, such a device could provide assistance with manipulation tasks, increasing the sense of control and the ability to live independently. For rehabilitation, a wearable orthosis could enable functional training on real-world manipulation tasks, extend training beyond the small number of sessions performed in a clinical setting, and provide distributed training during the course of daily activities rather than block training in designated therapeutic sessions. From a healthcare perspective, this work will enable a shift from devices used in a clinic under medical supervision towards unobtrusive functional orthoses used during daily life. From an engineering perspective, it will advance towards a new class of active wearable systems, controllable by natural movement or similarly intuitive interfaces. \r\n\r\nNew approaches will be required to build a device that is simultaneously dexterous (for complex manipulation), non-intrusive (for daily living) and intuitive to control. To achieve this, we investigate ways to assist joint movement using a network of artificial tendons routed on the surface of the hand and arm, without adding large structural components such as an exoskeleton. A key tenet of our approach is that a hand orthosis can provide meaningful assistance with daily manipulation tasks even when using a number of actuators far smaller than the number of joints in the hand. We will also investigate multiple control methods, including unimanual operation (where endogenous movement of the paretic limb is detected and enhanced) and bilateral operation (where movement of the less affected limb is used to generate control signals for the paretic one).",

Arm and hand motor impairments are a common consequence of stroke, and outcomes are frequently poor despite conventional rehabilitation treatment: fewer than half of stroke patients with arm or hand impairment ever regain functional use. In this project, we aimed to develop wearable and functional hand orthoses for stroke survivors, to act as both assistive and training devices. For daily living, such a device could provide assistance with manipulation tasks, increasing the sense of control and the ability to live independently. For rehabilitation, a wearable orthosis could enable functional training on real-world manipulation tasks, and extend training beyond the small number of sessions performed in a clinical setting.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">Wearable hand orthoses must help the user perform meaningful manipulation capabilities in a small and lightweight package. We thus investigated the capability of devices with a single motor to assist whole-hand movement patterns. This is done through a network of cables (called tendons) that transmit movement from the motor to the joints of the hand. In experiments with stroke survivors, we qualitatively demonstrated the ability to execute multiple grasp types. We then introduced two additional mechanical designs that provided effective force transmission by increasing moment arms around finger joints. We evaluated the designs with geometric models and experimented using a 3D-printed artificial finger to find force and joint angle characteristics of the suggested structures. We also performed clinical tests with stroke patients to demonstrate the feasibility of the designs. The testing supported the hypothesis that the proposed designs efficiently elicit can help patients with spasticity extend their fingers in order to use their hand for grasping, as compared to existing baselines.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">To be fully wearable, assistive devices must have intuitive controls: the device must ?understand? what the user is trying to do, and when, in order to provide appropriate assistance.  In this project, we first explored the feasibility of using electromyography (EMG) signals to control our device to enable pick and place tasks.  We used an easy to don, commodity forearm EMG band with 8 sensors to create an EMG pattern classification control for our tendon device.  With this control, we were able to detect a user's intent to open, and the device could thus enable finger extension and pick and place tasks. While our results proved that it is indeed possible to infer user intent using  EMG, we also found that the variety of encountered arm and hand impairment patterns means that a single sensor type might not be sufficient to enable controls for a broad range of users. To address this significant gap, we introduced a multiple sensor types for an active hand orthosis, such as EMG, finger bend and contact pressure sensors. We proposed interaction methods that utilize this complex sensory data as input, and showed they can enable tasks for stroke survivors who exhibit different impairment patterns.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">We then performed a pilot study to investigate training effects with our device over a 12-session training program (3 sessions per week for 4 weeks) for 11 participants, all stroke survivors. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first time an active wearable hand robot was employed to support fully user-driven functional hand exercises for chronic stroke patients interacting with various real-world objects. Our results suggested that intensive hand functional exercises using our assistive robot improved motor function in distal segments on the upper limb, and that our device can potentially serve in an assistive capacity for stroke patients with lower functional use of their upper limb.</p>\n<p class=\"western\"><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> the outcomes described above showed that it is possible to build a fully wearable, user-controlled robotic hand orthosis for stroke patients. From a design perspective, we showed that highly underactuated devices (with few motors helping many joints) can assist in relevant hand motions for patients exhibiting spasticity, a common aftereffect of stroke. From a user control perspective, we showed that it is possible to infer user intent based on forearm EMG with easy to don, commodity sensors, and introduced the use of multimodal sensing to address a wider range of impairments. Finally, our pilot study showed both rehabilitative and assistive effects in parts of our patient population after a training program with our device. <strong>Broader Impacts:</strong> our research was driven by a broad health problem, of insufficient access to rehabilitation therapy for people with hand impairments. Given the prevalence of such impairments following stroke, this project was grounded in the needs of stroke survivors. However, our research results can inform training and rehabilitation for populations affected by other arm and hand impairments (e.g. myopathies, motor neuron disorders, multiple sclerosis).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Matei&nbsp;T&nbsp;Ciocarlie</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526960/1526960_10386662_1569857204938_platform_all--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526960/1526960_10386662_1569857204938_platform_all--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Hand orthosis with multimodal sensing\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526960/1526960_10386662_1569857204938_platform_all--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Hand orthosis with multimodal sensing\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Our robotic orthosis equipped with multiple sensors for detecting user intent: EMG armband, bend sensors, pressure sensors</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Columbia University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matei&nbsp;T&nbsp;Ciocarlie</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Hand orthosis with multimodal sensing</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526960/1526960_10386662_1569857310498_DesignA_device--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526960/1526960_10386662_1569857310498_DesignA_device--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tendon transmission mechanism for hand orthosis\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526960/1526960_10386662_1569857310498_DesignA_device--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tendon transmission mechanism for hand orthosis\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Our transmission mechanism allows force to be transmitted from the motor to the fingers, using mechanical structures to increase torque.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Columbia University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matei&nbsp;T&nbsp;Ciocarlie</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tendon transmission mechanism for hand orthosis</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526960/1526960_10386662_1569857371301_platform_all_patient--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526960/1526960_10386662_1569857371301_platform_all_patient--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Functional exercise using hand orthosis\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526960/1526960_10386662_1569857371301_platform_all_patient--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Functional exercise using hand orthosis\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Stroke patient performing a grasp assisted by our robotic hand orthosis</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Columbia University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matei&nbsp;T&nbsp;Ciocarlie</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Functional exercise using hand orthosis</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526960/1526960_10386662_1569855395623_emg--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526960/1526960_10386662_1569855395623_emg--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Grasping examples with our device\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1526960/1526960_10386662_1569855395623_emg--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Grasping examples with our device\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Stroke patients performing grasping tasks assisted by our device, using EMG control.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Columbia University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matei&nbsp;T&nbsp;Ciocarlie</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Grasping examples with our device</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
