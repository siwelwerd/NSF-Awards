The ICP is a premier international scientific congress in psychology, held approximately every 4 years since 1889. The ICP attracts 6,000-10,000 psychologists, spanning a wide range of scientific psychology and spanning the globe. It offers an excellent venue for showcasing the work of U.S. psychological science, for exposing U.S. psychological scientists to cutting edge ideas being discussed around the world, for fostering a broader international perspective on research and theory across the discipline, and for facilitating international collaboration and exchange. \r\n\r\nEarly career scientists and graduate students whose research is within the purview of the Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences division of NSF will be given priority for sponsorship. The program will include mentoring and mentor-matching activities to strengthen the capacity building aspects before and during the congress and in later follow-up activities. The emphasis on young scientists strengthens the discipline and fosters the development of U.S. science and scientists.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Behavioral and Cognitive Sciences division of the Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences directorate at the National Science Foundation.",

The unique aspect of the program was its mentoring component which joined more experienced international researchers with graduate student and early career scientists to foster interaction and exchange in the context of a premier international congress of psychology.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The 18 distinguished participants (selected among 50 applicants) included13 early career or graduate student psychologists and 5 senior psychologists who had experience in international research collaborations and international conference networking. Each mentor was assigned 2-3 mentees, based on research interests. Participants met and interacted prior to ICP2016 via telephone and email. On arriving in Japan for ICP2016, they participated in a half-day pre-conference workshop on strategies for international networking, and participated in both group and mentor-mentee interactions during ICP2016 to navigate learning and professional development goals and promote networking. In addition to the pre-conference workshop, the group met every two days during ICP2016 for a morning &ldquo;check-in&rdquo; to review congress activities and opportunities. There were also informal gatherings. Most participants in the program stayed in one or two of the congress hotels, and met for breakfast meetings and to walk together to the congress center. Finally, program participants were invited to a number of congress-related social events (receptions, etc.) to afford an opportunity to meet international psychology leaders and colleagues. group communication was facilitated by creating a \"whats app\" group for rapid information sharing. Following ICP2016, all participants were asked to complete an online evaluation survey incorporating both quantitative and narrative responses.&nbsp;Representatives from APA and from the USNC organized and participated in the pre-conference workshop and morning &ldquo;check-in&rdquo; meetings.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">As a capacity building effort, this program was successful in fostering attendance at ICP2016 (80% of the mentees indicated they would not have attended the Congress without this program), and in serving perceived needs, which included networking and information on cross-cultural psychology and exchange. Mentors indicated they promoted contact with international scientists, provided research suggestions and ideas for international collaborations, and attended sessions with their mentees. Mentees&rsquo; listing of benefits gained included: networking, introductions to senior colleagues, discussions of career development, steps to collaborative research, suggestions for research directions, and specific guidance on how to best take advantage of an international congress, such as selecting sessions to attend and understanding international etiquette.

Attending ICP2016 also provided exposure to a broad range of research that participants would normally not be exposed to, because comparatively less research from outside of Europe/North America is published in mainstream journals and because the Japan location allowed an in-depth exposure to Japanese and Asian approaches and datasets. Medium- and long-range follow-up questionnaires will assess the longer term value of the mentoring program. Results from earlier programs suggests that it will, for some, lead to specific international collaborations, and for most add to the breadth and richness of their scientific thinking.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Reports on the Program -&nbsp;See: <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/international/pi/2016/09/national-committee.aspx\">http://www.apa.org/international/pi/2016/09/national-committee.aspx</a></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/11/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Merry&nbsp;Bullock</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548381/1548381_10391963_1481671303172_APAUSNCOrientation--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548381/1548381_10391963_1481671303172_APAUSNCOrientation--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Pre-Congress Workshop on International Collaboration Strategies\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548381/1548381_10391963_1481671303172_APAUSNCOrientation--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Pre-Congress Workshop on International Collaboration Strategies\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants in the APA-USNC Mentoring program to attend the International Congress of Psychology in Yokohama meet for a half day workshop</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Merry Bullock</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Merry&nbsp;Bullock</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Pre-Congress Workshop on International Collaboration Strategies</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548381/1548381_10391963_1481671395539_APAUSNCGroupSalutation--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548381/1548381_10391963_1481671395539_APAUSNCGroupSalutation--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"APA USNC Program Participants\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1548381/1548381_10391963_1481671395539_APAUSNCGroupSalutation--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"APA USNC Program Participants\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">APA-USNC Program Participants (partial) in Yokohama, Japan</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Merry Bullock</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Merry&nbsp;Bullock</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">APA USNC Program Participants</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
