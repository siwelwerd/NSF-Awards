 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Villanova University to acquire a next-generation sequencing platform\r\nfocused on the Illumina MiSeq instrument. This project will support high-impact research\r\nprograms that span the disciplines of Biology and Biochemistry, and will provide graduate and\r\nundergraduate students with hands-on genomics experience using leading-edge technology.\r\nVillanova University is a primarily undergraduate institution committed to recruiting and retaining\r\nstudents from underrepresented groups and disadvantaged backgrounds, and students of color\r\naccounted for more than 20% of full-time students in 2013. The University also has an impressive\r\nretention record, with 6 year graduation rates above 85% for all ethnic groups as of 2013. Ready\r\naccess to cutting-edge sequencing technology, and to the interdisciplinary genomics and\r\nbioinformatics approaches it facilitates, will support the Biology and Chemistry departments in\r\ntheir efforts to attract students from underrepresented groups to STEM careers. This equipment\r\nwill allow the transformation of undergraduate and Masters genomics education at Villanova, and\r\nwill be a centerpiece of a new course in genomics. Many Villanova students go on to attend\r\nprofessional schools or Ph.D. programs, and exposure of students to this technology will prepare\r\nthem for the science and medicine of the future. The PI and co-PIs have an extensive record of\r\nmentoring students, including students on peer-reviewed publications, and preparing students for\r\nacceptance to top graduate programs, and the MiSeq platform will advance this student-directed\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nThe MiSeq platform will advance the research of laboratories with diverse interests that include\r\nphylogenomics and phylogeography, evolution and speciation, microbial ecology in response to\r\nchanging environmental conditions, and the study of bacterial pathogens. This technology will be\r\nroutinely used in the immediate future by at least 5 research groups in 4 main research areas:\r\n1) Deep sequencing of the mRNA and small RNA transcriptomes will address fundamental\r\nquestions about how genes are regulated to control responses to stress, nutrient\r\navailability, and hormone signaling, and to direct cellular growth and development. These\r\nmethods will also support investigation of how gene regulation and nutrient signaling are\r\nshaped by evolutionary forces.\r\n2) ChIP-Seq and RNA-seq methods will be used to understand changes in transcription and\r\nidentify transcription factor binding sites in fungal and bacterial species.\r\n3) Targeted sequencing of genomic DNA will be used to resolve uncertainties and increase\r\nthe resolution of phylogenetic relationships in a variety of squamate (reptile) taxa. The\r\nresults of these experiments will have important impacts on conservation efforts for these\r\ngroups, and will advance our understanding of the forces that drive evolution and\r\nspeciation.\r\n4) Sequencing of both RNA and DNA will be used to investigate soil microbial populations,\r\nallowing researchers to address how changes in microbial communities impact plant\r\ngrowth and nutrient cycling in the face of climate change and nutrient pollution.",
