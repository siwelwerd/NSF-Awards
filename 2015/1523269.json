 "awd_abstract_narration": "As today's climate fluctuates and severe weather events occur more frequently, sustainability of resources is a prominent concern, not just of scientists but also of government leaders and the public. Humans have adjusted to climate changes in the past. Why have some of these adjustments been more resilient and sustainable than others? Archaeologists are uniquely positioned to provide insights on sustainability because their studies provide information over many centuries. In some cases, archaeological data permit tracking of the development of human societies from small-scale egalitarian groups to large-scale socially and politically complex societies. Inherent to this transition is reliance on and the sustainability of natural resources, including the development of food storage economies. The long-term trajectory of natural resource use and management in this context is pivotal. Dr. Lee Newsom of the Pennsylvania State University, along with colleagues at the Florida Museum of Natural History, will undertake archaeological research on coastal fisher-gatherer-hunter societies that lived in southern Florida for several millennia. The research emphasizes the role of fuelwood resources as a means to preserve surplus food in an emerging storage economy. This research will examine the influence of a past society on forest resources. Insights into the legacy effects of sustained wood use on the modern forest landscape/seascape, and generally the influence of humans on coastal environments, will be of interest to other academic disciplines and to planners. Mangrove forests are endangered world-wide and this investigation will further inform ecologists about their resilience at the edge of their range. Modern management and conservation of coastal forest resources can benefit from the long-term record, as policy makers consider further habitat disruption and loss from coastal development, sea level rise, and global change. \r\n\r\nThe project focuses on the Calusa Indians and their predecessors in southern Florida, using ethnohistoric records and especially archaeological evidence. The research team will test the hypothesis that the development of a food storage economy was a critical factor underlying cultural complexity, and that fuelwoods from coastal mangrove forests were an indispensable and sustainable natural resource inherent to this process. The team will undertake intensive wood-anatomical analysis of charcoal excavated from archaeological sites in the Calusa core area along the southwest coast, emphasizing the characteristics of the fuel supply, the influence of environmental perturbations on the availability of wood, and the role of human agency and influence over local forest resources. Basic wood data collection will include taxonomic assignments, observations on anatomical variation, age, growth form, and growth rate. The research will incorporate modern forest ecological data and experimental methods to establish the hypothetical limitations of the fuel supply. Relevant paleoecological and archaeological data will provide temporal and cultural resolution. All data can be compared in order to test hypotheses on the effects of sustained fuelwood selection and use, the impact of natural disruptions to the fuel supply, and the potential for management.",

People have adjusted to climate changes in the past. Why have some of these adjustments been more resilient and sustainable than others? Archaeology offers insights on sustainability because it can provide information over many centuries. In some cases, archaeological data allow us to track the development of human societies from small-scale groups to socially and politically complex societies. Inherent to this transition is reliance on and the sustainability of natural resources, including the development of food storage methods.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Within this context, this collaborative project focuses on the complex, non-agricultural, Calusa people who lived in subtropical, coastal southwest Florida (IMAGE 1) and the extensive archaeological datasets produced by excavations at their associated sites over the past four decades. Specifically, the research team tests the idea that the development of a food-storage economy was a critical factor underlying Calusa success, and that fuelwoods from mangrove forests were an indispensable and sustainable natural resource inherent to this process. In other words, a steady supply of appropriate fuelwood was needed for the preservation (i.e., smoking, drying) of food surpluses, most likely of finfish and shellfish.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; Collections of archaeological, charred wood specimens, the remains of countless Calusa fires (IMAGE 2), comprise the main data source for this research. The specimens were excavated, collected, bagged, and later stored at the Florida Museum of Natural History, each bag labeled with source locations within the excavations (IMAGE 3). Comprising the first component of the collaborative project, Florida Museum&rsquo;s archaeologists Karen Walker, William Marquardt, and assistant Stacey Huber (IMAGE 4) prepared the collections for study. A portion of them had not been properly curated; these required organization, problem solving, rebagging/boxing, and cataloging. Lists of all collections were completed, facilitating their subsequent evaluation, bag by bag, selecting ones for study (and prioritizing these further) based on whether or not the specimens could be assigned a relatively precise time increment based on excavated context. The detailed list also facilitated the loan of these collections to the project collaborators as well as the analyses. Collections of charred wood, even when they are collected and kept, are often neglected in terms of adequate curation and overlooked by archaeologists (with the exception of being a source for radiocarbon dates) as a research resource. As a necessary preliminary step to the fuelwood research, the collections-improvement component of the project has resulted in a highly accessible collection for current and future research (IMAGE 5).</p>\n<p>&nbsp; The second and larger component of the project was conducted by Penn State University&rsquo;s archaeobotanist Lee Newsom and her Ph.D. student, Jennifer Haney. This component involved an intensive wood-anatomical analysis of charred wood that emphasized the characteristics of the fuel supply, the influence of environmental fluctuations on the availability of wood, and human effects on local forests. Specifically, basic wood data collection included taxonomic assignments (IMAGE 6), observations on anatomical variation, age, growth form, and growth rate. Additionally the research incorporated modern forest ecological data and experimental methods to establish the hypothetical limitations of the fuelwood supply. The analyses of this component are nearing completion. The loaned collections have been returned to Florida. The resulting information allows an assessment (forthcoming) of the effects of sustained fuelwood selection and use, the impact of natural disruptions (e.g., climate changes, sea-level fluctuations, drought, storms) to the fuel supply, and the potential for modern-day management of mangrove forests.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/18/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Karen&nbsp;J&nbsp;Walker</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523269/1523269_10374080_1537284667845_PeopleoftheEstuaryIllustration1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523269/1523269_10374080_1537284667845_PeopleoftheEstuaryIllustration1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"People of the Estuary\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523269/1523269_10374080_1537284667845_PeopleoftheEstuaryIllustration1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"People of the Estuary\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Calusa of southwest Florida relied heavily on fish and shellfish for their food.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">(Art by Merald Clark;
