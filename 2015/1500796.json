The Symposium will bring together leading experts working in analysis, partial differential equations, and their applications, at different stages of their careers, to summarize the most recent progress in these topics, provide an opportunity to exchange ideas towards the solutions of open problems, and formulate and develop new directions and avenues of research. The Symposium will combine two short courses at an introductory level with more advanced lectures. This structure is designed to introduce prospective and young researchers to a larger mathematical community, and to help them establish new professional connections in their areas of interest. The mini-courses will encourage and enable students to participate in the more specialized parts of the Symposium and also other research conferences. \r\n\r\nThe Symposium will focus on recent developments in analysis and partial differential equations that are at the forefront of current research. The Symposium features two principal lecturers, each of whom will present four-hour mini-courses aimed at graduate students and recent doctoral degree recipients. Approximately ten invited speakers will deliver related one-hour lectures. In addition, approximately ten graduate students and recent doctoral degree recipients will present twenty-minute talks. The Symposium?s mini-courses are \"Free Boundaries and Minimal Surfaces,\" presented by David Jerison of MIT, and \"Extremum Problems for Elliptic Eigenvalues,\" by Fang-Hua Lin of the Courant Institute. More information on the symposium will be provided at the web page www.math.purdue.edu/~danielli.",
