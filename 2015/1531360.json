 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Valparaiso University will acquire a a ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography system with four detectors.  The instrument is approriate for analyzing samples by separating the components using chromatography techniques. This award has an environmental and biochemical research focus. The environmental research is directed at water analysis. One of the projects involves water quality  studies of Lake Michigan watershed surface waters. The research will involve collaborations with The Northwest Indiana Cluster of GLISTEN (Great Lakes Innovative Stewardship through Education Network). This is a network of local undergraduate institutions, K-12 schools, and environmental community partners that collaborate to integrate  curriculum, stewardship, and research to protect the health of the Great Lakes watershed. GLISTEN includes Ivy Tech Community College and Cal State Long Beach, with many students from underrepresented groups including African American students at the former and Hispanic students at the latter.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research, especially in areas such as (a) assesing water quality of Lake Michigan watershed surface waters; (b) studying oxidative remediation of organic contaminants in waste waters and transformations of organic compounds in surface water; and (c) assessing storm-water treatment technologies for pollution reduction.",
