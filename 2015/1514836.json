 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award focuses on studying the fundamental behavior of the solid-liquid interface. The solid-liquid interface is a microscopic region formed at the boundary between a metal electrode and the surrounding fluid electrolyte. The molecular structure of this region for aqueous systems has been continually refined, but the recent advent of ionic liquids as a new, advantageous class of electrolyte fluids requires new measurements. Ionic liquids are room temperature liquid salts that will play key roles in a myriad of applications from batteries to biocatalysis, but research on the interfacial region is necessary before technological advances can be made. Several other models have been described, and each has received criticism and undergone subsequent revision. Additionally, the effects of water at the solid-liquid interface in ionic liquids are widely unknown. Yet, the majority of ionic liquids studied are known to contain significant levels of water within their bulk liquid. In electrochemistry, this portion of water is known to be highly active. This research will systematically vary the concentration of water in ionic liquids and use electrochemistry to analyze water?s role at the solid-liquid interface. This research will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. Alan M. Bond, a pioneer in ionic liquid electrochemistry, at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia.\r\n\r\nTraditional models do not describe the behavior in ionic liquids, and experiments to uncover ionic liquid structure at the solid-liquid interface is a growing field in chemistry. One relatively new and powerful tool useful for exploring the solid-liquid interface in ionic liquids is large amplitude Fourier transform alternating current (FT-ac) voltammetry. Unlike most techniques, FT-ac voltammetry allows the separation of unwanted background signal from the signal of interest. This collaboration affords an opportunity to have access to a unique instrument, available only at Monash University, and enable new insights into this interfacial region in ionic liquid electrolytes. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Australian Academy of Science.",

The project title is &ldquo;Large Amplitude Fourier Transform Alternating Current Voltammetry to Study Electrical Double Layer Transition from Aqueous to Ionic Liquid.&rdquo; The host scientist is Professor Alan M.

This region is well described experimentally and theoretically in traditional molecular solvents but the recent utilization of novel ionic liquid solvents requires new measurements. Ionic liquids are defined as low-melting salts and their novelty comes from their ability to act as both the salt and solvent in myriad applications from energy storage to biocatalysts. Only a few models describing their interfacial properties have been proposed but matching observed experimental data to theory is challenging. Furthermore, the role of adventitious water is pivotal at the solid-liquid interface and it is safe to assume that the vast majority of experimental work with ionic liquids contain at least some amount of water. The principal hypothesis from this work is to examine a series of ionic liquid and water mixtures to study the transition from the known (traditional aqueous) interfacial model to the unknown (non-aqueous ionic liquid). One novel, powerful tool useful for exploring the solid-liquid interface is large amplitude Fourier transform alternating current (FT-ac) voltammetry. Unlike most techniques, FT-ac voltammetry allows the separation of unwanted background signal from the signal of interest to probe the interfacial region. By using the first harmonic response from the FT-ac voltammetry technique, as shown in the example figure, the interfacial region is examined as a function of water content. This project has potential to see direct impact in the broader electrochemistry field, battery technology, and those working with ionic liquids at heterogeneous surfaces. Broader impacts of the NSF-EAPSI fellowship provide first-hand research experience outside the U.S., an introduction to science infrastructure within the host country, and a direct experience with the culture of the host country. These activities meet the NSF goal to educate young and upcoming scientists, engineers, and educators on the significance of international collaborations to cultivate a globally aware scientific workforce. The results of this project will be disseminated in the form of conference presentations and publication in peer-reviewed scientific journals. This NSF-EAPSI fellow is an active academic and plans to share his experiences in the program by showing undergraduate and graduate students the significance of international collaboration to their future scientific careers.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/03/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Anthony&nbsp;J&nbsp;Lucio</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514836/1514836_10371547_1457037387492_AJLUCIO-ExampleFigureforFinalReport-v1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514836/1514836_10371547_1457037387492_AJLUCIO-ExampleFigureforFinalReport-v1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"First Harmonic Example\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1514836/1514836_10371547_1457037387492_AJLUCIO-ExampleFigure...",
