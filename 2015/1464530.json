The goal of this research is to exploit the properties of these dyes in new optoelectronic devices, particularly solution processable solar energy technologies, which may ultimately be produced in a fashion that is low cost, and with a scalability that meaningfully contributes to the sustainability of our planet. This research program has elements of molecular design, synthesis, characterization, and investigation of condensed phased materials properties, and as such will provide a multidimensional vehicle for training of scientists from all levels, including those from students underrepresented in the STEM fields.  Outreach activities to K-12 and community college students are also planned.  \r\n\r\nPhthalocyanine chromophores display a combination of long wavelength absorbance, photochemical stability, and photoconductivity, making them useful for solar transduction technologies such as organic solar cells.  The proposed synthesis develops a new class of phthalocyanines intended to develop a fundamental understanding between molecular structure and condensed phase (i.e. thin film) properties such as charge mobility and light absorption.  In this project, four classes of new phthalocyanine chromophores will be prepared to answer the following questions: 1) Can a C2-symmetrical phthalocyanine molecular structure provide solution processibility while maintaining condensed phase close molecular overlap known to be critical to near-infrared spectral response and high charge mobility? 2) Can the material energetics, critical for maintaining vectorial charge transport and high open-circuit photovoltages, be predictably modulated based on structural elements? 3) Will the condensed phase properties of these materials, when appropriately optimized, translate to viability as materials for solar-electric conversion in device platforms with appropriate acceptor molecules?",
