 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over half of the world's population lives in cities and urban growth is accelerating. Water-limited arid and semiarid cities are experiencing disproportionate increases in population and land transformation worldwide, increasing stress on water resources and altering natural hydrological systems. Cities face significant challenges in providing clean water for municipal and industrial uses and in managing the environmental water quality and flooding risks that accompany urbanization. The growth of cities will require a continuing investment in infrastructure and in new strategies to adapt to water resource limitations. In the face of demographic and global change, the sustainability of water resources in arid and semiarid cities will be a key challenge. Addressing this challenge will require improved understanding of how water availability and distribution changes with urbanization, and how these changes affect ecosystem service provision and policy responses. Policy and governance decisions aimed at enhancing ecosystem services related to water resources need to be based on scientific evidence to be effective. However, better science does not necessarily lead to better governance; there remains a gap between scientific knowledge and the actions taken as a result of this knowledge. The objective of this project is to improve understanding of the linkages between ecosystem services and governance of water resources.   \r\n\r\nThis project will study the natural and human components of semi-arid cities in the US Southwest in order to determine if various attributes of these urbanized systems encourage learning and action that lead to more sustainable outcomes. This research will draw on theoretical frameworks that explicitly link ecological structure and function to ecosystem services to information flows to decision making. Specifically, four key questions will be addressed: (a) How does the frequency, intensity and redistribution of rainfall and runoff influence the eco-hydrologic response of arid and semi-arid urbanized systems and result in emergent ecosystem services? (b) How do human system conditions affect city-level learning about actions that influence ecosystem service provision? (c) How do natural system conditions influence social networks, understanding, and decision-making about water management and infrastructure? And (d) What actions have been taken, in terms of alterations to the built environment, that influence the effect of the built environment on natural system processes? These questions will be answered through a set of field, survey, lab, workshop, and synthetic experiments. Specifically a suite of research sites will be established in Tucson, Sierra Vista, and Yuma, Arizona that will allow investigations from the 1 ha/individual to the 100,000 ha/regional scales. Natural system investigations will focus on how eco-hydrologic processes integrate from the point to large catchment scale and characterize ecosystem services. The social dimensions of this project will focus on the policy and governance sectors to understand learning, decision-making and action at the municipal scale and importantly across social and bioclimatic regions. This work will integrate across natural and human systems by examining how scientific information about ecosystem services develops into decision making and by investigating how policy interventions impact ecosystem services.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur project sought to understand the ways in which green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) exists at the intersection of the human built environment and the embedded hydrological and ecological systems that interact with our cities.  This work consisted of understanding the hydrological and ecological response to the installation of GSI in cities and how policy and individual preferences affect the installation and benefits of GSI.  On the hydrological impacts of GSI our research results demonstrate that while current rates of GSI are insufficient to have a significant impact on peak flood flows, water quality, or overall flow volumes reasonable levels of additional implementation could have an impact on all of these dimensions of physical system impact.  Ecologically we have been able to demonstrate that GSI does alter tree growth rates and patterns.  These changes likely resulting in improved ecosystem services in cities. In terms of policy, we have been able to observe that the current collaborative policy trajectory for Tucson has facilitated GSI implementation, but significant educational, cost, and regulatory barriers continue to impede GSI implementation.  We also documented that the diffusion of water utility practices across the state of Arizona occurs through specifical social policy networks that facilitate knowledge within these networks but that diffusion of ideas to other utility networks is less likely.  Our work also extended beyond Arizona to collaborative on nationwide comparisons of GSI implementation.  In that work led by researchers at Colorado State University the importance of combined sewer overflows and regulatory pressure from the federal level have aided the implementation of GSI in several cities in the United States.  Also, with a team of other researchers we worked on a framework of net zero urban water (NZUW) that shows that GSI is one key element in moving cities from being largely water extractive from the environment to net neutral impacts on water resources.  In retrospect the results of this project show that GSI is more impactful on water resources and urban systems than we originally hypothesized but GSI systems are not yet having the widespread impact on floods and water resources that decision makers have sought.  Our results do show that increased effort could aid in the water resource and flood hazard policy goals that society currently has.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas Meixner"
