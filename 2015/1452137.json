 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lower atmospheric small-scale gravity waves (GWs) play a crucial role in determining the dynamical and thermal structure of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. This project will address how GWs influence the vertical coupling in the atmosphere-ionosphere in terms of energy and momentum budget, variability, thermospheric composition, and ionospheric electron density distribution. Two comprehensive GCMs will be coupled and used to simulate the atmosphere-ionosphere from the tropopause to the topside ionosphere. A suite of available upper atmosphere measurements, such as, from the TIMED satellite, SuperDARN, and Fabry-Perot Interferometers, will be used to validate the model fields.\r\n\tSpecific topics to be addressed are: (1) GW effects on the circulation and composition of the thermosphere and on the distribution of ionospheric electron density; (2) The influence of gravity waves in shaping the variability of the high-latitude ionosphere, in both geomagnetically quiet periods and those of higher magnetospheric variability, (3) The impact of sudden stratospheric warming on the upward propagation of GWs and the resulting changes in GW dynamical, thermal, and compositional effects in various geomagnetic and solar conditions; (4) The direct GW propagation from the lower atmosphere during atmospheric and geomagnetic transient processes as a possible link between meteorological and space weather processes.",

While the notion of the lower atmosphere refers generally to the troposphere (0-15 km); the middle atmosphere includes the stratosphere (15-50 km) and mesosphere (50-100 km) and the upper atmosphere is the layer of the atmosphere above about 100 km known as the thermosphere (Figure 1). GWs are produced by meteorological processes, e.g., weather, in the lower atmosphere and propagate upward to the middle and upper atmosphere where they can impact the wind and temperature distributions as they transfer the energy and momentum they carry to the background atmosphere. GWs can be studied observationally, e.g., by satellites and GPS (global positioning system) total electron content (TEC) measurements, and theoretically, e.g., by global climate models. Our research has involved both observational and modeling approaches to study GW dynamics. Overall, throughout the project period, we have produced several comprehensive review papers on the influence of GWs in terrestrial and planetary atmospheres; organized a number of conference sessions on GW dynamics; disseminated our research results on GWs and the upper atmosphere via research papers published in peer-reviewed journals. Some key outcomes of the project are as follows:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GWs interact extensively with the diurnal tide in the middle and upper atmosphere.

Similarly, SABER observations of atomic oxygen, ozone (O3) and nitric oxide (NO) were used to look into the storm effects.
