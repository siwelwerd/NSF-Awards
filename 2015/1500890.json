 "awd_abstract_narration": "A matrix group is a set of invertible square matrices that contains all products and inverses of its members. Representation theory is a branch of algebra concerned with studying symmetries, especially symmetries arising from matrix groups. Modular representation theory is the branch of representation theory concerned with matrix groups whose entries come from a finite field. It has deep connections with number theory, combinatorics, and geometry. This research project aims to make advances in modular representation theory using geometric methods.\r\n\r\nThis research project aims to make advances in the representation theory of algebraic groups over a field of positive characteristic via the philosophy of local geometric Langlands duality. Specifically, the PI hopes to establish a collection of derived equivalences in positive characteristic modeled on characteristic zero results. This work will lead to explicit connections between between the following notions: (i) modular representations of algebraic groups; (ii) modular perverse sheaves and parity sheaves on the affine Grassmannian and the affine flag variety; and (iii) the phenomena of Koszul and Q-Koszul duality.",
