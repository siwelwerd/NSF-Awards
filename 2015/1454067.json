 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research will address critical challenges for oceanographic sensing by developing a new instrument to measure dissolved inorganic carbon. This will enhance the study of the ocean carbon dioxide system, which is of global importance for its role in climate changes, ocean acidification, and in biological processes. A  \"Girls in Ocean Engineering and Science Institute,\" for 5th and 6th grade girls will be developed. A diverse audience of undergraduate students, middle and high school teachers, and a graduate student will be included in the research. These efforts aim to contribute to diversifying the fields of engineering and ocean science/engineering.\r\n\r\nThe overall scope of this research is to develop a dissolved inorganic carbon sensor capable of measurements on a variety of oceanographic platforms. The research hypothesis is that infrared laser-based spectroscopic techniques traditionally used for atmospheric sensing can be utilized for highly sensitive, easy to deploy, yet low cost sensors to fill a critical need in ocean science. A small, near-infrared laser-based sensor will be designed for the measurement of carbon dioxide. Through the packaging of this sensor, deployments to depths up to 1000 m will be achieved. Bringing advanced analytical techniques from the laboratory into the deep sea will help to close critical gaps for in-situ sensing.",

CSPEC uses tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS) to measure the carbon dioxide&nbsp;content of dissolved gas extracted via a membrane inlet. Membrane equilibration dynamics were derived from first principles enabling informed design decisions.&nbsp;&nbsp;A new method, hybrid equilibration, leverages the membrane equilibration dynamics to improve time response without incurring cross-sensitivity. POCO, a surface pCO2&nbsp;instrument, was also developed as a key step towards CSPEC that employs TDLAS and a depth-compatible membrane inlet. Through laboratory and field-testing, POCO demonstrated that hybrid equilibration overcame the gas flux limitation of deep-sea membrane inlets. POCO was field tested in coastal waters and on several ship-based flow through systems. CSPEC was deployed in Fall 2021 and successfully mapped the carbon system near different hydrothermal features at 2000m in Guaymas Basin, becoming one of the first DIC instruments field-tested at depth. CSPEC enabled both pCO2 and DIC to be measured in the deep sea. The analytical tools and measurement systems developed represent a significant step towards&nbsp;&nbsp;increasing the spatiotemporal resolution of the carbon system.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>This award funded a graduate student whose doctoral research included the development of POCO and CSPEC.
