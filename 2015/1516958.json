The project, GBTrans, will utilize existing infrastructure and development. Broader impacts of the work include research training of one graduate student and two undergrads, and outreach to high-school students and their teachers to enhance the research experience as part of the NSF-funded \"Pulsar Search Collaboratory\" which is run by researchers at NRAO and WVU.\r\n\r\nGBTrans will also perform extensive searches for giant pulses from known radio pulsars, and will provide constraints on the statistics of the brightest such pulses. An important capability of the instrument is its full-polarization recording, which will identify the polarization properties of FRBs and perhaps even their rotation measures.",
