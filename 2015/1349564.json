 "awd_abstract_narration": "Study of ancient (paleo-) ecosystems preserved in the Navajo Sandstone, the largest sand sea (eolian) system ever known that was deposited between 190 and 175 million years ago (Lower Jurassic), will provide crucial information to understanding biotic, water (hydrology), and landscape (environments) during a greenhouse period of global climate. Results will reveal how biotic community structure responded to climate changes during the transition from wetter to drier eolian landscape successions. This study will transform how biodiversity, hydrology, and environmental factors of the largest eolian systems are interpreted for understanding Earth history. This study will be a model for evaluating climate sensitivities in eolian systems, and provide guidance on future hydrologic, ecologic, and climatic studies in global warming cycles. Research will have broad impacts to interpret the links between biological, chemical, and physical sediment records in a paleoclimate context. Our collaboration has a firm commitment to increase involvement of undergraduate and graduate students of underrepresented groups in research and training, and training of Earth/Space Science education majors and teachers. Each Investigator is involved with outreach or geologic education efforts. Study results will have high visibility to the public because of the prominence of the Navajo Sandstone in so many of the Colorado Plateau's National Parks, Monuments, public lands, and wilderness areas. Partnerships with government agencies will ensure broad dissemination of scientific results to the general public and secondary geoscience teachers via video modules, pictures, and science content for websites, publications or brochures.\r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary study will examine the sedimentology, hydrology, and biology recorded within paleoecosystems of the Lower Jurassic Navajo Sandstone (Ss) on the Colorado Plateau, USA. The Navajo Ss represents the largest erg system ever known, deposited during the: (1) disintegration of the megamonsoonal climate system after the breakup of Pangea; (2) early diversification of mammals; and (3) increased diversity and dominance of dinosaurs in continental ecosystems. Two hypotheses to understand the response of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to high-frequency climatic changes that affected paleohydrologic and paleoenvironmental settings in a variably arid landscape will be integrated into one generalized model: (H1) The climatic and paleohydrologic status of the Navajo Ss evolved from relatively moist in the lower part to relatively dry in the upper part, as well as regionally moist to dry from east to west. (H2) Groundwater evolved from fresh to saline from east to west across the basin, and biota was strongly influenced by its distribution and the change in water chemistry, such that animal body size, based on burrow diameters, decreases up-section and regionally towards the west. Field and laboratory studies will include: (1) stratigraphic and sedimentologic analyses in a stratigraphic framework to systematically document vertical changes, with the objective to subdivide the Navajo Ss: (2) C and O stable isotopic and petrographic analyses of tufas to provide data on paleoclimate and changes in the water budget; and (3) ichnological and paleontological analyses integrated with sedimentologic, stratigraphic, petrographic, and geochemical analyses of clastic and carbonate facies that represent a variety of paleoenvironments. Efforts will focus in the area northwest of Moab, UT, which is the highest priority target area with a high concentration of burrowed zones, plant fossils, and tufa and lacustrine deposits to address H1 and H2. Outcrop exposure is exceptionally good, which will facilitate establishing reliable timelines. As we establish these timelines, we may focus the study further to concentrate on the variability along those timelines.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Jurassic Navajo Sandstone is one of the most spectacular rock formations in North America.  Much of the scenery in Utah parks (e.g., Arches, Canyonlands, and, especially Zion national parks, and in Sand Flats and Glen Canyon national recreation areas) is Navajo Sandstone.  The Navajo represents the largest sand dune desert in Earth history.  This reports the findings of a collaborative project among geology principal investigators at the University of Idaho, University of Kansas, and University of Utah.  Scientists from North Carolina State University, New York State University at Stony Brook, Washington State University, and the University of Texas, Arlington, also participated.  In addition, the principal investigators worked with the Bureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and the Canyonlands Natural History Association.\n\n \n\nThe Navajo Sandstone is often held up as the archetype for a hyperarid desert.  Although the presence of small interdune lakes was recognized, this study has demonstrated that the hydrology of this vast desert was far more dynamic than previously thought.  This study demonstrated that the dynamism of this hydrology was expressed in many ways:\n\nA variety in size and abundance of soft-sediment-deformation features.  Soft-sediment deformation occurs when sediment is disrupted and liquefied, for example, by an earthquake, destroying the original sedimentary structures and homogenizing the sediment.  Sometimes the disrupted sediment erupted violently onto the land surface.  The evidence for this is folding and overturning of overlying beds.  The structures range from pipe cylinders a few centimeters across to large conical injectite structures many meters across and tens of meters high.\nInterdune lakes.  Some of the interdune lakes were as large as two kilometers across and a meter or so deep.  They were occupied by fish, ostracodes, clams, snails, and algae; limestone was deposited in these lakes, indicating they were not just ephemeral as so many desert lakes are.  The shallow margins of the lakes supported large trees and other plants and were trampled by dinosaurs and recorded insect trackways.  The abundance of life indicates that, at least in some stages of their existence, the lakes provided fresh water.  This is also supported by geochemical analyses that indicate freshwater.\nSprings.  The Navajo Sandstone is dotted with limestone spring deposits.  Most of these occur in association with lakes, which probably were fed by the springs.  In others, the water flowed just fast enough to build a limestone mound, but not enough to feed a lakes.\nAbundant life.  Although most of the life was associated with the lakes, by no means was all of it.  Whenever there was a pause in dune deposition, the land surface was rapidly colonized by plants and burrowing invertebrate and vertebrate animals, ranging in size from insects to medium-sized reptiles.  Along some ancient land surfaces, we can trace the burrowed beds laterally into interdune lakes.  Even a few dinosaurs came to the water?s edge in the oases of the Jurassic desert.\n\n\nOverall, our studies elucidate the archives of history in the spectacular and diverse landscape of the southwestern U.S.  This is an important part of our geological heritage.\n\n \n\nOur scientific results so far have been published in the following articles, with more in the works.\n\n \n\n \n\nChan, M.A., Hasiotis, S.T., and Parrish, J.T., 2018, Enigmatic Pipes in the Lower Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, Canyonlands National Park, Utah: Sedimentology, doi:10.1111/sed.12491\n\nChan, M.A., Makou, M.
