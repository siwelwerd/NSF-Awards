This approach will remove scaling and modeling adjustments currently made in scaled down wind tunnel experiments. Findings from this research will impact directly the wind energy industry. The proposed research activities are integrated into the educational plan of the proposal, which is centered on the use of the field laboratory and the wind turbine as a hands-on learning facility. Teachers, graduate and undergraduate students will participate in this project. \r\n\r\nThe PI proposes to develop a super-large-scale particle image velocimetry (SLPIV) technique that will be complemented by laboratory scale experiments to understand full-scale wake dynamics around wind turbines. The innovation of this proposal is that SLPIV will be implemented by using snowflakes as natural tracers to quantify incoming turbulence and wake flow fields around a fully-instrumented wind turbine at the University of Minnesota. The field data will then inform the design of laboratory scale experiments that will aim to reproduce the key full-scale wake phenomena by tuning controllable experimental parameters.  This proposal's goal to decipher the dynamics of the atmospheric layer behind a full scale wind turbine has both fundamental and practical importance. Better understanding of the turbine wake behavior and the fluid-solid interaction can lead to 10-20% improvements in the efficiency of wind turbines, while the establishment of the SLPIV as a ubiquitous experimental method can allow its use to study large scale ABL turbulence. Our climate, agriculture, and commerce are affected by the turbulence within the ABL.",

Specifically, combined with numerical simulation, our experiment investigated the generation of secondary vortical structures due to centrifugal instability in the near wake of utility-scale turbine [Yang <em>JFM</em> 2016]. Through a systematic investigation of SLPIV field deployments under different wind and turbine operational conditions, we examined the influence of turbine operation on the near-wake behavior and tip vortices [Dasari <em>JFM</em> 2019]. &nbsp;In particularly, in this study, we discovered the frequently-present wake contraction behavior in the field which is not commonly observed in the numerical simulation and laboratory studies and its relationship with turbine blade pitch control under certain operational regimes. Furthermore, utilizing SLPIV technique, we investigated the influence of turbine operation on incoming flow [Li <em>JWEIA</em> 2020] and flow structures produced by turbine nacelle and tower and their impact on wake development [Abraham <em>JWEIA</em> 2019]. Moreover, through further extension of our SLPIV, we examined the combined effect of turbine operation and stochastic incoming flow on the whole 3D near wake behavior and revealed a phenomenon referred to as dynamic wake modulation [Abraham <em>AE</em> 2020]. We found that the dynamic wake modulation can cause wake oscillation and contraction and expansion that add significant amount of wake mixing in addition to that associated with atmospheric turbulence. Combining our measurements with large eddy simulation, we elucidated the underlying physical mechanisms of dynamic wake modulation [Abraham <em>JFM</em> 2021] and its influence on near and far wake evolution [Abraham <em>Torque</em> 2020]. Using similar techniques, we further examined the effect of atmospheric coherent structures on turbine power generation, structural response, and wake evolution [Abraham <em>Flow </em>2021]. Such tools also enabled us to reveal the strong interaction of turbine wake with the ground and elucidate its dependence on turbine operation, and determine its influence on surface fluxes and the corresponding environmental impact [Abraham <em>RSER</em> 2021]. &nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Working along a different path in this project, we have applied data analytics approach to extensively investigate a number of practical problems related to the operation of utility-scale wind turbines using 10-year database from Eolos Wind Energy Research Field Station. We have established a strong collaboration with the major Midwest utility company Xcel Energy to test advanced data analytics and turbine controls for optimizing wind farm operations. Specifically, we investigated systematically the turbine blade response under different wind and turbine operational conditions [Gao JWEIA 2020]. Our study of wind veering (i.e., wind direction changes with height) effect on turbine power generation and structures [Gao POF 2021] enabled us to develop optimal yaw controls for turbines under various veering conditions. The deployment of this strategy requires nearly-zero cost and can potentially increase production equivalent to above $20k/year profit for each turbine based on our estimate. Moreover, we conducted a systematic field investigation of the impact of icing on turbine power generation, operational control, and structural response [Gao CRST 2021] and developed novel controls for icing mitigation. Different from conventional methods (e.g., distributive heating, coating, plasma, etc.), our method does not require installing any new components on the turbines, and instead utilizes the blade pitch and turbine yaw to adjust flow around turbine blades to suppress ice formation and accretion, allowing it to be readily implemented to existing turbines with no icing protection (e.g., the turbines that suffered in the Texas 2021 power crisis). In addition, we developed advanced turbine icing forecast models to predict the power loss for individual wind farm and electric grid at regional scales. These models were implemented to accurately predict icing-induced power loss for individual turbines and farms [Swenson AE 2022] and during the extreme weather in Texas Feb 2021 [Gao SETA 2022]. Last but not the least, we developed learning-based autonomous turbine yaw alignment methods [Gao JRSE 2021]. It can calibrate and minimize the turbine yaw misalignment due to degrading nacelle sonic and dynamic wind shift which contributes more than 5% power loss in existing wind farms (based on our analysis of field data) at zero cost. All these innovations are being deployed to Xcel Energy wind farms and data platform for long-term tests and have shown promising results.</p>\n<p>Our project has generated in total 14 journal papers, three conference papers, two patents, and two additional IP disclosures.
