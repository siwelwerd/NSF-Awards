This conference will offer a unique forum and intimate professional setting for the exchange of new ideas, presentation and discussion of unpublished results, speculative discussions, and opportunities for new\r\ninterdisciplinary collaborations among attendees. \r\n\r\nIn the past two decades, advances in microfluidic technologies have impacted manufacturing (with good control of parallel reactions in small scales and specialized manufacturing with the use of minimal resources), separations technologies, bioanalytics, and self assembly processes. In this conference, the speakers will discuss the very latest progress in their research in the area of microfluidic and nanofluidic systems for a wide variety of applications from genomics to proteomics to nanotechnology to chemical synthesis to energy. The areas of focus for this conference include the following: 1) Water filtration and desalination, 2) Energy and Carbon management, 3) Point-of-care diagnostics, 4) Concentrated suspensions in confined systems, 5) Rare cells capture and analysis, 6) Manipulation and analysis of single molecules, 7) Droplet microfluidics, 8) Microfluidic biotechnology.",
