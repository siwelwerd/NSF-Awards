 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central idea in this project is to motivate students to pursue studies in STEM areas by creating and disseminating scalable modules that demonstrate in a compelling manner how math and engineering theory enables modern applications such as those embedded in wireless devices.  The goal is to motivate graduates to create high-tech products, enter the high-tech workforce, and become innovators. This project will promote a transformative STEM education agenda by developing and disseminating innovative and scalable content for several courses. These innovative products will promote a positive attitude change towards learning STEM concepts by continuously fusing theory with high tech applications. Objectives include developing a diverse community of users, innovative products with mobile video-streamed content, software training modules for skill building, e-books, and training workshops. The PIs will create and disseminate products on multidisciplinary STEM applications in areas including engineering, arts and media, and earth systems.  \r\n\r\nThe innovative educational modules will have comprehensive multidisciplinary content to address diverse audiences. Modules will be packaged for mobile delivery and will be multipurpose, multidisciplinary, and will: a) motivate students to learn theory through compelling applications, b) engage students in implementation for skill building and workforce creation purposes, and c) immerse diverse audiences and stakeholders in hands-on workshops for outreach, retention, and recruitment purposes. This project is based on collaboration between ASU and Clarkson University and engages faculty from Johns Hopkins University, Phoenix College, St. Lawrence University, Prairie View A&M University, and Corona del Sol high school. The project will use a mixed-method assessment process (qualitative and quantitative data collection) to build an understanding of the impact of the use of the modules, apps, and other tools on student learning gains, from the individual concept level to more general knowledge about scientific and engineering habits of mind and research practice. Assessments will be done through electronic web tools, pre- and post- quizzes, presentations, one-to-one interviews, and ordinary in-class testing.",

The course was taught for the first time in the Fall of 2018. The course had students from Mechanical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Software Engineering.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">eModules have been developed, which contain several components that distinguish them from other demonstration apps and programs. The tools embedded in a typical eModule are demonstrations with supporting notes, exercises, quizzes, and companion videos. eModules have been developed to demonstrate echolocation, localization, machine learning, and cybersecurity concepts. The eModules are designed to supplement undergraduate coursework and help with better concept delivery. The eModules assist in teaching concepts in localization, ranging, and machine learning, in addition to algorithm development and linear algebra. Higher-level topics such as noise and statistics can also be addressed. These eModules can be used in junior and senior level communications, pattern recognition, and signal processing classes.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">Three eModules have been developed. Two apps (Reflections and Reflections Lite) that demonstrate echolocation are now on Google Play. An app to demonstrate localization based on Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is in a lab Beta. A web-module to demonstrate password hardening has been published. The user is asked to enter the password \"password\". Only if the typing behavior matches the template user, access will be provided. Educational material, as well as a quiz, are provided as part of the eModules. Other work in development includes an Android app to perform elementary video analysis and algorithms for voice assistants.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The eModules can be used in classrooms at multiple levels. For example, the Reflections app was used in undergraduate classrooms for both signal processing and machine learning applications. Workshops were conducted in a junior-level signals and systems class, and in a senior level signal processing class to evaluate the effectiveness of the app in demonstrating concepts in signal processing.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">In a junior-level Systems and Signal Processing class. The benefits of using the app for teaching concepts was measured using pre/post quizzes. A survey was given in order to obtain student experience with the app. Specific concepts covered were: (1) Autocorrelation; (2) Round-trip time; (3) Distance Estimate; (4) Correlation; (5) Symmetry of the autocorrelation; and (6) Noise effects. From the results, students were able to learn concepts including what signals help with better correlation results; the role of correlation in ranging; and several other areas of interest, such as the effect of noise on signal processing algorithms. Furthermore, most students agreed that ?The app was fun to use?; ?The exercises were helpful?; and ?The workshop was helpful?.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">With the increasing impact of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) on society, and the increased awareness of these topics among students, there is a growing need to teach these concepts at the undergraduate level. However, the methods used to teach these concepts need to be appropriate to the level of understanding of the students. Two different assessment methods were used to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach: one using the Reflections app in a single session, and one using project-based methods across an entire semester.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">In the first experiment, we use one of the applications of the Reflections app. The Reflections app is ideally suited for the space characterization task. Audio cross-correlation data obtained from the app can be fed into a machine learning algorithm that then determines the best use of the space. A workshop was conducted in a senior level Signal Processing and Applications course. Specific topics covered in each question that was asked in the pre-/post-quiz are: (1) Comparison between kNN and SVM; (2) Properties of a kernel SVM classifier; (3) Cross-validation; (4) Supervised machine learning (5) Random forests; (6) Principal component analysis (PCA). Students were able to show improvement in understanding of machine learning concepts as can be seen from the results of the pre/post quiz. The students also found the workshop to be helpful in getting acquainted with machine learning concepts.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">A semester-long effort was also conducted. The objective of this exercise was to determine whether machine learning concepts could be introduced at the Junior-level in a Signals and Systems course. Through the semester, via projects, various activities, including dimensional analysis and dimensionality reduction, PCA, classification, statistical decision theory, and digital modulation were introduced to students through a combination of theoretical material and computer exercises. Concept questions were asked in a pre-quiz and post-quiz format, with the pre-quiz at the beginning of the semester and the post-quiz at the end. Students showed improvement in all areas they were exposed to. In a survey at the end of the semester, about 90% of the students agreed that they liked the activities, learned from them, and felt this was an effective way for them to learn the material.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/02/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mahesh&nbsp;Banavar</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1525224/1525224_10396861_1606611865092_Reflections_app_screenshots--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1525224/1525224_10396861_1606611865092_Reflections_app_screenshots--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Reflections App Screenshots\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1525224/1525224_10396861_1606611865092_Reflections_app_screenshots--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Reflections App Screenshots\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Two eModule apps (Reflections and Reflections Lite) that demonstrate echolocation are now on Google Play. eModules contain several components that distinguish them from other demonstration apps and programs such as supporting notes, exercises, quizzes, and companion videos.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mahesh Banavar</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mahesh&nbsp;Banavar</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Reflections App Screenshots</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1525224/1525224_10396861_1606611373420_pre_post_UG_SP--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1525224/1525224_10396861_1606611373420_pre_post_UG_SP--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Improvements - SP workshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1525224/1525224_10396861_1606611373420_pre_post_UG_SP--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Improvements - SP workshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Results of the pre-quiz and post-quiz.
