The objective of the proposal is to request support for US graduate students, junior researchers and under-represented minorities working in the field of quantitative environmental sciences to participate at the 25th Annual Meeting of The International Environmetrics Society (TIES). \r\n\r\nThe rampant growth of digital technologies and information storage have revolutionized the volume, velocity and variety of collected information, leading to the so-called \"Big Data\" paradigm. In turn, this alters the way in which environmental scientists sense and analyze the available information dramatically, and ignites an ever-increasing interest in the Big Data phenomenon virtually everywhere, from smart and sustainable cities to renewable energy to health and business analytics. However, Big Data is not only about managing massive data volumes, it is much more on developing pioneering ways to connect various knowledge domains and fuse information from non-traditional sources. Indeed, what is substantially less discussed at the workshops on Big Data is the whelm of new ground-breaking interdisciplinary links that emerge from these massive information volumes. For example, what is common between Facebook, natural disaster awareness and ecological foodwebs' Who is responsible for increasing house insurance rates: outdated building standards, city infrastructure or climate change, and what can be done in the short and long-term perspectives' In the era of massive multi-platform, multi-scale and multi-source data, there appear increasingly more such examples that fall well beyond the scope of any single discipline or field of research practice and that connect across domains with new fascinating capabilities. Such problems must be addressed simultaneously from different perspectives, ranging from modern statistical sciences to pure and applied studies of Earth systems and their exposure to physical and human influences to environmental engineering and public policy. TIES2015 conference will highlight an interdisciplinary dimension of modern environmental research and will facilitate a better understanding of implications of climate change on ecosystems, economics, policy and our society as a whole.",
