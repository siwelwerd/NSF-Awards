 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Towson University will acquire a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)  system.  The system will be used to analyze the composition of complex materials obtained from various sources including samples from environmental sources, chemical reactions or biological origins. In this system, the liquid chromatograph (LC) separates the mixture into its individual components. Then the mass spectrometer (MS) ionizes the components and determines their mass by measuring the mass to charge ratio (m/z) of the ions. This is a widely used analytical tool to identify what is the composition of a mixture or material. The instrument will be used by students in their research, training them with sophisticated, modern instrumentation. Students in laboratory courses will be trained to use it including students in the only BS Forensic Chemistry program in Maryland.\r\n\r\nThe award will be used in research projects, such as (a) investigating the formation of disinfection by-products in drinking water resulting from reactions between so-called inert constituents of herbicide formulations and chemical disinfectants; (b) analyzing chemical composition of atmospheric aerosols; (c) improving polymer-based controlled-release technology for anti-herpetic drugs; and (d) improving traceability of cocoa through chemometric analysis of chemical signatures.",
