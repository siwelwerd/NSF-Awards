 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among many different models used to describe wireless networks, the PIs will focus on the one commonly called the SINR (Signal-to-Noise-and-Interference Ratio) model.  It attempts to model the reception or non-reception of a wireless transmitter signal in the presence of interference from other transmitters and ambient noise. Much recent work has been devoted to analyzing the SINR model and using it to predict the behavior of real-life wireless networks.  One simple aspect of this model is the construction of a SINR reception map, which associates with every transmitter the region where it can be received and also contains a region where no signal can be received due to interference of multiple transmitters.  The exact map is difficult to compute due to the complexity of the so-called SINR inequality that determines whether or not a signal is received. Previous work has been done on approximating the reception map.  The methods for this computation suffer from slow construction times (so-called preprocessing times) and from the fact that, for transmitters of unequal power, the preprocessing time depends not only on the number of transmitters and the accuracy of the approximation, but on other parameters of the problem that can not be expressed in terms of these two.  The PIs will develop methods to overcome these by speeding up the preprocessing times.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the PIs will develop batch preprocessing for SINR-diagram point location queries.  They will then use these tools to speed up existing algorithms for SINR-governed wireless networks. The PIs will study fundamental problems arising in SINR-governed wireless networks, combining algebraic tools with techniques of computational geometry and combinatorial optimization. The PIs will investigate a diverse suite of problems, including how to cope with directional antennas, problems arising when successive interference cancellation is enabled, combinatorial problems concerning SINR diagrams, and combinatorial optimization problems such as scheduling under a restricted, more practical version of the SINR model.  The PIs will also investigate further applications of the underutilized combination of computer algebra and computational geometry tools in a more general context.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the geometric properties of SINR-governed networks and being able to analyze such networks and predict their behavior is extremely important.  Moreover, efficient solutions to the problems of this family, as well as to problems that PIs intend to study from a more practical point of view, will benefit the motivating application domain of wireless communication. These solutions are essential in the planning stages of such networks (e.g., determining where to locate the devices), for examining existing networks, and for utilizing them efficiently. In this respect, the proposed project has the potential for substantial socioeconomic impact, as the popularity of such networks is rapidly increasing.\r\n\r\nThe project incorporates an educational mission, through training of graduate students and reciprocal visits among students and participants from the two institutions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis NSF grant is a companion to the BSF grant 2014/170 \"SINR-Governed Wireless Networks: Geometric Analysis and Algorithms\".  This document summarizes the outcomes of the two grants.  The Israeli Co-PI on the BSF grant is Matthew (Matya) Katz of Ben-Gurion University. \n\nThe SINR (Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio) model attempts to more realistically predict whether a wireless transmission is received successfully, in a setting of multiple simultaneous transmitters and background noise, taking into account the attenuation of electromagnetic signals.  While much previous research focused on the implications and the properties of this model, relatively little work was devoted to efficiently answering basic questions in this setting.  In contrast, one of the main objectives of this project was to devise compact data structures for predicting whether one of the transmitters is received at a given query position and, if yes, which transmitter.  This objective has been attained.  We have described and analyzed data structures for such queries in several settings.\n\nWe started by presenting a very efficient batched algorithm, which solves the problem for a large number of simultaneous receiver locations.  We used a rarely-employed combination of algebraic techniques with conventional range-searching data structures.  This approach promises to be more universally applicable.\n\n\nWe then considered the more challenging version of the problem, where the transmitters are preprocessed to facilitate quick individual reception queries, and the setting is dynamic: transmitters can be added or removed over time, with the data structure updated efficiently.  The data structures handle both the case of uniform transmitter power (all transmitters are at the same power level) and non-uniform transmitter power (transmitters may transmit at different power levels).   All of our data structures are optimal up to logarithmic factors, except for one situation: dynamic data structure to handle the non-uniform power case.\n\n\nWe then constructed a dynamic data structure to solve a problem not heretofore addressed in the literature, to the best of our knowledge: Given a collection of sites with positive weights, say in the plane, facilitate multiplicatively weighted nearest-neighbor queries.  This involves identifying the site that has the closest distance to the query position, with the distance multiplied by the site's weight.  While additive weights are commonly handled, there does not appear to be a dynamic (i.e., allowing addition and removal of sites) data structure for handling multiplicative weights.  We constructed such a structure with optimal space, preprocessing, query time, and amortized update time, within logarithmic factors.\n\n\n The data structure described above was then used to settle the remaining dynamic SINR query problem, namely that of non-uniform transmitter powers, in time, space, query time, and amortized update time optimal within logarithmic factors.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe work formulated provably efficient (optimal within logarithmic factors) algorithms for answering essential questions in the SINR model of wireless networks.  A number of other geometric questions were studied as well, with significant progress made in geometric algorithm design.  Algebraic techniques we used will have further applications in computational geometry.\n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThe results of the work were presented at major conferences and competitive archival journals.  Several PhD and MS students and a postdoctoral associate were trained while participating in this research.  The tools developed in this project will prove useful in efficient simulation and optimization of SINR networks.  The multiplicatively weighted nearest-neighbor data structure for dynamic data will find applications in a wider context of geometric computation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Boris Aronov"
