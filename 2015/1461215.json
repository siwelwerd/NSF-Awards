The education of highly skilled researchers requires strong educational programs at all levels.   Research experiences can greatly influence the future and motivation of young engineers and scientists and can provide professional, intellectual, and personal benefits for undergraduate students.. By performing research projects related to a disease that affects more than 25 million people in the U.S., we have the potential to advance understanding while influencing your engineers in their career. The program specifically targets students without previous research experience. This focus combined with support from community college programs will provide the opportunity to impact students at critical career transition points. In addition to research experience students are provided with a broader understanding of the disease and its impact on society. The program impacts students at multiple academic stages. Mentoring activities will be provided and fostered for graduate students to facilitate interactions with the REU student, and REU students will develop an enrichment activity for a high school STEM program. The high school students are from diverse backgrounds and will be exposed to cutting edge engineering research and opportunities for impact in the field of diabetes.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nThe primary goals of this program in the Biomedical Engineering (BME) Department at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) are: 1) Students will experience engineering research by completing challenging diabetes-related projects with faculty at IIT.  2) Develop and apply mentoring in graduate and undergraduate researchers. 3) Expose student to the broader health implications of their research. 4) Provide engineering research experiences to students without previous experience with an emphasis on students from community colleges. 5) Integrate ethics discussion and training into all aspects of the student experience. Laboratory experience is an essential component of this research proposal. However, seminars, mentoring workshops, ethics training, a K-12 outreach activity and tours of clinical facilities are provided to enhance the experience.  \r\n\r\nUpon completion of the summer program students will have a diverse set of research skills and knowledge by completion of the following specific objectives: Specific Objective (S.O.) 1: Students complete a diabetes related research project working with an engineering mentor from IIT.  S.O. 2: Increase participation by targeted student populations, specifically students without previous research experience and those from colleges and universities where research opportunities in STEM are limited. S.O. 4: Develop and apply mentoring skills in graduate and REU students through training and interactions with students at multiple education levels.  S.O. 4: Increase student knowledge of the health implications related to diabetes and the importance of engineering research.  S.O. 5: Communicate research ideas and findings through both informal discussion and formal presentations. This proposal targets students with limited opportunity for engineering research and those from colleges and universities where research opportunities in STEM are limited (specifically community college students), with a specific focus on women and students from underrepresented minority groups. This Research Experiences for Undergraduates program receives support from the Division of Engineering Education and Centers.",
