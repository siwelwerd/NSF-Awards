 "awd_abstract_narration": "Hybridization (genetic mixing between two adjacent species) occurs in many animal and plant species, and is among the most important sources of new gene combinations and new traits in natural populations. Most studies describe hybridization at the population level, rather than describing how hybridization affects individuals. Understanding how hybridization affects individuals will reveal the processes that determine whether genes from one species permanently mix with those of another, or whether this mixing is limited to one or a few generations. Using a wild population of baboons in southern Kenya, this research will provide a detailed description of how hybridization affects individuals. As such, it will be an important model for similar processes in many other organisms, including ancestral humans (who are known to have hybridized with Neanderthals and, before that, with other members of the human lineage). The research involves an international team with substantial participation by women and underrepresented minorities. The team will also contribute teaching modules for middle schools and conduct numerous public outreach activities discussing baboon behavior.\r\n\r\nIn the first five years of the LTREB project, the Principal Investigator measured the effects of hybridization on a suite of traits that could limit or enhance genetic introgression. The objective of this renewal is to expand this suite of traits, using methods or data that require the longer time horizon afforded by the LTREB mechanism. The specific aims are to (i) identify the sources of the admixture-by-sex interaction previously documented in the maturation schedules of wild baboons, (ii) measure the contribution of genetic admixture to social behaviors that predict male reproductive success, (iii) measure the contribution of genetic admixture to social behaviors that predict female reproductive performance, and (iv) measure the contribution of genetic admixture to social behaviors that predict female lifespan. The proposed work will produce an exceptionally detailed study of the effects of admixture on fitness-related traits in a naturally hybridizing mammal population, which in turn will help shape future hypotheses about mechanisms promoting or inhibiting genetic introgression during hybridization in other species. The data for this project will be stored on a web-accessible PostGreSQL database. A detailed description of the standards for data and metadata can be found in publicly available documents with links at the Amboseli Baboon Research Project website (https://amboselibaboons.nd.edu/ ). All datasets underlying published papers are deposited in the public Dryad Data Repository.",

However, the determinants and outcomes of hybridization remain unknown in most species. The goal of this project was to evaluate ongoing natural hybridization in the well-studied baboon population of the Amboseli basin in East Africa, in an effort to understand how hybridization is linked to behavior, and to life history traits such as age at maturity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The Amboseli baboon population consists primarily of yellow baboons, but hybrids between yellow and anubis baboons are found in Amboseli because of the occasional immigration of anubis baboons from outside the basin; hybrids have resulted not only from anubis immigrations and subsequent mating, but also from the movement and successful reproduction of hybrid males between and within study and non-study groups. Consequently, hybrids in Amboseli result from yellow?anubis, yellow?hybrid, anubis?hybrid, and hybrid?hybrid matings, resulting in great variation in genetic hybrid scores.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To evaluate the extent of anubis admixture in Amboseli individuals, we have mostly employed microsatellite genotyping to generate a ?genetic hybrid score? that estimates the proportion of a baboon's genome that is attributable to each of the parent species. More recently, we have also begun to employ whole-genome estimates of hybridization using next-generation sequencing techniques.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The effects of hybridization are marked in the Amboseli study population. First, a male's genetic hybrid score predicts age at puberty, at adult social rank attainment, and at dispersal away from the natal social group. In comparison to males, the effects of hybridization in females, although detectable, are more muted. In females, only one maturational milestone ? age at menarche ? reveals an effect of hybridity, and this effect is small, accounting for only ~4% of the variation in age at menarche. Further, not only does genetic hybrid score have a smaller impact on female maturation, but maternal effects have a concomitantly greater impact: whether the mother survived through her daughter's juvenile period, the mother's dominance rank, and the presence of maternal sisters, have significant effects on the timing of female maturation. This difference between males and females ? in which maternal effects appear to mitigate genetic effects in females to a greater extent than in males ? reflects an interesting gene-by-sex interaction, a type of interaction rarely documented in wild mammal populations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also identified novel effects of hybridization on mating patterns, including an advantage accruing to males with more anubis baboon-like genotypes, as well as assortative mating (same-species preferences) among both yellow-like and anubis-like baboon pairs. Our results suggest that this population may be undergoing hybridization-related evolutionary change, driven in part by nonrandom mating. However, the strength of the genetic effect is mediated by behavioral plasticity and social interactions, emphasizing the strong influence of social context on mating behavior in socially complex species.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A surprising result of our research was the discovery that social dynamics can be affected by hybridization. For instance, ?winner and loser effects? describe the phenomenon in which winners tend to become more likely to win in subsequent encounters ? they get a ?winner?s bonus,? and losers tend to become more likely to lose ? they experience a ?loser?s tax.? &nbsp;Surprisingly, we found that, compared with more yellow-like individuals, animals with more anubis-like genotypes experienced smaller ?winner?s bonuses\" and smaller ?loser?s taxes,? indicating that social dynamics, and the manner in which an individual?s group-mates respond to that individual, depends partly on the individual?s genetic makeup. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Most recently, we have discovered that male-female social affiliative behavior is affected by hybridization. Specifically, increased anubis baboon genetic ancestry is associated with a subtle, but significantly higher, probability of engaging in non-sexual affiliative behavior with members of the opposite sex, for both males and females. Additionally, pairs of anubis-like males and anubis-like females were the most likely to socially affiliate, revealing a moderate preference for similarity in genetic background among one?s social partners. Our findings suggest that affiliative behavior may simultaneously promote and constrain baboon hybridization.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to these striking effects of hybridization, we also examined many traits that seem to be unaffected by hybridization, including hormone levels, social dominance rank, fertility and pregnancy success, lifespan, the manner in which social behavior affects survival, and the manner in which the effects of early life affect adult health and survival.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition to the scientific results, our project provided support for the maintenance of our database, which has been used as a model for several other long-term animal research projects, and for our database manager.
