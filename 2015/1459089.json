 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial funding for the Brookings Conference on Macroeconomics and the accompanying conference volume, the Brookings Papers on Macroeconomic Activity.  The conference is designed to bring together economic scientists to focus on the scientific analysis of economic policy issues.  These issues include the changing labor market, financial institutions, global economic policy, heath care, data improvement, inequality, and long run economic growth.  The papers presented at the conference are available online to the public.  They develop empirical analysis, employ a wide range of research methods, include real world institutions, and focus on relevance to policy.  The award promotes the national interest by improving the quality of the economics used in making policy decisions.\r\n\r\nBPEA's work not only adds to the body of economic literature but increases the contributions of economic research to our understanding of public policy.  This is in part due to a high degree of interaction among the organizers, researchers, discussants, and attendees.  Each researcher invited to present engages in an intensive process of three rounds of review, criticism, discussion and editing.  BPEA encourages scientists to apply the best knowledge of the profession to pressing policy issues and uses policy concerns to point the profession's way toward new science.",
