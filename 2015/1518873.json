 "awd_abstract_narration": "Racial residential segregation is a significant and persistent aspect of the American urban landscape even decades after de jure segregation was made illegal.  While segregation has declined modestly over time for Black Americans, the immense growth of other racial and ethnic minority groups since the 1960s has complicated this issue and revealed new patterns and trends in the urban racial makeup of the United States.  Prior research has linked residential segregation to a variety of social problems, including poor health across the life course. Yet the mechanisms that produce such an association are poorly understood.  This project will examine one such potential mechanism, the distribution of community organizational resources and how residents of such communities utilize those resources.  This study proposes that minority segregated communities may have diminished access to community organizational resources and that this differential access may contribute to differences in health statuses across communities.  \r\n\r\nWith these considerations in mind the project addresses the question of how racial/ethnic residential segregation is related to health outcomes for minority communities in the United States. The PI's will examine the question nationally, using Census data sources and the American Community Survey, as well as locally through a specialized survey of the Phoenix metropolitan area, the 2013 Phoenix Caregiver Satisfaction Survey. These data sources are paired with a comprehensive database of local community-serving organizations from another ongoing research project by the PI's.  Both data sources are used in an analysis of family access to health care resources, how that access is patterned by what is available in local communities, and how this in turn impacts long term health. In addition to the contributions to the academic literature, the project has practical implications for policy makers and public health practitioners.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nResearch has long established that racial/ethnic minority residential segregation is related to a variety of social problems, including poor health and health care outcomes.  Yet, little research in this area has attempted to tease out the mechanisms underlying this association.  Furthermore, within this work, few studies address this relationship for racial/ethnic minority groups outside of the Black/White differences.  In this project, I argue that community organizations and service providers in neighborhoods provide important local sites which can improve residents\u00c6 access to key health-related resources.  I put this forward as a mechanism which can link segregation to health and health care outcomes, in that racial/ethnic minority neighborhoods are less likely to have a variety of such establishments compared to their White counterparts.  I test this mechanism through a two-part research project. \n\nIn the first part, I analyze the distribution of health-related facilities by segregation status using nation-wide Census data sources.  I find that racial residential segregation for Blacks, and to a lesser extent Latinos and Asians, is related to a decrease in the density of such facilities, including food sources, fitness facilities, pharmacies, a number of health care organizations, civic society, and social services.  The inclusion of socio-economic indicators accounts for this effect for most of the health care organization outcomes, such as physician\u00c6s offices, dentist\u00c6s offices, and mental health professionals, across all three groups.  The effects remain, though, for the various other health-related organizations and when dividing up the organizational types by size of the organization.\n\nIn the second portion, I examine the full pathway of segregation, access to health care facilities, and health care utilization using the case of the Phoenix urbanized area.  Using a 2013-2014 survey of families about their children\u00c6s health care utilization combined with area-level Census measures, I test where families are able to obtain care for their children, if any location, in light of what is physically proximate to them in space, and how this may be patterned or constrained by the segregation status of their local neighborhood.  I find that Latino and Native American segregation is related to a decreased number of health care facilities.  Further, the lack of such facilities is related to a decreased likelihood of families being able to utilize a physician\u00c6s office as their regular source of care, versus a clinic or health care center.  However, for those who do not have a regular source of care, or who utilize an emergency room, this seems to be patterned more by economic considerations, chiefly whether or not the child has health insurance.  Further, the distribution of health care organizations also accounts for a sizable portion of the effect of segregation on health care utilization choices. \n\nAs a whole, this project demonstrates that segregation, for a number of racial/ethnic minority groups, is related to a lower density of a number of health-related organizations, both in a nationwide analysis, as well as through an extended case study of the Phoenix area.  Moreover, using the Phoenix case, I find that the lack of such facilities is consequential, and that at least for certain health care providers, patterns where families are able to go for their children\u00c6s health care needs. \n\nFurthermore, in terms of policy implications, improving access to local service provision of health-related organizations may improve health care utilization and health outcomes in such communities.  Previous work on segregation and health/health care demonstrates strong disparities in health outcomes for the residents of such areas.  However, this extant work has offered little in terms of specific explanatory mechanisms.  This research suggests that one mechanism (although certainly not the only mechanism) by which these two are linked is t..."
