 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the globalized modern world, marine organisms are often carried across oceans by ships. Remarkably few of these creatures are able to make the leap from stow-away to established colonist on a foreign shore. However, the ones that are successful can have enormous ecological and economic consequences on the communities they invade. This project will compare the reproductive behavior of a globally successful sea anemone across its native range in Japan to that observed across its invaded US range. This comparison is important for predicting what traits help a species become an invader and for understanding how natural variation contributes to the spread of a species. This work will be done in collaboration with Dr. Matthew Dick of Hokkaido University, whose expertise in the genetics of marine populations will be essential to the success of the project. \r\n\r\nThe asexual fission rate of the anemome Diadumene lineata is positively correlated with water temperature and negatively correlated with gamete production. These features produce a latitudinal gradient in reproductive strategy in the United States, with poleward populations skewed toward sexual reproduction where equatorial populations are predominantly clonal. While there is variation among populations in the degree of temperature sensitivity, all individuals divide faster in warm water and produce more gametes in cold water. These forms of life history plasticity are likely important in explaining the global success of this species, however, these features have only been studied in the invasive range thus far.  This project will use a combination of common garden growth studies and microsatellite genetic analysis on populations spanning the species? native range in Japan to understand how well the globally invasive lineages represent the genetic and life history variation present in the native range, in hopes of better understanding the role of reproductive plasticity in marine invasions. This NSF EAPSI award supports the research of a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",

The balance of these processes can influence patterns of population growth and genetic structure, as well as potentially play a role in how the species responds to novel and changing environments. The purpose of this project was to measure variation in reproductive strategy among populations of the globally invasive sea anemone, <em>Diadumene lineata</em>, in order to better understand which conditions favor asexual or sexual reproduction and the role that reproductive variation plays in facilitating invasion on novel shores. Over ten weeks, I visited 23 sites across the species&rsquo; native range in Japan, which spans more than ten degrees latitude and a significant temperature gradient. At each site where anemones were located, I measured the body size and reproductive status of individuals in the field and collected tissue samples for ongoing analysis of genetic connectivity among Japanese populations, and among Japanese populations and US populations, which likely originated in Japan. In addition, individuals from across Japan were successfully grown in common garden culture to characterize variation in growth and asexual fission rates. Preliminary analysis of the data shows that individuals vary in their growth and fission rates predictability with latitude of origin, that these differences likely contribute to the observed gradient in body size (where anemones tend to be larger in colder conditions), and that differences in body size positively correlate with differences in the probability of producing gametes as well as the volume of gametes produced. These relationships among population of origin, growth rate, fission rate and body size suggest that the growth and reproductive characteristics of an individual in a given habitat are influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Measuring and mapping variation in key life history traits, such as growth rate and reproductive investment, across different environments is not only important for understanding what causes biogeographic patterns of reproductive diversity, but also for making predictions about which genotypes will be most successful in colonizing novel habits. Coupled with the forthcoming genetic analysis, these data will help explain how genetic variation in temperature dependent reproductive plasticity has contributed to this species&rsquo; success in colonizing novel habitats around the world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/15/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Will&nbsp;Ryan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1515296/1515296_10367643_1458069812335_IMG_8755-Version2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1515296/1515296_10367643_1458069812335_IMG_8755-Version2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Diadumene lineata, type I\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2016/1515296/1515296_10367643_1458069812335_IMG_8755-Version2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Diadumene lineata, type I\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">D. lineata with type I color morphology collected in Tanabe Bay, Wakayama, Japan.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Will H.
