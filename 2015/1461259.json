 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support efforts to bring together geospatial scholars from around the world for the Geocomputation 2015 conference at the University of Texas-Dallas in Richardson, Texas.  NSF support will facilitate the participation of up to 50 scholars and graduate students.  This now-biennial conference usually is held in Europe, with this event being only the third time it has been held in the U.S.  Geocomputation 2015 will advance the spatial research, promote teaching and learning, and enhance existing networks among U.S. and international spatial scientists.  The conference will provide opportunities to share latest research and advance knowledge about critical meta-topics in a wide range of social and environmental science research involving geocomputational issues.  It also will facilitate scientific collaboration among young, underrepresented, and international researchers who may not ordinarily have such networking opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn geocomputation as in many other scientific fields, advances in research and education increasingly rely on the development of international collaborations that bring together skilled scholars and educators from many different nations.  The Geocomputation conference is an especially important forum that brings together a high caliber of geospatial scientists performing innovative and transformative work in computational science and methods.  Examples of critical topics that the conference will cover are visualization and virtual reality, optimization of operating across a range of spatio-temporal scales, data mining, and knowledge discovery.  Their practical applications will be found in a broad spectrum of natural science, social science, environmental, and engineering scientific fields as well as in a broader range of real-world domains.",
