The facility consists of combined large-scale horizontal and vertical interactive surfaces, which support touch, pen, and tangible interaction.\r\n\r\nPlans for using the facility for research and teaching activities include Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research on novel interaction techniques for large-scale interactive surfaces, social media analytics, visual programming, learning analytics for intelligent learning interfaces, and visualization of biological, neuroscience, and chemistry information. In particular, the facility will enable research on: 1) novel interaction techniques for large-scale multi-surface environments; 2) new interactive visualizations for various domains including journalism, genomics, neuroscience, chemistry, and learning analytics; 3) understanding of how large-scale multi-surface environments impact collaborative learning of complex concepts; and 4) design guidelines and best-practices for large-scale multi-surface interactive visualizations for collaborative exploration.",
