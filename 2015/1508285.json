 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most bone grafting procedures to date still use autograft or allograft materials as the standard of care, which require tissue harvesting, are expensive, and are difficult to form into patient-specific implants. The proposed new materials technology platform allows for the synthesis and 3D-printing of customizable or off-the-shelf products that closely mimic tissue such as bone. Its unique mechanical and biological properties, combined with the ease of fabrication, potential for scalability, and low material and processing costs make this material system a very promising new bone tissue substitute for patients suffering from orthopaedic, dental, or craniomaxillo facial tissue defects.  This new technology has the potential to transform the standard of care for these applications, while significantly reducing medical costs associated with product manufacturing, surgical procedures, and patient recovery times. \r\n\r\nUnlike other high ceramic-content biomaterials, which are brittle, require high temperature processing, and have limited bioactivity, the proposed patent-pending material, Hyperelastic Bone (HB), has elastic and formable qualities and can be rapidly fabricated at room temperature from liquid inks into complex, custom or mass-produced, implantable structures using an extrusion-based 3D-printing platform. Additionally, the proposed 3D printable material platform enables users to tailor the implant through control of a variety of parameters, including overall architecture, porosity, strength, stiffness, absorbency, and bioactivity. Biological testing shows that this material is biocompatible and effectively supports cell and tissue infiltration as well as bone formation.",

The major goals of this project were to 1) Determine if there was a clinical/surgical need for HB and identify its value propositions, 2) Determine if there was a clincial need, which specific medical indication (spine, sports ortho, craniofacial, ect.) had the greatest need, and 3) Develop a much more comprehensive understanding of the commercial and regulatory hurdles that need to be addressed to translate HB into a successful medical product.</p>\n<p>At the start of the ICORPs program we knew there was great potential to apply HB to a variety of surgical applications involving bone or bone-to-soft tissue repair. But we really didn&rsquo;t know where to focus and how to begin. During our initial customer interviews with surgeons (orthopaedic, spine, neural, plastic and craniofacial), we soon realized that 3D printed patient specific geometries were less important than the ability for the graft to be intraoperatively manipulated. We also learned that regardless of the product cost and improvements over existing graft materials, adoption by surgeons would be challenging if it is not reimbursed through insurance. We validated the need for HB in different medical applications, identified a number of its value propositions with several surgical customer segments, identified regulatory and insurance-related processes involved with moving a new biomedical device to market, and identified the relevant existing channels that could aid in bringing our product to surgeons. A key learning from these interviews included the need to really pinpoint our value propositions so we can connect them to the ultimate claims we want to achieve through FDA approval, which will direct the preclinical and clinical studies we would need to perform (Fig. 1).&nbsp; We also learned that the most viable path forward for getting our product into the hands of surgeons is to partner with an existing biomedical company. These strategic partners not only provide aid in navigating FDA approval, insurance reimbursement, and the healthcare system, but also have the existing sales and marketing infrastructure and established relationships with hospitals and surgical centers to introduce new products. Finally, to put us in the optimal position for partnering, we discovered what biomedical companies look for when working with startups:&nbsp; a strong sense of what the product is and its value propositions, data demonstrating safety and efficacy of the technology, understanding any concerns regarding reimbursement, and the ability to forecast revenues and expenses.</p>\n<p>From the data and knowledge gained from this experience we have decided to move forward in creating and founding a startup, Dimension Inx, that will help translate Hyperelastic Bone into multiple end products using a 3-prong revenue model (Fig. 2).
