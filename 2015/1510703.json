 "awd_abstract_narration": "This EAGER award funds a collaborative study to study the turbulence of gas and dust in the material that will form planets around stars.   The mechanism to be studied could be important in forming the small rocky bodies that are the cores of future planets, and whose process of formation is poorly understood.  This study has potential impact in understanding the formation of our own Solar System and of the planets around other stars. The research will create a team consisting of undergraduate and graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars. The collaborative nature of our research will synergistically provide opportunities for students at San Francisco State University, a minority-serving non-PHD institution, to work with students and faculty at University of California at Berkeley. The investigators will also train and mentor a postdoctoral researcher.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish their science goals, the team will compute angular momentum transport in a protoplanetary disk (PPD) dead zone filled with large-amplitude turbulence, compute the rate at which dust and rocks accumulate and agglomerate in a turbulent PPD, and compute mixing in a PPD. In particular, they will determine if the ingredients from which chondrules form become sufficiently mixed that their composition agrees with observations.  They will also develop the capability to carry out the above-listed calculation of momentum transport efficiently by extending their current spectral code, which works with anelastic flows, to one that works with fully-compressible flows with Mach numbers less than 3 (as in dead zones). The team will develop the capability to carry out the above-listed calculations of planetesimal and chondrule formation efficiently by replacing their \"particle-tracking\" code with one that models the rocks and dust as different phases of the fluid flow.",

Unfortunately, the Keplerian motion within a disk is assumed by most astrophysicists to be stable by Rayleigh&rsquo;s theorem because the angular momentum of the disk increases with increasing radius. We show that there is a new purely hydrodynamic instability that is violent and destabilizes the protoplanetary disk, filling it with turbulence. The essential ingredients of the new instability are rotation, shear, and vertical density stratification, so the instability can occur in stratified Boussinesq (or fully compressible) Couette flows. Our new instability, called the zombie vortex instability, occurs at critical layers where neutrally-stable eigenmodes are singular in the inviscid limit (but finite, with a width that scales as the Reynolds number Re to the -1/3 power when viscosity is present) and requires an initial finite-amplitude perturbation. In a flow initialized with weak Kolmogorov noise with initial Mach number Ma, when Ma &gt; Re<sup>-1/2</sup> (~10<sup>-7</sup> in a protoplanetary disk) the instability will be triggered and create turbulence and large-volume and large-amplitude vortices that fill the disk. When the initial perturbation is an isolated vortex, the vortex triggers a new generation of vortices at the nearby critical layers. After this second generation of vortices grows large, it triggers a third generation. The triggering of subsequent generations continues <em>ad infinitum</em> in a self-similar manner creating a 3D lattice of turbulent 3D vortices. Viscous dissipation is unimportant in protoplanetary disks, but thermal dissipation is. In the disk thermal dissipation is a function of the distance from the midplane of the disk. At the midplane, the characteristic cooling time is approximately 1/1000 of a year, but that cooling time increases as an inverse Gaussian as a function of the distance from the midplane so that at distances that are one or more pressure scale heights above and below the disk, the cooling time is several million years or longer. If the cooling time were 1/1000 of a year everywhere throughout the disk, the zombie vortex instability would be suppressed and never grow into self-sustained turbulence. On the other hand, if the cooling time were constant over the disk, and if it were several years or longer, then the zombie vortex instability would grow into self-sustained turbulence. What happens in a real disk where the cooling time is fast at the midplane but decreases as one moves away from the midplane? The 5 figures answer this question. The first figure shows the vertical vorticity as a function of position in the disk. This initial perturbation is very weak homogeneous, isotropic Kolmogorov turbulence, so it is dominated by the small scales. Does it grow or decay in time? The second figure shows that in the first 600 years that the zombie instability has launched intense zombie turbulence, which is not homogeneous or isotropic but the turbulence only exists at distances greater than one pressure scale height from the midplane. The third figure shows that by 1300 years the turbulence has advected all the way to the midplane, that the advected turbulence differs from the zombie turbulence away from the midplane, and that the turbulent flow is anisotropic with a banded structure in the azimuthal direction. The fourth figure shows that at later times the turbulence has a much more laminar appearance. After a few thousand years the turbulence is self-sustaining with Mach numbers greater than 10, but it oscillates intermittently between a fully turbulent state, as in the third figure, and a more laminar state, as in the fourth figure. The cause of the intermittency is the fact that flow oscillates back and forth between a banded zonal structure (best shown by the red colored cyclonic vorticity) with 5 bands and 6 bands. The last figure shows the flow changing between 5 and 6.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/21/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Philip&nbsp;S&nbsp;Marcus</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1510703/1510703_10351607_1503274517594_zombies0--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1510703/1510703_10351607_1503274517594_zombies0--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"0\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1510703/1510703_10351607_1503274517594_zombies0--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"0\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Vorticity (random, Kolmogorov) at the initial time.
