 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to accelerate the pace\r\nof research and development to enable more rapid deployment of technologies\r\ninto commercial / industrial contexts. In many fields, information is expanding at\r\nsuch an exponential rate that finding relevant results to technical knowledge\r\nsearches is increasingly difficult. Further, content is expanding so fast that most\r\nfields are rapidly forming sub-disciplines, leading to the ?silo-ing? of different\r\nknowledge sub-domains, a clear challenge to both academia and industry. We\r\nneed ever better ways to organize and present information to users. There are\r\ndisadvantages of the current search engines, mostly relating to excessive\r\nsimilarity in search results. Further, while these engines present information\r\nrelating to a known search target, they are less effective at presenting\r\nunexpected results for information that a user has never heard of but that would\r\nbe useful. What is therefore needed is an exploration system giving searchers a\r\nstrong serendipitous element with a maximum likelihood of results from diverse,\r\nunexpected, and potentially provocative sources. This will break down silos by\r\nproviding a rapid, relevant means for knowledge-transfer between different\r\ndisciplines, fostering interdisciplinary innovation. This system has been designed\r\nto provide a means for systematic, automated discovery.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project is focused on\r\noptimizing and scaling a serendipitous document search system for repurposing\r\ntechnologies by analogy into lateral fields. Both by sub-parsing discrete content\r\ninto ontologically separable entities, such as capability, characteristic, and\r\ncomposition, and by comparatively assessing certain of these attributes between\r\nsuch entities, the attribute relatedness of these entities can be used to drive their\r\nself-assembly into related attribute networks. This approach provides a\r\nsignificant value proposition for drug repurposing, which is the current focus of\r\nthis project. To scale the pair-wise comparison and network assembly of millions\r\nof documents, a map-reduce based text-processing framework will be developed\r\nso that massively parallel computations can be carried out in a time- and costefficient\r\nmanner. A distributed search engine technology will be deployed to\r\nenable rapid querying of the emerging document relationship network. A series of\r\nmachine learning algorithms will then be used to determine potentially hidden\r\nstructural architectural features within the document relationship network.\r\nMachine learning will elucidate the nature of the relationships in drug networks\r\nthrough analyses of inter-node relationships and sub-graph motifs (termed\r\n?innovation motifs?). Documents including U.S. patents and scientific papers will\r\nbe processed in the system.",
