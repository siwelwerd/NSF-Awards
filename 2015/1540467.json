 "awd_abstract_narration": "Carla Hern\u00e1ndez Garavito, of Vanderbilt University, along with colleagues in Peru, will undertake research on how familiar sociocultural practices between local communities and expanding imperial political systems impacted the development of mutually legible socio-political orders in the 15th-16th century Inca Empire. The concept of legibility refers to a continuous political process, in which states use familiar idioms between them and their subjects to exert political and economic control over local populations. Legibility may serve the state as a tool of political subjugation, but it also may reinforce shared idioms in ways that were leveraged by local communities for their own interests. As with modern societies, past ones were subject to processes of global politics, yet the growing gap in the anthropological understanding of the inner workings of ancient and modern empires has rendered local/global relationships in the past into a simplified dichotomy of direct/indirect control. Through an interdisciplinary archaeological and historical approach, this research will investigate the critical period when the rules of imperial control were negotiated and established. This project significantly contributes and expands currently scholarship: 1. by using the concept of legibility to analyze the specific means through which subject groups shape political and economic processes of imperialism; 2. in characterizing a single imperial strategy as a diachronic process, from its local inception to negotiation between imperial and local practices; 3. by situating this research within global issues of state and local interaction. \r\n\r\nMrs. Hern\u00e1ndez and her research team will use archaeological excavation, mapping, archival research, and specialized material analyses, to investigate the role of public ritual and places as critical idioms of interaction between the Inka Empire and the local community in the Huarochir\u00ed region in the Peruvian Andes. Over the course of a hundred years, the Inka created the largest empire in the Americas, extending at its height over 906,000 km2 of western South America and weaving together a patchwork of ethnic diversity. Through targeted excavations in two sites containing both local and Inka standard public spaces and through an interdisciplinary methodology, this project will reveal a subtle means of hegemonic interaction that helped to shape Inka imperialism and the diverse material signatures of state imposition. This project will offer collaborative education and training opportunities for U.S. and Peruvian archaeology and history students, and will promote collaboration with local community members and Peruvian academic institutions. This research is of direct relevance to foster a critical understanding of how imperial policies created the conditions for incorporating and maintaining mutually legible local/state practices and how local forms helped to shape state politics.",

I focused on the highland province of Huarochir&iacute;, homeland of the Yauyos ethnic group. Huarochir&iacute; was selected since the colonial written record of this area is rich, descriptive, and includes a unique document in Andean scholarship: the Huarochir&iacute; Manuscript [1608], a locally produced account in which the Yauyos recount their own story, myths, traditions, and their interaction with the Inka. This research focused on three specific aspects: archival research, archaeological excavation of two sites in Huarochir&iacute; (Ampugasa, a large residential settlement, and Canchaje, an Inka-built ceremonial center), and material analysis from the excavation collections. Specifically, the focus was on the continued use of public areas such as plazas, and distinguishing local Yauyos ritual from Inka changes in these ritual practices.</p>\n<p>Working with an international team, which included Peruvian, Colombian and Belgian students, and working in direct partnership with our host communities, I conducted excavations in Ampugasa between July and mid-October of 2015, and in Canchaje between mid- October and early December of 2015. While my proposal centered on excavation of the plazas, I was also able to excavate in residential spaces. This enabled comparison of ritual and domestic areas within and between each site. Following fieldwork, I conducted material analysis in Lima between January and July, 2016. Afterwards, I came back to the United States to start work on my dissertation and to bring archaeological samples for further testing in the Elemental Analysis Facility at the Field Museum of Chicago, the W.M. Keck Carbon Cycle Accelerator Mass Spectrometer at the University of California-Irvine, and the Bioarchaeology and Stable Isotope Research Lab at Vanderbilt University.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Excavations in Ampugasa.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>The focus of excavation was an outcrop-plaza complex. We also excavated in a small circular plaza, a funerary area, and two different types of residential groups: circular agglomerated structures that dated to pre-Inka Yauyos use, and rectangular enclosures in the hillside from the Inka period. In total, we excavated an area of approximately 200m<sup>2</sup>. The excavation confirmed a pre-Inka and Inka period occupation, confirmed by AMS radiocarbon dating. Through the excavations, we identified a specific type of Yauyos ritual space: large rock outcrops surrounded by small plazas, and associated with funerary offerings. Through the analysis of the materials associated with the outcrops, we found evidence of Inka ceramics associated with it, yet no evidence of changes in the morphology or practices carried out in this outcrop plazas. Material analysis also confirmed that the main changes the Inka incorporation brought to the site was the construction of new residential structures, rather than a change in ritual spaces.</p>\n<p><strong>Excavations in Canchaje.</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Canchaje, unlike Ampugasa, only a small number of domestic structures. It included an outcrop plaza that was similar and larger than the one in Ampugasa. It also features two other large plazas: one was trapezoidal and another semi-circular. These plazas were associated with an orthogonal complex where, we hypothesized, storage and administrative activities were carried out. We excavated approximately 230m<sup>2</sup><span>&nbsp;in the site</span>, including its trapezoidal and semi-circular plazas, orthogonal structures associated with them, and the outcrop plaza. While dates for the plazas fell within the Inka period, the outcrop dated to the pre-Inka period. Canchaje yielded a less amount of Inka ceramic sherds than Ampugasa, even though the architecture was of Inka-provincial style. Building on these data, we hypothesize that Canchaje was originally a Yauyos shrine, initially limited to the outcrop plaza. After the Inka incorporation, the Inka have built the other two plazas and administrative structures in an attempt to connect their own ritual spaces with the Yauyos local ones. The outcrop was not modified by the Inka, even though some of the materials associated are of Inka style.</p>\n<p>Through historical analysis we developed a spatial geo-database that traced changes in the Huarochir&iacute; territory in the early colony to frame the existing historical research on the Yauyos. Material analyses included: Laser Ablation Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry of a sample of 100 ceramic sherds; flotation and residue analysis from 40 soil samples; lithic analysis using portable X-ray Fluorescence devices on a collection of lithic points from Canchaje; stable isotope analysis in funerary remains from Ampugasa; Accelerator Mass Spectrometry radiocarbon dating; among others. Building on this holistic research, we hypothesize that the Inka incorporation of Huarochir&iacute; was a negotiated enterprise rather than a full attempt to directly control the region. The rock outcrops, which were already features imbued with ritual meaning among the Yauyos, were also used by the Inka first as a way to immerse themselves in local rituality, and then attach to it their own public spaces and meaning. In this way, legitimation of Inka ritual rested on existing local rituals.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/28/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Carla&nbsp;C&nbsp;Hernandez</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540467/1540467_10381896_1497741746982_Fig.14_Plazas--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540467/1540467_10381896_1497741746982_Fig.14_Plazas--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Canchaje, Huarochir&iacute;\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540467/1540467_10381896_1497741746982_Fig.14_Plazas--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Canchaje, Huarochir&iacute;\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The site of Canchaje, Lahuaytambo district, Huarochir\u00ed, Lima, Peru</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carla Hern\u00e1ndez Garavito</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carla&nbsp;C&nbsp;Hernandez</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Canchaje, Huarochir\u00ed</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540467/1540467_10381896_1498671999367_IMG_0006--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540467/1540467_10381896_1498671999367_IMG_0006--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Ampugasa\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1540467/1540467_10381896_1498671999367_IMG_0006--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Ampugasa\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ampugasa, Huarochir\u00ed</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carla Hern\u00e1ndez Garavito</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Carla&nbsp;C&nbsp;Hernandez</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Ampugasa</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
