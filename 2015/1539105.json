This Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR* Collaboration (RII Track-2 FEC) award focuses on developing catalysts and technologies for the efficient conversion of lignin into fuels and useful chemicals.  Research groups from the University of Kansas (KU) and the University of South Carolina at Columbia (USC) are collaborating in this project.  This collaboration synergistically combines expertise of in catalyst synthesis, advanced characterization, and computational work to design novel catalysts and develop enabling research tools for the separation of useful products from lignin.  The project will provide multidisciplinary training for a postdoc and six graduate students and leverage existing Research Experience for Undergraduates and Teachers (REU, RET) programs as well as Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Rational Catalyst Synthesis at USC to engage undergraduates, K-12 teachers, and industry professionals.  \r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nThis multidisciplinary work aimed at improving catalyst designs and chemical separation methods for converting biomass into fuels has four integrated research thrusts: (1) synthesis and characterization of catalyst systems based on nanoparticulate metals supported on different substrates; (2) study of catalyst surface properties and reaction intermediates; (3) experiments to understand the catalytic conversion kinetics of biomass model molecules and lignin; and (4) computational simulations to interpret experimental results and provide guidance for the design of new, efficient catalysts.  The project combines expertise at the Center for Renewable Fuels at USC and the Center of Environmentally Beneficial Catalyst at KU for the synthesis, characterization, and computational modeling of heterogeneous catalysts for the depolymerization of lignin compounds into cyclic hydrocarbons.  Systematic experimental and computational studies will be performed to understand catalytic mechanisms, reaction kinetics, and to design and evaluate efficient catalysts for lignin deconstruction.  The project employs a team approach to mentor junior faculty, postdoc, and students and offers opportunities to discuss topics such as time management, work-life balance, grant writing, strategic planning, leadership training, and facilitate activities on intellectual property management, lab safety, ethics, outreach and communicating science to the public.  An evaluator provides formative and summative assessment of the project's progress.\r\n\r\n*Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research",
