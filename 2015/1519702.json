 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes significant advances in societal goals on energy security, sustainability, low cost energy, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.  The convection battery is a systemic approach to improve the way normal (not flow) battery chemistries are used in large systems (>2 kWh).  This technology will make batteries lower cost and lower weight.  Specific examples of how this technology can achieve these goals include:  a) reducing the cost of a battery pack for an electric vehicle from $10,000 to $2,000, b) reducing the cost of using wind power by up to $0.05 per kWh, and c) lowering the cost of remote power system used on farms and regions without an electrical power grid.  From a commercial perspective, the proposed technology will better enable several important industries such as wind power, electric vehicles, solar power, storage of grid electricity, and electrical power systems for remote locations.  \r\n\r\n The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project includes significant advances in societal goals on energy security, sustainability, low cost energy, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
