 "awd_abstract_narration": "Human development often causes declines in the diversity of pollinators, but little is known about how such declines impact pollination ecosystem services in natural (e.g., non-agricultural) ecosystems. For a series of scrub habitat field in large natural reserves and in small patches of natural scrub habitat embedded in urban landscapes sites in Southern California. The research will examine how declines in pollinator diversity impact interactions between pollinators and native plants and the reproduction of a native plant species. The findings of this project will be relevant to the conservation, management, and restoration of plant-pollinator interactions in natural ecosystems. Additionally, at least six undergraduate students will receive training in a diversity of laboratory and field techniques as well as mentorship regarding careers in science. Additional broader impacts of this project include engaging high school students in hands-on scientific research and contributing data on the diversity and distribution of Southern California native pollinators.\r\n\r\nThe research will evaluate the causal link between pollinator diversity and the structure and function of plant-pollinator interaction networks. Pollination networks will be constructed using empirical floral visitation observations study sites located in natural reserves and scrub habitat fragments in Southern California. A native plant species will also be experimentally introduced into study sites to evaluate how the restructuring of pollination networks may potentially impact plant pollination and reproduction. Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) pollinator diversity loss yields networks with higher modularity and fewer links than expected based on the number of extant pollinator taxa, and (2) changes in network architecture associated with pollinator diversity loss negatively affect floral visitation, pollen deposition, and overall reproductive fitness of a focal native plant species.",

Thus, recent findings that that human development often causes declines in the diversity of insect pollinators is of increasing conservation concern. Currently, little data exists regarding how the loss of pollinator species impacts pollination services rendered to native plant species in natural ecosystems; however, the scientific literature posits two alternative possibilities. First, the quantity and quality of pollination services may decline as pollinator species are lost from a locality, due to the complementary functions performed by different pollinator species. Second, the quantity and quality of pollination services may be robust to pollinator diversity loss, owing to the common observation that generalist pollinators, which are often more tolerant of human perturbations, tend to visit (and therefore, putatively pollinate) the majority of plant species in a natural community.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To address the dearth of data on the consequences of pollinator diversity loss, we took advantage of a series of scrub habitat field sites in Southern California where we have documented strong differences in pollinator diversity between field sites located in large natural reserves and those in small patches of natural habitat embedded in urban landscapes. We documented networks of interactions between pollinators and plants (i.e., pollination networks) in each study site by recording the frequency with which each observed pollinator species visited each plant species in the study sites. We also collected stigmas (pollen-receiving structures) from flowers of a subset of insect-pollinated plant species at the study sites to examine the numbers and identities of pollen grains deposited as a metric of the quantity and quality of pollination services. We deliberately chose study sites that contained similar compositions of native plant communities, such that any results we discover may be attributed to pollinator diversity loss, and not overall habitat degradation. We tested two hypotheses: (1) pollinator species loss in fragment sites will alter the structure of connections between plants and pollinators in pollination networks, and (2) the loss of pollinator species in fragments will lead to decreases in the quantity and quality of pollen deposited on flowers of a suite of plant species.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Consistent with our previous findings in this study system, plant species in fragment sites were visited by roughly 23% fewer pollinator species.

The non-native western honey bee (<em>Apis mellifera</em>) also dominates networks in fragments to a higher extent than they do networks in reserves.
