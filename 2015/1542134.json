The travel support will provide opportunities for young scientists and graduate students from the US to interact with established and emerging scientists on the international stage.\r\n\tThe ISEA conference is held approximately every three to four years and brings together international researchers to advance the understanding of the ionosphere-thermosphere-magnetosphere (ITM) coupling which impacts space weather, navigation, and communication systems. The location at Bahir Dar, Ethiopia, will facilitate future efforts in data collection in the African sector by engaging local scientists. This will address the longitudinal and hemispheric dependence of equatorial ionospheric effects and space weather.\r\n\tThis award will be jointly funded by the NSF Aeronomy Program and the Office of International Science and Engineering.",
