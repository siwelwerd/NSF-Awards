 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will develop and research the impact of an expanded model for mathematics professional development (PD) for elementary second and third grade teachers. It builds on the NSF-funded project, All Included in Mathematics (AIM). The PD is designed for elementary teachers to learn and use successful mathematics discussion strategies shown to support student learning. This project will expand the framework by improving teacher access to resources with web-based tools, targeting a new target audience of teachers in PD, and researching the impact of Project AIM via analysis of student data. The project partnership between university faculty and mathematics curriculum leaders from school districts will develop the web-based professional development resources. The project is co-funded by three programs: ITEST, EHR Core Research and Cyberlearning. The EHR Core Research program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.  Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring:  STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. This project will also advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM). The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of the project is to conduct an efficacy study to understand how a professional development program, targeting elementary math teachers, can be used with web-based facilitator support and less support from the original research and development team. The research questions ask about the extent to which teachers who did not work with the prior project can implement the new Project AIM materials with fidelity. The research will also investigate the impact of the professional development on teachers' knowledge, beliefs and mathematics teaching. Finally, the study is also examining the impact on students' participation in mathematics discussions and content learning with particular attention to English Language Learner students. The study is an experimental design in which school teams are randomly assigned to the initial treatment or delayed treatment conditions. Data will be collected to understand the efficacy of the intervention and will include facilitator implementation logs, measures of teacher knowledge, classroom artifacts, classroom observations, student discourse observation and student achievement data.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nSummary\nThe project Collaborative Research: An impact study to examine the efficacy of a mathematics professional development (PD) program for elementary teachers investigated the expansion and dissemination of Project AIM (All Included in Mathematics), a year-long PD program for improving mathematics classroom discourse in early elementary grades. Between 2015 and 2021 Project AIM worked with two school districts that provided the PD to kindergarten, 1st, and 2nd grade teachers, facilitated by local mathematics education leaders. \nThe AIM PD program emphasizes the purposeful selection and use of techniques to activate and promote all students' engagement in mathematics discourse. Mathematics discourse includes explaining ideas, asking questions, listening to others, and using many modes of communication (speaking in academic and everyday language, drawing or diagramming, using physical models, using digital technologies, etc.). The techniques provide structures and opportunities for all students to engage in classroom discourse during mathematics lessons. More importantly, they teach young students, whose language and communication backgrounds vary widely, how to communicate effectively about their mathematical ideas. \nThe Project AIM team conducted research on implementation and impacts of Project AIM using a quasi-experimental study in one district and a randomized experimental study in the other. Approximately 130 teachers from more than 20 schools serving diverse student populations engaged in the research studies. The Project AIM team also published a book about the techniques, adapted the AIM PD program to be delivered at scale using the book as its main text, and created an online, self-paced facilitator preparation course.\nIntellectual Merit\nThe project's research utilized videorecording, assessments, surveys, collection of classroom artifacts, and observations. Analyses showed that local leaders consistently provided the PD to teachers with fidelity to its design and intent. Although specific impacts varied between the participating districts, teachers who participated in the program strengthened aspects of their knowledge and beliefs, preparedness, planning, and mathematics teaching practice in comparison to teachers in similar schools in the same districts.  Across the two studies, the project had consistent effects on teachers' knowledge (effect sizes of .86 and .68 in the quasi-experimental and the randomized experimental studies, respectively), their planning for discourse (.72 and .76) and their perception of preparedness to facilitate discourse (1.14 and .69). \n\n \nA follow-up study in one district showed that most initial impacts on participating teachers and their teaching were sustained one year following completion of the PD program. Project AIM research underscored the importance of providing teachers opportunities for controlled implementation of new teaching techniques, accomplished through activities that connect what teachers are learning in the PD to specific opportunities to practice the new techniques in their classroom and then reflect individually and with colleagues on their experiences.\n\nBroader Impacts\nInformed by its research studies, the project's development efforts have led to several widely available products designed to support broader implementation and impacts. First, the project leaders authored a commercially published book entitled Activating Math Talk: 11 Purposeful Techniques for Your Elementary Students. It is written for elementary teachers and teacher leaders to be used alongside the PD or independently to strengthen discourse-promoting teaching techniques in mathematics instruction. Second, the project developed a web-enabled, hybrid face-to-face and online PD program available to schools nationwide. Accompanying the PD program, the project created an online, self-guided facilitator preparation program and supports embedded within the PD materials to aid local leaders in providing the PD to teachers. Dissemination of research and development results through project publications and presentations at local, national, and international conferences has enhanced teachers', teacher leaders', and teacher educators' understanding of how to promote high-quality classroom discourse for mathematics learning.\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/03/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paola Sztajn"
