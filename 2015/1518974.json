The conference follows on from a highly successful meeting held in 2011, and is designed to bring together a significant fraction of the top postdoctoral researchers in astronomy in North America. A key goal of the workshop is to create a venue where leading postdoctoral researchers from across the country, working in much different programs and in different areas, can come together to share their excitement and ideas on future key research areas. This is a significant opportunity for the attendees to speak about, and survey, the frontier of astrophysics, and the workshop will undoubtedly lead to numerous new collaborations being formed. Funding will additionally be targeted toward, although not limited to, women and under-represented minorities.",
