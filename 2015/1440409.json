 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate change forecasts for the Pacific Northwest portend drought, decreased snow packs, and increased wildfire. Predictions for how Pacific Northwest ecosystems will respond to climate change face both scientific and social challenges. First, observed rates of climate change in this region vary in both space and time. Second, forest governance systems face conflicting pressures to provide timber, restore ecological processes, maintain biodiversity, and facilitate adaptation of forests to climate change. The goal of this long-term project is to identify the mechanisms that determine how forested mountain ecosystems respond to changes in climate, land-use, and their interactions. Over the next six years, research will focus on determining how intermittent, spatially variable flows of air, water, nutrients, organisms, and information may reduce or accentuate the effects of regional and global climate change and land use in mountain ecosystems. Simultaneously, researchers will examine how humans and institutions make decisions that affect forest governance. These approaches in combination will engage the public, resource managers, and policymakers in studies of changing social networks influencing forest landscapes and conservation ethics analyses of arguments used in forest governance. Collaborations with arts and humanities will enhance public literacy about science, demonstrate the value of long-term ecological research, and convey the strong sense of place necessary to improve the well being of individuals in society. The project will continue education, outreach and STEM development for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students and teachers as well as the public, with explicit emphasis on enhancing participation of women, people with disabilities, and under-represented minorities.\r\n\r\nThe project addresses the central question of how climate, natural disturbance, and land use as controlled by forest governance interact with biodiversity, hydrology, and carbon and nutrient dynamics in a forested ecosystem. Research will use the lens of \"connectivity\" to evaluate and characterize spatial and temporal patterns and processes in the old-growth temperate forests, streams, and montane meadows of the mountain landscape of the Andrews Forest. Analyses of long-term climate and hydrology records and short-term mechanistic studies will investigate patterns and drivers of air and water flow in the landscape to assess how temperature, moisture, and associated fluxes of carbon and nutrients in forested mountain ecosystems are connected to or decoupled from regional and global climate.  Analyses of long-term vegetation records combined with short-term studies of phenology and organism movement will examine the implications of timing of trophic connections and landscape connectivity for community structure and function in forests and montane meadows.  Long-term studies of stream ecosystems and short-term experiments will test how stream community structure and function depend on network-level connectivity. Researchers will study how perceptions of the landscape influence societal expectations, social networks, and social movements, and examine the relationship between the arguments underpinning forest policy and the validity and soundness of those arguments.  Research on the changing history of relations between Andrews Forest science, federal forest policymaking, and federal forest management along with the implications of that change for ecosystem function will contribute to theories regarding the role of social networks in governance and landscape transformation, and the functioning of social-ecological systems.",

We learned that disturbance and human land use legacies can shape long-term ecological patterns and processes--from long-term forest development to nutrient dynamics to how the forest responds to new disturbances--demonstrating how intermingled social-ecological processes and feedbacks influence our understanding of disturbance ecology. We discovered that forest hydrology is not only impacted by regional climate oscillations but also by canopy structure, that past disturbance as well as climate impacts soil water storage varies with climate, and that past forest harvest has reduced late-summer streamflow. We found that our forest has massive carbon stores compared to other forest ecosystems and that management decisions can impact the ability of the forest to store carbon as well as protect species. We learned that, while the growth rate of slow-growing trees in second-growth forests were in sync with climate variability, older forest stands were desynchronized from climate variability. We also learned that variation in tree mortality can contribute to forest complexity (structure and composition) as well as to trends in ecosystem biomass diverging from trajectories predicted by theory and models. We saw how aquatic food webs and limiting factors in streams can by driven by reductions in forest canopy, how ongoing stream processes are influenced by the removal of in-stream wood, how the drought of 2015 temporarily reduced adult trout and salamander biomass in headwater streams, and how some fish and salamander species appear to be decreasing in body size in both old-growth and regenerating forests. We found that, while our forest has a high degree of temporal and spatial heterogeneity in moisture and temperature conditions, the response to microclimate variability is not consistent across trophic levels or taxa. We also discovered that a high prevalence of old-growth forest mediates the responses of forest bird populations to climate and may also mediate the effects of variation in climate on other taxa. The cold air drainage and pooling studied in past cycles demonstrated a moderating influence on under-canopy temperatures but in spatially heterogeneous ways that differ from previous conceptualizations of mountain landscape climate. Our human dimensions (social science, humanities, arts) examined how Andrews Forest research has impacted forest management in the Pacific Northwest, how the legacies of past institutions and shifting forest governance may impact the consequences of forest management and how it interacts with natural disturbances and land use, and how values and value judgments underpin forest management and conservation and the need to address such value assumptions transparently and systematically.</p>\n<p>During this funding cycle we engaged in a variety of broader impacts efforts: including training and development of scientists and scientific knowledge of citizens at various levels, including K-12 teachers and students, undergraduate and graduate students, and early-career researchers; encouraging broadly multidisciplinary, collaborative research; forging stronger alliances between biophysical scientists and researchers in the various human dimensions; actively disseminating scientific knowledge through strong and long-standing science/management partnerships and contribution to adaptive management strategies; fostering many science/arts/humanities connections; and continuing to enhance our cyberinfrastructure at the H.J.
