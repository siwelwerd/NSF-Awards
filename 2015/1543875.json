 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has been found that during the processing of a class of fluids, e.g., surfactants and polymers, the applied shear can lead to non-homogeneities in the solution, a phenomenon called shear-induced banding. This is a proposal to develop accurate and elegant experiments to understand this process, impacting current practice in several industries and potentially allowing the design of better manufacturing techniques for such materials. Research with impact in manufacturing addresses an area identified as an area of National need.  \r\n\r\nThe banding of macromolecular soft materials is currently under investigation theoretically, but there are very few laboratories in the world that have the capability to conduct the experiments that will determine the fundamental mechanism behind this phenomenon. The PI's laboratory is one of these, and she is proposing to develop a molecular level experimental technique to dynamically observe shear banding.  It is proposed to provide experimental spatiotemporal velocity and microstructure data in order to test existing theory and inform future modeling efforts relevant to the dynamics of shear banding in warmlike micelle solutions (WLMs) under time dependent conditions. Specific objectives include: (1) detect shear banding in WLMs using rapid Rheo-NMR velocity imaging to test the university criteria proposed by prior theories, (2) measure and quantify time and lengthscales of velocity fluctuation, as correlated with transient stress responses, using rapid Rheo-NMR velocity imaging and flow compensated pulsed gradient spin echo (PGSE) NMR, and (3) measure molecular level ordering for WLM solutions via 2H spectroscopy as correlated with shear banding and velocity fluctuation. Rheo-NMR techniques are non-invasive, non-destructive and offer information ranging from the macroscopic to the microscopic, providing insight into the formation of shear bands under start-up conditions and oscillatory flow as well as the coupling between the flow field, microstructure and transient stress. The proposed work will have an impact on the polymer, surfactant, chemical and food industry, where control of material properties and of complex fluids is important. Graduate and undergraduate student participation is proposed, as well as outreach activities to URM students across Montana.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSurfactants can self-assemble under certain conditions into long flexible cylindrical aggregates called wormlike micelles (WLMs) that have the ability to break apart and recombine. The resulting solutions exhibit complex viscoelastic behavior, including the phenomena of shear banding, where the one-dimensional homogeneous flow evolves into an inhomogeneous flow with two macroscopic regions of different shear rates.\n\nWLMs are prevalent in industrial applications ranging from food and material processing to oil recovery and such processes are often transient in nature. Experimental investigation and theoretical predictions of WLMs indicate complex spatiotemporal dynamics occur under flow.  To advance these materials in novel applications, their behavior needs to be predictable and easily manipulated, even under time dependent conditions.\n\nIn this project, the relationship between the macroscopic flow field, material properties and molecular ordering in shear banding wormlike micelle (WLM) solutions under time dependent boundary conditions in a concentric cylinder Couette device was studied using Rheo-NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) techniques.  Rheo-NMR is the use of rheometric devices inside an NMR spectrometer, allowing for the measurement of full velocity fields, complimentary to a bulk mechanical response as measured in traditional rheometry.\n\nThe mechanical response to an applied step shear, shear start-up, changes with time.  The stress undergoes an overshoot in the early time, then settles to a steady value.  In WLM solutions, a metastable regime including a stress undershoot has also been observed prior to the final steady state value.  We have measured one dimensional velocity profiles across the fluid gap, correlating flow behavior with the bulk stress response.  Homogeneous velocity is observed during the overshoot, the formation of shear bands and migration of the banded interface occurs during the metastable regime and finally at long times after shear start-up we see steady state shear banding.  It has been shown that elastic instabilities, reminiscent of the purely inertial Taylor vortices seen in Couette flow for Newtonian fluids, are prevalent in shear banded WLM solutions.  The resulting three-dimensional flow manifests as fluctuations in velocity for a 1D measurement.  From the velocity profiles, we calculate the shear rate in the high and low shear bands, as well as interface position and apparent slip velocities, as a function of time.  Analysis of the deviation of these values from the mean revealed the various timescales corresponding to the different regimes in the stress response.  \n\nThe flow behavior of a WLM solution can depend on shear history, in other words, solutions that have undergone flow have a memory.  They experience changes to their microstructure and behave differently than those freshly prepared.  In this work, a protocol was developed to ensure an isotropic state without shear history by allowing a wait time between shear start-up experiments and monitoring the characteristics of the shear banded flow.
