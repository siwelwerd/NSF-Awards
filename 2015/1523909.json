 "awd_abstract_narration": "Folded rock layers are among the most fundamental, instructive and charismatic geologic structures. Folds are studied to investigate mountain building, to understand the engineering properties of rock, to predict the underground movement of water or hydrocarbons, and to give insight into the fundamental processes of folding itself.  These applications rely on the accurate interpretation of rock deformation within a fold.  Various conceptual and mathematical models predict fold-related deformation.  To assess the capabilities of such predictive models, data from natural examples are required.  This can be challenging, because most geologic folds at Earth's surface are only partially exposed, with major portions of the fold either buried underground or eroded away.  The Whaleback Anticline in Bear Valley, east-central Pennsylvania, is a unique locale where a complete large-scale fold is exposed; strip mining for coal early in the last century revealed it in exquisite detail.  This outstanding exposure permits observation of the complete three-dimensional form of the folded surface and provides a highly detailed record of deformation across the fold.  This project will use cutting-edge digital imaging techniques and traditional geologic fieldwork to produce a comprehensive data set against which to test hypotheses about folding.  In addition to the scientific goals of the project, the research is contributing to achievement of societally relevant outcomes in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, including the development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through graduate and undergraduate student training; the development of research infrastructure of three universities; the broadening of participation of underrepresented groups in science; and increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with science and technology. The Whaleback Anticline is an important educational field trip location for dozens of university geology departments throughout the eastern United States, and it is a well-used recreation site for the local community. As part of this proposed project we will preserve, expand and curate geological observations from the Whaleback, for use by researchers, educators and the community. \r\n\r\nDeformation associated with folding is recorded by distributed strain and discrete secondary structures.  These features are of fundamental importance to understanding mechanisms and sequence of fold evolution and are of practical importance as records and hosts for fluid migration in and around folds.  Incomplete data from natural examples limits the ability to evaluate geometric and physics-based models of folding.  Recent advances in digital imaging and analysis now make it possible to produce quantitative three-dimensional descriptions of noncylindrical folds and evaluate the relationships of these forms to the distribution and evolution of fold-related strain. This project has the following objectives:  1) to produce a high-resolution digital surface model of an iconic fold, the Whaleback Anticline in Bear Valley, east-central Pennsylvania; 2) to document the spatial variability of strain around the fold with new observations of grain-scale strain, anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility, and detailed mapping of mesoscale structures in the folded layer; 3) to test the hypothesis that surface curvature controls the spatial variation and style of observed strain around a fold; 4) to evaluate stratigraphic and rheological influences on fold strain, through finite element analysis; 5) to demonstrate the utility of structure-from-motion photogrammetry as a tool for structural geology research and 6) to produce educational resources that will preserve and expand access to a world-class field locality and engage the local community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith new technologies come opportunities to examine familiar places in new ways.  The Whaleback Anticline is a large, folded, sandstone surface exposed by coal mining at Bear Valley in central Pennsylvania It is one of the most visited geologic sites in the eastern United States.  In this project, we created a detailed digital model of the Bear Valley mine that enables new geologic analyses and also new educational opportunities.\n\nWith hundreds of digital photographs of the Whaleback and adjacent rock walls, we used commercial software to create a digital point cloud of nearly 10 million points that represent the three-dimensional position of the surfaces of all objects exposed in the Bear Valley mine.  We edited these points to remove soil and vegetation, so that only rock surfaces remained in the data set.  We applied mathematical curve fitting routines to connect these patches of rock with a smooth, undulating surface.  This surface is an objective reconstruction of the top of the folded sandstone.  We compare this shape to the distribution of small faults and fractures in the sandstone surface as observed in the field and evaluate how the rock must deform internally in order to be folded.  The internal deformation patterns are substantially more complex than expected from standard textbook models of rock-folding, leading to new understanding of the processes that allow rocks to bend.\n\nWe used the same digital data to produce a virtual visit to Bear Valley, using state-of-the-art videogame programming.  In the Whaleback Field Adventure, players can walk or fly around the field site, and see the fold in full detail.  The game allows students to use virtual geologic tools to measure the orientation of the folded sandstone and to plot these data on a spherical graph for analysis.  We created this game to help preserve the geo-heritage of the Whaleback as an important geologic site, and also to allow students and others who are unable to visit (due to distance or physical ability) to see and experience this world-class feature.  As it turns out, this game is also being used in remote-learning classes, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where in-person field courses are not possible.  We have produced a plan that other researchers can follow to produce similar videogames from digital models of other places.\n\nThis project supported a collaboration among researchers at the University of Washington, Bucknell University and Bryn Mawr College.  The award contributed to training two doctoral students at the University of Washington and, indirectly, dozens of additional college students in tools of photogrammetry and geologic analysis.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/09/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Juliet G Crider"
