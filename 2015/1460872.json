 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project funded by the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation (NSF) creates a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of South Dakota (USD), led by Professor Andrew G. Sykes. The REU Site program is specifically designed to serve the research needs of students at regional tribal colleges, local primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs), and USD.  Eight students will be hosted at USD each summer for three years.  This REU site includes four major project elements: 1) onsite hosting of undergraduate students from regional tribal colleges, PUIs and USD conducting intensive research for ten weeks during the summer; 2) a two week computational chemistry workshop involving all participants; 3) communication of research results during and following the research experience; and 4) select social activities characteristic of the region. The research opportunities offered at USD fall under the theme of materials chemistry that involves non-covalent interactions to control structure and function. Non-covalent interactions (hydrogen bonds, van de Waals forces, halogen bonds, coordinate-covalent bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, to name a few) are linked to a variety of material applications that are associated with all the research projects conducted by participating chemistry faculty at USD.\r\n\r\nRecognizing, understanding and controlling weak intermolecular forces is critical to modern chemical and materials research. In addition, students will learn about the use of single-crystal and powder XRD; NMR spectroscopy; fluorescence and optical techniques; SEM and TEM imaging; and other chemical characterization methods during their research experience. Computational chemistry is also of growing importance, where almost every communication in the literature offers some computational component. Students will benefit from an immersive learning experience in computational methods as linked to their individual research projects. The broader impact of this REU program includes increased access to the chemical sciences for students attending Tribal colleges and PUI institutions in the area.  The University of South Dakota (USD) is ideally situated geographically to serve both Native American and small PUI student populations in the region.",
