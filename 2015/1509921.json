 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proposal Title:  A Microfluidic Platform for Detecting Circulating Endothelial Cells at the Point-of-Care\r\n\r\nProject Goals:  This project involves developing a point-of-care platform to detect circulating endothelial cells for diagnosing or monitoring vascular disease or injury.\r\n\r\nNontechnical Abstract:  Circulating endothelial cells (CECs) are indicators of vascular injury and/or disease.  Clinical studies have shown that individuals with vascular disorders, such as ischemia, vascular trauma, acute myocardial infarction, sickle-cell anemia, vasculitis, pulmonary hypertension, and deep-vein thrombosis, have higher levels of CECs than healthy controls (who had no little to no CECs). Importantly, the number of CECs strongly correlated with the severity of injury or disease. Thus, CECs have diagnostic and prognostic importance.  Current methods to detect CECs are overall inadequate, as they lack sensitivity, require a highly trained physician-scientist to interpret results, and cannot be performed in a physician's office.  This project will develop a microfluidic platform that can detect CECs in patient blood at the point-of-care, enabling a physician to diagnose and monitor a patient's vascular disease or injury and also to respond quickly in acute cases.  Beyond the obvious high medical/clinical impact, this project will have strong societal impact, as workshops will be held to demonstrate to students how different disciplines in engineering and science can come together to address real and important problems, just as had done for this medical project, and how students are capable of both engineering and scientific thinking.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:  The overarching goal of this project is to develop a novel label-free microfluidics platform that screens for circulating endothelial cells (CECs). CECs are indicators of vascular injury and/or disease and are either shed from the vascular wall (mature CECs) or recruited from the bone marrow (endothelial progenitor cells or EPCs). Representing 0.01% to 0.0001% of the total mononuclear cells in peripheral blood, CECs are challenging to detect. The platform to be developed will utilize inertial fluid dynamics within a contraction-expansion array (CEA) to isolate candidate CECs from whole blood based on size. The platform will then screen the isolated cells using Node-Pore Sensing (NPS) to not only identify CECs from white blood cells but also to differentiate mature CECs from EPCs based on specific phenotypic profiles. NPS measures the transit time of a cell as it interacts (specifically or non-specifically) with antibodies functionalized in a microfluidic channel that has been segmented by nodes. Specific interactions between cell-surface receptors and the functionalized antibody retard the cell, leading to longer transit times and subsequent determination of a particular surface-marker presence.   Overall, having the ability to identify and distinguish between mature CECs and EPCS in patient blood at the point-of-care would enable a physician to diagnose and monitor a patient's vascular disease or injury and also respond quickly in cases such as an acute myocardial infarction.\r\nThis three-year project has three specific aims:\r\n-Aim 1: To optimize a contraction-expansion array (CEA) device such that it enriches CECs from whole blood. The CEA device will rely upon inertial forces to fractionate blood and CECs based on size. The device will be optimized for 100% recovery of cancer cells.\r\n-Aim 2:  To expand the capabilities of NPS to screen for mature CECs and EPCS. A unique NPS platform with optimized coding and processing (optimum Barker codes, matched filtering, sparse deconvolution, linear classifiers, all of which are inspired by radar and telecommunications theory) will be designed and developed to enable high-resolution detection and classification of CECs.\r\n-Aim 3:  To integrate the optimized NPS with the CEA device and also include a sorter downstream. The CEA device with NPS will be integrated onto a single platform, enabling isolation, analysis, and sorting of CECs from peripheral blood.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project focused on Node-pore sensing (NPS) to probe and screen single cells and in particular, identify circulating endothelial cells (CECs) in blood. NPS relies on measuring a series of current subpulses produced as a cell traverses across a microfluidic channel that has been segmented by \"nodes.\"  The subpulses are a result of the insulating cell displacing by volume the conducting media in the channel&mdash;the volume displaced is different in the segment vs. node.  The magnitude of the subpulses correspond to the cell size and the sub-pulse duration, to the cell transit time across the segment between two nodes.  If the segments between the nodes are coated with antibodies, specific interactions between cell-surface markers with those antibodies would result in the cell taking longer to pass through those segments (and the duration of the subpulses would be subsequently longer) than through a segment coated with an isotype control.  \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit:  Over the course of this project, we advanced the NPS technology in two different ways:  first in terms of the device and integration into a point-of-care platform; and second in terms of the analysis.\n\n            NPS can be thought of in terms ofradar/telecommunications systems in which the goal is to detect the unique electrical current signature generated as cells pass through the NPS device.  Under the funded project, we applied concepts from these disciplines to design our NPS device such that would enable high-throughput detection. We encoded our devices with Barker codes, which are a specific set of 1?s and 0?s.  Their properties are ideal for NPS, as they can separate different overlapping signals. Such overlapping signals are known as \"coincidence\" events, and occur when two or more cells pass through in the NPS channel simultaneously.  Coincidence events commonly occur in traditional flow cytometry and removed from analysis.  We successfully showed that we could differentiate 3-5 cells transiting our NPS devices simultaneously.  Moreover, we also showed that we could perform real-time analysis of cells with Barker coding. \n\n           During the project period, we also significantly advanced NPS by inserting a \"contraction\" channel whose width is narrower than a cell diameter in between a sequence of node-pores.  In so doing, we are now able to mechanically phenotype cells. Specifically, we are able to characterize multiple mechanical properties of that cell: diameter, resistance to compressive deformation, transverse deformation under constant strain, and recovery time after deformation.  We have recently demonstrated that mechano-NPS can distinguish malignant vs. non-malignant immortal epithelial cell lines and measure deformability changes in the cell cytoskeleton due to drugs. Our future task is to use this method to distinguish CECs.  Overall, the key advancement of our next-generation NPS is the fact that we have now obviated the use of antibodies, making our device far simpler to use and appropriate for long-term storage. \n\n            In addition to the work described above, we achieved a major milestone in terms of successfully creating a compact benchside/point-of-care platform (POC) to perform NPS measurements.  We delivered this platform to City of Hope in Spring 2018, and we have set up another platform in a separate research group at UC Berkeley. \n\nBroader Impact:  Over the duration of this project, the PI, Sohn, was actively involved with outreach with middle-school children.  She hosted 25 students from the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth Programin September 2015, and with her lab, demonstrated the basics of microfluidics. The 25 students learned soft-lithography and made and tested microfluidic devices.  Sohn answered their questions on career paths and described the focus of this NSF-funded project.  In Summer 2016 and 2018, Sohn participated in the Girls in Engineeringsummer camp at UC Berkeley as the \"Lead Faculty\" in one of the weekly modules.  She gave an overall introduction to engineering to the middle-school girls enrolled that week and also described her research.  Moreover, Sohn answered the girls? many questions about engineering, her career path, and her passion for research.  Finally, Sohn has served as a judge for the BioE High School Competition (BioEHSC&trade;), which is sponsored by the Berkeley Bioengineering Honor Society and held on campus in April 2017 and 2018.  BioEHSC&trade; is a team-based research and design competition which has students focus on identifying a problem in medicine or biology and proposing a solution.  As judge, Sohn listened to 5-10 teams who focused on solutions involving medical devices/platforms and ranked these teams based on their design and the potential impact it would have on the chosen problem.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lydia L Sohn"
