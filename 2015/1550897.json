 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by prek-12 students and teachers through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. While national and state standards provide important benchmarks for algebra learning beginning in kindergarten, they do not provide rigorously tested models by which these algebra standards might be attained in elementary grades classrooms in ways that will ensure further mathematics achievement. This work will addresses this need by closely documenting the effectiveness of models and tools, developed in our previous work, for early algebra education\r\n\r\nThe proposed project will use a quasi-experimental design to explore students' knowledge of core algebraic concepts in middle grades (grade 6), one year after their completion of 3-year, grades 3-5 early algebra intervention. The project will also study the algebraic knowledge of a comparison group of students. The research questions are:  (1) how well students who received a specific intervention retain their understanding of algebraic concepts in future years; and (2) whether and how the intervening year of regular classroom instruction in grade 6 influences the algebra understanding of both intervention and comparison students",
