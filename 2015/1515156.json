 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bayesian statistical methodology involves the natural updating of information from a priori knowledge to a posteriori knowledge.  In this framework, the prior belief about quantities of interest is updated through the observation of data to obtain a ?posterior distribution,? which contains the updated information about these quantities in light of our observations.  This type of analysis can suffer from a poorly chosen prior structure which will have an impact on the posterior results.  In objective Bayesian methodology, mathematical techniques are applied to the assumed distributional structure of the observed data so a prior can be computed while maintaining minimal impact on the posterior distribution.  This is important because statistics is commonly being applied by scientists directly, and an objective prior takes away the potential for biased results.  This project seeks to develop an objective prior for the negative binomial distribution, which to date does not have this structure when both parameters are unknown.  This research will be conducted at East China Normal University in Shanghai, China, under the guidance of Dr. Yincai Tang, who has contributed several important results to the objective Bayesian community.\r\n\r\nBecause of the discrete nature of the parameter space of the negative binomial distribution, historically available methods for deriving objective priors do not apply.  The 2014 method of Villa and Walker assigns ?worth? to every element in this parameter space by examining how much the overall model structure changes when each element is removed and the objective prior is derived as a function of these values.  After the prior is obtained and the posterior is derived, the performance of this structure will be examined under simulation where data with known properties is generated to see how well the method recovers these properties. This NSF EAPSI award supports reserach by a U.S. graduate student and is funded in collaboratin with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology.",

Most statistical distributions have an extensive collection of objective priors, however little work has been done with the negative binomial distribution due to certain aspects of it which make it difficult to work with mathematically.  This project sought to overcome these challenges and develop a prior for this distribution.  It was a partial success, with a prior distribution being able to be obtained for the negative binomial model with treating one of the two parameter as known.  Future work will investigate the case with both parameters being unknown.\n\n \n\nThe project ran into several major challenges, the first of which was conducting the proofs required to derive the prior for the one dimensional model.  The proof was able to be partially completed, with the other part being evaluated by a computer simulation so that one could say the condition \"appears\" to be satisfied.  Beyond this, there was a specific part of the prior that could not be computed mathematically, so it needed to be approximated.  This approximation performed well, and the resulting statistical structure was studied by randomly generating a dataset, and seeing how well the developed methodology could recover the properties of that dataset.  Results for the one parameter model were good, and when the future work of obtaining a prior for the two parameter model is completed, manuscripts on this work will be submitted and software will be made available for free.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/13/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John C Snyder"
