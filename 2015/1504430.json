 "awd_abstract_narration": "The question \"Does shale gas extraction lead to contamination of freshwater aquifers by methane, deep-formation brines, or frac-water chemicals?\"   is a topic of considerable public and scientific interest and the debate to date has taken place within a fundamental lack of data and cooperation.  This study begins with a cooperative arrangement between Yale and an industry partner that will facilitate the exchange of knowledge and data between industry and university scientists and will lead to an assessment of water quality concerns stemming from shale gas development.  The study directly addresses the issue of an established predrilling baseline.  \r\n\r\nThe study will improve our knowledge of drilling as an initiating mechanism for cross formational flow of water, brines and gas.  The study improves upon previous knowledge with: (i) time series data on groundwater quality to be collected before gas wells are drilled, enabling natural variations in shallow groundwater chemistry to be distinguished from a shale gas effect; (ii) data on water quality and groundwater flow to be measured throughout all stages of shale gas development and (iii) monitoring locations to be chosen strategically to take into account known locations of gas well laterals, rather than sampling only from drinking water wells that are located randomly, without consideration of hydrology and potential sources of water quality impairment.  The project will provide fundamental research on drilling as a means of initiating cross formational subsurface flow.",
