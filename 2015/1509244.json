Bothun / Carmen Scholz\r\nProposal Number:  1508844 / 1509244\r\n\r\nButanol is a promising advanced biofuel because it has a high energy content approaching that of gasoline, and can serve as a drop-in replacement fuel.  However, butanol is more difficult to produce by fermentation relative to ethanol.  This is because the butanol product is toxic to the fermentation process, resulting in low concentrations of butanol that are too costly to recover economically. This project will develop a novel fermentation process that uses a nontoxic solvent to remove butanol while it is being produced, which reduces toxicity and increases overall butanol yield.  Furthermore, the microorganism chosen for study, Clostridium pasteurianum, makes butanol from fermentation of crude glycerol, the by-product of biodiesel manufacture. Through this investigation, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in renewable fuel technologies, and will receive specialized training in communication skills and public outreach.\r\n\r\nThe production of butanol by fermentation typically results in low butanol yields due a variety of factors, including low butanol tolerance of microorganisms, difficulty in redirecting the metabolic pathway towards butanol biosynthesis, and limitations of conventional extractive fermentation techniques. Recently, ongoing research has shown that the bacterium Clostridium pasteurianum can achieve high butanol yields using crude glycerol as the sole substrate. Crude glycerol is the byproduct of biodiesel production from fatty acid feedstocks.  The overall goal of this research is to enhance butanol production by C. pasteurianum through understanding of the relationships between butanol tolerance and its extractive removal by biocompatible lipid vesicles during continuous fermentation on crude glycerol as the substrate.  Continuous cultures will be used to determine changes in membrane lipid composition and maintenance energy in response to butanol and substrate addition. This approach will used to connect tolerance, toxicity, and substrate utilization to butanol production.  Continuous culture combined with lipid vesicle-based extractive fermentation has the potential to enhance the butanol yield through two processes.  First, vesicle-mediated extraction of the crude glycerol will be studied to remove residual fatty acids in the biodiesel-derived glycerol, which are known to inhibit glycerol fermentation to butanol.  Second, in situ extractive fermentation with the biocompatible lipid vesicles will be studied for its potential to stimulate the metabolic pathway associated with butanol biosynthesis through the mass-action effect.  The project also provides opportunities to educate students, teachers, and communities about the sustainable production of biofuels, and to develop the communication skills of students in this context through Metcalf Institute at the University of Rhode Island.  Interdisciplinary modules will be created where students from the University of Rhode Island and the University of Alabama in Huntsville will work together on bioseparation processes relevant to biorefinery operations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n The use of biodiesel has been identified as one approach to a sustainable future.  Biodiesel can be produced from a variety of agricultural products, such as canola oil, but also from spent cooking oils and fats, which are readily available by-products from the food and fast-food industries.  \n\nThe biodiesel industry has been steadily growing over the past decade and has seen annual increases that were as high as 65% (2012 to 2013).   In 2020, the daily production is about 114,000 barrels.  Yet, for every ton of biodiesel produced there are also 100 kg of glycerol produced, which is currently considered to be waste.  In fact, the pile-up of glycerol, the so-called \"glycerol glut\", severely hampers the industry.  Purifying this glycerol so that it could be re-entered into such typical glycerol applications as cosmetics and as additives to therapeutic drugs is not financially viable. \n\nHence, this research is situated in the area of sustainable fuels and addressed converting glycerol into a new value added biofuel, i.e. bio-butanol.  It is anticipated that butanol will be introduced as fuel additive into applications that do not tolerate the currently used ethanol-additive.  Moreover, butanol is of particular interest as a fuel additive because it has a higher heat of combustion, better miscibility with petroleum fuels and lower vapor pressure than the traditionally used ethanol.\n\nA bacterial strain (Clostridium pasteurianum) has been identified that is capable of converting glycerol into bio-butanol, but also produces a variety of by-products.   Our research identified ways to suppress the production of these microbial by-products and increase the production of the target product bio-butanol.  \n\nAs the microorganisms produce bio-butanol they excrete it into their aqueous fermentation broth from which it needs to be isolated. Since butanol has a higher boiling point than water, simple distillation is not an option for collecting the target product.  Considerable research efforts were therefore directed at isolating the butanol by methods such as liquid-liquid extraction, liposome extraction and liquid based membrane extractions.  The effectiveness of each method was tested and engineering aspects were evaluated for each method.\n\n \n\nIn the course of this research it was found that liquid-liquid extraction is very effective, however, involves the use of reagents (e.g. fuel products) that are toxic to the microorganism.  Hence the method is very useful in a laboratory setting but is difficult to scale up to an industrial setting, that allows for the production of butanol by continuous culture in a steady state.  Liquid-based membrane extraction is effective and scalable but continues to pose the problem that the target product bio-butanol is obtained in an aqueous mixture.  Liposome extraction has been identified as the most promising method.  It can be used while bio-butanol is produced in a steady state, partition coefficients of bio-butanol to liposomes are sufficiently high and the isolation of the bio-butanol from the liposomes is feasible.  Most importantly, this method is also scalable to industrial needs. \n\nIn summary, this research supports the growing biodiesel industry by developing processes for (i) the conversion of glycerol that currently impedes the industry into another profitable fuel product (bio-butanol) and (ii) the isolation of bio-butanol from a continuous microbial fermentation process. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/01/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carmen Scholz"
