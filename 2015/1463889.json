 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through the development of highly competitive students from groups historically underrepresented in STEM disciplines:  African-Americans, Alaska Natives, American Indians, Hispanic Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Native Pacific Islanders. The goal of the LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (BD) Activity is to increase the quantity and quality of STEM graduate students from underrepresented populations, with emphasis on Ph.D. matriculation and completion.  BD programs implemented in the nation's institutions of higher education contribute to addressing one of the objectives in NSF's 2014-2018 Strategic Plan, namely to \"integrate education and research to support development of a diverse STEM workforce with cutting-edge capabilities\"  For the U.S. to remain competitive globally, it must provide exceptional educational preparedness in STEM areas that underpin the knowledge-based economy. California State University, Los Angeles, one of the 23 California State University campuses included in The California State University-Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (CSU-LSAMP), will implement a comprehensive BD Program, which will result in the production of well-trained, highly skilled STEM professionals from underrepresented groups. Therefore, the project will contribute significantly to increasing the diversity and representation in academia and the STEM workforce, thereby increasing the nation's competitiveness.\r\n\r\nWith support from the National Science Foundation, California State University, Los Angeles, will provide a Master's level \"bridge\" to doctoral-level study for twelve students who have participated in the LSAMP undergraduate programs.  The Master's-level experience is designed to increase participant persistence and competencies in STEM and their advancement to Ph.D. programs following completion of the Master's degree.  The project will increase the number of Ph.D. level scientists by identifying and developing the talent of students who would be unlikely to pursue graduate-level study at either the Master's or the doctorate level without the project's support. In addition to providing substantial financial support to enable students to focus full-time on a two-year program of Master's-level course work and research, the BD Program  will provide an integrated set of activities designed to advance BD students toward completion of doctoral level studies.",
