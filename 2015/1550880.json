 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is coming online and will provide atmospheric and ecological data locally, regionally and continent wide. At the same time, images are rapidly becoming the most abundant, widely available, and cheapest source of information about the natural world, especially about animals. This project will extend NEON's data, scientific, and citizen science capacity with image-based animal sighting data to scalably collect, manage, and analyze data for individually identifiable wildlife using the Image-Based Ecological Information System (IBEIS) prototype recently developed under another NSF award. Combined with other ecological data, the image data offer the promise of addressing big questions about animal ecology, behavior, and conservation - who? where? when? what? and why? - at high resolution and at fine-grained scale, across landscapes and ecosystems, from an individual animal to regional and global systems. As part of this project, undergraduate and graduate students from ecology and computer science at four institutions will produce and test the application interface, and will develop a suite of companion applications and training tools to allow greater involvement of citizen scientists.\r\n\r\nThese tools will allow NEON to connect its database to data derived from large volumes of animal photographic images. Although this is primarily a proof of concept proposal focused on connecting whale shark images to NEONs atmospheric data, it will provide the means to be able to apply IBEIS algorithms and databases on images of distinctly marked North American species such as tortoises, monarch butterflies, salamanders, spotted skunk, bobcat, lynx, and humpback whales, thereby connecting these to NEON?s other data streams related to organisms, land use, hydrology and biogeochemistry. The proposed suite of tools includes: 1. an infrastructure and a mechanism for collecting images from scientists, automated remote cameras, citizen scientists and other sources; 2. a data management system for storing, accessing and manipulating images and derived data; 3. computer vision techniques for extracting information from the images about the identity of species and individual animals, as well as techniques for combining that information with other relevant data to derive information about ecological units such as animals, populations, species, and habitats; 4. a software application-program interface integrating the image and derived data with and within NEON; 5. a framework for engaging citizen scientists in data collection, derived science, and interaction with nature. Previous funding from NSF allowed building and testing of an IBEIS prototype.  This project will focus on the detection and identification methods for the identifiable US species, on integrating the system with NEON, and on scaling the system to many thousands of daily images from a variety of sources.",
