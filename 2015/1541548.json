 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants and fungi are interdependently connected in nature, through interactions that are beneficial to both (mutualism, and decomposition of dead plant material by fungi) or detrimental to one partner (parasitism). Therefore, fungal and plant biology cannot be fully understood without studying them within the context of their symbiotic interactions. With the advent of new DNA sequencing technologies, it is becoming clear that the 100,000 known species of fungi represent only a tiny fraction of the estimated 5.1 million species of fungi present in nature. Amazingly, the largest fraction of this unknown fungal diversity seems to be hidden in healthy leaves of plants and lichens, as endophytic and endolichenic fungi. Endophytes are known to protect plants from pathogens, and enhance their resistance to abiotic stresses such as droughts and high temperatures. Most of these hyperdiverse endophytic and endolichenic fungi are classified within a group of filamentous Ascomycota fungi called the Pezizomycotina. The main aims of this research are to reconstruct a phylogeny (genealogical relationships) for the Pezizomycotina and link this evolutionary framework with a rich and diverse set of organismal data. The research will be complemented by diverse outreach activities, engagement of high school students in research, training of junior scientists in five states, and development of tools with potential applications for studying the evolution of species interactions across the life sciences. Accelerating the discovery of these hidden fungi also promises to provide a rich source of secondary compounds for new pharmaceutical and biocontrol products.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this study are to fill the largest phylogenetic void in the fungal genealogy of life (the Pezizomycotina) and integrate diverse data layers with the emergent tree as a means to understand the evolution, ecology, and physiology of fungal-plant symbioses. Culture-dependent and independent methods will generate the largest sample of endophytic and endolichenic fungi to date, targeting diverse plants, lichens, macroalgae, and co-occurring microalgae and cyanobacteria in terrestrial, aquatic, and marine environments, with a focus on biotically rich but understudied bioclimatic zones. Efficient collecting and analytical pipelines will enable rapid integration of phylogenetic data from these new symbiotic fungi into the fungal genealogy of life, while novel biodiversity informatics tools will integrate existing multi-locus and phylogenomic frameworks with short sequence reads obtained with next-generation sequencing. Resulting evolutionary trees, greatly enriched by systematic sampling of currently unknown biodiversity, will be integrated with host and trophic spectra in three data layers (symbio-phylogenetic, eco-phylogenetic, and physio-phylogenetic), enabling for the first time novel insights from geographic data, abiotic and biotic factors, and the physiological traits that enable mutualistic interactions with plants on which most communities depend.",

Of the greater than five million species estimated to be living throughout the world, only about 130,000 species have been described and named so far. This relatively small number of known species are mostly found in temperate and boreal biomes of the northern hemisphere. It is believed that most of the unknown fungal biodiversity is microscopic and lives inside plant and lichen tissues, or in soils. The overarching objective of this project was to greatly accelerate the discovery of these unknown and hidden fungi and document their ecology and symbiotic interactions with plants and lichens. This project enabled a team of 14 researchers to sample all major lineages of plants and lichens, and their surrounding soils, in sites at low to high altitudes in four main localities: (1) neotropical forests (Panama), (2) paleotropical forests (Sabah area of Malaysia, Borneo), (3) South American vegetation of the southern hemisphere (Chile), and (4) southern African vegetation of the southern hemisphere (South Africa and Namibia).</p>\n<p>During these four major expeditions, thousands of fungi have been isolated in pure culture from surface sterilized plant and lichen specimens. Also, DNA was extracted and sequenced from these specimens, but also from soil samples to detect the presence of fungi without having to grow them in vitro. This was in addition to the sequencing of DNA from the fungi isolated in culture. To analyze all these DNA sequences, we developed an online bioinformatic toolkit (Tree-Based Alignment Selector; T-BAS) for a more accurate and efficient way to identify these fungi and to determine which are new to science. Using phylogenetic methods available within T-BAS, we found 48 fungal cultures that not only represent new species but also might represent new families, orders, or classes of fungi within the subphylum Pezizomycotina, which is the most biodiverse subphylum of all fungi. We sequenced the genomes of these 48 fungi and have included these genomes within a massive dataset of 3506 fungal genomes. This phylogenetic tree will enabled the identification of other fungi for which we have only sequenced a few genes or only one very short portion of their genomes. The locality where they were collected, their ecology and symbiotic interactions will be visible and accessible interactively on this tree. Because it will be available publicly via T-BAS, this will become a comprehensive reference phylogenetic tree for future studies on fungal biodiversity.</p>\n<p>A total of 18 peer-reviewed primary research articles resulted from this project so far.
