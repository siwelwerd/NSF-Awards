 "awd_abstract_narration": "When a stacked two fluid system is shaken in a direction perpendicular to the fluid interface, patterns on the fluid interface will develop as a result of resonance.  This phenomenon is known as Faraday instability.  Experimental research in collaboration with Dr. Satoshi Matsumoto at the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) will allow the PI  to study and validate theoretical calculations for the development of patterns generated on a liquid-air interface through the use of electric fields.  This collaboration offers access to both a unique experimental apparatus and a world-class research staff.  The apparatus has been used previously to perform successful preliminary trials.  The understanding of interfacial pattern generation will lead to advancements in a multitude of industrially relevant processes, including semiconductor crystal growth, microfluidic mixing enhancement, and oil recovery techniques.\r\n\r\nElectrostatic parametric forcing offers a unique approach to the generation of Faraday instability within multi-fluid systems.  Through the application of nonlinear dynamics, researchers will delineate the underlying physics of this instability when generated via electrostatic oscillations.  Experiments conducted in JAXA will allow for the validation of the stability thresholds for systems of multiple fluids and geometries obtained through a linear stability analysis that rigorously treats viscosity.  The research will complement traditional studies on mechanically forced Faraday instability, offering additional insight into the physics of surface forcing.  This knowledge will translate into the understanding of self-induced oscillations that occur in interfacial convection, interfacial evaporation, and phase transformations such as solidification and electrodeposition.  The separation of the scales that govern surface forcing and bulk forcing will advance the understanding of other instability phenomena where both bulk and surface forces participate.  Direct applications of the research include microfluidic mixing enhancement, a deeper understanding of liquid sloshing dynamics, and the potential for enhanced oil recovery when using hydraulic fracturing. This NSF EAPSI award is funded in collaboration with the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSpatial patterns occur frequently in nature, and typically arise due to a competition between forces within a system.  Examples include convection cells in clouds, the structured formation of volcanic rocks as in Fingal\u00c6s Cave, and the patterned structures observed in drying lakebeds.  These types of patterns are important because they can be selectively exploited or prevented to enhance a multitude of processes, including semiconductor crystal growth and mixing in microfluidic devices.\n\nFor this project, research was conducted on pattern formation as a result of resonance.  These patterns arise when a stacked two fluid system is oscillated in a direction perpendicular to the fluid interface.  When the amplitude of the oscillation exceeds a critical value for a given oscillation frequency, flow patterns will develop on the interface as a result of resonance between the imposed oscillation frequency and the natural frequency of the system.  This phenomenon is known as Faraday instability, and its understanding is of crucial importance to many applications.  One example is space-enabling operations, as oscillations that occur in space as a result of flight correcting maneuvers or impacts to space stations can inadvertently cause Faraday instability to occur, hindering important operations like water purification.  Traditional Faraday instability experiments use a mechanical shaker to oscillate the fluid system.  For this project, however, electric fields were used to force the oscillations.  By using electric fields as the forcing method, unique physics can be observed, ultimately leading to a deeper overall understanding of Faraday instability. \n\nOver the course of the project, experiments were conducted on water and air systems in cylindrical geometries of various sizes using an apparatus available at the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in Tsukuba, Japan.  \"Stability curves\" were mapped over a wide range of frequencies using these experiments.  These stability curves show the point at which the system will become Faraday unstable at various oscillation frequencies.  They also show the shape of the pattern that will arise on the interface as a result of this oscillation, which depends on the oscillation frequency.  These shapes were determined through analysis of high-speed videos of the instability.  Lastly, a theoretical model for the prediction of the stability curves and shape of the patterns observed was derived.  Thus far, comparison between the theoretical pattern shapes and those observed experimentally shows excellent agreement.  In the future, the assumptions used for the theoretical model will be relaxed in order to compare the theoretical predictions of the stability curves to those that were obtained experimentally during this project.\n\nThis project was an excellent opportunity to build collaborative relationships between the University of Florida (UF) and JAXA.  It allowed for my internationalization as a researcher, and opened avenues for further two-way student exchange between the two institutions in the future.  In addition, the stay in Japan was a culturally enriching experience, and I was able to immerse myself in Japanese culture and visit many regions of Japan.  It was an honor to work alongside the world-class research staff of JAXA, and access to the unique experimental equipment yielded excellent results that will certainly make an impact on the field of fluid instability.  Future planned collaboration will allow for the involvement of undergraduate students, positively impacting their careers as professional engineers. The results of the research have been presented at multiple national conferences, and will soon be disseminated to local K-12 classrooms in an effort to increase interest in pursuing careers in STEM fields.  The EAPSI program was an extremely satisfying experience, both academically and personally, and has had a significant impact on my life.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/12/2016..."
