 "awd_abstract_narration": "Beginning with the discovery of a \"curious valley\" in 1903 by Captain Scott, the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) in Antarctica have been impacted by humans, although there were only three brief visits prior to 1950. Since the late 1950's, human activity in the MDV has become commonplace in summer, putting pressure on the region's fragile ecosystems through camp construction and inhabitation, cross-valley transport on foot and via vehicles, and scientific research that involves sampling and deployment of instruments. Historical photographs, put alongside information from written documentation, offer an invaluable record of the changing patterns of human activity in the MDV.  Photographic images often show the physical extent of field camps and research sites, the activities that were taking place, and the environmental protection measures that were being followed. Historical photographs of the MDV, however, are scattered in different places around the world, often in private collections, and there is a real danger that many of these photos may be lost, along with the information they contain.  This project will collect and digitize historical photographs of sites of human activity in the MDV from archives and private collections in the United States, New Zealand, and organize them both chronologically and spatially in a GIS database.  Sites of past human activities will be re-photographed to provide comparisons with the present, and re-photography will assist in providing spatial data for historical photographs without obvious location information. The results of this analysis will support effective environmental management into the future.  The digital photo archive will be openly available through the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long Term Ecological Research (MCM LTER) website (www.mcmlter.org), where it can be used by scientists, environmental managers, and others interested in the region.     \r\n\r\nThe central question of this project can be reformulated as a hypothesis: Despite an overall increase in human activities in the MDV, the spatial range of these activities has become more confined over time as a result of an increased awareness of ecosystem fragility and efforts to manage the region.  To address this hypothesis, the project will define the spatial distribution and temporal frequency of human activity in the MDV.  Photographs and reports will be collected from archives with polar collections such as the National Archives of New Zealand in Wellington and Christchurch and the Byrd Polar Research Center in Ohio.  Private photograph collections will be accessed through personal connections, social media, advertisements in periodicals such as The Polar Times, and other means. Re-photography in the field will follow established techniques and will create benchmarks for future research projects.  The spatial data will be stored in an ArcGIS database for analysis and quantification of the human footprint over time in the MDV.  The improved understanding of changing patterns of human activity in the MDV provided by this historical photo archive will provide three major contributions: 1) a fundamentally important historic accounting of human activity to support current environmental management of the MDV; 2) defining the location and type of human activity will be of immediate benefit in two important ways: a) places to avoid for scientists interested in sampling pristine landscapes, and, b) targets of opportunity for scientists investigating the long-term environmental legacy of human activity; and 3) this research will make an innovative contribution to knowledge of the environmental history of the MDV.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe McMurdo Dry Valleys are the largest ice-free region of the Antarctic continent.  The predominantly ice-free environment offers excellent opportunities for scientific research in fields such as geology, geomorphology, and ecology, and the since the late 1950s the region has become an important location for Antarctic science.  The environment of the Dry Valleys, however, is in some ways quite fragile making it potentially vulnerable to human activities (e.g. walking can cause soil compaction).  The scientific value of the region together with its environmental fragility sets up a delicate balancing act in which efforts are made to promote science but to limit its environmental impact.   \n\n \n\nThis project set out to test the effectiveness of environmental management strategies in the McMurdo Dry Valleys at limiting the spatial extent of research facilities in the region.  This was done by collecting over 5000 historical photographs of the McMurdo Dry Valleys with a focus on images of the semi-permanent structures that have been constructed in the region.  These images were collected from archives and personal collections in the United States, New Zealand, and Japan, the three countries with the most significant histories of conducting science in this region of Antarctica.  These photographs were digitized and uploaded to publicly available digital archive along with the relevant metadata  (https://mcmurdohistory.lternet.edu/), where they are organized both spatially and chronologically.  Through this website, the photos and a variety of other historical sources are available for use by researchers and the general public. \n\n \n\nThe digitized and archived images were then used alongside other geospatial data (e.g. satellite imagery and aerial photos) to help estimate the changing ?infrastructure footprint? of the McMurdo Dry Valleys over time using the ArcGIS software programme.  This infrastructure footprint can be thought of as the area that has been directly impacted by human structures and the associated activity. \n\n \n\nIn addition to collecting visual data to help us estimate the changing infrastructure footprint of the region, this project also sought to collect data on the nature of human activities in the region more broadly.  This data proved more difficult to collect than originally anticipated, but we responded to this challenge by adopting a variety of innovative approaches.  One of our most successful strategies was the bibliometric analysis of scientific publications to give a sense of the quantity and nature of the scientific activity taking place in the region.  Social Network Analysis (SNA) was used to provide insights into the nature of the relationships between different scientists and different academic fields working in the McMurdo Dry Valleys.  Results from this part of the project show a strong shift away from geological sciences towards ecological sciences since the conclusion of the Dry Valleys Drilling Project (DVDP) in the 1970s. \n\n \n\nThe initial findings from this project suggest that over the past 20-years or so, environmental management strategies have been broadly effectively at limiting the infrastructure footprint in the region.  Over the same period of time, the number of scientists publishing papers on the McMurdo Dry Valleys region has gone up quite significantly, and the number of publications is again rising after a prolonged dip following the end of the DVDP.  Putting these findings together suggests that with careful management, increased scientific productivity is possible without an increase in the spatial extent of scientific activities. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Adrian Howkins"
