 "awd_abstract_narration": "Large earthquakes occur on major fault zones. Obtaining spatio-temporal changes of seismic activities and detailed fault zone properties around the times of large earthquakes are long-sought goals in earthquake seismology. Sometimes large shallow earthquakes are preceded by increased seismic activity also known as ?foreshocks?. However, the exact relationship among foreshocks, mainshock nucleation and fault zone structures are still in debate. Recently several large earthquakes occurred around the Tibetan Plateau in China, and produced significant damages and casualties. These include the 2008 Ms7.3 Yutian, Ms8.0 Wenchuan, the 2010 Ms7.0 Yushu, the 2013 Ms7.0 Lushan, and the 2014 Ms7.3 Yutian earthquakes. Among them, the Yushu and Yutian mainshocks had clear evidence of M4-5 foreshocks, while the Wenchuan and Lushan mainshocks did not., a comprehensive analysis could provide us a better understanding on whether foreshocks exist and their physical mechanisms. This project will support a team to conduct a systematic examination of seismicity changes around the times of these large earthquakes in China, as well as high-resolution imaging of fault zone structures. The study will employ continuous waveforms recorded by permanent seismic stations around the region of each mainshock, as well as dense aftershock deployment. \r\n\r\nTo examine evolutionary changes in seismicity and fault zone processes, the researchers plan to conduct the following tasks: (1) Use a recently developed waveform matched filter technique to detect all earthquakes long before the occurrence of each mainshock; (2) Use newly relocate catalogs to search for spatio-temporal evolutions before mainshock, as well as performing Epidemic Type Aftershock Sequence (ETAS) modeling and deriving source properties; (3) Identify fault zone head waves along the rupture zones of several recent events; and (4) Perform joint inversion of P and FZHWs for high-resolution fault interface properties. With multi-facet techniques and extensive waveform data, they look to obtain a more complete picture on evolutions of seismic activities and their relationship with fault zone processes around the epicenters of several large intra-plate earthquakes in China. This project can provide important new evidence on the existence (or lack of) precursory changes that precede large mainshocks. The obtained results are essential for evaluating the use of foreshocks as forecasting tools and seismic hazard mitigation in these regions. The project will develop data products such as newly detected earthquake catalog and share with other researchers via peer-reviewed publications. This project will support both graduate students and undergraduate interns to conduct scientific research in China, and promote international collaboration. The project is co-supported by the ISE Global Venture Fund.",

Better understanding these earthquake sequences and properties of active faults hosting these earthquake ruptures can improve our understanding of the physical mechanism of earthquake triggering and intraplate seismicity.</p>\n<p>In the first research direction, we performed a comprehensive detection of foreshocks and early aftershocks of several major earthquakes in China, including the 2008 M 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake (Ruan et al., BSSA, 2017; Yin et al., JGR, 2018) and the 2013 magnitude 6.6 Lushan earthquake (Wu et al., JGR, 2017). We utilized earthquakes listed in the standard catalogs as templates, and scan through continuous waveforms to detect additional events based on a template matching technique (Figure 1).</p>\n<p>Wu et al. (JGR, 2017) found that aftershocks of the Lushan earthquake in the first hour mostly occur around the mainshock slip region, and aftershocks at later times show systematic expansions, likely driven by continuous aseismic slip (i.e., afterslip) of the Lushan mainshock. Yin et al. (JGR, 2018) found similar expansions of early aftershocks following the Wenchuan earthquake (Figure 2). In addition, early aftershocks also illuminated a shallow and steep dipping fault, likely corresponding to the two active faults that ruptured during the mainshock.</p>\n<p>In the second direction, we examined how the occurrence of distant major earthquakes changed local seismicity in several seismically active regions, also known as remote dynamic triggering. Li et al. (Tectonophysics, 2017) systematically detected microseismicity in Southern Tibet following the 2015 M 7.8 Nepal earthquake. Han et al. (EPSL, 2017) found a magnitude 3.8 earthquake in Western China remotely triggered by the Rayleigh wave of the Nepal mainshock. Li et al. (JEAS, 2019) compared remote triggering behaviors in Yunnan province, South China following several great earthquakes in Western Sumatra.</p>\n<p>Li et al. (Tectonophysics, 2017) found that seismicity in Southern Tibet increased shortly ollowing the M7.8 Nepal earthquake, including two M&gt;5 normal-faulting events about 3 and 11 hours after the mainshock (Figure 3). Our results highlight potential increase of seismic hazard in Southern Tibet due to occurrence of major thrust earthquakes along the Himalaya frontal thrust faults. Han et al. (EPSL, 2017) found two local events (~<em>M</em><sub>L</sub>2.5, and&nbsp;<em>M</em><sub>L</sub>3.8) near Qijiang in Southwest China with ~15 seconds during the surface waves of the Nepal mainshock (Figure 4). The triggering site is close to hydraulic fracturing wells that began production in 2013-2014. Hence we suspect that fluid injections may increase the region&rsquo;s susceptibility to remote dynamic triggering. This is consistent with another study near Beijing, China, where remote triggering occurred close to an active coalmine (Wang et al., JGR, 2015). These studies suggest that human activities can perturb subsurface stress conditions, increasing the likelihood of being triggered by distant earthquakes.</p>\n<p>We also included two undergraduate interns (supported by this project and the IRIS internship program) to perform a systematic detection of remotely triggered seismicity in North China following the 2008 M 7.9 Wenchuan earthquake (Figure 5). They have presented their work at the annual AGU meeting in 2016 and 2018 (Goldhagen et al., AGU, 2016; Spangler et al., AGU, 2018).</p>\n<p>In the third direction, we performed a systematic search for possible fault zone head waves using abundant aftershock observations following the 2010 magnitude 6.9 Yushu earthquake (Yang et al., EPSL, 2015), and the 2013 Mw6.7 Lushan earthquake (Daniels et al., AGU, 2016). These studies are among the first to observe fault zone head waves in intraplate settings, suggesting that bi-material interfaces are universal features of major faults, and are not only attached to plate-boundary regions or strike-slip faults only.</p>\n<p>To help analyzing large amount of seismic data, we also developed two methods to pick additional P and S phases for local earthquakes (Li and Peng, SRL, 2016), and automatically pick fault zone head waves that propagates along the bi-material fault interfaces (Li and Peng, GJI, 2016).</p>\n<p>This project helped to fund several graduate students at Georgia Tech, and their work has become major components of their Ph.D. thesis. It also partially supports PI Peng?s effort to work with several visiting scientists from China to conduct collaborative work, which resulted in several peer-reviewed publications. In addition, this project supported four IRIS interns to visit the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and conducted research related to this project. All of them have produced abstracts and presentations in the 2016 and 2018 AGU meetings. In addition, two female interns are currently enrolled as Ph.D. student in Seismology at two US institutions. Hence, this project also helps to attract talented students into the pipeline of Geosciences.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/13/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zhigang&nbsp;Peng</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1447091/1447091_10389296_1550091561135_figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1447091/1447091_10389296_1550091561135_figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
