 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award is to investigate how the cytoskeleton (internal cell scaffolding) of tendon progenitor cells regulates developing tissue mechanical properties to influence tendon formation. Tendon transmits forces from muscle to bone, and fails to regenerate when injured, often resulting in permanent orthopedic dysfunction. The premise of this study is that understanding how the tendon forms during embryonic development will advance tendon regeneration strategies. Inside all cells are cytoskeletal filaments that act as scaffolding to impart mechanical integrity to a cell, and that also sense and transmit extracellular physical forces as biological signals inside a cell. These signals can direct cells to secrete and surround themselves with matrix, from which adult tissues derive their mechanical properties. In turn, cells can sense these mechanical properties and receive new signals, and so forth. However, this scenario is less likely with embryonic tendon as the tissue is highly cellular and lower in matrix content, leading to the question of from where do mechanical cues arise during development, and how do they direct tendon formation? The goals of this project are to investigate the cytoskeleton as a significant contributor to the mechanical properties of highly cellular embryonic tendon, and to determine its role in the mechanoregulation of new tendon formation. Toward that end, this study will chemically modify the cytoskeletal network of tendon progenitor cells in both embryonic tissues and simplified 3-dimensional engineered tendons, and the resultant effects on embryonic tendon mechanical properties and new tissue formation will be assessed with engineering and biological tools.\r\n\r\nSuccessful outcomes of this study would advance the field's understanding of embryonic tendon development, and significant roles the cell cytoskeleton plays in this process. Knowledge gained could lead to improved medical interventions for orthopedic disorders. Scientifically, this work could have a transformative impact across biological fields since the cytoskeleton influences important cell functions in tissue maintenance, aging and disease. The educational objectives of this award focus on the recruitment and mentorship of undergraduate engineering students as young scientists and educators, and on outreach activities to educate the public about cutting-edge research at the intersection of engineering and biology. This will be accomplished via undergraduate student-driven research projects in the laboratory, course projects in the classroom, and teaching events at the Museum of Science in Boston and the Museum of Science in Rochester.",

Tendon fails to regenerate when injured, often resulting in permanent orthopaedic dysfunction. Our long term goal is to understand how the tendon forms during embryonic development and to use this knowledge to advance strategies to regenerate tendon. The objective of this award was to investigate how mechanically functional tendons develop during embryonic development. To do this, we asked how intracellular (e.g. cytoskeleton) and extracellular elements (e.g. mechanical cues) contribute to and regulate tendon mechanical properties during development using the chick embryo model. We used the chick embryo model because it is well established that chick embryo orthopaedic tissues develop similarly as mammals and because it is a more accessible and affordable system than mammalian animal models. Using both leg explant cultures as well as engineered tendon constructs, we discovered that inhibition of cytoskeletal network formation within cells leads to significant reductions in the elastic modulus of the native and engineered tendons. These findings demonstrated the tendon cell cytoskeleton is a significant contributor to embryonic tendon mechanical properties. We also tested the effects of the extracellular mechanical microenvironment on tendon formation by inducing paralysis and hypermotility of chick embryos during development <em>in ovo</em>. We discovered immobilization significantly compromises tendon mechanical properties, whereas increased movement frequency dramatically improves tendon mechanical properties. These results showed that movements during embryonic development are critical for the development of mechanically functional tendons. Collectively, these findings revealed the development of tendon mechanical properties is dependent on both the cytoskeletal network within cells as well as dynamic mechanical cues imposed on cells, such as during movement. These studies also led to the development of new protocols with which to characterize the mechanical properties of embryonic connective tissues and novel bioreactor systems with which to regulate embryo limb movements during development. These scientific outcomes highlighted the complexity of tendon formation and provided new insight into how intracellular and extracellular mechanics may be necessary for healthy tissue formation during development and engineered tissue formation, with potential implications for future medical interventions for orthopaedic disorders.
