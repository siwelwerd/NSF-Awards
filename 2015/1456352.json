 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is the significant improvement of\r\nsurgical accuracy, which will dramatically reduce surgical errors, improve outcomes and\r\nreduce healthcare costs. In spine surgery alone, there are more than 500,000\r\nprocedures every year in the US utilizing implants such as screws. In 4% to 11% of\r\nthese surgeries, the implant placement is inaccurate. For the patient this translates into\r\nlonger recoveries - from days to weeks - and in many cases into a second revision\r\nsurgery. The patient is non-productive, unable to carry out their daily routines for weeks,\r\nwhile the healthcare system has to absorb the costs of the longer recovery as well as\r\nthe revision surgeries. For both the healthcare and economic systems these are\r\navoidable costs. The medical imaging technology being developed in this project has\r\nthe potential to eliminate surgical inaccuracies across the $2.4B market of image\r\nguidance, improving clinical applications that range from orthopedic surgery to minimally\r\ninvasive vascular interventions, to cancer diagnosis and treatments.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project will demonstrate a\r\nnovel imaging modality, which provides near-real-time 3D live imaging - 4D - during\r\nsurgery. This novel system will provide surgical imaging at a lower x-ray dose than\r\nfluoroscopy (current standard), with a geometry that allows concurrent imaging with\r\nsurgery. This 4D technology has the potential to significantly reduce surgical\r\ninaccuracies, improve outcomes and reduce costs. Phase 1 successfully demonstrated\r\nthe feasibility of the reconstruction algorithm used by the proposed imaging modality by\r\nshowing its potential of higher surgical accuracy in a single spinal screw insertion. This\r\nPhase 2 project will I) prove the robustness of the reconstruction algorithm across a\r\nvariety of use-cases, II) demonstrate the clinical usability of the 4D scanner, and III)\r\nconfirm the clinical utility of the scanner. The clinical usability will be studied with an\r\nergonomic model in a surgical setting. The clinical utility will be proven by building a\r\nsystem prototype and performing image quality and x-ray dose comparisons versus\r\nfluoroscopy and 3D in a realistic surgical setting. Preliminary results show that these\r\nobjectives are achievable. This research is readying the technology for clinical research,\r\nregulatory clearance and commercialization.",
