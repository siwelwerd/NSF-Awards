 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project instabilities in dynamical systems will be studied.  In dynamical systems the way in which a system obeying some fixed rules evolves over time is studied. The long term behavior of a deterministic dynamical system may be chaotic and unpredictable.  Such behavior is termed \"instability\". An example is the well-known butterfly effect, where there is a sensitive dependence on the initial conditions in which a small change of the initial state of a system may lead to huge differences in later states.   The proposed research will study instabilities of systems arising in classical mechanics and general relativity. The goal is to understand how the instability occurs and to quantify its properties. Another goal is to discover unknown phenomena based on a new understanding of instability mechanisms.\r\n\r\nThe proposed projects fall into the following three different fields.  The first project is to study Hamiltonian systems using symplectic methods. This will be a continuation of previous work.  It includes finding periodic orbits and homoclinic or heteroclinic orbits satisfying certain topological constraints in non-convex Hamiltonian systems.   The next project is to try to use the methods of proving Arnold diffusion to study systems in general relativity.   The interest is in showing Arnold diffusion in a perturbed Kerr-de Sitter metric and the physical meaning of Arnold diffusion in this setting is the Penrose process for energy and angular momentum extraction from black hole. In the last project the PI and his collaborators will use a general dynamical system without Hamiltonian structure to produce positive Lyapunov exponents in concrete systems with the help of small random perturbations.   In particular, for two dimensions the methods show positive Lyapunov exponents for a randomly perturbed standard map.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe original PI is a young researcher who proposed exciting new avenues of research into the classical problem of instabilities in dynamical systems.  A central question, and one vitally related to the subject of the proposal, is whether the configuration of a group of heavenly bodies (for example, our own solar system) is stable: is it possible that at some future date Mercury will go into retrograde?  The original PI completed several important papers related to this theme during the award period, including a proof that instabilities are in some sense to be expected.  The original PI also explored further avenues of instabilities, notably proving in a collaborative work that the famous standard map displays genuine and predictable chaotic behavior when a tiny amount of random noise is introduced.\n\nThe original PU used the granted funds to support his research into these and related problems, some of which required travel to visit collaborators in New York and in China.  His work was widely disseminated and appeared in some of the top journals in mathematics, including the Annals of Mathematics.\n\nAfter two years of support, the original PI moved to a job abroad and transfered the grant to another senior PI who used the remaining funds to support travel to an international conference on instabilities in dynamical systems held in Provo, UT during the summer of 2017.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/12/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anne M Wilkinson"
