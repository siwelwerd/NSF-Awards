 "awd_abstract_narration": "During normal development, signals between cells in the early embryo can have\r\nsubstantial influence on how the body develops, such as how the eyes and brain\r\nbecome localized in the head or how the spinal cord becomes localized on the back and\r\nnot the belly. These early events have a tremendous effect on the organization of the\r\ntissues within the body and are critical for normal development of all animals. This\r\nproject will determine how changes in early developmental mechanisms can lead to\r\nformation of new body parts. The three study animals are segmented worms, and offer\r\nthe advantage that their embryos possess only 16 to 64 cells when these critical early\r\nsignaling events occur. This contrasts with the approximately 1000 cells at a comparable\r\nstage in the vertebrate embryo. Thus, development will be studied on the single cell level,\r\nand similar cells can be compared across distantly related animals. The specific goals of\r\nthis study are to identify the signaling cell and the molecules responsible for instructing\r\nsurrounding cells to correctly position and generate body parts. The proposed study will\r\nprovide strong STEM training opportunities by integrating scientific training with research\r\nfor college students, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. In addition, there will\r\nbe ongoing community outreach activities, including hands-on activities with several\r\ndifferent K-12 age groups in the local school districts to teach about animal biodiversity\r\nof the oceans, and general talks to adults in the local community.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to understand how developmental changes lead to a range of body\r\nplans, and represents a unique opportunity to gain insight into the evolution of\r\ndevelopmental programs. A group of animals known as the Spiralia exhibit enormous\r\nbody plan diversity, yet many phyla in this clade share a highly stereotypic embryological\r\nprogram called spiralian development. This conservation allows studies of the evolution\r\nof homologous embryonic cell lineages with single cell resolution across diverse taxa.\r\nSpecifically, the molecular signaling repertoire of a single cell will be determined, and the\r\nevolutionary plasticity of its organizing activity will be assessed by comparing distantly\r\nrelated species. Spiralian development will be investigated experimentally in the\r\nannelids Capitella teleta, Platynereis dumerilii and Chaetopterus sp. The phylogenetic\r\nposition and embryonic studies of the three species will be used to reconstruct the\r\nancestral cellular and molecular characteristics of annelid organizing activity. Specific\r\ngoals of the project utilizing the three annelids are: 1) deletion of single cells in early\r\nstage embryos to identify cell(s) possessing 'organizing activity', 2) identification of\r\nmolecular signals that mediate organizing activity, 3) determination of the function of\r\norganizing signals by knockdown and mis-expression studies. The proposed study will\r\nprovide strong training opportunities by integrating scientific training with research, and\r\ncontinue to develop Capitella and Platynereis as annelid models for Evo-Devo studies.\r\nThere will be ongoing community outreach activities, including hands-on activities with\r\nseveral different age groups in the local school districts that highlight biodiversity in the\r\noceans, and general talks to adult audiences in the local community.",
