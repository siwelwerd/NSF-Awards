 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Audience Summary \r\n\r\nThis project uses historical methods to evaluate the extent and relative costs of Russian nature transformation activities from 1900 to the present. It is situated at the intersection of history of science and technology on the one hand, and environmental history on the other. It will study various projects embraced by Russian leaders to transform nature in the effort to improve economic performance, military preparedness, agricultural production, and industrial growth. Such projects include the building of huge hydroelectric-power stations, irrigation systems, transport and water transfer canals, and the draining wetlands. Many of the projects had significant social and environmental costs, such as the loss of hundreds of thousands of prisoners who were forced into the Stalinist gulag laborers in large-scale public works projects; and many ecosystems in Russia continue to suffer degradation from the projects to this day. The project is relevant to contemporary issues; under Vladimir Putin, Russia has again embraced many large scale, and potentially environmentally unsound projects. By considering the way in which Russian officials responded to the public in areas of critical technological choices, the project will shed light on the keys to reaching proper decisions about whether and where to pursue major pubic works projects, and how to balance environmental risks with the public good.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary \r\n\r\nThis study will contribute to understandings of human-nature interactions in comparative perspective, and of the influence of political, ideological, cultural, financial, and other factors on these interactions. Due to the closed nature of Soviet and Russian society, little is known of the motivations for Russian nature transformation projects, nor the extent of their short- and long-term costs. Nor have specialists considered at length the evolution of scientific ideas and concepts used in these projects. In addition, they have been little compared with other such efforts, for example, massive hydroelectricity projects in Brazil, China and India, or water basin transfer projects in the US, South Africa, and Australia. The study will enable more complete comprehension how the sciences and engineering connected with the projects developed over time. It will enable better comprehension of the way in which governments and citizens come together to carry out massive public works projects, how funding evolves, and the nature of the scientific and engineering organizations who undertake them. It will also reveal something of the interaction between scientists and the public, and not only in the former Soviet Union, but in such transitional regimes like Russia. Finally, it will provide awareness of the costs and benefits of various projects advanced to ensure material comfort, safety, and productivity of citizens.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDating to the Peter the Great, Russian leaders have believed the nation?s future depends on production, extraction and trade of natural and mineral resources: furs, forest and fish; later oil and gas, nickel, copper and platinum, electricity and water.  In their activities and programs, the ministries and state corporations of today?s Russian Federation epitomize this approach.  Since Russia?s greatness, they believe, depends on its resources, they intend to mine them, tap them, drill for them, process them and sell them to secure state power.  This approach &ndash; viewing natural systems and resources as goods to be processed, apprehending nature with an industrial ethos and treating it as a commodity machine &ndash; shares continuities with the Soviet and even Tsarist periods, as does, by definition, the manifestation of surprising nostalgia for Soviet politics and transformation projects among many citizens in Putin?s Russia.\n\nSoviet planners and Party officials joined engineers in pursuit of a series of massive interconnected projects aimed at transforming nature from the swampy taiga of Russia?s northwest to the deserts of Central Asia and the great rivers that flow through the tundra of Siberia into the Arctic Ocean.  The projects reflect the melding together of Enlightenment visions to improve upon nature, beliefs in the use of science and military to create a multinational, Russian-dominated empire, and convictions that natural and mineral resources are the key to state power, itself an unquestioned, desirable end.  Many of the projects had Tsarist roots in personnel, institutions, and even blueprints.\n\nMany of the Soviet era projects have been rejuvenated, and great projects eyed with the expectation of greater power and resources under state control  For example, the new hydropower stations of Rusgidro, born out of gulag construction projects of the 1940s and 1950s, and pursued under Brezhnev in the 1970s and 1980s, are arising again in the tundra to power the extraction of Siberian resources and generate foreign currency earnings through exports of electricity &ndash; and perhaps water, another valuable Russian commodity, to China; Putin?s minister of agriculture has suggested an interbasin transfer project from Siberia to China. Even the Tsarist project to transfer Siberia river water to Central Asia, modified under Stalin and pushed by 250 construction and engineering firms Brezhnev, has been rejuvenated in the press with Central Asian governments and China ready to be paying customers.  The rejuvenated Rosatom, the USSR?s ministry of nuclear weapons and reactors, offers self-aggrandizing pronouncements of dozens of reactor starts and sales of reactors abroad; at the same time its expensive new nuclear-powered icebreakers and floating nuclear power stations will support an oil and gas economy by making it possible to exploit these resources in the Arctic.  Like canals, irrigation systems, and railroads under the Tsars and their Soviet offspring, high tech dams and reactors are the tools of a commodity state seeking to industrialize nature.\n\nAnother aspect of this project has been to investigate institutional momentum:  the ability of projects and institutions to acquire resources and even expand even as political and economic conditions change.  The case of the Russian empire is the case of institutional momentum par excellence.  Not only have institutions been reborn in the post-gulag era as reputable engineering and construction firms, and then in post-Soviet period as state corporations, but they have secured unquestioned state support as the only means to manage and develop resources.  Similarly, state political culture, authoritarian in nature, grants these institutions vast power to move through the landscape to harvest resources and ore for the central authorities. Similarly, great continuity exists in the political culture of the Soviet period and contemporary Russia, and in many ways of the Imperial era, whereby powerful economic and political interests have gathered around the tsar, general secretary or president.\n\nIndeed, many of the features of the Soviet political economy and ideology have been reborn in contemporary Russia.  And a number of the unfinished projects of the Stalin or Brezhnev era &ndash; icebreakers, dams, railroads, irrigation systems &ndash; have also been reborn.  After an interregnum in engineering projects under the Yeltsin presidency in the 1990s brought about by a poverty-stricken government and failed economy, the Russian Federation has resumed a number of large-scale projects through corporations and ministries reborn from Soviet ones, using them as a symbol of state power, economic strength and enlightened leadership.  The impacts on local people, environments and ecosystems will likely be extensive.  But the legitimacy of the regime rests on its ability to exploit vast natural resources.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/03/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul R Josephson"
