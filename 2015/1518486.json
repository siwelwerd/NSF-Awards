 "awd_abstract_narration": "A non-technical description of the project that explains its significance and importance\r\n\r\nDeclines in water quality and increased exposure to infectious disease, particularly those that cause diarrhea, are recognized as persistent global health threats, especially in water-scarce areas of the world. In these dry regions, river floodplains are critical for human communities, but these same areas are also extremely vulnerable to human impacts. This project will use a multidisciplinary research approach to examine these linkages in order to improve the management and forecasting of diarrheal disease in general and particularly in vulnerable dryland systems.  The project will serve as a foundation for a multidisciplinary education program that will strengthen cross-cultural understanding and leadership in coupled natural and human systems research. This study brings direct benefits to society through the development of knowledge and tools that will identify periods of increased risk of diarrheal disease and degraded water quality allowing vulnerable communities in dryland regions sufficient lead time to identify public health preparedness.\r\n\r\nA technical description of the project\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on three significant problems: (1) basic knowledge of the coupled dynamics of fluvial processes and water quality in drylands and the influence of anthropogenic and natural influences on pathogen pollution and health; (2) sociocultural and economic variables that influence waterborne disease dynamics and system feedbacks; and (3) appropriate tools to monitor indicators of system change and intra-annual forecasting ability. The project will examine the coupled natural human dynamics in dryland river floodplains in southern Africa by using advanced sensing, molecular, microbiological, and modeling tools that span multiple disciplines. The study area spans part of Namibia and Botswana in a region where human diarrheal disease outbreaks are coupled to fluvial processes and microbial water quality dynamics. Empirical studies of this dryland river system will be integrated with dynamical modeling of the environmental and human- system components of diarrheal disease. Project outcomes will: i) provide robust empirical data; ii) advance dryland fluvial, soil microbial, and socioeconomic theory and public health policy; and iii) produce generic tools for managing and forecasting the coupled dynamics of microbial water quality and health in other drylands globally.",

We conducted a study of the Chobe River floodplain system in northern Botswana, a dryland river system that floods annually and is the source of drinking water for 7 villages, their domestic animals, and water dependent wildlife. Data identify a significant coupling between human diarrheal disease, human behaviors, flood pulse dynamics, meteorology, ENSO phenomena, and wildlife distributions along riparian areas in this region. We also identify extensive antibiotic resistance (AR)&nbsp; in surface waters of the Chobe River with spatiotemporal variation associated with landscape use and seasonality, and water quality variables. Similar AR profiles were identified between human, water, and wildlife isolates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We fully characterized the dryland fluvial landforms of the region. We further characterized the&nbsp; land cover change over three decades and the influence of climate, fire, and elephants on these dynamics, information critical to improving land use planning and management strategies under future climate change scenarios for the region. Natural resource dependencies were widespread across study villages, highlighting the vulnerability of the population to environmental fluxes.&nbsp; Household surveys further suggest important couplings between sanitation type and practices, fly densities, and diarrheal disease dynamics.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also developed a fully parameterized hydrological model of the Upper Zambezi River including the Chobe River Floodplain system. This model can be used as a critical early warning system for both drought and flood conditions as well as extreme weather events, providing lead time for mitigation efforts and population preparedness. To address data needs for hydrological modeling across the globe, we created a large basin data portal (www.caracal.info) allowing users to visualize, map, interpolate, and reformat environmental data needed for hydrological models for use in any system.&nbsp; We created seasonal flooding maps of the Chobe River Floodplain system using innovative machine learning approaches.</p>\n<p>We applied multimodel inference approaches assessing the influence of river height, water quality (bimonthly counts of Escherichia coli and total suspended solids [TSS], 2011&ndash;2017), and meteorological variability on weekly diarrheal case reports among children under 5 presenting to health facilities (n = 10 health facilities, January 2007&ndash;June 2017). During this period, a 1-meter drop in river height corresponded to an estimated 16.7% and 16.1% increase in reported diarrhea with a 1- and 4-week lag, respectively. In this region, as floodwaters receded from the surrounding floodplains, TSS levels increased and were positively associated with diarrheal cases (0- and 3-week lag). We also demonstrated that a compartmental model coupled with data assimilation can be used to generate accurate forecasts of diarrheal disease and identify El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) teleconnection. La Ni&ntilde;a conditions lagged 0-5 months were associated with higher-than-average incidences of childhood diarrhea with ENSO providing a potential long-lead prediction tool for childhood diarrhea in southern Africa.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also characterized a new protoparvovirus in the feces of children with diarrhea within the study area. Of concern is that this virus is closely related to another, known to cause skin cancer in humans. We developed a non-invasive pit latrine sampling technique for use in community health surveillance efforts where health belief systems and health seeking behaviors may limit detection of disease through traditional public health surveillance approaches.&nbsp;&nbsp;In flood pulse river-floodplain systems, rapid changes in surface water quality may influence the ability of water treatment plants to provide safe drinking water to human populations. Climate change is expected to increase hydrological variability, further influencing the vulnerability of populations in this and similar regions. As distant weather patterns influence local flood dynamics, use of country-level data may not be adequate to predict climate impacts on human health in these types of systems. Additionally, where populations with high HIV infection levels occur, public health focus may need to be extended to include other at-risk groups beyond children under five, such as HIV-infected individuals and others that may also be immunocompromised. Maintaining natural areas in this region and elephant access to permanent surface water resources will be critical to minimizing wildlife impacts to surface water resources and coupled human health impacts.</p>\n<p>Our work has resulted in the production of 20 publications and 24 presentations nationally and internationally.

The project educational program was successfully delivered across 12 schools in the district reaching more than 420 children a week prior to the pandemic (efforts combined with the EEID award outputs).
