The Marcel Grossmann meeting is one of the two main international conferences in gravitation. It is organized every three years and is attended by approximately 500-1000 participants from all over the world. This award provides travel support to the most deserving participants from the US. The award will be shared, giving priority to participants with accepted abstracts for oral presentations and junior participants.\r\n\r\nA panel comprised of theoreticians and experimentalists in gravitational physics will be convened to evaluate applications for travel support from qualified candidates from the US. Priority will be given to participants with accepted talk abstracts and to researchers with either no or reduced NSF funding. The panel will decide on the number of awards depending on the quality and quantity of applications received.",
