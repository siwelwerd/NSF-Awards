 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is one component of a collaborative effort to fund the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) Science Education Center Partnership between Southern University in Baton Rouge (SUBR), LA, the LIGO Livingston site in Livingston, La, through the Baton Rouge Area Foundation (BRAF), and the Exploratorium. The managing institution for LIGO itself is California Institute of Technology.  The project is the continuation of the LIGO Science Education Center Partnership focused on scientific outreach to the general public, teacher training, and teacher education focused on LIGO activities in Louisiana. A previous award helped create the SEC building, with a classroom and a large exhibit hall, with exhibits developed by the Exploratorium and staffed by SUBR student docents and a (separately funded) professional staff.  The multilayered partnership of HBCUs, a cutting edge research facility and a renowned informal science center created a model for future partnerships. With the expansion of this partnership the model is extended, and research on the effects of these extensive partnerships can provide information for future attempts at leveraging the resources of research laboratories for educational purposes.\r\n\r\nThis project will use the LIGO-SEC Partnership to amplify and nurture a Science, Technology, Engineering, Education and Mathematics (STEEM) pipeline that taps into under-represented audiences and engages them in techniques that encourage students to advance their education in STEEM fields. The docent program and the teacher programs will increase participation of under-represented audiences within the STEEM fields. The docent program will train between sixty and eighty under-represented STEEM majors to become community ambassadors in conjunction with LIGO Science Education Center's outreach program, and the docents will interact with between 12,500 and 5,000 participants. The teacher professional development activities target high-need areas in New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The activities will develop around 250 teachers' familiarity with engineering design processes and underlying science concepts.  These teachers will create and build interactive science activities to use in the classroom to engage with students.  Graduate students will conduct new research in the use of inquiry and informal science methods within the formal (School) and informal (LIGO-SEC) environments. The graduate students' dissertations will contribute to the literature on Informal Science Education.  The project is guided by an on-going evaluation.",

The major, overall goal of this partnership was to create an exemplary statewide educational and informational resource to promote scientific learning and understanding in Louisiana and beyond. Consistent with their mission, these LIGO SEC partners have implemented initiatives and programs to achieve the following goals: (1) communicate LIGO-related science concepts to the public; (2) strengthen candidate and clinical educator science teaching and learning; (3) reach a broad audience of students in Louisiana and the surrounding region; and (4) create a national model for ways in which scientists and educators in universities, school districts, research observatories, and informal learning environments can work together to have a significant and positive impact on inquiry-based teaching and learning. Progress and attainment towards these goals was measured by external evaluators, Inverness Research.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>A unique model for a diverse partnership has been created to strengthen science education in Louisiana and beyond. The combined efforts of a cutting-edge astrophysical observatory (LIGO), a historically black college and university (HBCU - SUBR), and a leading museum specializing in informal science education (the San Francisco Exploratorium) resulted in an effective center for teacher training and student learning in science education. The LIGO-SEC Partnership has expanded and deepened the Science, Technology, Engineering, Education and Mathematics (STEEM) pipeline for under-represented audiences and engaged them in active techniques that encourage students? STEEM inclinations.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;<strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>The LIGO SEC partnership developed a pipeline for under-represented audiences to engage in STEEM. The diverse STEEM pipeline was established through three avenues: 1) Docent Program, 2) Teacher Professional Development &amp; LIGO Field Trips, and 3) Educational Research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;1)<strong> Docent Program</strong>: Docents are SUBR STEEM undergraduates who are trained by LIGO SEC and Exploratorium staff on inquiry-based LIGO science to facilitate the LIGO SEC field trip experience for K-16+ learners. SUBR STEEM undergraduates were engaged as docents and role models involved in school and community outreach led by LIGO SEC in consultation with the Exploratorium. Docents facilitated field trips to LIGO, led activities at family math and science nights and other public outreach events and served as role models for younger learners. Strengthening students? cognitive and non-cognitive skills was emphasized in the training. This grant trained 62 new SUBR undergraduates from underrepresented groups as docents.</p>\n<p>2) <strong>Student Impacts through Teacher Professional Development &amp; LIGO Field Trips</strong>: The LIGO SEC Partnership provided workshops for 785 in-service and pre-service teachers from at least 20 (out of 64) different Louisiana Parishes to strengthen their conceptual understanding of and excitement for the physical sciences, thus impacting approximately 100,000 K-12+ learners in classrooms. A subset of these teachers had the opportunity for field trips to LIGO to enhance their students? STEM Identities, resulting in 5,943 students whose teachers took them to LIGO during the year they were trained, with many more students attending LIGO field trips in subsequent years. Selected teachers were trained to be leaders in their school communities magnifying the effect of their training and broadly disseminating the results in professional settings, such as the National Science Teachers Association Annual Conference and the Smithsonian Science Education Center Virtual Professional Development Workshop. Louisiana science teachers were afforded the opportunity to participate in the Exploratorium?s Summer Institute, and four Louisiana physics teachers participated in an exchange with colleagues in Scotland.</p>\n<p>3)<strong> Research on Educational Effectiveness</strong>: Doctoral students in the SUBR Science/Mathematics Education Doctoral program conducted research on programs and activities of the LIGO-SEC Partnership that are reflected in dissertations and refereed publications. Additionally, Inverness Research Associates, the external evaluator, conducts overview assessments of the programs and provides formative recommendations.</p>\n<p>As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the LIGO SEC Partnership coordinated and implemented most of its programs and activities to be delivered virtually. Now the partnership has multiple viable modes of delivery (in-person, online, and hybrid) for its Docent Program, Teacher PD, and field trips with LIGO SEC.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>The LIGO SEC Partnership has provided thousands of learners from underrepresented groups with the unique opportunity to experience science education in an innovative and meaningful way, both in-person and virtually. This impact will be experienced for generations to come, as the teachers and docents who trained with the LIGO SEC Partnership Staff continue to impact the community around them.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;A&nbsp;Stubblefield</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div

The diverse STEEM pipeline was established through three avenues: 1) Docent Program, 2) Teacher Professional Development &amp; LIGO Field Trips, and 3) Educational Research.\n\n 1) Docent Program: Docents are SUBR STEEM undergraduates who are trained by LIGO SEC and Exploratorium staff on inquiry-based LIGO science to facilitate the LIGO SEC field trip experience for K-16+ learners. SUBR STEEM undergraduates were engaged as docents and role models involved in school and community outreach led by LIGO SEC in consultation with the Exploratorium. Docents facilitated field trips to LIGO, led activities at family math and science nights and other public outreach events and served as role models for younger learners. Strengthening students? cognitive and non-cognitive skills was emphasized in the training. This grant trained 62 new SUBR undergraduates from underrepresented groups as docents.\n\n2) Student Impacts through Teacher Professional Development &amp; LIGO Field Trips: The LIGO SEC Partnership provided workshops for 785 in-service and pre-service teachers from at least 20 (out of 64) different Louisiana Parishes to strengthen their conceptual understanding of and excitement for the physical sciences, thus impacting approximately 100,000 K-12+ learners in classrooms. A subset of these teachers had the opportunity for field trips to LIGO to enhance their students? STEM Identities, resulting in 5,943 students whose teachers took them to LIGO during the year they were trained, with many more students attending LIGO field trips in subsequent years. Selected teachers were trained to be leaders in their school communities magnifying the effect of their training and broadly disseminating the results in professional settings, such as the National Science Teachers Association Annual Conference and the Smithsonian Science Education Center Virtual Professional Development Workshop. Louisiana science teachers were afforded the opportunity to participate in the Exploratorium?s Summer Institute, and four Louisiana physics teachers participated in an exchange with colleagues in Scotland.\n\n3) Research on Educational Effectiveness: Doctoral students in the SUBR Science/Mathematics Education Doctoral program conducted research on programs and activities of the LIGO-SEC Partnership that are reflected in dissertations and refereed publications. Additionally, Inverness Research Associates, the external evaluator, conducts overview assessments of the programs and provides formative recommendations.\n\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the LIGO SEC Partnership coordinated and implemented most of its programs and activities to be delivered virtually. Now the partnership has multiple viable modes of delivery (in-person, online, and hybrid) for its Docent Program, Teacher PD, and field trips with LIGO SEC.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe LIGO SEC Partnership has provided thousands of learners from underrepresented groups with the unique opportunity to experience science education in an innovative and meaningful way, both in-person and virtually. This impact will be experienced for generations to come, as the teachers and docents who trained with the LIGO SEC Partnership Staff continue to impact the community around them.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael A Stubblefield"
