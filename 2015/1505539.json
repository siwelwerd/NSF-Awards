The conference will bring together senior researchers from around the world with young mathematicians to exchange the most recent developments in the field and facilitate scientific interaction. NSF funds will support participants that do not have access to grant funds of their own, with a particular emphasis on supporting the participation of graduate students and recent graduates from groups underrepresented in the mathematical sciences.\r\n\r\nThere have recently been major advances in several directions within the subject proposed for the conference, work which has led to numerous new questions and research programs. Among these are: the work on the Milnor and Bloch-Kato conjectures and the new techniques introduced for it, including a useable category of motives and motivic homotopy theory; the introduction of algebraic cobordism and its use in proving degree formulas; advances on and applications of trace methods; progress on the Farrell-Jones and Baum-Connes isomorphism conjectures and applications in geometric topology. The goal of the conference is to explore the connections between these research projects and share methods and techniques as well as the newest results. More details about the conference can be found at https://sites.google.com/site/kchm2015/.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the Algebra, Number Theory, and Topology programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Conference on K-theory, Cyclic Homology and Motives was held at\nRutgers University in New Jersey from Wednesday August 19 through\nFriday August 22, 2015, on the opportunity of Professor Charles\nA. Weibel's 65th birthday.  About 50 researchers and aspiring\nresearchers from five continents and all parts of the US assembled to\ndiscuss topics ranging from algebraic geometry and motives, to\ngeometric topology and surgery theory, to homotopy theory.  A diverse\nline-up of seventeen speakers presented cutting-edge new discoveries\nto guide discussion; ample time was also available for the\nmathematicians present - from graduate students, through junior\nresearchers, to senior colleagues - to connect and talk about their\nresearch in smaller groups.  To further enhance the opportunities for\nthe attendants to connect across all age groups, several social events\nwere planned, including a party at Professor Weibel's home, a banquet,\nand a lunch on the last day of the conference.  The occasion of many\nK-theorists being at the same place was also utilized to schedule a\nmeeting of the K-theory Foundation.  Thanks to the support from the\nNSF, we did not have to charge a registration fee for the conference,\nand we were able to support the travel and accommodation expenses of\nmost graduate students and junior researchers.  A special issue of the\nJournal of Pure and Applied Algebra will publish proceedings of this\nconference as well as contributions from colleagues who were prevented\nfrom being there.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anders S Buch"
