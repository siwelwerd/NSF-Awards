 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Instrumentation and Facilities (CRIF) programs, Miami University at Oxford will acquire a microfocus X-ray diffractometer. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. The studies described here will impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument will be an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of chemistry, biochemistry and geology graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) integrating paramagnetic resonance of high-spin cobalt systems using trispyrazolylborates and trispyrazolymethanes as ligands; (b) investigating the structure of cation and anion solid solutions in apatite; (c) studying surface structure induced dissymmetrization during crystal growth; (d) investigating decavanadates; (e) preparing large molecules with complex three-dimensional structures; (f) developing catalytic methods to affect difficult organic transformations; and (g) merging transition metal and organocatalysis for asymmetric organic transformations.",
