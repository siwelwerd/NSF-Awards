 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on developing novel statistical methods for the analysis of dependent data arising in biomedical applications. Often, frequency patterns in such data contain interpretable scientific information. The main motivating applications in this project include epilepsy-related EEG (electroencephalogram), sleep, and DNA sequence data. In epilepsy research, advance warning of an epileptic seizure based on the analysis of intracranial EEG could minimize injury, and give patients a sense of control in their management of the disease. Simultaneous analysis of multiple channels may lead to more accurate estimates, compared to separate analyses of signals from individual channels.  The proposed methodology will also be used to analyze data from the AgeWise study to help understand the connections between self-reported measures of sleep and electrophysiological signals.\r\n\r\nThis project is focused on adaptive spectral estimation for nonstationary multivariate time series using Bayesian modeling that relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for the estimation. Methods are developed for estimating local spectra of qualitative or quantitative bivariate and trivariate nonstationary time series. The multivariate Whittle approximation is used for approximating local likelihoods corresponding to small segments of the time series. Each approximate local likelihood is a function of the discrete Fourier transform of the segment and the corresponding local spectral matrix. Spectral matrices are expressed as modified Cholesky decompositions, thus allowing estimation that guarantees Hermitian and positive definite matrices. Smoothing splines are used for estimating the elements of the spectral matrices as a function of frequency. Additionally, the proposal develops methodology for the analysis of time series collected along with covariates on multiple subjects, where the goal is to model spectral matrices as a function of both frequency and covariates. The proposed methods are applied to the analysis of intracranial EEG signals from two channels in the brain of an epileptic patient, sleep data on older adults from the AgeWise study, and DNA sequences.",

Often, frequency patterns in such data contain interpretable scientific information. The main motivating applications in this project have included heart rate variability during sleep from the AgeWise study, high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) during a psychotic episode, rainfall in Australia, and weekly incidence rate of measles in the U.S. In analyzing the AgeWise data, we have found a potential biological pathway through which long sleep in older adults may influence health and functioning. This finding has the potential to inform interventions that optimize sleep to improve health. The power spectrum of high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) during transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and its evolution provide dynamic, high-resolution neurobiological information regarding neurological mechanisms. The goal of our analysis is to investigate hdEEG during TMS in patients who experience a first break psychosis, which is a potential precursor to a future diagnosis of schizophrenia. Simultaneous analysis of multiple channels of hdEEG may lead to more accurate estimates, compared to separate analyses of signals from individual channels. The analysis of Australian rainfall data is from February 1st  1876 to December 31st  2015. Of interest are climate drivers of rainfall. Oceanic and atmospheric interactions in the Pacific, Indian and Southern Oceans are thought to be the main climate drivers of the variability in Australian rainfall. Common proxies for these climate drivers are the following. In the Pacific Ocean, the Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) measures the difference in surface air pressure between Tahiti and Darwin. In the Indian Ocean, the Dipole Mode Index (DMI)  measures the change in sea surface temperature gradients between the tropical western Indian Ocean and the tropical south-eastern Indian Ocean. In the Southern Ocean, the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) records the difference in zonal mean sea level pressure at 40 degrees S and 65 degrees S. The analysis suggests that the southwest and mid-northeastern coast of Australia are experiencing more dry days, while the northwest of Australia is experiencing fewer dry days.  On days on which rain occurs, it is more extreme in the northeastern regions of Australia, while the reverse is true for the southwestern corner of Australia and mid-southeastern coast of Australia. The southwestern corner has  experienced a significant decline in rainfall levels. Measles is a highly contagious disease with possible complications that can include pneumonia, deafness, or death. Prior to the licensing of a vaccine in 1963, the incidence rate of measles averaged 318 cases per 100,000 population per year, with outbreaks occurring annually or every other year. After vaccine licensure, incidence declined dramatically, and endemic measles transmission was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000. The post-vaccine drop in the mean and power of incidence is the most obvious feature. It occurs in steps, starting with a dramatic drop following the licensing of the Edmonston vaccine in 1963, stalling around 1970, then dropping again around 1980. This corresponds to the waxing and waning of government funding and effort targeted at measles elimination, which culminated in an intensified elimination drive. An outbreak during the early 1990s received much attention and resulted in changes to the immunization schedule for children.</li>\n<li> This project is focused on  spectral estimation for nonstationary time series using Bayesian modeling that relies on Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for the estimation.
