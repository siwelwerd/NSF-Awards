The project analyzes subversive attacks, develops defenses and deterrents, creates privacy tools and software, and increases awareness and expertise through teaching, mentoring and involvement of students in research. \r\n\r\nThis research rethinks the basics of cryptographic security to provide new models, frameworks, tools and solutions. This project considers the subversion of random number generators and offers forms of encryption that are robust in its presence. The project explores: (1) the subversion of certificate authorities and offer certificate-signing mechanisms that deter it, (2) the exfiltration of cryptographic keys by malware installed on systems and development of big-key cryptography as a deterrent, and (3) the subversion of key distribution protocols through infiltration of their endpoints and development of new protocols to resist it.",
