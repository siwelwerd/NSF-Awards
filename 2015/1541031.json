 "awd_abstract_narration": "For a collection of scientific data to be useful to multiple independent research groups, the collection must contain auxiliary information that describes where and how the data were collected, the units of measurement used, and other similar details. This auxiliary information, known as \"metadata,\" is crucial to allowing scientists to understand the physical and derived quantities captured by the data.  The Climate and Forecast (CF) metadata conventions for netCDF (netCDF-CF)  are currently used widely by weather forecasters, climate scientists, and remote-sensing researchers to include metadata along with scientific data, and numerous open source and commercial software tools have been developed to explore and analyze data sets that use the conventions. This project will work to extend the existing metadata conventions in ways that will broaden the range of  earth science domains whose data can be represented.  By broadening the applicability of an established convention, this effort seeks to extend its benefits to related earth science domains and reduce the amount of effort scientists must expend decoding and reformatting datasets created by other research groups. This, in turn, will leave researchers more time for analysis, leading to a better understanding of the physical processes the data describe.\r\n\r\nNetCDF-CF is a community-developed standard first released in 2003. Originally designed to represent climate and forecast model output encoded in the netCDF binary format, with the specific goal of facilitating comparison of output from different models, the standard is now widely accepted in the climate, weather, and remote-sensing research communities, but less so in other earth science domains. This project will extend the standard to better represent a data set's spatial extents, and to encompass earth science data sets not currently covered by the conventions, including radar and more complex satellite data. Additionally, the project will work to make netCDF-CF compatible with data stored in modern data structures developed since the original creation of the conventions. Since netCDF-CF is a community-based standard, the approach will be to bring stakeholders from the existing CF community together with experts from domains into which CF can logically be extended so they can work together to design and prototype a series of enhancements, which will be submitted to the larger community for consideration. The envisioned improvements will help diverse research groups use the conventions to faithfully represent their data in formats accessible using standard, widely-available software tools.  This type of cross-domain data interoperability has the potential to give rise to more effective, integrated decisionmaking tools for a wide range of communities.",
