The capability to inject SO2 in the stratosphere will be added to the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model version of the Community Earth System Model (CESM-WACCM), a fully coupled land, ocean, ice, and atmospheric model extending through the stratosphere, which includes full interactive tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry.  The study will derive the most reasonable injection location(s) that can be used as degrees of freedom in a wel-designed geoengineering scenario.",
