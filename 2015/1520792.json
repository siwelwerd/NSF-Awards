 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds some of the research activities of Professor Ken D. Olum at Tufts University.\r\n\r\nCosmic strings are microscopically thin or even fundamental objects of cosmological length, which may or may not exist in our universe. Detection of cosmic strings would provide a window onto fundamental physics at energies beyond the reach of any accelerator.  Observation of a cosmic superstring network could provide a confirmation of the correctness of string theory.  Professor Olum's research will advance our knowledge of the cosmic string network as it would exist today and would have existed in the past under any specific cosmic string theory.  In particular, it will lead to accurate information about the spectrum of gravitational waves emitted by cosmic strings.  This information will allow us to determine the properties of the cosmic string network if such gravitational waves are detected in the future. If they are not detected, it will enable us to set limits on the possibilities for cosmic strings, and thus on underlying theories of high-energy physics. As a result, research in this area advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions:   the discovery and understanding of the universe.  Professor Olum will also involve graduate students in the work and thus train future generations of research physicists. The work will further connect studies of the universe with studies of the fundamental laws of nature.\r\n\r\nMore technically, Professor Olum will study the shape of cosmic string loops to determine how many cusps they have and to calibrate the signals that they might produce for comparison with observational limits on gravitational waves from pulsar timing.  He will also study networks that might arise from cosmic strings with a low probability of reconnection when they intersect each other, as might be found in cosmic superstring theories.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur universe may contain a network of cosmic strings, microscopically\nthin but astronomically long objects resulting from physics at very\nhigh energies.  If so, loops of cosmic string will oscillate and emit\ngravitational waves that we may be may be able to detect.  The\ngravitational waves from large numbers of loops will combine together\nto form a stochastic background, a kind of gravitational noise coming\nfrom everywhere in the sky.\n\nWe calculated the spectrum of these gravitational waves.  It depends\non the unknown energy scale &mu; at which the cosmic strings form.  The\nimage shows our predictions for this spectrum and compares them with\nthe detection capabilities of various current and proposed\ngravitational wave observatories.  Pulsar timing arrays (PTA in the\nimage) currently give the strongest bound on the possible energy scale\nof cosmic strings, limiting G&mu;/c2 (G is the gravitational constant, c\nthe speed of light) to be no more than about 10-11.  Also shown is\nthe highest possible contribution to the gravitational wave\nbackground that might come from supermassive black holes orbiting each\nother at the centers of galaxies.  If a gravitational wave\nbackground is discovered soon, it may be difficult to tell whether it\ncomes from strings or from black holes.\n\nFuture gravitational wave observatories, in particular the space\ninterferometer LISA, scheduled for 2035, will have much greater power\nto discover or constrain a network of cosmic strings.\n\nThe spectrum of the gravitational waves depends on the shape of cosmic\nstring loops.  The work above was done with a simplified model of how\nthese shapes evolve.  We also studied the detailed evolution of loop\nshapes, both on paper and by computer simulation.  Future work will\nuse this more-accurate calculation of the loop shape evolution to\nimprove the accuracy of our predictions of the gravitational wave\nbackground.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ken Olum"
