 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning Program (I-Corps L), this project will develop ways to increase the scale and impact of the CyberMentoring Network.  This network will provide a suite of innovative web-based and mobile tools to address the preparation, retention, and graduation of STEM students.  The CyberMentoring Network is specifically adapted for cases in which there are no formal networks in place to mentor students based on their specific needs. One of the keys to broadening participation of individuals from groups that have been traditionally underrepresented in STEM is to provide students with readily available information essential to making informed decisions and to assist institutions of higher education identify, recruit, mentor, retain, and place prospective STEM students. By offering students resources and access to mentors who are practitioners in the STEM field, students will be better able to understand the applicability of their coursework to their professional career. Furthermore, the CyberMentoring Network will impact students' social networks, social capital for work in STEM fields, and their preparation for graduate and professional school. \r\n\r\nImplementation of the CyberMentoring Network will be initially in minority serving institutions. The CyberMentoring Network will be instrumental in broadening the participation of individuals from groups underrepresented in STEM and thus, contribute to the strengthening of the STEM workforce. First-year students tend to experience the most difficulties in transitioning from high school to higher education institutions with STEM majors. These students tend to fall behind because they may not be well prepared for college STEM courses or because they may feel intimidated by the subject areas and/or fast-pace of the programs.  The CyberMentoring Network will utilize web-based and mobile tools tailored to the needs of STEM students. These tools are designed to mentor and empower minority and underrepresented students to access, research, organize, track, and realize their career options. CyberMentoring Network provides students with an easy way to communicate and interact from any geographic location with peers and STEM mentors (both educators and practitioners), create a support network, and access information about STEM careers.",
