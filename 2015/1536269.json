 "awd_abstract_narration": "In order to control the risk of severe socioecological impacts related to hydrocarbon extraction, enforcement of environmental laws on the part of state agencies is needed.  This doctoral dissertation research project will investigate the role of the state in the governance of natural resource extraction by examining the practices of environmental law enforcement in the hydrocarbon sector.  The project will contribute to a better understanding of environmental law implementation across time and space as well as the role of the state in influencing the socioecological consequences of resource extraction.  It will generate new insights in resource and legal geography by empirically assessing the complex relationships of environmental law enforcement and the role played by the state in the extractive sector.  The doctoral student will work with national and regional government agencies, social organizations, and international nongovernment organizations to disseminate project findings.  The project will inform policy-makers, government officials, academics, and environmental advocacy groups globally who seek to minimize the negative impacts of hydrocarbon extraction.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.\r\n\r\nThe doctoral student will investigate empirically the relationship between institutional capacity, autonomy and the enforcement of environmental laws related to the hydrocarbon sector by taking into account the interplay among the different actors and agencies involved.  She will address three core questions:  (1) How have increased budgets and regulatory competence led to enhanced autonomy and capacity in the practice of environmental monitoring?  (2) What are the conditions under which such institutional changes have translated into successful monitoring of the hydrocarbon sector?  (3) How do these processes and patterns vary across space?  The student will analyze databases on the institutional capacity and monitoring as well as conflictive and cooperative inter-agency relationships within Ecuador.  The analyses should yield a better understanding of the patterns of autonomy, capacity, and monitoring functions of the state agencies as well as enable a comparison of their effectiveness across jurisdictional units.",

The Ecuadorian state underwent a significant re-structuring in 2008, and since then has increased the budget as well as the regulatory competence of its Ministry of Environment significantly.&nbsp; This project took Ecuador as a case to investigate the conditions for successful environmental law enforcement in the hydrocarbon sector by asking how, and why (or why not) such institutional changes translated into the enforcement of environmental laws in the oil and gas sector on the ground. To answer this question the research project was designed as a comparative analysis of enforcement and state-building practices of the Ministry of Environment at the national and sub-national levels between the years 2005 to 2015. Methodologically, the research project employed the collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data, such as interviews, participant observation, official documents, and statistical records. Theoretically, the research projects draw on concepts of the role of state in natural resource extraction by legal and resource geographies, institutional ethnographies of state-making, theories of regulatory enforcement, and theories of the resource curse. Among important results of this research project is the finding that planning documents <em>do</em> matter for the allocation of state-budget to the environmental monitoring of the oil and gas sector.&nbsp; This is shown by the ranking of environmental variables in budget planning reports being parallel to years in which the programs linked to environmental monitoring of the oil and gas sector at the Ministry of Environment received the most budget. Another important finding suggests that material and behaviour residues of enforcement practices previous to the constitutional change pose considerable challenges to the current enforcement practices as taking away work time that could be better invested in more surprise inspections.
