 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation is conducting a portfolio review for the facilities, science programs, and other activities of the Geospace Sciences (GS) section in the Division of Atmospheric and Geospace Sciences (AGS). The portfolio review is, in part, a response by the NSF to the recommendations highlighted for the Geospace scientific community in the National Research Council's (NRC) 2013 Decadal Survey, \"Solar and Space Physics: A Science for a Technological Society\". The review is being carried out by a Portfolio Review Committee (PRC), organized by NSF under its Advisory Committee for Geosciences. NSF has stated that the primary goal of the review, and of any resulting adjustments of the Geospace Section's portfolio, is to ensure that investments in the Geospace science disciplines and respective facilities are properly aligned, both now and in the future, with the needs and priorities of the Geospace scientific community and with the interests of the nation in funding cutting edge scientific research of relevance to national priorities. \r\n\r\nThis project, under the auspices of the National Research Council, will examine the portfolio review (PR) and undertake the following tasks: (1) determine how well the PR's findings, conclusions and recommendation align with the issues and priorities highlighted in the NRC decadal survey, (2) examine actions already taken by the GS section in response to the decadal survey, (3) provide a forward-looking focus on the potential of all GS funded facilities, programs and activities for delivering the desired science outcomes, and (4) provide a clear set of recommendations on how the GS section should implement the decadal survey's priorities within the context of the NSF/Geosciences strategic planning process. The activities covered by this award will be done by a committee of up to 12 members who will be appointed under the auspices of the Space Studies Board and its Standing Committee on Solar and Space Physics (CSSP). The committee will meet up to three times over a five-month period. The committee's analysis and evaluation of the GS portfolio review will be based on its collective expertise supplemented by information and data gathered independently during the course of the study.",
