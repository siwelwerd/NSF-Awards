 "awd_abstract_narration": "In addition to the conventional concern of stability and collapse in large-scale engineering structures, buckling phenomena play a key role in many other natural and engineered systems, e.g., plants responding to stimuli, deformations of macro-scale engineering structures, patterning of periodic porous materials, and design of 3D shapes from 2D nanostructures. More generally, predicting the escape from a potential energy well is a universal exercise, and governs behavior in many physical systems that are unable to maintain stability in the face of disturbances. All these situations are essentially dominated by the large-scale organization of system states, as the system finds a way to exit one state (i.e., behavior) and get to another. Often this transition is sudden, and the consequences of this escaping behavior may be catastrophic. Focusing attention on low-order experimental buckling systems is the key intermediate step in transitioning from an abstract theoretical concept to practical and design-oriented guidelines. This award supports an effort to apply a new paradigm, by way of a fresh theoretical-computational approach, to assess the ways in which the problem of escape can be tested experimentally, in a statistical sense, and hence provide a framework for prediction, design, and in some cases prevention, laying the groundwork for more sophisticated design and control of such systems. This project brings together two researchers from complementary backgrounds. Although the framework will be developed within the realm of nonlinear structural dynamics, there are many other potential applications of the mathematics: chemical reactions, nanostructures, earthquake engineering, ship dynamics, to name a few, and even possible utility beyond engineering: certain biological and ecological systems. The broad range and reach of this research project will provide a strong training environment for undergraduate and graduate students. The research team will also develop an active outreach program to excite young minds about dynamics through snap-through phenomena and self-guided inquiry using 3D printer technology at high schools.\r\n\r\nThis award will support an effort in theoretical and applied mechanics to develop an innovative unified approach to experimental nonlinear structural buckling, using high dimensional cylinder-like phase space structures as the fundamental basis for understanding the dynamics governing motion between potential wells (equilibrium states) in phase space. These tube features organize the evolution of trajectories in phase space in a global sense. This point-of-view will be applied to understand the behavior of a number of axially loaded slender mechanical structures, of varying degrees of complexity.  Criteria and routes of escape from a potential well have previously been considered and determined for one degree of freedom systems with time-varying forcing, with reasonable agreement with experiments. However, when there are two or more degrees of freedom, the situation becomes more complicated. Yet, even for the higher dimensional case, recent work suggests the beginnings of a theoretical-computational framework for determining the boundary of those trajectories which will soon escape (or equivalently, transition between wells in multi-well systems). These methods are geometric in nature for deterministic systems, merging naturally into a probabilistic framework when noise and stochastic effects are incorporated. The research develops a consistent approach to a deeper understanding of an important class of structural mechanics problems, with potential applications to buckling prediction for traditional engineered structures, and emerging opportunities to design adaptive structures that can bend, fold, and twist, i.e., controllably morphing structures into a desired shape to achieve some objective.",
