 "awd_abstract_narration": "Astronomy has been making strides in increasing the participation of traditionally underrepresented groups. Several recommendations and strategies for broadening participation, especially of women in astronomy, have arisen from conferences dedicated to the subject. The \"Inclusive Astronomy\" conference and workshop will be held in June 2015 at Vanderbilt University. The focus of the workshop is on providing resources and advocating for inclusion of astronomers who identify with more than one underrepresented category, e.g. gender, race, disability, etc. The conference will cover topics including barriers to access; creating inclusive climates; inclusion and access to leadership, power, and decision making; and establishing a community of inclusive practice. The discussions will result in the astronomical community being better informed of research on diversity, equity, and inclusion, and in a set of recommendations that administrators, faculty, and the research community can use as a roadmap to improve the participation of all in astronomy. This award supports the conference travel and subsistence of a total of about 30 students and early-career researchers who would otherwise be unable to attend the conference.",
