 "awd_abstract_narration": "\"Big Data\" has emerged as a new approach to computing that is transforming science, engineering, medicine, health care, finance, business, and ultimately society itself. The IEEE International Conference on Big Data 2015 (IEEE BigData 2015) provides a leading venue for disseminating the latest research in big data research, development, and applications. The conference will take place in Santa Clara, California from October 29 - November 1, 2015. The conference co-chairs are Dr. Laura Haas (IBM), and Prof. Vipin Kumar (U. Minn.). The program committee co-chairs are:  Dr. Howard Ho (IBM), Prof. Beng Chin Ooi (National Univ. of Singapore), and Prof. Mohammed J. Zaki (RPI). This award will help support travel of Ph.D. students at U.S. universities who are primary authors on full papers that have been accepted to the technical program or are participating in the doctoral student symposium. Special efforts are being made to recruit and fund women and minority students.\r\n\r\nThis conference solicits high-quality original research papers in any aspect of big data, including infrastructure, management, search and mining, security and privacy, and applications. Contributions will advance the state of the art in techniques, algorithms, and systems.\r\n\r\nFor further information see the conference homepage: http://cci.drexel.edu/bigdata/bigdata2015/",
