 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Cyberlearning and Future Learning Technologies Program funds efforts that will help envision the next generation of learning technologies and advance what we know about how people learn in technology-rich environments. Capacity-building (CAP) projects increase the ability of researchers to understand how such technology should be designed and used in the future and supports new capacity in allowing researchers to answer questions about how people learn, how to foster or assess learning, and/or how to design for learning.  The proposed work is a series of summits designed to increase the capacity of researchers in the learning sciences community through exposure and instruction in advanced data analytic techniques.  It addresses a critical need at the intersection of two burgeoning fields of study and advances the larger goal of CAP projects.\r\n\r\nThis project is a series of summits that builds on previously funded NSF work to advance learning sciences.  Members of the learning science community are often unaware of the complementary developments in the data analytics community that could enhance the depth and impact of their work.  The participants in these summits are current NSF awardees, from various programs, whose work focuses on learning sciences.  Building through exposure and instruction in data analytics not only expands the body of knowledge at the interface of these two fields, it smartly leverages current NSF funded projects.",
