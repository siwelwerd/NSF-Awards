 "awd_abstract_narration": "BROADER SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PROJECT:\r\n\r\nThe proposed research site will recruit undergraduate students in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. The vicinity of the host institution, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology (SDSMT), to a number of Tribal Colleges and Universities affords SDSMT a unique opportunity to introduce research to American Indians students and provide them with the resources to complete degrees in the STEM fields.  \r\n\r\nThe site is entitled \"Technical Experience in Advancing Modeling Sciences (TEAMS).\" As the name implies, the research projects will involve modeling in a number of areas including materials, defense, renewable energy, and three-dimensional printing. The projects will be performed in parallel with experiments to best expose the participants to the research area and to best connect their findings to problems of interest.  For example, one modeling project will investigate why purification materials in biofuel production (i.e., ethanol from corn) clog up.  By understanding what occurs at the molecular level, and how the material interacts with the waste byproducts, the models can influence the design of new materials for these applications.  \r\n\r\nAlso, modeling projects are inherently collaborative, so the site will also teach students how to work in collaborative (i.e., team) environments. A number of skills feed into effective collaborative relationships, so workshops, seminars, and activities will be conducted to assist participants in developing these collaborative skills.  Some examples include teamwork building, writing workshops, and large data set analysis.  The ultimate goal is to provide the TEAMS REU participants the tools and experiences to increase their success as they pursue STEM careers.\r\n\r\nPROJECT DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the proposed research is to host a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site entitled \"Technical Experience in Advancing Modeling Sciences (TEAMS).\" The TEAMS REU site aims to provide undergraduates with the opportunity to make a significant contribution to collaborative modeling research projects. Specifically, the goals of the TEAMS REU site are as follows: (i) provide research opportunities in a number of modeling mediums including molecular dynamics, transport phenomenon, and solid mechanics, (ii) develop students' appreciation of team diversity and collaborative efforts in research, (iii) enhance students' teamwork, communication, critical thinking, and professional skills, (iv) expose students to the importance of modeling in a number of fields, (v) transition students from pre-engineering programs into four-year degree programs, (vi) guide students to pursue graduate programs, and (vii) increase the opportunities for underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nA number of activities are planned to meet these objectives. Some examples include developing teamwork skills, exposing students to modeling work outside the REU site, and writing workshops to enhance communication ability. The reason for developing these skills is because they are all important to modeling research. For example, modeling research is typically collaborative. As such, projects require researchers to work in a team setting and communicate their respective perspectives and expertise to their collaborative partners. Other objectives involve preparing participants for four-year or graduate programs and enhancing participation of underrepresented groups like American Indians. An example seminar is designed to guide students on how to identify and apply fora graduate program meeting their interests. With regards to research opportunities, a number of modeling projects have been designed to be completed by undergraduates within a year's time. These projects coincide with current experimental efforts and will complement those efforts.",
