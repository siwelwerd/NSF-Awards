 "awd_abstract_narration": "Superalloys are critical structural materials ideally suited for high performance gas turbine applications due their excellent resistance to deformation and environmental degradation at elevated temperatures.  Although many of the intrinsic characteristics of superalloys can be attributed to the underlying alloy chemistry, in many instances the properties of these alloys can be enhanced through engineering control of the structure at very fine scales.  Because many of the advanced turbine engines now operate at temperatures approaching the limits of existing superalloy capabilities, these engineering techniques can potentially extend the life and impart higher a higher degree of damage tolerance to many of these superalloy structures.  This award supports fundamental research to understand how the process parameters employed during metal forming and heating operations effect the development of morphology and fine structure. This research will impact advanced gas turbine technologies for power generation, space exploration, and aerospace/marine propulsion, with significant economic and environmental benefits, such as the reduced fuel consumption, minimization of carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions. The award will also support educational outreach programs at local Chicago high schools and assist in the training and education of US graduate students. \r\n\r\nThis research funded by this award aims to understand the fundamental mechanisms that govern the formation serrated grain boundaries in polycrystalline Ni-based superalloys containing a high proportion of Sigma-3 twin boundaries, and assess their combined effect on grain boundary sliding. The extent and effectiveness of coherent and semi-coherent precipitates to induce grain boundary perturbations will be assessed in two commercial superalloys.  In addition, bi-crystal samples possessing controlled misorientations will be fabricated to systematically quantify the effect of grain boundary misorientations on the formation and growth of perturbations.  Finally, nano-scale assessments of the compositional and mechanical attributes along the serrated boundaries will be combined with 3D microstructural characterization and in situ strain mapping to quantify the effectiveness of the serrations on grain boundary sliding.  These studies will contribute to the development of innovative thermal-mechanical processes that can be effectively used to tailor or engineer the mechanical properties of the alloy though the presence of meso-scale features.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGas turbine technologies for clean power generation and aerospace propulsion are continuously evolving in an effort to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.  Realization of many of these advances is limited by the temperature and strength capability of the Ni-base superalloys used in the hot section of the engine. In recent years, substantial effort has been dedicated towards the development of new chemistries of high temperature resistant materials and all in an effort to meet these design requirements. Equally as important, however, is the development of novel manufacturing processes that can be employed to optimize the underlying microstructure to further extend the temperature capabilities of both existing and new materials.  The ability to efficiently produce and engineer the microstructure of these critical structural materials with desirable features or characteristics that impart a higher degree of damage tolerance is both industrially relevant and scientifically challenging.  This award has supported an investigation at the Illinois Institute of Technology aimed at understanding how serrated and stitched grain boundaries can be developed to enhance the durability of Ni-base superalloys. \n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit: A novel thermal-mechanical processing approach was developed a commercial, powder processed Ni-base superalloy, RR1000.  By quantifying and modeling the nucleation and growth kinetics of primary, grain boundary gamma prime precipitates during cooling from the solution temperature, a two-step thermal process was developed to engineer and form serrations along the grain boundary. A slow cooling rate from the solution temperature was used to heterogeneously nucleate and grow coarse grain boundary precipitates that would form serrations along the grain boundary. By limiting the slow cooling rate to 10&#730;C below the solvus temperature and immediately increasing the cooling rate to a standard rate typical of large forgings, the size and dispersion of intragranular gamma prime precipitates was comparable to conventionally processed Ni-base superalloys.  The serrations did not affect or compromise the strength of the material, but they were observed to mechanically interlock the grain boundaries and inhibit damage accumulation and grain boundary sliding during creep deformation.   A similar approach was used to engineer the grain boundaries of a commercial, cast and wrought Ni-base superalloy ATI718+.  For this alloy system, a thermal process was developed to preferentially nucleate and grow semi-coherent eta phase precipitates along the grain boundary that served to stitch the grain boundaries with neighboring grains. Subsequent aging heat treatments were then employed to modify and engineer the intragranular dispersion of gamma prime precipitates. Findings from this investigation were validated using commercial forgings of RR1000 and ATI718+ that were heat-treated to attain a range of conventional and meso-scale engineered microstructures. The various microstructures were then subject to tensile and creep testing at a range of temperatures and conditions to quantify the effects of the microstructural features.  As predicted, the grain boundary serrations were confirmed to exert a significant effect on the creep rupture lives of the samples predominately under conditions of high temperature creep where grain boundary sliding mechanisms become operative.  At low to intermediate temperature creep conditions, where grain boundary sliding is limited, the impact of serrated or stitched grain boundaries is modest or negligible.  Findings from this study clearly demonstrated that novel thermal-mechanical processes can be employed to engineer the microstructure of Ni-base superalloys to further extend the temperature capability and performance of Ni-based superalloy forgings.  \n\n \n\nBroader Impact: The broader impact of this research is that advances in manufacturing of high temperature alloys has the potential to revolutionize the design of gas turbine systems and lead to significant improvements in performance and energy efficiency.&#8232;Combined with economic and environmental benefits, such as the reduced fuel consumption, minimization of CO2 and NOX emissions, there exists a strategic need for the U.S. to maintain a technological advantage in this field due to the importance of advanced gas turbine technologies for power generation, space exploration, aerospace/marine propulsion, and various other defense related applications.  The research program has served to train and educate graduate students at the Illinois Institute of Technology.  Additionally, the funding has enabled the PI at IIT to continue to work with inner-city Chicago-area high school teachers and students to promote educational outreach activities that enhance the middle/high school curricula and raise the students? awareness and knowledge of STEM. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sammy Tin"
