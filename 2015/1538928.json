The conference will be held from March 29-31, 2015 in Philadelphia, PA. \r\nThe proposed funding would support the travel of up to 15 eligible US students to the symposium. Recipients would be able to attend the main conference, workshops, and tutorials. Travel grants will encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering it. A special effort will be made to reach out to women and under-represented minorities. Furthermore, support from this grant will also be available to provide companion funding for attendees with disabilities and/or parental responsibility for an infant less than one year old. These efforts are anticipated to broaden the participation in the conference and, by extension, the research field.",
