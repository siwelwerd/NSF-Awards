 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates the relation between brain rhythms during sleep and memory.  The question of whether sleep serves a critical function in learning and memory remains strongly debated.  There are two stages of sleep, rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and slow-wave sleep (SWS), and these different sleep stages may play unique roles in memory functions.  This project tests the novel hypothesis that different types of brain waves, slow and fast gamma rhythms, occur during SWS and REM, respectively, and differentially regulate memory processing during these states. The project employs a state-of-the art approach that involves recording electrical signals from the brains of live animals and decoding the messages transmitted by these signals during wakeful learning and subsequent sleep.  The studies are expected to reveal major insights about how memories may be strengthened during sleep.  The results will also make progress toward successful decoding of conscious and unconscious brain activity.  This is expected to promote the development of devices that advance human intelligence through brain signal translation.  This project will also provide scientific training to students at various levels, from junior high to graduate school, and impart knowledge about brain signals to the general public.  \r\n\r\nThis project will test whether distinct fast (~80 Hz) and slow (~40 Hz) gamma rhythms serve unique memory functions in the entorhinal-hippocampal network during different stages of sleep.  The work has two objectives: 1) Test the hypothesis that slow gamma facilitates hippocampal output to the entorhinal cortex during SWS as part of the memory consolidation process, and 2) Test the hypothesis that fast gamma coordinates entorhinal input to the hippocampus during REM as a different step in the memory consolidation process.  The proposal employs an innovative multi-technique approach combining single cell recordings, neuronal ensemble coding, network rhythms, and animal behavior. The proposed work has the potential to transform theories of memory processing during sleep.  An influential theory of memory consolidation posits that memories are transferred from the hippocampus to the neocortex during sleep. Yet, it is unknown whether neurons in the entorhinal cortex, the gateway between the hippocampus and neocortex, respond to inputs from the hippocampus during sleep. If, instead, the hippocampus responds to inputs from the entorhinal cortex during sleep, conventional theories of memory consolidation during sleep would have to be revised.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n A key area of the brain for the storage of spatial and episodic memories is the hippocampus.  Memories that are initially stored in the hippocampus are thought to be transmitted from the hippocampus to long-term storage sites in the neocortex during the non-rapid eye movement (REM) stage of sleep.  The major interface between the hippocampus and the neocortex is a brain area called the entorhinal cortex.  The hippocampus transmits its output to the deep layers of the entorhinal cortex.  The first objective of our project was to determine whether the hippocampus and the deep layers of the medial entorhinal cortex show rhythmically coordinated activity during non-REM sleep.  We also aimed to test the hypothesis that ensembles of neurons in the medial entorhinal cortex developed specific representations of memories of previously learned spatial environments during non-REM sleep.  Some prior evidence also suggested that memories are processed during REM sleep, a stage of sleep when signals are transmitted from the superficial layers of the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus.  Therefore, another objective of our work was to determine whether the hippocampus and the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex show rhythmically coordinated activity during REM sleep.  We also aimed to investigate whether ensembles of neurons in the superficial layers of the medial entorhinal cortex transmitted information about previous spatial experiences to the hippocampus during REM sleep.   \n However, we encountered an unexpected finding when we attempted to decode memories of specific experiences represented by activity of neuronal ensembles in the medial entorhinal cortex.  We found that patterns of coordinated neuronal ensemble activity in the medial entorhinal cortex were preserved across different environments and across different stages of wakefulness and sleep (Trettel et al., Nature Neuroscience 2019).  Although this discovery did not provide support for our original hypotheses about the role of the medial entorhinal cortex in memory processing during sleep, it constituted an important finding of its own.  It provided empirical evidence that the medial entorhinal cortex exhibits ?low-dimensional attractor dynamics?, a theory that had previously been put forward based on results from computational models of the medial entorhinal cortex.  Our evidence for low-dimensional attractor dynamics in the medial entorhinal cortex suggests that the activity of medial entorhinal cortex neuronal ensembles is highly stable across different experiences.  More studies are needed to understand whether interactions between the medial entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus during different stages of sleep affect consolidation of spatial memories.\n We also found that neurons in hippocampal area CA3 that were active as new environments were learned were preferentially reactivated during subsequent non-REM sleep (Hwaun and Colgin, Hippocampus 2019).  This finding built upon a foundation of prior research supporting the conclusion that the hippocampus processes new memories during non-REM sleep.\n In addition to the intellectual merits of our research described above, our work also had broader and educational impacts.  The project supported the training of multiple members of groups that are underrepresented in science.  Our outreach efforts also contributed to greater public awareness of mechanisms involved in memory coding.  We also participated in an annual science summer camp, in coordination with the UTeach program at UT Austin, that taught a hands-on lesson about neuronal coding to middle school and high school students, many of whom were from groups that are underrepresented in science.  UTeach interns assisted with the lesson.  UTeach interns are training to be teachers in the future.  Thus, another broader impact is that UTeach interns could incorporate what they learned through this experience into their own classrooms in the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laura L Colgin"
