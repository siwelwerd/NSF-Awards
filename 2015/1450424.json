 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project establishes an I-Corps Site at the Oregon State University (the Oregon State University Advantage Accelerator (OSUAA)). NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\nThis I-Corps Site project helps OSU deliver on its mission as a land grant university and advance efforts to revitalize an economically depressed Oregon by helping multiple local teams transition their ideas to the marketplace. Funds allow OSUAA to make specific enhancements to the Accelerator and increase the number of I-Corps Site (ICS) teams. The project's three goals include the following: (1) Enhancing linkages with the OSU engineering, science, and business disciplines through a faculty liaison program in support of Accelerator ICS teams; (2) Creating and delivering new course content on personal development, team formation, and dynamics to enable high performing ICS teams; and (3) Providing course materials and tracking software to enhance the Lean Canvas curriculum delivery and seed funds for development of prototypes and minimum viable products.\r\n\r\nMany of the emerging companies OSUAA supports help address larger societal issues  such as clean energy and expensive healthcare devices. OSUAA provides a supportive environment to allow these cutting-edge technologies to develop and find commercialization pathways. Ultimately, the OSUAA may serve as a viable model to help develop new business and enhanced employment outcomes for other rural land grant institutions engaged in similar research activities.  \r\n\r\nThe OSUAA framework to advance the commercialization of research will help improve the economic climate and development in the largely rural state of Oregon. Oregon, particularly in the rural areas, tends to lag the nation in economic prosperity and recovery. Through facilitated launch of new startup companies, the OSU system may reduce unemployment through the creation of higher-wage positions in development, manufacturing and related support roles. Funded investments in ICS teams accelerate the transition of research to market by providing stronger curricular components and dedicated resources for prototyping. \r\n\r\nOSUAA works across all 11 university colleges, which allows for students to actively participate in the real-world, experiential aspects of moving research to the marketplace. The OSUAA also works closely with the four cultural centers on campus to ensure that traditionally underrepresented groups know about, have access to, and take advantage of OSUAA's learning opportunities.",
