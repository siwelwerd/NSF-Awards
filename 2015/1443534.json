 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ross Ice Shelf is the largest existing ice shelf in Antarctica, and is currently stabilizing significant portions of the land ice atop the Antarctic continent. An ice shelf begins where the land ice goes afloat on the ocean, and as such, the Ross Ice Shelf interacts with the ocean and seafloor below, and the land ice behind. Currently, the Ross Ice Shelf slows down, or buttresses, the fast flowing ice streams of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), a marine-based ice sheet, which if melted, would raise global sea level by 3-4 meters. The Ross Ice Shelf average ice thickness is approximately 350 meters, and it covers approximately 487,000 square kilometers, an area slightly larger than the state of California. The Ross Ice Shelf has disappeared during prior interglacial periods, suggesting in the future it may disappear again. Understanding the dynamics, stability and future of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet therefore requires in-depth knowledge of the Ross Ice Shelf.  The ROSETTA-ICE project brings together scientists from 4 US institutions and from the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences Limited, known as GNS Science, New Zealand. The ROSETTA-ICE data on the ice shelf, the water beneath the ice shelf, and the underlying rocks, will allow better predictions of how the Ross Ice Shelf will respond to changing climate, and therefore how the WAIS will behave in the future. The interdisciplinary ROSETTA-ICE team will train undergraduate and high school students in cutting edge research techniques, and will also work to educate the public via a series of vignettes integrating ROSETTA-ICE science with the scientific and human history of Antarctic research.\r\n\r\nThe ROSETTA-ICE survey will acquire gravity and magnetics data to determine the water depth beneath the ice shelf. Radar, LIDAR and imagery systems will be used to map the Ross Ice Shelf thickness and fine structure, crevasses, channels, debris, surface accumulation and distribution of marine ice. The high resolution aerogeophysical data over the Ross Ice Shelf region in Antarctica will be acquired using the IcePod sensor suite mounted externally on an LC-130 aircraft operating from McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Field activities will include ~36 flights on LC-130 aircraft over two field seasons in Antarctica. The IcePod instrument suite leverages the unique experience of the New York Air National Guard operating in Antarctica for NSF scientific research as well as infrastructure and logistics. The project will answer questions about the stability of the Ross Ice Shelf in future climate, and the geotectonic evolution of the Ross Ice Shelf Region, a key component of the West Antarctic Rift system. The comprehensive benchmark data sets acquired will enable broad, interdisciplinary analyses and modeling, which will also be performed as part of the project. ROSETTA-ICE will illuminate Ross ice sheet-ice shelf-ocean dynamics as the system nears a critical juncture but still is intact. Through interacting with an online data visualization tool, and comparing the ROSETTA-ICE data and results from earlier studies, we will engage students and young investigators, equipping them with new capabilities for the study of critical earth systems that influence global climate.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Ross Ice Shelf is the largest ice shelf on Earth.  Ice up to 1000 m thick flows from both the East and West Antarctic ice sheets and coalesces into this sheet of floating ice that covers the southernmost Ross Sea. This ice takes approximately 1000 years to travel from the grounding line, where it first goes afloat, to the ice front, where it calves icebergs, leaving a cliff of 100-300 m thick ice.  The ice shelf slows the flow of grounded ice from the continental ice sheets. An ice volume equivalent to 11.6 m of global sea level rests in the basins feeding the Ross Ice shelf.  Satellite observations since the 1970\u2019s suggest that the Ross Ice Shelf is currently stable, but geological evidence shows that it has collapsed in the past.  The ice shelf hides what, until the ROSETTA-Ice project, was the least known piece of ocean floor on our planet. \n\nThe ROSETTA-Ice project investigated the processes controlling stability of the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica by combining extensive new observations with numerical models in an interdisciplinary study of the interactions between ocean, ice, rock and atmosphere.  Aircraft-based surveys of the ice shelf provided the most comprehensive mapping ever completed of the Ross Ice Shelf, measuring the surface elevation, ice thickness, ice internal structure and magnetic and gravity fields at 10 km line spacing over a region approximately the size of Texas.  Six oceanographic profiling floats were launched from the aircraft into the water in front of the ice shelf to monitor the temperature and salinity of the water masses that make up the Ross Sea as they evolved over the 2016-2017 Antarctic summer season.  The project demonstrated the power of collecting data in Antarctica with the modular ice-imaging IcePod system, produced novel insights based on the data collected with the air-deployed profiling floats and demonstrated the accuracy and versatility of a strapdown gravity system.  The project also fostered both the first extensive Virtual Reality news coverage from Antarctica and the first implementation of Augmented Reality exploration tool using the HoloLens.\n\nGravity anomalies from ROSETTA-Ice surveys were used to develop a new model of the seafloor beneath the Ross Ice Shelf, providing an order of magnitude greater resolution of the shape of the seafloor.  Along with revealing hidden bathymetry the ROSETTA-Ice team discovered that the geologic boundary between East and West Antarctica rests beneath the Ross Ice Shelf and controls the underlying bathymetry.  Stark differences in the character of the magnetic anomalies on either side of the Ross Ice Shelf revealed this major geological boundary.   Deeper water on the East Antarctic side and the shallow water on the West Antarctic side is a persistent feature of the morphology.\n\nThis geologic boundary and the shape of the seafloor steers the ocean circulations beneath the floating ice.  It is essential to understand this circulation of ocean water beneath the ice shelf in order to understand the present melting and predict how it could change in the future.  The ROSETTA-Ice team used the stratigraphy preserved in the ice and imaged with the IcePod radar systems to map the distribution of basal melt for the past ~85 years.  Using this innovative analysis complimented by ocean and ice models, the ROSETTA-Ice team identified that the primary vulnerability of the Ross Ice Shelf in the near future (the next 100 years) is to melting of the base of the ice shelf in a key region near Ross Island, in the northwest corner of the ice shelf near the ice front.  A numerical ocean simulation using this new melt map revealed the predicted circulation of ocean water beneath the ice shelf and identified a seasonal influx of warm water entering the sub-ice shelf cavity.  These findings were supported by several publications that came from the project, each focusing on a different aspect of the ice shelf stability.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/24/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robin Bell"
