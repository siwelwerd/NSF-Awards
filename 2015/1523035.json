 "awd_abstract_narration": "The recipients will organize a two-day workshop to bring together principal investigators, senior personnel, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows  from 2013 and 2014 Coastal SEES cohorts to interact and exchange ideas with each other and external experts. The intention of the workshop overall is to provide a venue to exchanging information and ideas regarding current Coastal\r\nSEES projects, as well as discuss and identify new collaborations for future work, enhance interdisciplinary collaboration in coastal sustainability research, and identify gaps and challenges for addressing coastal sustainability. \r\n\r\nCoastal SEES projects are especially complex in that each project involves typically multiple science disciplines and/or engineering, as well as some component that focuses on the human dimension of the sustainability problem. In addition, most projects identify a pathway through which scientific progress can be translated to practical outcomes, such as more informed decision making. The need for a principal investigators meeting to  exchange ideas and best practices for dealing with this complexity was anticipated in the program solicitation, which instructed the investigators to plan to attend such a meeting. This award covers very modest costs for the organization and logistics of the meeting.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCoastal SEES is focused on the sustainability of coastal systems, which includes the swath of land closely connected to the sea, including barrier islands, wetlands, mudflats, beaches, estuaries, cities, towns, recreational areas, and maritime facilities; the continental seas and shelves; and the overlying atmosphere. Humans benefit from the myriad of ecosystem services that coastal environments provide, but their activities often result in alterations to those very ecosystem services that generate benefits.  A major challenge is to understand the dynamics of this coupled human-natural system to inform societal decisions about the uses of coastal systems, including for economic, aesthetic, recreational, research, and conservation purposes. Coastal SEES projects are expected to lead to generalizable theoretical advances in natural sciences and engineering while, at the same time, integrating key aspects of human processes required to address issues of coastal sustainability.\n\nA workshop for the Coastal SEES program was held at NSF in Washington DC on 29-30 January 2015.  The objectives of the Coastal SEES PI Meeting were to exchange ideas and progress between awardees of projects funded by NSF.  The workshop included lead investigators, their students and post-docs around a schedule that provided an opportunity for participants to share research approaches and challenges; encourage discussion of the new types of interdisciplinary collaborations necessary for sustainability research; identify broad challenges in coastal research, especially gaps and important areas needing attention, including those that might be addressed in future research endeavors.  The workshop was also designed to discuss ways to increase visibility of Coastal SEES Projects around NSF as well as in the research community.\n\nThe workshop had a total of 54 participants representing 20 different Coastal SEES projects.  The participants had the opportunity to network among one another and meet with representatives from NSF.  The worskhop also focused on how to address science misinformation with award-winning journalist Cornelia Dean of The New York Times.  There was discussion of how to effectively communicate and disseminate scientific concepts to non-scientific audiences in a panel discussion, and to share their Coastal SEES projects in poster presentations.  With the rising recognition that to tackle large-scale environmental and societal issues, interdisciplinary collaborations and approaches are increasingly common, yet the challenges to do this type of work effectively remain.  This workshop provided an important opportunity for leading research experts to exchange ideas in person on strategies to enhance interdisciplinary approaches.  In addition, within this highly interdisciplinary group, everyone received feedback on their Coastal SEES projects, providing outside perspectives from experts representing a variety of disciplines.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/05/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert R Twilley"
