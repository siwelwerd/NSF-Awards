 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Mark Aldenderfer, of the University of California, Merced, along with colleagues from the University of Oklahoma, the University of Chicago, and Nepal, will lead a project to explore the ways in which high elevation environments affect the movement of people, material culture, ideas, and genes. High elevation and high mountain valleys were among the last places on the planet colonized by humans due to the combined challenges of hypoxia, cold stress, and the relative scarcity of resources found in them. High mountains act as barriers to population movement and gene flow and often create cultural, linguistic, and genetic isolates in valley systems that are only short distances apart. But most critically, high altitude environments require genetic adaptations for successful permanent habitation in them. But the antiquity of the selective processes that have increased the frequency of these genes in modern populations is unresolved; some researchers argue that these genes can become fixed very rapidly in human populations due to intense natural selection while others suggest the process develops much more slowly. Archaeology is uniquely positioned to study human biological and cultural adaptation to these extreme environments and to look at the ways in which culture and genes have interacted within and been affected by them over the course of time. \r\n\r\nDr. Aldenderfer and his team will study the ways in which culture, environment, and genes have interacted over time in the Kali Gandaki valley of Upper Mustang, Nepal. Known from history as a key trade route that connected the Indian subcontinent to the Tibetan plateau, the valley appears to have been first occupied some 3000 years ago. While the geographic origin of these migrants is unknown, three source populations have been hypothesized: peoples from the Indian subcontinent, peoples from the Tibetan plateau, and finally, peoples from Central Asia via the northwestern Himalayas. To test these hypotheses and determine the antiquity of genes that promote adaptation to high elevation life, the researchers will conduct excavations at key early sites to recover additional material culture for regional comparisons and human remains, extract and genotype ancient DNA (aDNA) from the human remains from three archaeological periods that span the prehistory of the valley, compare the genetic make-up of these three ancient populations to contemporary South Asians, East Asians and Western Eurasians as well as archaic human genomes to test hypotheses about the peopling of the region as well as subsequent migrations into it, and finally, estimate the frequency of genes in these ancient populations known to promote high elevation adaptation to test for systematic increases in these genes over time.  The project will train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the cutting edge aDNA extraction and computational methods developed in this research. The researchers will also foster a wide range of educational activities with their Nepali partners, including the development of displays of project findings in regional and local museums and engagement with local village leaders on how preserve and maintain their cultural heritage.",

What combination of genetic and cultural adaptations are necessary to live permanently at high elevation? Our project sought answers to those questions and more by conducting research in the highest mountain range on the planet&mdash;the Himalayas. High elevations and high mountain valleys such as those in the Himalayas were among the last places on the planet colonized by humans due to the combined challenges of hypoxia, cold stress, and the relative scarcity of resources found in them. High mountains are said to act as barriers to population movement and gene flow and often create cultural, linguistic, and genetic isolates in valley systems that are only short distances apart. Choosing the Kali Gandaki valley in Upper Mustang, Nepal, as our primary study area, we looked at how this harsh environment affected the movement of people, material culture, ideas, and genes. Questions like &ldquo;when did people first enter the valley&rdquo;, &ldquo;where did they come from&rdquo;, &ldquo;how many migrations do we see&rdquo;, and &ldquo;how did people&rsquo;s lives change over the course of time&rdquo; further structured our research. We conducted excavations at five mortuary sites and recovered the remains of more than 170 individuals along with the artifacts that were buried with them. Our project was fully interdisciplinary, and along with the archaeologists, we worked with specialists in the analysis of ancient DNA extracted from human remains, geneticists who used powerful technologies to study the genomes of these ancient peoples, bioarchaeologists who told us about stress and trauma, specialists in archaeological sciences who examined the composition of the metals, glass beads, and fabrics found among the remains, &nbsp;human biology, and ethnography worked to find answers to our questions. We addressed competing ideas about where these early migrants came from&mdash;earlier research suggested that these migrants came from South Asia, others from Mongolia, and others still suggested the Tibetan plateau. Our combined findings overwhelmingly support the hypothesis that the earliest known migrants to the region came from the north&mdash;the Tibetan plateau some 3000 years ago and brought with them two genes&mdash;EPAS1 and EGLN1&mdash;that are widespread in the modern peoples of Tibet and their ethnic cousins in the Kali Gandaki valley. What was interesting in this finding is that our results suggest that natural selection continued to operate on EPAS1 over the past 3000 years, while there was little evidence that indicated a similar level of selection on EGLN1. This finding seems to be contrary to the presumed great antiquity of this variant of EPAS1, which is said to have been present in the ancient Denisovans who lived in Central Asia more than 45,000 years ago. We also learned that the population history of the valley is more complex than we originally thought. Although all of the genomes we studied are related to modern Tibeto-Burman speaking peoples, the populations in the valley appear to have come from different locations. Some ancient peoples most closely resemble the modern Sherpa of Nepal and Nepali Tibetans while other people, including some of the earliest inhabitants of the valley appear to be most closely related to Bhutanese Tibeto-Burman peoples. This is the first time multiple prehistoric migrations have been observed in the Himalayas, and it indicates that instead of being a formidable barrier, the mountains actually channeled migrations. We learned that the artifacts found with the peoples of the region primarily reflected trade relationships to the south, rather to the north. In other words, despite their ancestry, people looked to the great population centers of South Asia for many of the objects used in their daily lives. Only after 1600 years ago did people in this valley look to the north to obtain artifacts, like Chinese silks and decorative metal objects. This seems to be associated with the expansion of trade along the Silk Roads. Our project found answers to many of our questions, but also opened new directions for future research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond the details of the science, members of the project team were very active in outreach to multiple audiences. NOVA and PBS funded a documentary about our work: &ldquo;<em>Secrets of the Sky Tombs</em>.&rdquo; A preview can be found on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zS_ALdf2e8) and the film can also be purchased for viewing on Amazon Prime or from a PBS store. In it, we described many of our most important findings. We have made concerted effort to create a sense of excitement about research. Other versions of this documentary have been shown in the UK and across Europe. Finally, we opened two small museums in the Kali Gandaki valley&mdash;one in Chuksang, and the other in Samdzong&mdash;as part of the effort to give back to the local people of the region who have helped us in so many ways.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/17/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mark&nbsp;Aldenderfer</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1528698/1528698_10375810_1536942080613_mustang_sites--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1528698/1528698_10375810_1536942080613_mustang_sites--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Archaeological sites explored by the project\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1528698/1528698_10375810_1536942080613_mustang_sites--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Archaeological sites explored by the project\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">All sites are located in the Annapurna Conservation Area Project in Mustang and Manang, Nepal</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mark Aldenderfer; source map Google Earth</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mark&nbsp;S&nbsp;Aldenderfer</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Archaeological sites explored by the project</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1528698/1528698_10375810_1536942868767_DSC_2785--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1528698/1528698_10375810_1536942868767_DSC_2785--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Kyang\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1528698/1528698_10375810_1536942868767_DSC_2785--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Kyang\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The architecture at Kyang indicates the entry into the mortuary cave.
