 "awd_abstract_narration": "The overall goal of the Idaho State University's Energy Systems Scholars (ESS) project will be to recruit, retain, and graduate 35 academically promising students and place these graduates in high skill/high wage jobs in energy and related fields. The project will serve students with significant financial need from Idaho and surrounding states. This scholarship initiative will be managed by the Energy Systems Technology and Education Center (ESTEC), a provider of energy education that prepares individuals for careers as technologists. ESTEC received an ATE project award in 2007 that helped to launch the energy education center, which operates in close collaboration with the Idaho National Laboratory. ESS is an initiative that will broaden the participation of students in two-year energy systems programs. \r\n\r\nKey support services for ESS participants will be: 1) 1-1 faculty mentoring for scholars; 2) a Personal Effectiveness Program; 3) ENERGIZE ESS group meetings to address academic and professional issues/opportunities; 4) 1-1 matching of scholars with ESTEC alumni using a distance mentoring system; 5) expanded work experience opportunities; 6) supported energy conference attendance; 7) participation in an enterprise development seminar; and 8) career placement assistance.  The project will increase the visibility and influence of S-STEM graduates seeking energy-related careers.  The ESS program will focus on increasing the average mathematics strength of ESTEC students and expanding the number of ESTEC graduates from surrounding states. Efforts to recruit underrepresented populations to STEM-related energy systems programs will create more role models and mentors, and will help to increase the diversity of the energy workforce.  ESTEC industry advisory council will help disseminate the results of the project. Content will be placed in STEM education and related journals, websites, blogs, and social media. Formative and summative evaluation efforts will identify key challenges, lessons learned, and promising practices that will serve to enlarge the knowledge base regarding the attributes of successful scholarship programs that are tied to regional industry needs.",

Scholarships and activities were provided for 49 different students during the five-year project at the Energy Systems Technology and Education Center (ESTEC) department at ISU. \n\nThe project had four objectives: 1) Recruit and enroll academically promising students who will increase age diversity; 2) Increase regional diversity; 3) Integrate ESS participants into the existing learning community; 4) Prepare students for placement into related technical occupations.\n\nApplicants for the scholarships were required to apply online with information typical for a job interview.  A committee screened the applicants and then conducted interviews for recipient selection.  Student references were contacted and grant funded scholarships were awarded. \n\nThe project involved more than just a dollar scholarship.  Recipients were provided opportunities for extracurricular activity and field trips.  Activities included; social skill workshops; attendance at the industry Power-Gen conference; visits to Idaho Power generation and control stations; business presentations; volunteering for recruiting events; to name a few.\n\nPrior to the 2015 grant, the majority of ESTEC enrollment was older males wanting to change to a better pay, skilled career, leaving a labor job they started as teenagers.  Female enrollment then was typically below 10%.  During the 3 years prior to the grant, only 7 of the 37 women who started the ESTEC program graduated.  With the grant activity support, 79%, 15 of the 19 women ESS awardees graduated.    \n\nThe ESS students were also included in department discussions with the grant support group so they could talk openly about the ESTEC academic program.   Receiving student feedback for faculty and administration provided insight to continue the positive practices, and modify the negatives.  Open discussion provides much more than an end of the semester course evaluation.\n\nReceiving the NSF grant was a tremendous benefit for the Energy Systems Technology and Education Center at Idaho State University, College of Technology.  Both student recipients and the ESTEC department benefited. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/11/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Evan T Smith"
