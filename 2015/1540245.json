 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Asian Technology Information Program (ATIP) proposes to hold a Workshop at SC'15 in Austin, TX, that will provide a balanced picture of key Chinese HPC R&D. Over the past 5 to 10 years, China has emerged as a significant HPC player. Although a few US experts are following Chinese research, for others there is no coherent way to fully understand what is occurring. This is specifically true for younger US researchers who are not familiar with where to access the best Chinese research. Broader impacts will include potential US-China collaborative efforts in computational research. More importantly, it enables US researchers to keep abreast of developments in China and to incorporate the best ideas in their research in the US. It will also enable funding agencies in the US to keep abreast of the priorities of Chinese funding agencies in HPC. \r\nThe Workshop will include presentations, posters, and discussions by Chinese researchers from universities, government institutes, and industry in sessions addressing systems, centers, and government plans, progress in components, system software, and applications, and human resource and eco-system development. This balanced program will enable the US research community to gain a more holistic understanding of the current situation and better evaluate potential opportunities for collaboration. As part of this proposal, ATIP will support at least eight young US researchers identified as having a high potential for research interests that overlap with their Chinese counterparts and who would normally be unable to attend SC. Members of the Chinese research community have agreed to support attendance by similar students in China who are anxious to share their ideas and engage in collaborative work. The key aspect of the proposed Workshop will be the unique opportunity for members of the US and international HPC research community to interact and have direct discussions with the top Chinese scientists and leading graduate students in both China and the US.",
