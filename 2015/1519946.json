 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project is for the early detection of aspergillosis, a severe fungal infection that most frequently involves the lungs in immune compromised individuals, typically as a result of cancer chemotherapy or transplantation. The disease is often misdiagnosed resulting in poor patient outcomes and death. Early detection is important to initiate therapy and save lives. \r\n\r\nThe proposed project has two objectives: 1. To reconfigure a non-competitive immunoassay lateral flow device and 2. To develop novel antibodies that will result in feasibility studies of a point of care device for the detection of Asgergillus in urine. Successful completion of this project will result in a Phase II project toward commercialization.",
