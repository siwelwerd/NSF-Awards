 "awd_abstract_narration": "The importance of metagenomics arises from the fact that over 99% of\r\nthe species yet to be discovered are resistant to cultivation. Unlike\r\nsingle genome sequencing, assembly of a metagenome is intractable and\r\nis in large part, an unsolved mystery.  Moreover, the advent of high\r\nthroughput sequencing is fueling rapid generation of enormous\r\nmetagenomic datasets. There is no available sequenced genome for a\r\nmajority of the species. There is a need to determine the number of species in\r\na metagenomic dataset as well as the abundance of each of these\r\nspecies.  The key steps (Assembly and Clustering) in the metagenomics\r\nanalysis algorithms are compute-intensive, while the sheer amount of\r\ndata the algorithms operate on is staggering.  The most promising way\r\nto tackle the computational challenges is to build special purpose\r\nhardware, dedicated solely to suitable algorithms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main objective of this project is to develop a range of flexible,\r\naffordable, parallel, fast hardware-accelerated bioinformatics\r\nsolutions, using GPGPU, FPGA, and ASIC, for metagenomic analytics to provide an alternative to\r\nexpensive computer clusters. Specifically,  hardware solutions for\r\nmetagenomic clustering and assembly will be developed. Several\r\nacceleration methodologies, including parallel software mapping and\r\nspecial hardware design, are proposed to explore the parallelism\r\ninside the applications and to improve the data access bandwidth in\r\nthe hardware running bioinformatics applications. The ideas proposed\r\nin this work will be evaluated in a multi-pronged manner using a\r\ncombination of simulation, emulation and prototyping efforts. Further,\r\nthe PIs will use a combination of commercial tools, collaborator\r\nresources and  existing internal tools. The research will be \r\nconducted in collaboration with  industrial partners. Through close\r\ncollaboration with several industry partners,  direct transfer of many\r\nideas to industry is enabled. The outcome of this research will,\r\ntherefore, have a direct impact on future bioinformatics application\r\nsolutions. This project will involve graduate and undergraduate\r\nstudents in all aspects of the research. The PIs will actively\r\nintegrate the research results from this project into the graduate and\r\nundergraduate curricula, and develop new interdisciplinary courses on\r\nbioinformatics and computer architecture to train the next generation\r\nwork-force. Finally, the tools and techniques developed in this\r\nresearch will be made available through   web-sites for use by other\r\neducators, researchers, and industry practitioners.",
