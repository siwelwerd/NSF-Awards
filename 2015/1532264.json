 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a development project to construct a scanning two- and three-photon microscope for deep imaging in the brain in support of activities related to neuronal circuit analysis and neurovascular coupling. The ability to image ever deeper in the brain with optical methods is a key enabling technology in our ability to decipher neuronal anatomy and circuit function as well as neurovascular function. Optical tools, together with labels of specific brain structures, are the only means to probe the geometry and state variables of single cells, e.g., voltage and second messengers, and the dynamics of brain vasculature in a noninvasive or partially invasive manner in vivo. The current method of choice for in vivo imaging makes use of two-photon microscopy with a 100-femtosecond pulsed laser sources to observe structure and dynamics throughout the upper ~ 500 micrometers of cortex of mice. Yet there is a clear need to image throughout the full depth of cortex, 1.0 to 1.2 micrometers in mice, to determine the complete flow of information in cortical processing. There is also a need to image deeper still into hippocampus and other subcortical structures without excavated overlying tissue, as well as to determine the loci of vascular control throughout gray and while matter. The initial proposed experiments, all of which depend on the proposed instrument, address topics in fundamental brain science as well biomedicine. Fundamental issues revolve around neuronal plasticity and memory formation and include: the formation of motor memories, where the learning of a behavioral task is believed to follow from the formation of patterns of correlated neuronal output in motor cortex; the transformation of sensory signals in cortex into memory traces, such as learned fear via the amygdala and induction of depression via the habenula; the role of specific gene products, known as inducible transcription factors, in synaptic plasticity; and understanding how the prodigious adult neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb is integrated into ongoing olfactory function. More applied issues concern the role of exposure to nicotine alone in changing the basis for memory formation, as well as issues in vasodynamics, including the locus for neuronal control of its own nutriment supply through the cortical vasculature and the impact of microinfarctions on cell death within the white matter, where myelinated fibers traffic information from sensory to motor areas that span the cortical mantle. Realization of this system will permit training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in state of the art in vivo optical imaging. UC San Diego, along with the greater La Jolla scientific community, supports a large and highly collaborative neuroscience community with graduate students and fellows who will pursue careers at institutes throughout the county, even the world. They will be inspired to think of new experiments based on the capabilities of imaging new vistas in the brain, as well as new associated technologies, particularly in the design of optical probes of yet unmeasured variables. Lastly, the high density of potential users within this community will facilitate unanticipated refinements of deep imaging and perhaps transform the proposed development project into a turn-key design for the benefit of the global neurosciences communities. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe PI proposes to build an instrument, whose design is motivated by three threads of work, that enables two- and three-photon imaging throughout the full depth of cortex and into deeper structures. First is the use of 100-fs pulsed laser light at wavelengths of 1.3 or 1.7 micrometers, where scattering is minimized but absorption by water is still weak; second is the use of an optical amplifier to increase the energy per pulse and drive fluorescence at greater depths, and third is the use of aberration corrective optics to counteract distortion of the incident beam with increasing depth into brain tissue.",
