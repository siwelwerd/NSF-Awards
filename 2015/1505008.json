 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative research project, consisting of four institutions (Rice, Yale, UIUC and Princeton) aims to continue the Physics of Living Systems Student Research Network (PoLS SRN). This network has been in existence for four years and has had a dramatic impact on many graduate students, both in the US and abroad, working on the application of physical science techniques to living systems. These students now can participate in a global community that can help deal with the many complex issues involved in conducting research in such a new and inherently multidisciplinary field. These issues range from proper training, to gaining a broad perspective, to accessing technical expertise that may not be available at their home institution. In addition to the obvious broader impacts related to training of a research workforce, there are other broad impacts of this plan. Via the interaction of one of the PoLS nodes (Rice) with the biomedical community in Houston, students and faculty will be exposed to possible avenues whereby physics can contribute to human health issues. Funds to attract  students from under-represented groups to network meetings will be available through the new funds administered by the newly proposed network coordinator. Also deas vetted by the PoLS SRN will be adapted to create student networks in other areas of science and engineering.\r\n\r\nThere is by now little disagreement with the general notion that concepts and methods from physics have been a critical contributor to the increased understanding of the living world, and that its importance will be growing as the scientific world moves toward an ever more quantitative and predictive form of biology. Thus, the physics community clearly needs to train a new generation of scientists who can lead this effort, scientists who have the right mix of physics/mathematics rigor and broad knowledge of living systems from molecular scales on up. The PoLS SRN aims at creating a community of graduate students who can collectively help themselves and their mentors accelerate and enhance this training process. This is being done by a mix of in-person and virtual modes of communication, and this proposal is a plan to continue and expand these efforts; it will reach more students, improve the social networking portals, and make use of the complementary research agendas of the different network nodes to provide broad technical expertise. Doing all of this, will boost the intellectual level of the entire research field and convince the best students that the Physics of Living Systems is truly the most exciting research frontier in 21st century science.\r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics, the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences, the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Division of Chemistry, and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.",

Illinois IPoLS has also supported 4 graduate students to pursue training in new techniques and approaches through participation in courses such as the Marine Biological Laboratory Physical Biology of the Cell and Optical Microscopy and Imaging in Biomedical Sciences courses as well as specialized Gordon Research Conferences. (See images from IPoLS Meetings)</div>\n<div><strong>Development of Meetings &amp; Workshops:</strong>&nbsp;iPoLS students and postdocs were invited and accepted to our NSF Center for Physics of Living Cells (CPLC) &nbsp;Summer School in 2016-2019. Other specialized workshops and meetings, included the Cell Scale Simulations Workshop in 2018 and the International Physics of Living Systems Education Meeting in 2019, 2020, and 2021. In addition, iPoLS graduate students and postdocs have been involved with developing and leading many of the training initiatives, so these efforts serve as both outreach to the broader community and professional development opportunities for Illinois PoLS researchers.</div>\n<div><strong><em>The PoLS Education Meetings:</em></strong>&nbsp;the Illinois and Johns Hopkins node pioneered this new initiative, with the first such meeting in <strong>2019</strong> at Johns Hopkins University focused on exploring education and training and included talks from international experts including Joachim Spatz, Director of the Max Planck Institute in Hedielberg Germany and of the MPI Matter to Life Graduate Program and Daniel Riveline, Director of Research at the CNRS France and Director of the Interdisciplinary Cell Physics Masters Program. The <strong>2020</strong> meeting was held at the J Craig Venter Instititue in La Jolla, California and focused on Science Communication. Here we invited Sandra Tsing Loh, from National Public Radio?s ?The Loh Down on Science?, as well as Andrew Rennekamp, Editor of Cell, who presented a talk ?Writing for a General Scientific Audience?. The <strong>2021</strong> meeting, held online due to the pandemic, focused on celebrating Black scientists working in Physics of Living Systems and featured speakers from academia (<em>Ebony McGee, Vanderbilt and Alison Williams, Wesleyan</em>) as well as industry&nbsp;<em>Donnell Walton (Corning, Inc). A</em>n online mentoring workshop was also offered for students. Over 150 faculty, students, and postdocs have participated in these PoLS Education meetings since 2019.<em>&nbsp;</em></div>\n<div><em>&nbsp;</em><strong><em>Hands-On Workshop on Cell-Scale Simulation</em></strong>&nbsp;was organized by Illinois PoLS in July 2018 at the UIUC Beckman Institute. Of the 19 participants, 12 were from IPoLS institutions at Rice University (4), Georgia Tech (1), LMU/TUM/MPI (5) in Munich and UIUC (3). IPoLS student, David Bianchi, was a TA for workshop and gave a lecture on visualizing cell simulations with VMD. Director of Microscopy and Imaging for the Paul Allen Institute, Dr. Winfried Wiegraebe presented human stem cells imaged with 40 labeled components. Dr. Tyler Earnest, a PoLS postdoc in ZLS research group, demonstrated using Jupyter Python notebook to implement stems into GPU-based cell simulations software, Lattice Microbes.</div>\n<div><strong><em>The CPLC Summer School</em></strong>&nbsp;From 2009-2019, this was the CPLC?s signature outreach program. Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and senior researchers came to Urbana to learn the latest experimental and theoretical techniques in biological physics. For the duration of this award (Fall 2016-present), 25 students and postdocs from US and international iPolS institutions participated in the CPLC Summer School, with 40 Illinois PoLS students and postdocs serving as teaching assistants.</div>\n<div><strong>iPoLS Seminars &amp; Extended Visitors:</strong>&nbsp;This seminar series was developed to promote lectures on new and emerging biological physics research topics. Seminars are attended from students, graduate students, postdocs, and faculty across the entire campus and this has resulted in new collaborations / research directions.&nbsp;Seminar speakers often remained several days to develop collaborative research projects with Illinois PoLS reseachers,&nbsp;this includes Emmanuel Maigre, Siewert Marrink, and Stefan Hell.</div>\n<div><strong>Student Exchange Programs:&nbsp;</strong>In 2017 and 2018, Illinois iPoLS students participated in an international research exchange with students from the Junior Nanotech Network (JNN) at&nbsp;the Center for NanoScience (CeNS) at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit?t (LMU) in Germany. 10 students in total participated in this exchange over 2 summers.</div>\n<div><strong>Journal Clubs&nbsp;</strong>for iPoLS graduate students were hosted by the Illinois node in 2020 and 2021. Students chose articles focusing on new topics in biological physics and received training from Illinois PoLS faculty in developing and delivering high quality scientific talks.</div>\n<p><strong>Research:</strong>&nbsp;We partially funded the research of 1-2 graduate students each year who were working on new projects in the laboratories of the NSF CPLC faculty.

Other specialized workshops and meetings, included the Cell Scale Simulations Workshop in 2018 and the International Physics of Living Systems Education Meeting in 2019, 2020, and 2021. In addition, iPoLS graduate students and postdocs have been involved with developing and leading many of the training initiatives, so these efforts serve as both outreach to the broader community and professional development opportunities for Illinois PoLS researchers.\nThe PoLS Education Meetings: the Illinois and Johns Hopkins node pioneered this new initiative, with the first such meeting in 2019 at Johns Hopkins University focused on exploring education and training and included talks from international experts including Joachim Spatz, Director of the Max Planck Institute in Hedielberg Germany and of the MPI Matter to Life Graduate Program and Daniel Riveline, Director of Research at the CNRS France and Director of the Interdisciplinary Cell Physics Masters Program. The 2020 meeting was held at the J Craig Venter Instititue in La Jolla, California and focused on Science Communication. Here we invited Sandra Tsing Loh, from National Public Radio?s ?The Loh Down on Science?, as well as Andrew Rennekamp, Editor of Cell, who presented a talk ?Writing for a General Scientific Audience?. The 2021 meeting, held online due to the pandemic, focused on celebrating Black scientists working in Physics of Living Systems and featured speakers from academia (Ebony McGee, Vanderbilt and Alison Williams, Wesleyan) as well as industry Donnell Walton (Corning, Inc). An online mentoring workshop was also offered for students. Over 150 faculty, students, and postdocs have participated in these PoLS Education meetings since 2019. \n Hands-On Workshop on Cell-Scale Simulation was organized by Illinois PoLS in July 2018 at the UIUC Beckman Institute. Of the 19 participants, 12 were from IPoLS institutions at Rice University (4), Georgia Tech (1), LMU/TUM/MPI (5) in Munich and UIUC (3). IPoLS student, David Bianchi, was a TA for workshop and gave a lecture on visualizing cell simulations with VMD. Director of Microscopy and Imaging for the Paul Allen Institute, Dr. Winfried Wiegraebe presented human stem cells imaged with 40 labeled components. Dr. Tyler Earnest, a PoLS postdoc in ZLS research group, demonstrated using Jupyter Python notebook to implement stems into GPU-based cell simulations software, Lattice Microbes.\nThe CPLC Summer School From 2009-2019, this was the CPLC?s signature outreach program. Graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and senior researchers came to Urbana to learn the latest experimental and theoretical techniques in biological physics. For the duration of this award (Fall 2016-present), 25 students and postdocs from US and international iPolS institutions participated in the CPLC Summer School, with 40 Illinois PoLS students and postdocs serving as teaching assistants.\niPoLS Seminars &amp; Extended Visitors: This seminar series was developed to promote lectures on new and emerging biological physics research topics. Seminars are attended from students, graduate students, postdocs, and faculty across the entire campus and this has resulted in new collaborations / research directions. Seminar speakers often remained several days to develop collaborative research projects with Illinois PoLS reseachers, this includes Emmanuel Maigre, Siewert Marrink, and Stefan Hell.\nStudent Exchange Programs: In 2017 and 2018, Illinois iPoLS students participated in an international research exchange with students from the Junior Nanotech Network (JNN) at the Center for NanoScience (CeNS) at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit?t (LMU) in Germany. 10 students in total participated in this exchange over 2 summers.\nJournal Clubs for iPoLS graduate students were hosted by the Illinois node in 2020 and 2021. Students chose articles focusing on new topics in biological physics and received training from Illinois PoLS faculty in developing and delivering high quality scientific talks.\n\nResearch: We partially funded the research of 1-2 graduate students each year who were working on new projects in the laboratories of the NSF CPLC faculty. This work has resulted in 50 conference presentations and 4 publications. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/27/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sharlene M Denos"
