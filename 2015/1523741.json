 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Megan Jensen is \"Whale baleen: form, function, and filtration.\" The host institution for this fellowship is Stanford University, and the sponsoring scientist is Jeremy Goldbogen.  \r\n\r\nBaleen whales are among the largest animals that have ever lived, and many of these oceanic predators achieve extreme body sizes despite filter-feeding solely on tiny organisms like krill. Baleen consists of plates that hang down from the roof of the mouth and fray on the interior edge; the resultant mat of fringe separates prey from the water. This feeding mechanism is thought to be highly efficient, but the fluid dynamics of baleen filtration are poorly understood. This project challenges the long-standing hypothesis of how baleen filters seawater using specimens from the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History. In addition to increasing and perhaps correcting current theory of a fundamental life process in whales, some of which are endangered, the research results are likely to increase public awareness of marine resources and ocean conservation. The filtration mechanism used by baleen whales could have applications for industrial flexible meshes and filters inspired by baleen.  This fellowship directly supports the Fellow's career goals of becoming a leader in bio-inspired research using biomimetic approaches to illuminate ecological and evolutionary principles and teaching the next generation of biologists to use approaches from engineering. The research engages several students from a local high school as lab assistants, giving them hands-on research experience before they apply to college.  \r\n\r\nBaleen specimens from the four living families of baleen whales are being studied using CT scans to generate 3-dimensional print models of baleen for flow tank experiments. These baleen models are being used to determine the mechanism(s) of baleen filtration, measure prey capture efficiencies, and estimate optimal filtration speeds. Identifying potential differences in filtration mechanisms and efficiencies in different evolutionary lineages of baleen whales is needed to understand how baleen's unique feeding mechanism evolved in cetaceans and may illuminate the feeding processes that support the largest animals on the planet.  This project requires collaborations with researchers at multiple institutions in a number of fields, including marine mammal ecology, morphology, biomechanics, and fluid dynamics. The research integrates the Fellow's background in fluid dynamics and ocean engineering with new techniques, including making morphological measurements from museum collections and using 3D-printed models for research.",

Blue whales are a species of baleen whale, a group that also includes humpback whales and fin whales. Baleen whales are unique because they support, grow, and maintain massive body sizes by filter-feeding. Instead of teeth, these ocean mammals have rows of plates in their mouths that strain krill, fish, and other critters from the seawater. These plates are known as baleen, and they are arranged in baleen racks that line the animal's jaws where other mammals have teeth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, the mechanics -- particularly the fluid dynamics -- of filter-feeding by baleen whales is very poorly understood. In fact, even descriptions of the complex shapes of baleen are relatively limited. Much of what we know about baleen comes from old whaling records, and even modern data on baleen is limited to two-dimensional descriptions, which neglects the complex curvature found in baleen plates. These curves vary within a plate in two dimensions: 1) from where the plate erupts in the gum down to the tip, and 2) from the inside to the outside of the mouth. Additionally, the shapes of plates in the front of the mouth differ from those in the back of the mouth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To better understand the three-dimensional morphology, or geometry, of these plates, I used a CT scanner to take a series of very closely spaced X-ray images of baleen plates from museum specimens (Image 1). CT scanning allows us to look at the structure of baleen without destroying it: without the ability to image the inside of racks, we'd have no other way to look at baleen morphology without physically cutting up specimens.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These CT images could then be used to generate a three-dimensional model of baleen, as&nbsp;&nbsp;shown in Image 2. Using this model, we were able to do two things:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1) We published the first three-dimensional details of baleen morphology. My co-authors and I looked at how the plate curvature changed along the three axes inside an animal's mouth: from the top to bottom of a baleen plate (from gum to tip), from the inside edge of a plate to the outside edge, and from the front to back of the animal. These curves bear a resemblance to airfoils, and likely play a functional role in enabling whales to efficiently filter-feed. An example of plate curvature is shown in Image 3.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) The three-dimensional baleen model was used to 3D print baleen plates (as shown in Image 4) which were used for flow tank experiments. How does water move between and around these plates? Using creative light sources and filming strategies, we were able to prototype low-cost and effective flow visualization within baleen.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While there are many limitations to 3D printed plates (for example, not all details could be faithfully captured by the 3D printer), there are important advantages as well. Baleen specimens are limited -- but using 3D printing, we could vary geometric and morphological factors to see how they affect flow. If there is more or less space between plates, what happens? If plates are shorter, or longer, or straight rather than curved, what happens? 3D printing enables us to reproduce -- and control -- variables that we can't in nature, to see how they affect flow in a whale's mouth.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Many critically important questions regarding how the largest animals in the world feed remain unanswered, but this study took an important first step: visualizing the three-dimensional structure of baleen plates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/05/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Megan&nbsp;M&nbsp;Jensen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523741/1523741_10367403_1544048400349_seiWhaleCTscanner--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523741/1523741_10367403_1544048400349_seiWhaleCTscanner--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sei whale baleen on CT scanner bed\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523741/1523741_10367403_1544048400349_seiWhaleCTscanner--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sei whale baleen on CT scanner bed\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Top: Sei whale baleen rack on a CT scanner bedBottom: CT (x-ray) image of the baleen</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Megan Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Megan&nbsp;M&nbsp;Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Sei whale baleen on CT scanner bed</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523741/1523741_10367403_1544048494172_3DCTbaleen--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523741/1523741_10367403_1544048494172_3DCTbaleen--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"3D image of baleen rack generated from CT scan\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523741/1523741_10367403_1544048494172_3DCTbaleen--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"3D image of baleen rack generated from CT scan\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">3D image of baleen rack generated from CT scan</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Megan Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Megan&nbsp;M&nbsp;Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">3D image of baleen rack generated from CT scan</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523741/1523741_10367403_1544050841171_SeiWhaleCrossSection--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523741/1523741_10367403_1544050841171_SeiWhaleCrossSection--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cross-section of sei whale plates\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523741/1523741_10367403_1544050841171_SeiWhaleCrossSection--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cross-section of sei whale plates\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Cross-section of three sei whale baleen plates</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Megan Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Megan&nbsp;M&nbsp;Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cross-section of sei whale plates</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523741/1523741_10367403_1544053100037_3DprintedPlatesSeiWhale--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523741/1523741_10367403_1544053100037_3DprintedPlatesSeiWhale--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"3D-printed sei whale plates\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1523741/1523741_10367403_1544053100037_3DprintedPlatesSeiWhale--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"3D-printed sei whale plates\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">3D-printed sei whale plates</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Megan Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Megan&nbsp;M&nbsp;Jensen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">3D-printed sei whale plates</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
