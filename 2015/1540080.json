The workshop will bring together all the PIs engaged in the NRI for a two day workshop to discuss research, educational initiatives, and methods for transition of results. \r\n\r\nThe workshop includes oral presentations by involved program managers, the PIs, a poster session with presentation of all sponsored projects, tutorials, and several keynote speeches. An important aspect of the workshop is program-wide networking and exploration of mechanisms to optimize the results of the overall initiative with respect to research, training, and societal impact.",
