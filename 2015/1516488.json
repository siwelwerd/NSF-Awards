 "awd_abstract_narration": "The southern Great Basin is among the most arid regions in North America. It has almost no\r\nperennial streams, but does have >1,000 springs. These springs are islands of aquatic habitat\r\nin an ocean of desert. Remarkably, many of these isolated springs contain diverse aquatic\r\necosystems and even endemic species of fish, spring snails, and other aquatic organisms. The\r\npresence of many aquatic species that can only survive in water is evidence that the springs\r\nare remnants of a perennial drainage system, and the presence of endemic species requiring\r\nintervals in the million-year range for genetic divergence are evidence that at least some\r\nof these springs have never desiccated over the geological time scale. Aquatic biogeographical\r\npatterns thus inform the geological and hydrological history of the region.\r\n\r\nThis is a project to expand the already-large regional biogeographical database and to use the combined\r\nnew and preexisting data to test models of tectonic and paleohydrological evolution of the\r\nsouthern Great Basin. The PIs will focus on two timescales: that of the extensional breakup of\r\nthe region from the late Miocene to the present and that of glacial/interglacial climate cycles.\r\nExtensive work has been done to understand the extensional history of the region, which started\r\nin the eastern portion of the study area at ~14 Ma and migrated westward to the Sierra Nevada\r\nfront, driven by plate-boundary dynamics. They will simulate this evolution using a regional\r\nquasi-3D kinematic/tectonic-geomorphic-hydrologic coupled model that fully couples movement\r\nalong faults, mass distribution, magmatism, isostatic compensation and flexural deformation\r\nwith hydrology and surface geomorphic processes, including erosion and deposition. The extensional\r\nfragmentation of the hydrological system will be studied and groundwater flow, necessary to\r\nsimulate the resulting development of springs, will be an integral part of the regional tectonic-geomorphic-hydrologic model.\r\n.\r\nModeled paleohydrologic histories will be tested against biotic data (aquatic biota inventories,\r\nmicrobial and macrofaunal DNA, and genetic divergence times) with island biogeography theory.\r\nThe PIs will test for relations of hydrologic fragmentation chronology with endemic species and\r\nfor ecosystem diversity with spring resilience, as inferred from groundwater ages and climatically\r\ndriven modeling. They will use these results to assess and improve their tectonic/paleohydrologic models.",
