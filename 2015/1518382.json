 "awd_abstract_narration": "A longstanding problem in astrophysics is to understand how galaxies form and develop throughout their lifetimes.  Such understanding is necessary to uncover how our Universe evolved and to gain insight into the origin of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  One important aspect of understanding galaxy formation and evolution is to study supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies and how these black holes interact with their host galaxies.  Observational evidence suggests that black holes and galaxies evolve together.  This evidence includes the tightness of the correlation between the black hole mass and galaxy bulge properties and the similar history of black hole growth and star formation.  This evidence is supported by theoretical arguments.  Black holes in their active phase emit more than enough energy to unbind the host galaxies' bulge, and in their non-active phase should be present in the centers of most present-day galaxies.  As a consequence, many models for galaxy formation include a unspecified process by which a fraction of the energy released in the region surrounding the black hole contributes to the galaxy formation environment.  This interaction is generically known as \"feedback,\" and the mechanism by which the black hole acts on the host galaxy remains a mystery.  This project uses a novel spectral synthesis and statistical approach to build the tools needed to constrain the key parameter characterizing one type of feedback.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the project activities will directly contribute to the training of young scientists, including undergraduate students, in techniques of spectral and statistical analysis.  The PI will develop and teach a course, directed toward advanced undergraduate and graduate students, on machine learning and statistical methods, some of which will be used in this project.  The PI will bring the results of this research to the citizens of Oklahoma through participation in the OU speakers program.\r\n\r\nThis research effort will constrain the key parameter characterizing quasar mode feedback: the ratio of the kinetic luminosity to bolometric luminosity, in the SDSS broad absorption line quasars as a whole.  In addition, the carefully-phased research program addresses related scientific questions at each check point.  These include the location and nature of feedback interactions, a search for and evaluation of absorption-line spectral diagnostics, and constraints of key outflow physical parameters, including column density, ionization parameter, and covering fraction.\r\n\r\nThis research project will yield insights into the physics of quasar outflows, and measurements of key parameters that will be valuable to a wide variety of researchers.  These include scientists who are interested in on-going interactions potentially occurring in infrared-loud quasars, data analysts who use spectral diagnostics to infer physical conditions from spectra of individual objects, and theorists who need observational constraints to develop their hydromagnetic wind models, as well as providing an assessment of the viability of quasar-mode feedback for galaxy evolution models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the most pressing problems in astronomy is how the Universe\nevolved from a nearly smooth and almost featureless state at the time\nof the Big Bang to the highly structured environment we see today.\nLarge-scale cosmological simulations of structure formation have seen\nnotable success, but a key result is that feedback - energy returned\nto the galaxy by the accreting black hole - is necessary in the\nmodels.  The issue is that large-scale models are not able to\ndetermine how the black-hole feedback occurs, since the scale of the\nblack hole is tiny compared with the scale of the simulations.  One of\nthe most promising of the feedback candidates is the high-velocity\nwinds that are seen in the rest-UV spectrum in about 20% of quasars -\nthe so-called broad absorption line quasars (BALQs).  BALQs were\ndiscovered about 50 years ago, yet their potential as feedback\ncandidates remains unknown because quasar spectra are not easy to\nanalyze, especially when there is severe line blending.\n\nUnder this grant, we developed a novel method for analysing\nbroad-absorption line quasar spectra.  The traditional method involves\nmeasuring individual absorption lines and comparing those measurements\nto results from the photoionization code Cloudy.  This method is time\nconsuming and can lead to ambiguous results.  Our method, called\nSimBAL, inverts the process.  We create synthetic spectra from the\nphotoionization results, and compare those synthetic spectra with the\nobserved ones using a machine-learning technique.\n\nThe outcome of this project was the development of SimBAL, and\napplication to several 10s of BALQ spectra.  Many technical problems\nwere solved, including writing the base code, determining the\nmost efficient machine-learning methods, determining how to model the\nvelocity-resolved absorption lines, and how to model the continuum.\nOur results revealed hithertofore unknown wealth of information in\nBALQ spectra, much more than we had anticipated.  For example, we\nfound that BALQ troughs are generally complex, with evidence for\nthicker regions at certain velocities.  We found that outflows in a\nsub-class of broad absorption line quasars span an enormous range of\ndistances in the quasar, from very close to the accretion disk all the\nway out in the host galaxy.  We discovered the most energetic outflow\never identified, where the energy of the outflow is comparable to the\nluminosity of the quasar.  Most importantly, we established that\nSimBAL enables us to begin the first systematic study of the physical\nproperties of BALQ outflows, which in turn will permit us to evaluate\nthe contribution of BALQs to feedback and to constrain dynamical\nmodels.\n\nThe SimBAL project offers excellent opportunties for education.  Under\nthis grant, Leighly developed a graduate Machine Learning course, and\ntaught it twice.  This course provides a ambitious romp through\nstatistical inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, cluster analysis,\nregression, principal components analysis, classification, and time\nseries. The class was a success. Several students became very\ninterested in machine learning techniques, and adopted them in their\nresearch. Three students now working in data analytics jobs at the FAA\nand Boeing report that having this class on their resume proved a\nsignificant advantage in getting those jobs.\n\nThe SimBAL project also offers opportunities for mentoring student\nresearch.  Under this grant, a total of nine students worked on the\nproject.  The results include on-going PhD research by one student,\none completed masters thesis, three completed undergraduate capstone\n(senior thesis) projects, and two more in progress, six REU mentorship\nexperiences, and long-term undergraduate student research experiences\nfor five students, all of whom are attending or who are are admitted\nto graduate school, and of whom two are women.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen M Leighly"
