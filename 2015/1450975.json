 "awd_abstract_narration": "Data intensive science discovery at a global scale has imposed new requirements on the speed and management of international research and education networks. At the connection points of these international networks, it is critical to measure the network data flows to understand network traffic patterns, identify network anomalies and provide insights to network control and planning. However, the ever-increasing network speed, the massive amount of network flows and the changing measurement objectives have made the flow-level measurement on very high-speed networks extremely challenging. The Advanced Measurement Instrument and Services (AMIS) project leverages many-core, programmable network processors to prototype and deploy an advanced measurement instrument to enable services for accurate network monitoring and in-depth traffic analysis. The instrument supports flow-granularity measurement at line rate up to 100Gbps and software application programming interfaces to examine selected flows, with no impact to the performance of user traffic. With scalable hardware and an open source software stack, the measurement services equip network operators with effective tools to quantify flow-level network performance and study network flows through privacy-preserving computational analytics. This project is built on a consortium of academia, industrial partners, network operators and international alliances, who bring unique expertise and resources to achieve the objectives of high performance, programmable flow-granularity network measurement. The outcomes from this project will significantly benefit data driven science discovery, such as astronomy and space weather studies, and will promote broadened participation of underrepresented groups (such as Hispanic and female students) through the involvement of multiple universities, including an EPSCoR university and a Hispanic Serving Institution.",

Currently, they are using some very basic techniques for protection, such as suppressing the last byte of IP addresses. Such approaches provide little protection. The implemented <em>kanon</em> module offers protection that is far superior to existing practices, while at the same time providing several visualization and analytics tools (see Figures 1 and 2). Nevertheless, the amount of protection achieved by <em>kanon</em> is best-effort, so one can view this module as a \"legacy\" component meant to provide an alternative for sites that require protection, but at the same time are not prepared to migrate to a differential-privacy approach, due to the difference in query semantics supported by <em>DP</em> (i.e., <em>DP</em> does not allow direct access to data, but only provides a statistical query interface).</p>\n<p><br /><strong>(2)</strong> The <em>DP</em> approach implements the state-of-the-art, formally secure differential privacy model, currently employed by major industry players such as Google and Apple. Our implementation combines <em>DP</em> with Big Data techniques, and provides features for the creation and querying of a DP-compliant network flow repository. We index network flow data in an HBase repository, which allows efficient random access to data, such that arbitrary queries can be efficiently answered. A novel and effective feature of our design is the creation of contingency tables at multiple levels of granularity across the attribute space (e.g., time granularity or IP address space granularity). The query interface itself is implemented as MapReduce jobs with Hadoop, to parallelize the process and obtain fast query times. The query interface is also available as a restful interface. We provide a set of scripts for system administrators to create and manage the data repository, as well as for tuning the privacy parameters of the system. Figures 3 and 4 attached illustrate respectively the job monitoring interface for DP queries, and the script for contingency table creation.</p>\n<p>The github repository of our software is organized across these two components (Figure 5). Extensive documentation is also provided, as well as several written tutorials on how to initialize, query and maintain the systems. We have also provided some video tutorials. For instance, a video tutorial on how to use the differentially-private engine for flow sanitization and the associated restful web GUI is available at:</p>\n<p>https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J6wZpfz2q85y60C_YN3IGjG1Xgkcnfwf/view</p>\n<p>Currently, the github repository is managed by the lead institution in this project (University of Massachusetts Lowell), and the repository has not yet been made public. Until it is made public, please email PI Gabriel Ghinita at <a href=\"mailto:Gabriel.Ghinita@umb.edu\">Gabriel.Ghinita@umb.edu</a> to request access to the current private Git.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Workforce Development</span></strong></p>\n<p>The project involved development of software that uses state-of-the-art techniques in data privacy and big data.
