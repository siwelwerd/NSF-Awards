 "awd_abstract_narration": "Locusts are grasshoppers that can form enormous migrating swarms. They are major pests of agriculture throughout the world, causing millions of dollars in losses. In nature, locusts exist as one of two forms depending on local population density. At low density, locusts are inconspicuously colored and avoid each other, but at high density, they transform into conspicuously colored individuals that are attracted to each other. When the high-density condition persists, they eventually form swarms. This ability to change in response to density is known as density-dependent phenotypic plasticity. However, it is poorly understood how this phenomenon has evolved, why locusts swarm, and what makes them different from typical grasshoppers. Therefore, the main goal of this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project is to understand why some grasshoppers respond to crowding by forming swarms and others do not. The project aims to unravel the genetic basis of locust swarming using behavioral experiments and cutting-edge molecular techniques. \r\n\r\nThe core of this CAREER project is the seamless integration of research and education from K-12 to undergraduate and graduate students. The partnership with local public schools, enhanced by service-learning, will provide unique and relevant science education opportunities for both elementary school and college-level students. Specifically, the CAREER-enabled course development will fill a much-needed void in providing authentic research experience to the biology curriculum at the University of Central Florida. One primary goal of the broader impact activities will be to broaden participation of underrepresented minority students, particularly those who seek careers in science after transferring from community colleges. Graduate students supported by this project will be exposed to high-impact research with international and interdisciplinary opportunities. The broad nature of this project will establish a strong and long-lasting international network for future collaborations.",

The project also instrumental in the PI&rsquo;s career development as a teacher-scholar, who is now an associate professor with tenure in the Department of Entomology at Texas A&amp;M University. At the level of graduate training, the project allowed training of six graduate students (3 Ph.D. and 3 M.S.) in various aspects of research including cutting-edge molecular techniques, behavioral ecology, field biology, bioinformatics, and systematic entomology during the grant period. Of the 6 graduate students, five have graduated, and all of them were able to find the next academic career positions. At the level of undergraduate training, the project allowed training of 14 students, including 7 REU students, which positively influenced their career development and five out of the 14 students went to graduate school to pursue career in science. This CAREER project has allowed development of a new undergraduate-level course in the Department of Biology at the University of Central Florida, which provided training in scientific methods, experimental designs, and data analysis. This project also enabled K-12 education opportunity by engaging with a local public school to educate 5th grade students through the lens of entomological research and service learning. The CAREER project has been a great vehicle to illustrate the importance of hypothesis-driven and innovative research to the students of all levels.</p>\n<p>Prior to this project, most of what we knew about swarming locusts came from the study of the desert locust, <em>Schistocerca gregaria</em>, which is one of the most devastating migrating pests in North Africa and the Middle East. The genus that the desert locust belongs to, <em>Schistocerca</em>, contains two other locust species, the Central American locust (<em>S. piceifrons</em>) and the South American locust (<em>S. cancellata</em>), but their expression of density-dependent phenotypic plasticity had not been studied. Furthermore, <em>Schistocerca</em> also contains 32 species that are sedentary grasshoppers that do not swarm in nature, and it was also unknown how these non-swarming species would respond to experimental crowding. This CAREER project had three major research objectives, which were all successfully accomplished to produce the following outcomes: i) A robust dated phylogeny of <em>Schistocerca</em> based on a large amount of molecular data; ii) Complete characterization of density-dependent phenotypic plasticity in 9 <em>Schistocerca</em> species including the Central American locust and the South American locust as well as 7 sedentary species; and iii) Generation and analysis of a comparative transcriptomic dataset of four closely related <em>Schistocerca</em>, showing a gradient of density-dependent phenotypic plasticity, and identification of candidate genes underlying density-dependent phenotypic plasticity. The comparative approach enabled by this CAREER project has completely transformed the way we study swarming locusts. Especially, the project allowed the establishment of long-term colonies of four closely related species that show a gradient of density-dependent reaction norms, which opened up exciting possibility to pursue additional comparative genomics work in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, this CAREER project has allowed establishing and bolstering collaborative relationships with international researchers. Through the project, it was possible to develop a strong relationship with CESVY, a government agency in Yucatan, Mexico responsible for locust control, which will continue to mature for many years.
