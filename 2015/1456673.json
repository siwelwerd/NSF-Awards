 "awd_abstract_narration": "For most cells, the signals regulating gene expression typically arise from internal cues.  Intestinal epithelial cells however are uniquely exposed to digested food and need to respond to changes in diet or nutrient availability. This award will support innovative experimental approaches to investigate the adaptive characteristics of intestinal epithelial cells, thereby dramatically expanding our understanding of mammalian epithelial biology and intestinal regulation. The principal investigator will integrate this research program with educational activities involving graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, as well as inner city students recruited via previously established links with their high schools and colleges. Results from the studies will be distributed through peer-reviewed journal publications, and through presentations at regional and national scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nUsing the broadly representative response of the fructose transporter GLUT5 to dietary levels of its substrate as experimental model, the first aim tests the hypothesis that intestinal stem cells (ISCs) and their progenies have different capacities to adapt to dietary cues.  It will determine whether ISCs as well as fully differentiated absorptive and secretory cells perceive and respond to fructose, whether the response is reversible, and whether molecular information arising from transient exposure of ISCs to fructose can be memorized and transmitted to differentiating progenies. The second aim will test the hypothesis that fructose metabolism regulates GLUT5 expression via the cellular energy sensor AMP kinase and assess the contribution of nutrient metabolism to the adaptive response of fructose-responsive cells. Because nutrients regulate their own transporters, this study on GLUT5 regulation provides a broad understanding of how transporters in various intestinal cell types respond to changes in luminal concentrations of their substrates.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOne of the most controversial issues in regulatory biology concerns the plasticity of the renewable epithelia in adult mammals.  For most cells, the signals regulating gene expression typically arise from endogenous sources.  Intestinal epithelial cells however are uniquely exposed to luminal food contents.  Thus, their ability to perceive and adapt to these environmental cues is so critical that specific types and numbers of transporters are synthesized to match the variety and fluctuating concentrations of dietary constituents.  The intestinal mucosa consists of complex, three dimensional (3D), mountain-like structures: intestinal stem cells (ISCs) in the valleys differentiate into mature cell types that line the sides of the mountain or villi and that have different functions.  Which cell type(s) is able to perceive dietary cues and initiate an adaptive response?  The heterogeneous nature of epithelial cells and the process of cell migration along the crypt-villus axis preclude definitive conclusions as to the identity of nutrient-adaptable cell type(s) as well as to the role of ISCs in determining the nutrient-sensing capacity of their differentiated progeny. The bottleneck has been the absence of a cell type-specific culture system that also faithfully recapitulates the ISC differentiation hierarchy within the 3D intestinal structure.  This decades-old question became addressable when our laboratory was able to culture primary intestinal tissue organoids and to manipulate the composition of cells that comprise them into distinct types.  Using the sugar fructose as cue and the adaptive responses of fructose-transporting and fructose-metabolizing enzymes as biomarkers of nutrient sensing, this study found that all differentiated cells are able to sense fructose, including not only absorptive enterocytes that function to absorb nutrients into the blood, but also goblet cells that secrete mucus protecting the intestine and Paneth cells that secrete antimicrobial peptides as well as growth factors that maintain ISC?s.  Since ISC organoids failed to respond, differentiation must be essential for nutrient sensing.  The ability of secretory goblet and Paneth cells to respond suggests that nutrient sensing ability is retained even in nonabsorptive cells that do not transport dietary nutrients to the blood.  Although secretory cells can respond to the sugar fructose, only absorptive cells seem able to convert this sugar to lipids reportedly exported from the small intestine when sugar consumption is high. Remarkably, mature cells, upon forced dedifferentiation to reacquire ISC characteristics, retained fructose sensing ability, albeit with marked lifespan extension and enhanced expression of anti-apoptotic markers characteristic of nonstem cells possessing tumor-initiating capacity.
