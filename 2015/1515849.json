 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project studies dispersive partial differential equations, which are equations describing wave-like behavior in physical systems.  As such, dispersive partial differential equations can describe phenomena in optics, fluids, or plasmas, to name just a few areas of application.  To determine the validity of a particular equation as a model for a given phenomenon, it can be helpful to determine whether the equation has a solution, and if it does, how this solution depends upon the physical parameters.  For certain nonlinear Schrodinger equations, and for certain equations which can be used as models for waves in water, the principal investigator will study when these equations either lack solutions, or have solutions which depend discontinuously upon the data.  This will indicate that these particular models have only limited validity for applications.  As another part of the project, for some other families of dispersive partial differential equations, the principal investigator will determine when the equations either do or do not possess solutions with certain special forms.  Understanding such solutions, such as waves of permanent form or time-periodic waves, can lead to a deeper understanding of the behavior of the corresponding physical phenomena over long intervals of time.\r\n\r\nThe principal investigator will study well-posedness and ill-posedness for quasilinear Schrodinger equations and for truncated series water wave models.  For quasilinear Schrodinger equations, well-posedness theorems have been proved under certain non-degeneracy hypotheses; in this work, ill-posedness will be studied when the non-degeneracy condition is violated.  For truncated series models of water waves, the relationship between well-posedness/ill-posedness and the strength of dispersion will be investigated using complex variable methods and tools from paradifferential calculus.  For nonlinear Schrodinger equations and for general families of nonlinear dispersive equations, the principal investigator will use small divisor estimates, normal forms, and dispersive smoothing estimates to demonstrate the non-existence of small-amplitude spatially periodic, time-periodic waves in certain parameter regimes.  Also, existence of time-periodic, spatially-periodic waves for dispersive equations with high-derivative nonlinearities (especially for systems related to capillary waves in fluids) will be studied, using small divisor methods and techniques of Fourier analysis.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe main thrust of this research is determining when mathematical models of real-world phenomena possess reliable solutions.  It can be the case that models used by practioners in applied disciplines either lack solutions altogether or have solutions which behave badly (perhaps in ways unrelated to the reality of the situation being modeled).  In such cases, it can be the case that the models need to be further developed, perhaps incorporating more physical effects from the application.  When the models do possess good solutions and are generally appropriate for use in practice, this analysis can shed light on the behavior and properties of solutions.\n\nThe work of this project gave insights into two kinds of models for the motion of waves in water.  Truncated series models are a class of models used for numerical simulation of water waves, and the investigator and colleagues previously showed that these models can be unreliable.  With a graduate student, Shunlian Liu, the investigator showed that incorporating elastic effects at the wave surface makes the truncated series models well-posed, i.e. more reliable.  Such elastic effects relate to models of sea ice at the top surface of the ocean.  With Jerry Bona and Timur Milgrom, the investigator showed that a number of Boussinesq-type models of water waves, including what is known as the Kaup system, are ill-posed, in particular showing that very small changes in the initial conditions of the waves lead to very large changes in the solution only a short time later.  This shows that these models are not suitable for making physical predictions of water waves.\n\nBeyond the question of well-posedness or ill-posedness of initial value problems for models arising in physical situations, it is also helpful to know when solutions of special form do or do not exist.  Such special forms include traveling waves and time-periodic waves.  The investigator continued his work with J. Douglas Wright to provide a general framework for ruling out the existence of time-periodic solutions in certain parameter regimes.  The framework was refined for the application to nonlinear Schrodinger equations, which are much-used models in a variety of areas of physics.  With Benjamin Akers and a graduate student, David Sulon, the investigator proved theorems on the existence of traveling waves for the hydroelastic wave system (as mentioned before, this can be a model for the motion of sea ice).  Such waves were also numerically computed.\n\nThis project supported undergraduate student research by three students.  Two students worked with the investigator, Shari Moskow, and Gideon Simpson on a project in electromagnetics.  One student worked with the investigator on a project in well-posedness of a model system related to reliability of numerical simulations of dispersive wave equations.  Both of these projects with undergraduate students have resulted in journal papers submitted for publication.  This project supported the research of two PhD students who have now graduated (Shunlian Liu and David Sulon), and one PhD student who is expected to graduate in the next year (Benjamin Irwin).\n\nExistence theorems were also proved for models from a number of other disciplines as well, including on magma flows, epitaxial films, flame fronts, and non-cooperative games.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David M Ambrose"
