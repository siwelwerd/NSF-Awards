These facilities are essential infrastructure providing high-performance advanced networking that enables the large-scale data flows, access to high performance computing, and remote visualization necessary for collaborative research in all areas of science and engineering including astronomy, biology, bio-medical engineering, materials science, medicine, earth sciences, high-energy physics, and oceanography.\r\n\r\nThis award funds enhancement and expansion of the Pacific Wave production infrastructure to support multiple 100 gigabit-per-second connections among US-based research and education networks and international counterparts from countries of the Pacific Rim including Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan. Many research and education networks are developing novel network architectures based on Software Defined Networking to better support the demands of the science and engineering communities that they serve. Project activities also include the development of a parallel set of network connection facilities comprising a distributed Software Defined Exchange to interconnect these emerging Software Defined Networks.  \r\n\r\nThe Pacific Wave Expansion project supported by this award achieves these objectives through engagement with the 17 major international research and education networks currently connected to the Pacific Wave exchange and through information and technology exchange with other awardees of the International research network connections program and the US science and engineering research community.",

The scientists can focus on their science, and in the background, the network will support their requirements. This work is ongoing.</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 pandemic crisis highlighted the importance of having a global fabric of interconnected research networks like Pacific Wave. These networks provided an essential platform for bringing together the research leaders, distributed data, and supercomputing resources from around the globe, all of which were needed to achieve an understanding of the virus, accelerate the development of vaccines, and coordinate global public health measures. Networks such as Pacific Wave help to accelerate the pace of scientific discovery by supporting global collaboration and are an essential tool in solving some of the most critical problems facing the globe in all areas of science and engineering.</p>\n<p>This award to Pacific Wave supported successful innovations on the Pacific Research Platform (PRP). The NSF-supported PRP is a partnership of more than 50 institutions, led by researchers at UC San Diego and UC Berkeley and includes the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and multiple research universities in the US and around the world. The PRP builds on the optical backbone of Pacific Wave, to create a seamless research platform that encourages collaboration on a broad range of data-intensive fields and projects.</p>\n<p>The success of PRP has led to national and international analogous programs, the National Research Platform and the Global Research Platform, both made possible by the NSF investments in Pacific Wave and the Pacific Research Platform. At the core of all of these programs are networks with advanced capabilities that enable secure and frictionless access to data, scientific instruments (many of them global scale instruments and data sources), and multi-institutions and, often, multi-national scientific collaborations.</p>\n<p>Pacific Wave is also engaged in other national multi-user, programmable testbeds such as the Open Science Grid (OSG), and multi-user, programmable testbeds, such as FABRIC; and, efforts to develop services to simplify public cloud access for computer science research and education, such as CloudBank.</p>\n<p>In addition, Pacific Wave provides network access for many US local, state, and federal entities. Through the recent inclusion of the Tribal Digital Village Network, 20 Native American tribes in Southern California are now directly connected to Pacific Wave's peering structure, its high-performance scientific networks, and ever-expanding global connectivity.</p>\n<p>Lastly, as a part of this project, Pacific Wave developed software for \"Virtual Customer Equipment (VCE)\" and experimented with its use with several US networks.
