This one-day workshop was planned by a stand-alone committee of experts and was held on December 15, 2016, in Washington, DC. A resulting publication, Returns to Federal Investments in the Innovation System: Proceedings of the Workshop&mdash;In Brief provides a summary of the event and is available for free download on the National Academies Press website.\n\nThe workshop began with a discussion of the theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence that bear on assessing the returns to federally-funded basic research; data limitations; and potentially fruitful directions for further research.  It next looked at the ways by which federal policies support private-sector innovation, including R&amp;D tax credits, procurement and prize mechanisms, Small Business Innovation Research programs, and public-private venture funds, as well as the patent system.
