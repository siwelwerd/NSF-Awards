This year marks the 10-year anniversary of the PREM program and an opportunity to showcase the science of PREM students (past and current) and discuss the lessons learned and successes of the program.  Towards these goals, the Materials Research Society (MRS) will host a two-day event during the Fall 2014 conference in Boston that will expand the professional development and networking program for PREM undergraduate students launched at its Fall 2013 Meeting.  As a result of this award 56 students from PREM institutions will attend the MRS meeting, receive mentoring advice from established materials scientists and present their research results in a MRS poster session.",
