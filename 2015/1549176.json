The workshop will provide an opportunity for students and young researchers to interact with leaders in these important fields. The diverse experience and expertise of the participants coupled with a shared interest in rewriting and formal systems provides an ideal setting to foster new synergies and collaborations to address challenging problems in theory and applications to real world problems.",
