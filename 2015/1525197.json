 "awd_abstract_narration": "Building upon content and first generation electronic homework websites that were created with prior NSF support, this IUSE: EHR project will develop an adaptive intelligent tutoring system for organic chemistry.  The critical components of the system are (a) a student model that includes both cognitive and affective factors, (b) a network to evaluate students' knowledge, and (c) a meta-cognitive coach that will monitor the status of students' problem solving skills.  Previous research has shown that self-efficacy and self-determination are the most important student-centric factors for high engagement with electronic learning tools. The meta-cognitive coach will attempt to identify students with poor self-regulation so that it can offer appropriate learning strategies to promote the active development of organic chemistry problem solving skills.  The results of this research should contribute to the broader development of intelligent tutoring systems across a variety of STEM disciplines.\r\n\r\nThe intelligent  tutoring system will be developed and disseminated along with associated course materials that guide a method of instruction based on problem solving from fundamental organic chemistry principles (e.g., Lewis acid/base theory; retrosynthetic analysis).  These materials together with the tutoring system are grounded in constructivist pedagogy, wherein students construct an understanding in a strongly guided setting, by applying fundamental principles to explain the properties and reactions of organic molecules.  The evaluation of the meta-cognitive coach will be based on whether or not students are observed to have improved learning gains and motivational gains (exam scores and questionnaire responses).   The assessment of learning strategy development will be done by the meta-cognitive coach itself, which will analyze log data to determine the extent to which students' actions conform to the learning strategy proposed.  The results of this project will be disseminated at the Bienniel Conference on Chemical Education and the 2017 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Chemical Education.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOrganic chemistry is a required course for many students, notably in pre-health tracks.  Organic chemistry is often described as a roadblock course for many students who wish to enter medical school and other health professions.   \n\nWe have developed a web-based online homework system that is uses a new method for learning organic chemistry based on sound teaching/learning theories.   \n\nThe online homework system, called ?Organic chemistry Practice Environment? (OPE), has been tested in classes of over 500 students per semester and from fall 2012 to the present.  It?s 2500 organic chemistry problems cover the entire content of a standard two-semester organic chemistry course.  Of these problems, 250 have step-by-step guidance, and 800 have video explanations.  All problems have detailed explanatory feedback of the chemistry involved.  These explanations and problems are unique to OPE.  They are based on the electron energies and Lewis acid/base principles. \n\nAffective factors have been incorporated guided by social cognitive theory, which recognizes that learning is hard work, and that students must be motivated to put in the effort to learn. Motivation is in turn regulated by affective factors such as self-efficacy, self-determination and metacognition. OPE includes features to enhance self-efficacy, self-determination and metacognition, as follows:\n\nSelf-efficacy is supported by giving students equal credit for getting a problem correct and incorrect.  This encourages students to see the system as not punitive.  \n\nSelf determination is supported by recognizing that student use OPE to perform two functions that are very different, i.e. to learn, and to test their performance. Cognitively, these are very different. Each time a student approaches a problem, they are asked if they are learning or if they are testing their performance, allowing students to control their learning.\n\nOPE incorporates a unique adaptive meta-cognitive coach, which predicts student outcome based on site usage.

Therefore, we completed a study on the roles of cultural and social forms of capital on organic chemistry learning and uncovered a new form of social capital we call \"College Connections\".\n\nEach OPE problem is categorized in terms of 400 individual organic chemistry knowledge components, with from one to as many as either knowledge components per problem.  This is the first time that such a categorization of an entire organic chemistry course has been attempted.  This analysis allows OPE to track the student?s success while solving problems and update its estimates of the student?s degree of mastery of each knowledge component.  This detailed assessment of the student?s current competence allows OPE to recommend problems that are neither too easy nor too hard for students.  The recommendations aim to increase their learning rate while reducing frustration and boredom.\n\nHowever, we discovered a significant flaw in traditional algorithms for updating the student?s degree of mastery of knowledge components.  The algorithms were developed in the context of mathematics, where students are typically given dozens of opportunities to practice each knowledge component.  In organic chemistry, most knowledge components are practiced only a few times, from 1 to 5 typically.  This caused the traditional algorithms to be inaccurate. \n\nWe invented a new algorithm.  It is based on a simple matching idea.  Using our data base of students who have taken OPE before, our algorithm selects prior students whose histories match this student?s history up to the resent time.  It then uses their future work to predict this student?s future work.  This approach was more accurate than the traditional ones.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/27/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ian R Gould"
