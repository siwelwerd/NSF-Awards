The workshop will focus on the possible use of new generation, lower voltage, highly automated, and far less costly AMS systems than have been traditionally used in the U.S. to date.  It is envisioned that lower cost, low voltage (1 MeV) AMS systems will allow for high throughput cosmogenic nuclide analysis at modest cost enabling hundreds of measurements that can be used to characterize the probability distribution of isotope concentrations ? allowing greatly enhanced reliability for dating moraines, for isochron burial dating of sediments, and for tracing sediment across the landscape.",
