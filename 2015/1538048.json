 "awd_abstract_narration": "Polymeric nanofibers can have major societal impacts in many applications including water filtration, drug delivery, energy storage, and light-weight composites for automotive and aerospace sectors. Despite significant potential applications, scalable methods to produce nanofibers are in their infancy. Current methods such as the well-known electrospinning process often rely on polymer processing from solutions in which a large quantity of solvent is released to the environment. The solvent significantly increases the cost of raw materials and the environmental footprint of the production units, and demands extreme measures for safe ventilation to protect the workforce. This award supports fundamental research to generate the knowledge required to produce polymeric nanofibers in a solvent-free and industrially scalable method. The method is applicable to a wide range of polymers.  The results from this research will impact advanced manufacturing and, hence, the U.S. economy, by establishing solvent-free and thus \"green\" nanofiber production methods. The fulfillment of the research goal will be through a multidisciplinary effort, guided by expertise in material science, chemical engineering, fiber processing and energy-matter coupling. This effort will also broaden the participation of underrepresented student groups in STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThe goal is to develop the science and technology of manufacturing continuous polymeric nanofibers in an environmentally sustainable and scalable fashion. To this end, a novel form of melt electrospinning, where polymer melts are energized via electromagnetic radiation and pulled by electrostatic fields, is planned. Microfibers with carbon nanotube inclusions will be utilized as nanofiber precursors. The intellectual significance of this work partly lies in attempts to develop new understanding for coupling energy to matter required to develop nanofibers. The proposition to utilize microfibers is also intellectually significant and is a key to scalability. The nanotubes in microfibers will serve as energy absorbers from radiation to raise the temperature of the jet, regulate its viscosity and assist with reducing the jet diameter via electrostatic forces. The research team will experimentally study the energy absorption by composite fibers from microwave radiation. The team will then develop physics-based models to explore the formation of nanofibers from microfibers. Based on model output, the team will develop the setup to process nanofibers. The setup will allow for real time monitoring of the nanofiber formation to obtain more insight into energy-matter couplings.",

They are favorable in these applications due to characteristics such as high surface to volume ratio, a mere effect of their small diameter, and in many cases enhanced material properties such as strength and toughness compared to the same polymer in bulk form. Despite all the potential benefits of low micron and sub-micron polymer fibers, scalable processing of polymer fibers with such low diameters is still in its infancy. The overarching goal of this project has been to develop the science and technology of manufacturing nonwoven, continuous and straight nanofibers in environmentally sustainable and scalable fashion via major innovations in melt-electrospinning. This is a daunting task due to high viscosity and low charge density of polymer melt, as a result of which the polymer jet experience limited drawing (and thus reduction in diameter) during electrospinning.</p>\n<p>With these challenges, the project made advances in four fronts. First, we developed a combined modeling-experimental technique to unravel the effect of downstream heating on diameter of the melt electrospun fibers. We developed a model for non-isothermal melt electrospinning in the presence of a volumetric heat source applied to the polymer. Our simulation results demonstrate that downstream heating does reduce the fiber diameter, and therefore can be used to address the limitations of melt electrospinning. In addition, our model has also been used to capture the effect of the surrounding temperature, which affects the thinning of the fiber through surface rather than volumetric interactions. The models were also experimentally validated (Journal of Polymer Science Part B: Polymer Physics 55 (18), 1393-1405).</p>\n<p>A downside to the downstream heating was the rather intense radiation required to offset the heat loss due to convection. Therefore, we then developed a novel melt electrospinning method to produce low-micron fibers, in which a polymer-coated wire with a sharp tip is used as the polymer source. Our method, wire-melt electrospinning, relies on confining the Taylor cone and reducing initial jet diameter via concentrated electrostatic fields as a means to reduce the diameter of fibers (instead of stretching the jet during electrospinning). By inducing a concentrated electrostatic field near the polymer source, we managed to reduce the size of the jet by about an order of magnitude, which led to a reduction in the fiber diameter by ~3-4 times. We have explained the generation of thin fibers (a few microns in diameter) in terms of the electrostatic field around the wire tip, as obtained from FEA (Macromolecular Materials and Engineering 304 (1), 1800417).</p>\n<p>Next, we demonstrated non-contact heating of melt electrospun polymer fibers by using radio frequency (RF) fields which heat carbon nanotubes (CNT) receptors inside the fibers. This was inspired by one of the goals of the project to couple energy to matter via CNT receptors. We observed that the heating rate scales with the CNT loading even below the bulk electrical percolation threshold, suggesting that individual CNTs can serve as RF receptors/heat sources. This capability eliminates the requirement for a percolated network of CNTs inside a fiber as a means to enable heating. We also showed that a strong radial temperature gradient will develop within the fibers. For a 2 ?m diameter fiber, the temperature of the core is 10-15?C higher than the surface. Hence, the temperature of the core can surpass the melting temperature inside the fiber without altering the morphology of the fibers (i.e., without fusing between fibers). These electrospun fibers that can be stimulated through RF energy can be used for applications such as plastic electric heaters, hyperthermia treatment, and heat-generating textiles (ACS Applied Polymer Materials 1 (10), 2751-2759).</p>\n<p>Lastly, we used an inert atmosphere to increase thermal degradation temperature of polymer melts during electrospinning, which in turn allows us to increase the polymer temperature, and reduce the viscosity. Our results revealed that by using an inert atmosphere in syringe electrospinning in which flow is regulated independent of temperature, increasing the electrospinning nozzle temperature from 300?C to 360?C reduced the fiber diameter significantly from 26?10 ?m to 9?5 ?m, while electrospinning in air became unstable and turned into electro spraying potentially due to thermally induced polymer degradation in air. In contrast, increasing temperature of the wire-based electrospinning did not lead to a noticeable reduction in diameter. That is attributed to the viscosity-dependent flow rate in this method, as a result of which increasing the temperature leads to increased flow rates (promoting the formation of thicker fibers) as well as stretchability (promoting the formation of thinner fibers).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/16/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mohammad&nbsp;Naraghi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1538048/1538048_10391386_1576527973587_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1538048/1538048_10391386_1576527973587_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Melt electrospinning with down stream heating\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1538048/1538048_10391386_1576527973587_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Melt electrospinning with down stream heating\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1: Schematic of electrospinning setup.
