 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the Southwest Local Algebra Meeting 2015, held at Oklahoma State University on February 28 - March 1, 2015. This conference will facilitate interactions between students and faculty with interests in ring theory, broadly interpreted, from institutions in the Southwest. Algebraists in the Southwest region pursue research on a variety of topics under the umbrella of pure and applied ring theory. The geographical distances in the region are such that interactions between people at different institutions rarely happen spontaneously. The meeting will bring together students and faculty from a variety of institutions for inspiring talks, with ample time for scientific interaction, providing opportunities for participants to begin new collaborations and catalyzing new research projects. About 50 participants are expected, including students and young and senior faculty from throughout the Southwest and South. The participation of students from underrepresented minority groups, women, untenured faculty, and faculty at non-Ph.D. granting institutions is particularly encouraged. Six experts will deliver hour-long talks on topics within their areas of specialty; the lectures will be accessible to graduate students. The meeting will also feature three hour-long poster sessions in which the participating students will present their research. More information can be found at the conference webpage: http://www.math.ttu.edu/~lchriste/slam2015.html.\r\n\r\nThe study of rings, in the broadest sense, is crucial to many branches of mathematics, including commutative and non-commutative geometry, group representations, number theory, coding theory, and cryptography. Participants will discuss several key problems in commutative algebra, including progress on finding bounds for Betti numbers, a topic that has significant implications for classical problems in combinatorics and algebraic geometry, including Cayley-Bacharach theory. Several speakers work in combinatorial or computational algebraic geometry and will also shed light on connections between these fields and commutative algebra. Finally, the research expertise of one speaker is in Lie theory, providing an opportunity to introduce ring theorists to problems in a different field close to their area of work.",

This was the sixth annual Southwest Local Algebra Meeting (SLAM); the first five meetings took place at the University of Texas at Arlington in March 2010, New Mexico State University in 2011, Texas Tech University in 2012, the University of Arizona in 2013, and Texas A&amp;M University in 2014. The purpose of the meeting was to facilitate interactions between young and senior mathematicians, with interests in ring theory, broadly interpreted, from institutions in the Southwest. Participants met at OSU for talks, graduate student poster sessions, and discussions. The five speakers were Laura Matusevich (Texas A&amp;M University), Lance Miller (University of Arkansas), Chris Peterson (Colorado State University), Edward Richmond (Oklahoma State University), and the keynote speaker, Giulio Caviglia (Purdue University), who surveyed topics at the intersection of commutative algebra, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry. Each speaker gave a talk that was accessible to the graduate students in the audience, often illustrating connections between basic material learned in graduate school with the latest research in the field. Nine graduate students from seven different institutions presented posters during over two hours of poster sessions, explaining their research to other students and faculty. The posters were entitled \"The Taylor resolution and some open problems of Peeva-Stillman\" (Guillermo Alesandroni, Oklahoma State University), \"Curvature on the integers\" (Malik Barrett, University of New Mexico), \"An isomorphism of Gerstenhaber Algebras\" (Lauren Grimley, Texas A&amp;M University), \"Blowing up finitely supported complete ideals in a regular local ring\" (Youngsu Kim, University of California-Riverside), \"Counting standard closures on a power series ring modulo the edge ideal of a complete graph\" (Greg Morre, University of New Mexico), \"The group of divisibility of a finite character intersection of valuation rings\" (Lokendra Paudel, New Mexico State University), \"Deviations of graded algebras\" (Alessio Sammartano, Purdue University), \"On the Koszulness of multi-Rees algebras of principal Borel ideals\" (Gabriel Sosa, Purdue University), and \"Algebraic independence and asymptotic properties of ideals\" (Jonathan Toledo, CINESTAV-IPN, Mexico).
