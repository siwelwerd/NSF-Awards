 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a well-documented need for competent, confident, and committed STEM teachers to serve in high-need school districts.  Through this Phase 2 Noyce project, the Winthrop Initiative for STEM Educators, WISE, will provide scholarship funds to produce thirty-two new teachers at the middle and high school level who will be licensed to teach mathematics, biology, chemistry, and/or general science in the State of South Carolina.  Each of these new teachers will have a solid foundation in the content area through a bachelor's degree in the chosen STEM field. The project will provide support through several undergraduate and graduate initial licensure pathways. WISE will also enhance the undergraduate experience for approximately forty-eight high-achieving STEM majors by providing an annual summer internship program (designed to encourage students to consider STEM education as a career) that will include authentic research in the area of study and service learning in high-need schools. York Technical College, a 2-year institution, will partner with Winthrop University in the recruitment, mentoring, and support of Noyce scholars.  This Phase 2 project, funded by the National Science Foundation's (NSF) Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program will also conduct a longitudinal study to examine several aspects of their pre-service teacher education work.  \r\n\r\nWISE provides students who pursue majors in a STEM field three pathways for becoming a teacher.  The first option is designed for undergraduate mathematics and biology majors who decide early to pursue teacher preparation.  Scholarship support will be provided for the final two years of a STEM major's undergraduate program allowing for certification in mathematics, biology, and chemistry, with options to extend licensure for middle grades and general science.  The second option is for post-baccalaureate STEM majors who take coursework to complete a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program leading to initial teacher certification. Both a fast track (3-term option) and a more flexible program that typically requires four semesters of coursework are offered.  The third option is designed to combine aspects of the undergraduate and graduate program.  It allows students to start working in schools as an undergraduate and complete certification at the graduate level in year five. This new model provides flexibility for research, electives, and a balanced approach that allows for fieldwork incorporated over time.  During the course of this project the investigating team will continue longitudinal data collection in order to identify effective models related to recruitment and retention of qualified STEM educators.  Areas to be examined include: recruitment efforts; transition experiences for 2-year college transfer students; summer research experiences; persistence; influence of content specialists on dispositions and skills, and the infrastructure to support new STEM teachers in high-need schools.  Ultimately, not only will WISE contribute thirty-two well-qualified STEM teachers to the professional workforce, but WISE has the potential to contribute research-supported best practices for the recruitment, development, and retention of highly qualified STEM teachers for high-need schools.",

Both were similar to <em>WISE Phase I</em> (2010-1016), in which there were 65 Summer Interns and 44 Scholars. In <em>Phase II</em>, 45 first- and second-year Winthrop and York Technical College STEM majors participated in the Summer Internship, where they were introduced to disciplinary research, career options, and STEM education in public schools. The <em>Phase II</em> Scholars Program provided 37 scholarships with mentoring for students in the final two years of a STEM teacher certification program.</p>\n<p><em>WISE Phase II</em> had four main goals:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Recruit qualified and diverse STEM educators</li>\n<li>Provide high-quality preparation of STEM educators</li>\n<li>Support and retain STEM educators</li>\n<li>Produce effective STEM educators</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">WISE</span></em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Summer Internship</span></strong></p>\n<p>The Summer Internship program (three weeks each May in 2016-2019) addressed all four goals. The internship was open to all high-achieving STEM students as an early opportunity for career exploration; a total of 45 students participated across four summers. Interns were encouraged to consider a STEM education career, and participated in a range of experiences focused on water. Interns were trained as <em>Project WET</em> educators and worked in disciplinary teams (biology, chemistry, and mathematics) with content experts to research various aspects of aquatic life, water quality, and water supply/demand. Through the research component, they were able to develop as STEM majors regardless of their ultimate desire to teach. A critical aspect of the Internship provided participants opportunities to work in area high-need secondary STEM classrooms, thereby experiencing public education as a prospective teacher and realizing the role that all STEM professionals can play in the development of STEM knowledge through our schools. Interns visited other STEM-related working environments (such as a municipal wastewater treatment facility and the site-based work of a regional riverkeeper) to explore careers beyond education.</p>\n<p>A significant aim of the <em>WISE </em>Internship was to recruit students to the STEM teaching profession; however, we recognized that not all of the Interns would choose teaching. Therefore we consistently integrated the impact that noneducator citizens have on local schools (through voting and supporting grants at federal, state, and local/philanthropic levels) and the inherent responsibility of STEM professionals to volunteer their expertise.</p>\n<p>Overall, the <em>WISE</em> Internship utilized a high-touch, high-impact design to provide a valuable experience for talented STEM majors early in their college career. The result was (a) retention of at least 90% of participants as STEM majors; (b) 14 (31% of 45) participants pursuing STEM teacher certification; and (c) the development of research agendas and/or skills in research that quickly advanced participants as STEM professionals. The design elements and impacts of the <em>WISE</em> Internship were shared at the international level through a video presentation in the 2021 STEM for All Video Showcase (available at <a href=\"https://stemforall2021.videohall.com/presentations/1989\">https://stemforall2021.videohall.com/presentations/1989</a>).</p>\n<p><strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">WISE</span></em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> Scholars Program</span></strong></p>\n<p>The <em>WISE</em> Scholars program was designed to support STEM education teacher candidates both financially and professionally, and it addressed all four project goals.
