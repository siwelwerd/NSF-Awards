Conference web site:  www.artsci.uc.edu/departments/math/complex_geometry_conference.html\r\n\r\nThis is a conference in the general area of geometric function theory. The event seeks to focus attention on and highlight connections between a variety of topics, including the theory of quasiconformal mappings, mappings of finite distortion, potential theory, analysis on metric spaces, and Teichmuller theory. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
