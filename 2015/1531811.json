 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the University of Texas at Dallas to acquire a state of the art X-ray diffraction tool for determination and understanding of the crystal structure of new materials in the fields of low power electronics, energy storage, superconductors, organic electronics, nanotechnology, flexible electronics, photovoltaics, optoelectronics, and environmental catalysts. Crystal structure plays a major role in each of these important applications as it determines the mechanical, toxicity, reactivity, and electronic properties of the new materials. The remarkable advances over the past half century in the fields of computing, engineering, medicine, and energy would not have taken place had it not been for the creation of \"materials by design\" that is only possible when the structure of materials and their correlation to material properties are well known. UT-Dallas has state of the art facilities for materials synthesis by a wide range of technologically relevant processes in addition to advanced characterization tools. Therefore, this new instrument, which allows a precise determination of the structure of materials grown by the PI, will allow them to study the effect of processing conditions on materials structure and, in turn, determine the materials properties. The instrument will also play a significant role in the education of graduate and undergraduate students in a wide range of disciplines; it will be open to users from outside of the university fostering new collaborations in the Dallas-Fort Worth metropole and around the country. \r\n\r\nThe instrument is a Rigaku SmartLab high-resolution, ultra-high speed X-ray diffractometer for the structural analysis and crystal quality determination of bulk and thin-film organic and inorganic materials for nanoelectronic and energy applications. The new instrument will be housed in the Natural Science and Engineering Research Laboratory (NSERL) and will complement existing materials synthesis and device fabrication capabilities in dedicated labs and shared user facilities at UT-Dallas. The new diffractometer will significantly enhance in research high quality single crystal 2-dimensional semiconductors for high performance and low power nanoelectronic applications, in intermetallic and oxide layered materials that can exhibit a range of properties from unusual magnetism to superconductivity and more. In these fields and others the quantification of thin-film crystal quality and the orientation of grains in polycrystalline samples in reduced dimensions are crucial to understanding the process-structure-property relationships. The ability to determine crystal quality and carry out high-speed pole figures for texture analysis opens new research avenues for a wide number of investigators and students. The acquisition of a high-resolution and ultra-high speed X-ray diffractometer will greatly enhance the research of current and potential materials and device researchers within UT-Dallas and across the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex as well as dramatically transform important research and educational efforts. The instrument will be used to improve student education and training through hands-on access to new techniques and complement classroom learning.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nQuantification of thin-film crystal quality and the orientation of grains in polycrystalline samples in reduced dimensions are crucial to understanding the process-structure-property relationships that are central to scientific and engineering research and education at UT-Dallas.  The Department of Materials Science and Engineering?s previous diffractometer was severely limited in ways critical to the needs of the UT-Dallas faculty and students, including poor resolution and a low rate counter.  To alleviate these problems and enhance the materials science research at UT-Dallas, we were awarded funding to purchase a Rigaku SmartLab Diffractometer with a high-speed detector and outstanding resolution capabilities. After acquisition of the funds, we finalized the system details. The system is capable of out-of-plane 2-Theta/omega, asymmetric 2-Theta measurements and in-plane measurements.  The in-plane arm also facilitates the acquisition of a complete pole figure from 0-90&deg; with respect to the surface normal.  The high-resolution optics allow for a range of optics on the incident side including conventional slits, 2-bounce monochromators, or 4-bounce monochromators.  An additional 2-bounce monochromator can also be installed on the receiving (detector) side to obtain maximum resolution.  The ability to easily switch between a selection of monochromator options is vital for a multi-user system where each project has different objectives and requirements for the trade-off between high intensity and high-resolution data.  The high-speed detector expands functionality to materials with low diffraction intensities as well as provides for faster data acquisition during time-consuming measurements such as pole figures.  The system came with a full and educational version of the International Centre for Diffraction Data (ICDD) database that allows for phase identification.  Also included was data acquisition software and a suite of analysis software packages that will provide for: 1) crystal structure determination; 2) phase identification; 3) reference intensity ratio (RIR) quantitative analysis; 4) crystal size determination; 5) residual stress analysis; 6) reciprocal space map and pole figure generation; 7) rocking curve analysis and simulation; and 8) XRR fitting for density, thickness, and roughness extraction (Parrat?s equation).\n\nThe new SmartLab XRD equipment is located in the Natural Science and Engineering Research Laboratory at the University of Texas at Dallas in the diffraction laboratory (Room 3.502), specifically designed for X-ray diffraction, and containing the required radiation safety equipment including Geiger counters and radiation dosimeters.  The new instrument was made part of the Nano Characterization facility which is managed by co-PI Professor Moon Kim. The daily operation of the SmartLab diffractometer is supervised by Dr. Jinguo Wang who is the associate director of the Nano Characterization Facility at UT-Dallas.  In this capacity, Dr. Wang has overseen the operations and maintenance of a range of microscopy and diffraction tools in use at UTD.  The system was delivered the week of January 15, 2016 with lab fit-out, system installation, system testing, and training all overseen by Dr. Jinguo Wang. On June 1, 2016 the tool was officially opened to the entire user base.  The new instrument has enabled greater XRD research activities at the university.  The user base for the facility is now at 75 regular users, up a remarkable 56% from before the acquisition of the new tool.  Students and postdocs from the following departments are all regular users of the new tool:  Materials Science and Engineering, Chemistry, Physics, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and BioEngineering. ).  The new tool has already led to external research funding from the US Department of Defense and the semiconductor industry. (https://engineering.utdallas.edu/news/archive/2016-summer/nsf-award-enables-new-research-capabilities\n\n  \n\nAn XRD training school that is run by Rigaku is now available to all new users.  This class has a value of $2,500 per user, is held approximately ten times per year, and is available free of charge to any new user for the entire lifetime of the tool.  The Diffraction Science advanced graduate course (MSEN 6362) is currently available tograduate students every year and includes both a classroom based overview of X-ray diffraction theory as well as laboratory based instruction in basic data acquisition and analysis (Co-PI Kim).  The new user friendly SmartLab diffractometer has allowed for the expansion of course content to include data acquisition/analysis of pole figures, reciprocal space maps,, and rocking curves.  This expansion will be of substantial educational benefit to the students as it will allow them to learn advanced diffraction techniques that are widely used in both research and industry and will therefore better prepare them for careers in a range of fields. \n\nThe MSEN department recently established an interdisciplinary Minor in Nanotechnology, which creates an avenue for undergraduate students in all relevant disciplines to familiarize themselves with the concepts and principles of nanotechnology.  This minor has been designed around three core courses: with live demonstrations of some thin film deposition and characterization techniques.  The acquisition of the new diffraction tool will allow undergraduates to learn about advanced structural analysis techniques and will permit projects for Undergraduate Research in Nanotechnology. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher Hinkle"
