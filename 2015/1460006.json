 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1\r\nThis IRES: US-Germany Collaborative Research program at the University of Southern California (USC) prepares both graduate and undergraduate students, particularly underrepresented students, for global research with a focus on the relationship between materials processing and properties at the nanoscale. Overall, fifteen (6 PhD and 9 undergraduate) students will participate in the program over a 3-year period. The students will also participate in the dissemination of the program, which is expected to reach a wide number of US and German students. This IRES: US-Germany Collaborative Research program will enhance the skills of current graduate students who are already working in a materials related field and will give them access to the latest tools and technologies available in the world.   For the undergraduate students, this program will be one of their first exposures to materials science and will enhance their skills as engineering students.  Furthermore, it will allow them to develop critical problem-solving skills in their respective fields since almost all engineering problems involve materials-related issues.  Overall, the participating students will have the opportunity to experience first-hand an elite international research center with a strong connection to industrial applications.    \r\n\r\n Part 2\r\nThe search for advanced engineering materials with excellent mechanical properties and mechanical and thermal stability, remains a goal of current materials research.  Nanostructured metals are a particularly promising example, as these materials exhibit extremely high strength even though stability and ductility have hindered their potential.  The program's research theme is novel fabrication techniques for enhanced properties of nanostructured materials. This theme is strengthened by collaboration with two elite nanostructure scientists, Profs. Horst Hahn and Oliver Kraft at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), who will serve as hosts and technical mentors to the participating students.",
