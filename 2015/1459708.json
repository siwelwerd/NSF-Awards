 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water clarity in coastal and estuarine systems impacts ecosystem dynamics, influences essential habitat for key life stages of many species, and is also valuable for aesthetics and recreation. In Chesapeake Bay, water clarity has seemed particularly unresponsive to management practices, and has continued to decline over recent decades. Paradoxically, clarity has decreased more in areas with relatively low concentrations of inorganic sediment than in locations where riverine sediment loads have increased. Here it is proposed that the apparent disconnect between water clarity and input of sediment in the Chesapeake Bay and many other estuaries is related to the interaction of common estuarine flow patterns with the presence of excess organic matter. Through improved observation, modeling, and analysis of the interaction of estuarine physics with suspended organic matter and inorganic sediment, this study aims to transform understanding of the controls on water clarity in estuaries.  States in the Chesapeake Bay watershed will invest billions of dollars over the next decade to further reduce runoff of nutrients and sediment. In the future, analogous investments may be required for estuarine watersheds nationwide. By evaluating how estuarine physics, organics, and sediment interact to influence water clarity, this study will provide valuable guidance on effectively investing these funds.  This project will fund two PhD students on societally-relevant dissertation projects and provide engaging projects for undergraduate researchers. \r\n\r\nIn many coastal settings, the interactions that determine water clarity are sensitive to particle concentration, size, density, composition, organic content, and settling velocity, yet few studies have explicitly considered how these connect to generalized estuarine turbulence and circulation patterns. The main objective of the study is to better understand the interaction of small and large scale estuarine physics with mixtures of inorganic sediment and organic matter typical of partially-mixed systems. Novel field observations and numerical models will be developed to test these ideas and focus on the York River estuary, a logistically attractive, broadly representative, partially-mixed branch of the Chesapeake Bay. Field observations will characterize physical oceanography (circulation, stratification, and turbulence), as well as particle populations (including size distribution, concentration, density, settling velocity and organic constituents). Open-source, community-supported numerical models will be implemented to further investigate feedbacks between estuarine hydrodynamics, organic content, and sediment dynamics, incorporating multiple particle sizes and densities, and new formulations for composition-dependent flocculation, as well as state-of-the-art formulations for cohesive bed behavior. This work will test the following novel hypotheses: (H1): Addition of organic material further enhances the horizontal and vertical particle sorting that characteristic to the physics of partially-mixed estuaries. (H2): Organic matter added to low concentrations of inorganic solids results in relatively small, low density flocs having slow settling velocities (Type 1 flocs). Conversely, adding organic matter to high concentrations of inorganic flocs favors larger, higher density flocs, with increased settling velocity (Type 2 flocs). (H3): Organic rich flocs (Type 1) are especially effective at attenuating sunlight because they are suspended high in the water column and have a large cross-sectional area per unit mass. The end result of interactions with estuarine physics is that the addition of organic matter to the estuary degrades water clarity in the lower estuary and improves water clarity in the upper estuary, closer to the estuarine turbidity maximum.",

Population has been growing rapidly in the Bay's watershed, with immigration into the watershed increasing the population by nearly 10% over the past decade alone. The states and localities within the Bay's watershed have committed to investing $10s of billions over the next decades in an effort to reverse dramatic declines in water quality seen in the Bay since the middle of the last century. &nbsp;An important component of water quality is whether the water is clear; but both organic matter (like algae) or muds can cause the water to be cloudy. Also, mud can be packaged as small particles, or in large clumps called <em>flocs</em>, depending on how much organic matter is in the water or how fast the water is flowing, among other things. This makes it difficult to predict how much mud will be in the natural waters, especially organic rich estuaries like Chesapeake Bay. Therefore, to understand how well our efforts aimed at improving water quality are working; we need to understand the ways that organic matter and muds interact.</p>\n<p>This project used state of the art observational methods and computer models to study the role of organic matter in the size and transport of flocs within the York River, Virginia (Figure 1). The York River is a tributary to Chesapeake Bay; and provides an accessible natural laboratory as our campus is located along its shores.</p>\n<p>Using novel instrumentation (the PICS camera and platform, Figure 2), researchers were able to measure the size and fall velocity (how fast a particle settles), and thereby estimate the density of flocs.&nbsp; Combined with measurements of organic content, and turbulence from the PICS platform, researchers concluded that flocs in the York River tend to be larger when the organic content was low, and that flocs tend to be less dense as they grow larger (Figure 3). These observations were the first in situ measurements of floc size and density for a Chesapeake Bay System.</p>\n<p>Numerical models have been developed to represent both floc behavior and water quality for Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.&nbsp; However, until measurements from this project were available, the models relied on rough estimates of floc behavior.&nbsp; For this project, a numerical model was developed that used the measured floc properties to evaluate how muds will be transported in an idealized estuary configured to be like the York River (Figure 4). The exercise concluded that flocculation processes are most important in the most turbid parts of the York River, and that only the smallest particles will be carried high enough in the water column to impact light attenuation.</p>\n<p>For the third component of the research, insights into how muds and organic matter are transported in the bay were incorporated into a numerical model of water quality for Chesapeake Bay. The study specifically examined the way that shoreline hardening has reduced sediment input into the Bay, while water quality measures have reduced nutrient input. Results indicated that these have had the effect of overall improving water quality within the upper Chesapeake Bay, though it has shifted the area of degraded water clarity southward. For example, the reduced sediment input has led to better water clarity in terms of light scattering (K<sub>d</sub><sup>-1</sup>), but worse turbidity in terms of secchi depth (Z<sub>D</sub>), creating what has been called an <em>organic fog zone</em> (Figure 5).</p>\n<p>In addition to the scientific advances described above, the researchers involved in this project have had major influences on both their larger scientific communities, and the management bodies responsible for overseeing water quality in Chesapeake Bay.&nbsp; The researchers published eight peer-reviewed scientific papers, and gave more than sixty scientific presentations including prestigious invited talks and keynote addresses. The lead investigator Carl Friedrichs provided expertise to the better understanding and restoration of Chesapeake Bay water clarity through his positions on the EPA/NOAA Chesapeake Bay Program's (i) Integrated Trends Analysis Team, (ii) Integrated Monitoring Networks Workgroup, and (iii) Modeling Workgroup; and contributed both talks and reports to those groups that summarized the research findings and applied them to management of Chesapeake Bay water quality.</p>\n<p>This project allowed for research training of three graduates students, who have now all earned their PhD and taken research positions.
