 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the STEM workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations to successfully complete high quality degree programs in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines.  The LSAMP Bridge to the Doctorate (LSAMP-BD) activity provides two-year support at the post baccalaureate level for students from historically underrepresented minority populations to matriculate in STEM graduate programs with the ultimate goal of earning a doctoral degree in a STEM discipline.  Participants are selected from LSAMP institutions nationwide. The Florida-Georgia Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (Florida-Georgia LSAMP), under the leadership of Florida A & M University, a Historically Black College/University (HBCU), has chosen Florida International University (FIU), a Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) as the host for the 2015-2017 BD program in which a cohort of twelve LSAMP BD students will engage in STEM research, academics and professional development leading to completion of the STEM terminal degree.  The programs promote systemic change in graduate education practices and policy in ways that increase the success of individual students on the doctoral pathway and the effectiveness of STEM graduate programs continuing the goal of diversifying America's STEM workforce.\r\n\r\nTwelve cohorts of students have matriculated in the Florida-Georgia LSAMP BD programs at the following sites:  Florida State University, University of South Florida, University of Florida and Florida International University since 2003. For the 2015-2017 cohorts, the host of the Florida-Georgia LSAMP BD program will be Florida International University. The program includes collaborations and linkages with other STEM networks and resources as well as other graduate programs, such as NSF's Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP) and other regional LSAMP-supported graduate education programs.  The BD program at FIU provides a comprehensive set of support services that monitors student progress, builds a strong BD community, and increases BD students' academic and professional skills. Institutional resources are committed to ensure participants' successful completion of the STEM doctoral degree. This BD program will be externally evaluated and students will be tracked throughout its duration and into STEM careers following completion of STEM doctoral degree programs.",
