 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanism Program is supporting Professor Anna Gudmundsdottir at the University of Cincinnati to investigate the solid-state photochemistry and photophysics of naphthoquinones and vinyl azides,  using a combination of laser flash photolysis and x-ray crystallography. The goal of this research is to elucidate solid-state reaction mechanisms and to explain how a crystal lattice structure can affect reactivity. Professor Gudmundsdottir will integrate the research components of this project with an educational program designed to attract both high school and undergraduate students, with a focus on enhancing participation of students from groups that are underrepresented in science. Students will be provided with an opportunity to participate in research and educational activities that focus on professional development. The proposed research and the developmental teaching will lead to enhanced infrastructure within the Chemistry Department at the University of Cincinnati and serve as an outreach program for other schools in the region.  \r\n\r\nThis research will investigate the solid-state photoreactivity of naphthoquinones and vinyl azides by identifying their photoproducts and acquiring their  X-ray structures. Laser flash photolysis will be used to characterize the transient excited states and radicals which are formed in the crystals and to determine the kinetics for their formation and decay. Collectively, these data will make it possible to elucidate detailed solid-state reaction mechanisms and to explain how the crystal lattice affects behavior of transient species and selection of the reaction products. Mechanistic studies will be supported by theoretical calculations. The planed studies, will lead to new knowledge in the field of photochemistry, reactive intermediates and solid-state chemistry. The proposed research will also contribute toward the  design of crystal lattices for selective carbon-carbon and carbon-nitrogen bond formation from radicals, with a goal of using crystals as a matrix for solvent-free synthesis. Simultaneously, this research will contribute to the design of photoresponsive devices, such as solar cells and light emitting diodes.",

Our studies yielded a new understanding of the reactivity of vinyl azides and revealed that they can be used for the selective formation of triplet vinylnitrene intermediates. The physical properties of the vinylnitrene intermediates were determined using infrared (IR), ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The triplet vinylnitrenes have significant 1,3-biradical character, which makes rotation around the vinyl bond feasible. We theorized that this flexibility enhances their intersystem crossing to form products in solution, cryogenic matrices, and in the solid state. However, triplet vinylnitrenes incorporated into cyclic structures are more stable and can be detected directly at temperatures below 100 K. The inclusion of triplet vinylnitrenes in five-membered ring systems provided the vinylnitrenes with sufficient stability to dimerize at ambient temperature rather than decaying to form unimolecular products through intersystem crossing. Thus, triplet vinylnitrene intermediates have potential use in synthetic applications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we demonstrated that the photoreactivity of several azido alkyl derivatives in solution and the solid state yields different photoproducts. By comparing the laser flash photolysis of these derivatives in nanocrystals to that in solution, it was possible to clarify the different phase-dependent reaction mechanisms. Such an improved understanding of the solid-state reaction mechanisms will without doubt lead to the development of solid-state reactions as a tool for sustainable synthesis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This grant made it possible to further build the infrastructure of the laser laboratory in the chemistry department, thus providing state-of-the-art instrumentation for the scientists who worked on this project among others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This project enabled the training of a diverse group of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students to become proficient experimental scientists.
