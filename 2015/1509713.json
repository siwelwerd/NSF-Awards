This interdisciplinary project involves the development of a microfluidic device and man-made peptide-based biosensors to specifically identify distinct sub-populations of cancer cells found in a tumor, including those that are resistant to particular chemotherapy drugs. Ultimately, the goal of this proposal is to develop a new diagnostic tool that can lead to a personalized treatment protocol for high risk myeloma patients, dramatically increasing the prognosis of individuals battling cancer.\r\n\r\nMolecularly-targeted therapeutics and personalized medicine have dramatically increased the prognosis of patients suffering from cancer. In the case of multiple myeloma, there has been great success using drugs that specifically target enzymes associated with the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS). Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) are one such class of enzyme due to their ability to promote drug resistance in multiple myeloma patients.  In this proposal, an interdisciplinary approach will be applied to develop a new method to directly measure DUB activity in intact single cells across a heterogeneous population such as tumor biopsy. A long-lived, cell permeable, DUB-specific fluorescent reporter will be developed to directly measure DUB activity. One hallmark of this peptide-based reporter is the inclusion of a \u00e2-hairpin ?protectide?, serving to both confer stability onto the DUB-specific substrate, and to act as a potent cell penetrating peptide (CPP). This novel reporting scheme will be incorporated into a microfluidic droplet array that will be developed to facilitate high-throughput screening (HTS) of a population of myeloma cells.  The microfluidic droplet array designed in this proposal will allow for on-chip encapsulation followed by real-time quantification of DUB activity in intact single cells. The biochemical assay will serve as a first step in developing a new technique allowing to 1) determine if patients would benefit from a DUB-targeted therapy, 2) identify an ideal dose of drug to maximize efficacy while minimizing side effects, and 3) analyze a heterogeneous sample to identify distinct subpopulations of drug-resistant cells, which cannot be performed using bulk measurement.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).",

Thus, there is a critical need for new approaches to interrogating drug efficacy and identifying diagnostic approaches. This award was responsible for developing a new set of bioanalytical tools to produce a measurable/detectable fluorescent signal in intact cancer cells that directly correlates to enzyme activity. The first major outcome was the synthesis of a library of peptides (the building blocks of proteins) that could gain entry into intact cells. This was an important step to interrogate the cells without altering them. The second major outcome was the synthesis and characterization of a novel biosensor to directly measure deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) activity in intact cells. DUBs have been associated with a number of cancers, including multiple myeloma (which effects 1 in 143 Americans). This type of biosensor is the first of its kind and was used to identify how a population of cells responds differently to drugs which can explain why cancer patients also respond differently to treatments. The third major outcome was microfluidic device which allowed for the high-throughput analysis of intact cells to measure either peptide uptake or intracellular enzyme activity. Using this device, we observed the aforementioned heterogeneity which can provide new insight into how a population of cancer cells responds to drugs or other forms of interrogation. The fourth major outcome was an open source software called FluoroCellTrack which can be used to measure enzyme activity in intact cells using our microtechnology. It decreased the analysis time from ~20 hours to 30 minutes. The fifth major outcome was the development of an outreach day for middle school students in the Baton Rouge area to engage, educate, and excite them about bioengineering. Called ENGage LSU, the outreach day has been performed 3 times from 2017-2019 with an enrollment of ~70-80% of students from traditionally underrepresented minorities in STEM.
