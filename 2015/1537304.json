 "awd_abstract_narration": "The aim of this study is to assess uncertainties in climate predictions due to intrinsic ocean variability, as well as explore modes of ocean variability that may feedback on the atmosphere. The analyses that will be conducted are essential for advancing our understanding of climate predictability, and for clarifying what forms of ocean dynamics coupled climate models must accurately capture to address the questions of decadal-scale climate variability. The findings will be disseminated in publications and in various meetings, workshops, summer schools as well as via the internet. International connections between Florida State University and European scientists will be strengthened. The project will support a young researcher and a graduate student. The investigators will also work with existing outreach and education programs at the University and state level to support K-12 science teachers with materials that assist them in teaching to the Florida Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics standards.\r\n\r\nThe broad objective of this study is to dissect North Atlantic variability in the 1-to-10 year range with respect to its dynamics and origins.  This variability will be simulated using a high-resolution ocean general circulation model of the North Atlantic and analyzed to categorize the variability as forced or intrinsic, and local or remote in origin. The contributions of these various kinds of variability to well-known observational indices, like the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, will be estimated. This analysis using novel methods that emphasize potential vorticity diagnostics, ensemble averaging and data reduction, will provide quantitative information on the contribution of intrinsic variability to such critical measures of the ocean climate as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation and the mass transport of the Gulf Stream. The dynamics supporting the intrinsic variability will be diagnosed, and the projection of subsurface variability onto the surface, where the bulk of ocean observations are currently obtained, will be computed. Additionally, the extent to which remote mesoscale dynamics influence North Atlantic variability will be assessed; doing so will help understand the behavior of planned classes of eddy-permitting Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe ocean is a messy place, meaning that it is ?turbulent?, and much more like coffee into which cream has been stirred than ?laminar?, like syrup being poured over pancakes.  This means much of what we see the ocean do is ?unpredictable?.  This is known in weather forecasting as the ?Butterfly Effect?, and is why weather forecasts do not go beyond 10 days or so.  But even if the ocean is largely unpredictable, it still exhibits patterns, and we can understand how much it varies and where the ocean variability is the strongest.  Our research has been directed at understanding this ocean ?chaos?.  The value of this is that the oceanographic community has for several years now been watching the ?Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation? (AMOC), which is the Atlantic expression of a global circulation that moves warm waters northward through the Atlantic.  This warm water off the coast of Massachusetts and over to the European continent warms the atmosphere and thereby affects global climate.  In fact, this area of atmospheric warming is the most important warming area on the entire planet.  What we find is that about 50% of the AMOC variability is of the unpredictable type, which has important implications for how we interpret our AMOC measurements in terms of human impact on the climate.  We also find that much of this ocean chaos varies on time scales of one to ten years.  The good news here is that since the ocean is so sluggish, knowing the ocean state at any one time can lead to assessments on time scales of up to 10 years about how the North Atlantic warming of the atmosphere will proceed.  Although the proper methods for doing this are not yet known, we anticipate some degree of climate predictability on these same time scales to emerge.  \n\n \n\nWe have also considered how the ocean sorts out its energy budget.  Atmospheric winds blow broadly over the ocean, thereby providing it with its primary source of energy.  The ocean responds by developing a large scale gyre, the eastern most part of which is the Gulf Stream.   The ocean is roughly in steady state, meaning that averaged over about ten years, it more or less looks the same.  So a fundamental question about the ocean circulation is how does it get rid of the energy that it recieves from the atmosphere.  After all, at steady state, ?energy in? must equal ?energy out?.  The traditional idea is that everywhere in the gyre, the large scale ocean feeds energy to the ocean chaos, which thereby acts as a globally distributed sink of energy.  We find that this picture is in need of refinement.  In particular, our studies show the eddies and chaos occurring in the ocean interior are pretty weak, and so do not represent much of a sink of ocean energy.  Instead, the Gulf Stream, once it has detached from the Eastern US and moves into the interior North Atlantic, is where the eddies become strong enough to drain the energy from the large scale.  This is important because the Gulf Stream is the most important component of the northward flow of warm water in the AMOC, and all that Gulf Stream chaos is likely to affect how the atmosphere is heated by the Gulf Stream.  This has implications for the variability of global climate.  \n\n \n\nOur studies have mostly been conducted on the large computer facilities maintained by the National Science Foundation, and underscore the importance of this infrastructure to the national scientific endeavor.  In addition, we have combined these large computer studies with pen and ink thinking, demonstrating the importance of human innovation and technology in the advancement of our understanding of the planet.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William K Dewar"
