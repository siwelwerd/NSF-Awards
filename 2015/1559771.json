 "awd_abstract_narration": "Developing enzymes that can catalyze efficient conversion of plant cell wall material (lignocellulose) to fermentable sugars or high-value chemical building blocks is an important goal of many industrial enzyme companies. However, the current enzymes being used for plant cell wall degradation are active under a limited set of conditions; they can't, for example, deal with very acidic or basic conditions. This research project seeks to identify industrial enzymes that can be used to break down hard-to-degrade materials such as plant cell walls. Such enzymes are useful in producing energy and in remediating pollution. This project seeks to find new enzymes that are active in diverse conditions and, as such, maximally useful. The use of these improved enzymes would allow industrial processes to be cheaper, higher volume and more efficient. \r\n\r\nThis research will result in a proof-of-concept, specifically the production of at least one commercially relevant enzyme from the microbiome of household insects. The project will also result in providing the basis for at least two types of patents: 1) process of isolating lignocellulosic enzymes from camel crickets and dermestid beetles and 2) the application of recombinant enzymes identified in the course this project. The I-Corps program will enable the team to seek out industrial partnerships to customize the proposed research to the needs and interests of the industrial partners. In performing the research goals outlined in this proposal, the team will foremost have the opportunity to mature the development of an isolation and screening platform designed to identify microorganisms and enzymes from household insect microbiomes that have utility for biotechnological/industrial applications and to form relationships with target technology companies. In addition the proposed research could also answer several questions about the ecology of the household insects, their microbiota, and the enzymes used by these insects to degrade and digest permanent household materials.",
