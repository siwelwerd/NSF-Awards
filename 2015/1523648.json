 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding how indigenous people employed management practices to increase the diversity and productivity of plants and animals is an important issue for researchers, tribes, and stewards of public land.  Human induced or \"anthropogenic\" burning was one of the most effective tools indigenous people used to enhance the vigor and health of plant and animal communities at the landscape scale.  By igniting frequent, low-intensity fires, indigenous groups were able to create patchworks of biotic communities at different stages of succession, which in some cases maintained higher than natural levels of heterogeneity and biodiversity.  Archaeology offers the necessary long-term perspective for examining how people used fire to enhance landscape productivity at local and regional scales and for evaluating the outcomes of these practices over many centuries.  This project employs an innovative eco-archaeological approach to address how the landscape burning practices of ancient and historic hunter-gatherer societies in California may have augmented the yields, biodiversity, and sustainability of local ecosystems. The research will provide new information that can be used to improve stewardship of open spaces, enhance the biodiversity and the vitality of local habitats, mediate the effects of massive firestorms in the face of global warming, and educate students and members of the public about traditional land use practices of indigenous people.\r\n\r\nThe project examines the timing, evolution, and scale of anthropogenic burning using a methodology that brings together multiple types of evidence to reconstruct ancient vegetation conditions and to understand how humans used biological resources and modified landscape biota over the last several thousand years. To explore these topics, researchers will synthesize  new data from the analysis of microscopic plant remains from soils and archaeological sites;  artifacts, faunal remains, and charred macroscopic plant remains from dated archaeological contexts; along with previously published data on fire ecology, paleo-ecology, ethnohistory, vegetation history, and climate. Investigators will also develop novel ways to integrate cutting-edge genetic research into the study of long-term management practices through ancient DNA and phylogeographic research on biotic resources used by humans. Long-term patterns in the cultural practices of hunter-gatherer groups will be evaluated in two study areas along the central California coast - Point Reyes National Seashore and A\u00f1o Nuevo State Park. Researchers include archaeologists, environmental scientists, and geneticists from the University of California at Berkeley and Santa Cruz.  They will work in close collaboration with native scholars from the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band and the Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria, along with land stewards and archaeologists from the National Park Service and California State Parks. The project will contribute to the current management of public lands in California by providing long-term data on historical ecological processes that will guide stewardship decisions by land managers; deliver relevant information to tribal partners who are re-instituting traditional management practices as part of their on-going cultural revitalization efforts; and create and enhance educational and training opportunities for both students and tribal scholars.",

The research team is exploring how deeply rooted indigenous practices can contribute to the development of better ways to reduce wildfire risk and increase biodiversity of open spaces and public lands. The research team is comprised of scientists from the University of California campuses at Berkeley and Santa Cruz, working closely with archaeologists and ecologists from California State Parks and scholars and elders from the Amah Mutsun Tribal Band and Federated Indians of Graton Rancheria.</p>\n<p>Findings derived from the investigation of archaeological materials (tools, plant remains, and animal specimens), phytolith research, and on-going genetic studies demonstrate that people strategically used fire to create and maintain open coastal prairies. Native Californians employed small, low temperature burns at regular intervals to create environmental mosaics that enhanced the diversity, quantity, and predictability of plant and animal resources that they used for foods, medicines, and raw materials. Sustaining grassland communities along the Central California coast required a sub-decadal fire return interval with fires probably set every one to five years. The research also amassed information about cultural practices in and around shorelines affecting intertidal and wetland resources. While we do not yet know when people first initiated sustained cultural burning, the current findings indicate a correlation existed between landscape management practices and the intensive use of the nearby seascape from 800-1400 CE. The creation of grassland habitats, the mass harvesting of small-bodied fish, and possible enhancement of shellfish beds appears to be part of a broader process of resource intensification that involved people working harder to obtain more food and other resources from their territories. The study suggests that climate change may not have been the primary factor in why people intensified the use and modification of resources from the land and sea, but that other social, political, and demographic factors were also involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The NSF project provides new insights for improving the management of public lands, for enhancing the biodiversity and the vitality of local habitats, and for mediating the effects of massive firestorms in the face of global warming. There is growing recognition that current approaches for managing wildlands in California are not sustainable. Decades of fire suppression have produced an accumulation of woody fuels that are helping to feed an increasing number of catastrophic firestorms that have left in their path death, financial destruction, and hundreds of thousands of hectares of burned land. The research team is addressing this problem by working with the Amah Mutsun Land Trust to explore the benefits of employing indigenous stewardship practices in active management of selected public lands along the Central California coast. This work involves the reopening of the landscape by thinning woody fuels, removing some exotic flora, tending stands of ceremonial plants, stewarding patches of coastal grasslands, and restoring native plants whose populations have been reduced since Euro-American colonization.</p>\n<p>We recognize that given the regulatory restrictions on prescribed burning and the labor costs involved, it will be challenging to employ indigenous-based land stewardship approaches over extensive areas.&nbsp; However, from a regional open space management perspective, prescribed burning may be used to strategically establish and maintain fuel break corridors bounding large wilderness areas. These low fuel load zones may serve to 1) enhance the quantity and diversity of indigenous plants and animals, 2) provide places where tribal members can harvest traditional foods, medicines and raw materials as part of the revitalization of their tribal cultural practices, and 3) minimize the spread of catastrophic wildfires that are afflicting California.</p>\n<p>The NSF project exposed a number of tribal members and undergraduate college students from low income, first-generation, and/or underrepresented backgrounds to the methods of scientific research.
