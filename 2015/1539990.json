 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will help create a new I/UCRC Site at University of Mississippi (UM) to join an existing IUCRC called BWAC (Broadband Wireless access and Applications Center) led by University of Arizona which started in July 2013. The UM site extends the scope of BWAC in the areas of computational electromagnetics (EM), antenna design and testing, and telecommunications. This Site will add two of the largest industries in the wireless space, Qualcomm and Intel, to the BWAC Industrial Advisory Board. The BWAC site will help recruit diverse and promising undergraduate and graduate students into electrical engineering undergraduate and graduate programs at UM. By engaging them directly in research on problems of actual interest to corporate partners, BWAC will help prepare these students to compete and be productive in corporate jobs the day they graduate.\r\n\r\nThis project will bring to bear UM research capabilities and real-world industry interest in areas that align with the focus of BWAC. The UM faculty have identified potential industry-oriented research in the areas of metamaterials for antenna cloaking, mmWave antennas, wireless signaling from embedded sensors for concussion management in college athletic sports, fountain codes for big data transfers, cognitive radios and radar systems. Other possible applications areas include, wireless connectivity for improved efficiency in factory, new wireless security algorithms, applications of wireless sensor networks, and telemedicine.",
