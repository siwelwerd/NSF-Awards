However, in the U.S., these systems are under continuous aging and deterioration hindering their ability to properly function. Changing Climate may exacerbate this functionality problem. For the proper performance assessment of structural systems during their life-cycle, it is necessary to take into account not only functionality but also economic, social and environmental indicators. Therefore, formulating methodologies to quantify the effects of changing climate on infrastructure vulnerability and to identify optimal life-cycle management strategies for civil infrastructure considering risk and sustainability is of paramount importance. This project pursues fundamental research to provide needed knowledge for the development of an integrated risk and sustainability informed decision making framework for optimum life-cycle management of civil infrastructure systems.

The outputs of this framework are the risk and sustainability based performance profiles and the optimized life-cycle intervention strategies taking into account conflicting budgetary and safety constraints.
