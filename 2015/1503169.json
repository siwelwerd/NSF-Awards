The Fourteenth International\r\nConference on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 2015) will be held in Istanbul,\r\nTurkey, May 4-8, 2015. AAMAS is the premier conference devoted to all aspects of research and application of agent technology, a key area of research with applications to the success of the WWW, electronic\r\ncommerce, digital libraries, robotics, personal agents, and virtual humans. All students\r\nawarded travel funding will participate in a Doctoral Mentoring Consortium in which they will\r\npresent their research to other student researchers and receive in-depth feedback from a group\r\nof senior researchers. Students will also attend the conference, which has a rich technical\r\nprogram complemented with an array of workshops, tutorials and other events. The wide variety\r\nand significance of the topics typically presented at AAMAS, in both the technical program\r\nand the workshop program, provides opportunities for students to share, exchange and learn\r\nfrom the best in the field.",

The selected students had a high level of participation in the AAMAS program (e.g., were an author on a paper accepted for oral presentation).\n\nAttending the conference gives the participants a better grasp of their  field. AAMAS is the premier international conference in the area of multiagent systems.  Technologies, methods, and theories of agents and multiagent systems contribute to many diverse domains such as information retrieval, user interfaces, electronic commerce, robotics, computer games, education and training, ubiquitous computing, and social simulation.  The doctoral mentoring program prepares students for making the transition from student to independent researcher.  Participation in these programs motivates students to continue on their research journey, by connecting them with multi-agent researchers from all over the world.\n\n \nAt the doctoral mentoring symposium, the students participated in the following activities: \n1) a career interview session with researchers Gal Kaminka (Bar Ilan University) and Kate Larson (University of Waterloo) who spoke about the process of transitioning from student to senior researcher and answered candid questions from the students.\n2) student presentations (11).
