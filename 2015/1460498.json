 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project seeks to provide a clearer understanding of the relationship between non-volcanic tremor (a recently discovered seismic phenomenon) and earthquakes within the San Andreas Fault System.  Along the San Andreas Fault, tremor has been studied in only a few locations near Parkfield, California and for a limited time period.  This has effectively limited the association of tremor to only one larger earthquake--the 2004 Parkfield magnitude 6 event.  Notable changes in the rate and migration pattern of tremor leading up to this earthquake were observed, however, this single example is insufficient for establishing precursory tremor as a general phenomena leading up to larger events. This project will significantly expand the geographic and temporal base of tremor observations and will allow for a greater number of associations between tremor and larger earthquakes to be studied.  Included in the project are detailed analyses of these associations with the aim of establishing a more robust understanding of the relationship between tremor and earthquakes. The project will also search for and characterize tremor on a greater diversity of faults within the San Andreas fault system, which will provide additional constraints on ?transform system? tremor for comparisons with subduction zone tremor. The project?s analyses of the special properties of tremor (i.e., greater depths, sensitivity to small stress change, correlation with deformation rates, and associations with deep fault fluids and stressing from earth-tides and distant large earthquakes) will also impact other fields of study by providing information on the genesis of tremor, the relationship of tremor with deep faulting, on earth-structure, deep earth properties, and on active tectonic processes.  The project includes significant student participation (both graduate and undergraduate) that will support their training and research experience in science and technology, and it increases partnerships with international institutions and participation of early-career and underrepresented groups through collaboration with female early-career geophysicist Aurelie Guilhem (CEA/DAM/DIF, France) and early-career professor Haijiang Zhang (University of Science and Technology, China). \r\n\r\nDetections of ambient tremor events in northern California have relied primarily on sensitive borehole recordings of continuous seismic observations from the local-scale High Resolution Seismic Network (HRSN) at Parkfield, CA. This has resulted in a parochial view of tremor on California faults. Additional observations of tremor on a broader array of fault-systems and in association with a greater number of larger earthquakes are needed to accurately characterize the process of tremor in California, to accurately compare transform fault and subduction zone tremor, and to more clearly understand the relationship of tremor to larger earthquakes. The objective of this project is to expand the geographic and temporal scope of tremor observation and to analyze the expanded dataset in terms of tremors? relationships to a greater number of fault systems and their structures, process, inferred composition, and stress-change through time.  This will be done through a comprehensive and systematic search for ambient and triggered tremor throughout much of northern California going back to the mid-1990s using, primarily, a recently available dataset of continuous seismic records from the regional USGS Northern California Seismic Network (NCSN). Continuous records from other networks in the region will also be analyzed. Envelope cross-correlation and percentile stacking methods will be used to deal with the lower sensitivity of the surface NCSN stations. Corresponding high-resolution LFE catalogs will also be developed when possible using waveform stacking and pattern match scanning techniques. Proven methods for inferring mechanics and process in the tremor-genic fault zones will be employed, and velocity and attenuation tomography using tremor sources and station-pair double-differencing methods will be performed to improve tremor locations and to enhance understanding of deep fault properties and structure.",

Award Number: 1460498 The goal of this project has been to undertake a comprehensive search for ambient tremor within the northern SAF system; to characterize the tremors? spatial, temporal and size properties, and to gain new insights into the process of tremor and its relationship to faults, earthquakes and stress/strain change. EXPLOSION in DATA: The tremor phenomena provides a wealth of new information on the inner workings of deep fault zones and their relationship to large earthquakes. Their favorable attributes have changed traditional paradigms on data collection, and an explosion in available digital seismic data has ensued. As part of a \"Big-Data\" effort to characterize the spatial and temporal distribution of ambient tremor throughout the Northern San Andreas Fault system, continuous seismic data from multiple seismic networks with contrasting operational characteristics and distributed over a variety of regions are being used. A shift in philosophy from saving only earthquake triggered snippets to digitally archiving all continuous data occurred as the new phenomena were being discovered. Continuous data saved on tape was also retrieved and made available on-line. DATA CHALLENGES: A myriad of masquerading noise, anthropogenic and natural-event signals must also be discriminated in order to characterize tremor accurately. These Data-science challenges and others that we have endeavored to overcome include: Large volume of data Large geographic region Heterogeneous data coverage Inconsistent meta-data Noisy and time-variable seismic time-series Development of reproducible and replicable data-science methods and code. Accomplishments: We have shown that data mining of archived seismic data for detecting, locating, and monitoring tremor extending as far back as late 1993 is entirely feasible. Our work has helped lay the groundwork for future research targeting specific zones of tremor for more detailed analyses and for studies using different analysis (e.g. array deployments and methods and/or LFE analyses). And our work has also established a basis for future development of a near-real-time monitoring capability for SAF system tremor. NEW NOVEL METHODS: Automated Meta-data Search, Assesment, and selection (pre-waveform) Automated work-arounds to address confounding Noise-types (e.g., Earthquakes, spikes, multi-station common mode noise, glitches, jogs, Gaps and Dead channels) (Fig.Noise, Detections and FDB filtering) Adaptive station-channel selection series: PDC, BDC, IDC, TIDC, FDC Cross-correlation rather than amplitude detection: Hits-O-Gram Detections: Detection-Duration Catalogs Amplitude-Transform-Stacks ?
