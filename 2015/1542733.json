 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nighttime thunderstorms with heavy rainfall pose a threat to lives and property in the central United States and are a difficult forecasting challenge.  A field campaign is planned during the summer of 2015 to study how these thunderstorm complexes form and maintain themselves.  This award will augment that campaign by providing observations from an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) platform.  The UASs will fly in targeted locations near a frontal boundary and in the vicinity of thunderstorms, making measurements that will be input into a computer model.  The overall goal of the project is to improve understanding and forecasting of these hazardous events.  In addition, the project will contribute to scientific workforce development through the education and training of a graduate and undergraduate student and the involvement of a number of other students in the field work.\r\n\r\nThe Program for Research on Elevated Convection with Intense Precipitation is an ongoing project with a goal of characterizing the processes responsible for creating environments conducive to the development and maintenance of organized elevated deep convection.  UAS observations will be assimilated into the Weather Research and Forecasting model to address the goals of the project by improving the representation of:  1) the airmass upstream of the synoptic scale front, 2) mesoscale lifting mechanisms such as Kelvin-Helmholtz billows and gravity waves within and above the synoptic-scale cold airmass, and 3) the structure of storm-generated outflow within the cold air.  The researchers involved in this award will take the lead on assessing the impact of UAS observations on model forecasts and testing strategies for targeting observations to produce the largest gains in forecast skill.",

The overall goal of this collaborative project was to improve understanding and forecasting of these hazardous events. Unmanned aircraft system (UAS) observations collected across the frontal surface over which elevated deep convection is anticipated are likely to improve the ability to forecast the processes responsible for destabilization and heavy rain.

The specific FAA approvals obtained by the CU project team for UAS operation, in the form of Certificates of Authorization (COAs), require that a visual observer be within 0.5 miles horizontally of the aircraft at all times. In order to satisfy this requirement, a customized &ldquo;Follow Me&rdquo; capability was implemented on the CU Tempest and CU TTwistor unmanned aircraft to enable long range tracking of moving ground vehicles. By following a ground vehicle that contains the visual observer, FAA regulations are satisfied. The ground vehicle is then driven under the parts of the atmosphere to be sampled by the aircraft. As part of this project, the capability has been tested with flights of over 45 minutes and covering over 35 miles distance. Subsequent deployments for other projects have utilized this capability for flights over 3 hours covering over 100 miles in distance, including flights in collaboration with the National Severe Storms Laboratory that provided real-time data to the National Weather Service during severe storm forecasting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/05/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Eric&nbsp;W&nbsp;Frew</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542733/1542733_10364261_1504626757616_follow_me--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542733/1542733_10364261_1504626757616_follow_me--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Follow Me\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542733/1542733_10364261_1504626757616_follow_me--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Follow Me\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The CU Tempest unmanned aircraft following a moving ground vehicle.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">University of Colorado</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eric&nbsp;W&nbsp;Frew</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Follow Me</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542733/1542733_10364261_1504627134426_20170607_163444--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542733/1542733_10364261_1504627134426_20170607_163444--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Preparing for launch\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1542733/1542733_10364261_1504627134426_20170607_163444--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Preparing for launch\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The CU Ttwistor unmanned aircraft being prepared for launch.
