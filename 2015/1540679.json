 "awd_abstract_narration": "Spruce budworms are the most important defoliators of conifer forests in the United States Pacific Northwest, injuring or killing hundreds of thousands of acres of trees each year. Budworm infestations can decrease forest growth and as a result affect streams that drain from those forests. But the actual connections between infestations and the functioning of streams remain unknown. Budworms could increase the amount of organic material entering streams directly as they feed, or they could increase the amount of nutrients that runoff the landscape indirectly as a result of reduced forest growth and nutrient demand. In either case, the growth of algae and bacteria in streams, both key components of stream food webs, could be stimulated with consequences for fish or other stream organisms. Since so little is currently known about these possible connections, it is difficult to predict how streams will respond to budworm attacks, especially as budworms are expected to become more active in the future under a warming climate. This project will enable better predictions of how streams in the forests of central Washington state will change as a result of increased spruce budworm feeding and how they would likely respond under a warmer climate. There are clear implications of project results for the regional economy, which has a large base in timber production, recreation, and water supply for hydropower, fisheries and irrigation. Researchers will engage natural resource managers in the region to assist in the development of better adaptive management plans for Federal, State, and Tribal forests and streams. The project will support the education and training of two undergraduate students and will provide new activities for local fifth grade classes who already are learning about ecosystems in their science curriculum. Finally, the researchers will collaborate on the curation of a display about the management of Pacific Northwest forests and streams at a public museum at Central Washington University. \r\n\r\nThe focus of this project is on the sensitivity of streams to increased organic matter and nutrient inputs. There are three main approaches to be employed. First, whole-stream experiments will be used to simulate increased nutrient runoff for measurements of how algae and bacteria respond to nutrient additions under light and dark conditions. Second, observations will be made of how budworms affect stream food webs by tracing how stable isotopes of important nutrients derived from budworm material become incorporated into stream insects. Third, historical data about spruce budworm feeding intensity will be gathered to gain insights about where spruce  budworms will most likely affect forests in the future. The exploratory nature of the project, which takes advantage of current regional budworm infestations to generate important background data and experimental infrastructure for future studies, justifies this project as an EAGER.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe intellectual goal of the research funded by this grant was to better understand how western spruce budworms could influence in-stream processes.  Over the three year project period, we found many lines of evidence suggesting that western spruce budworms can influence stream ecosystem function.  Although budworms are generally a cyclic outbreak species, their activity is expected to increase in response to regional environmental change, so our results suggest that any increase in their activity should cause subsequent changes to stream ecosystem processes. \n\nStreams in this region are generally shady and low in nutrients, and our results show that budworms could stimulate heterotrophic biofilms through organic carbon compounds leached from frass inputs to the stream.  Although frass also leaches inorganic nutrients, we did not find evidence that nutrients would stimulate autotrophic biofilms.  Instead, we found evidence that frass and litter leachates could actually suppress autotrophic biofilm activity on a chlorophyll-specific basis, perhaps negating any increased productivity as a result of higher light via canopy thinning by herbivory.  These changes could shift the relative importance of microbial and algal activity to food web production.\n\nStreams in this region also have very low quality coniferous litter inputs that support stream insect consumers, so budworm activity that inputs frass to streams could stimulate macroinvetebrate production.  We found evidence that frass is a labile food resource that can support insect biomass, particularly for insects that collector particles and eat needles and/or leaves, but we did not find clear or intuitive links between riparian herbivory by budworms and the importance of frass in the immediately receiving food web.  Instead, we found evidence that frass produced from upstream herbivory could support downstream communities with no budworm herbivory in stream side trees.  It remains unclear how far downstream this potential food web linkage could remain important, but in any case, we can confirm that frass produced by budworms is an important food resource in these streams.\n\nFinally we assessed the use of pheromone traps to predict the following year?s herbivory intensity and as a way of forecasting which streams would support budworm populations.  The use of pheromone traps to forecast insects has been a standard silvicultural method for decades and we confirmed its usefulness.  However, we also did find that this tool is a better coarse scale predictor than a fine scale predictor, and we refined some alternate imagery methods to better detect budworm activity.\n\nThe proposed broader impacts of this research were to generate data that could be used in adaptive management of these forest ecosystems, provide outreach efforts support development K-12 curricula, and to increase STEM retention.  We have shared our results with Washington state agencies and helped them map budworm outbreak severity, and we have presented these results in community events attended by the general public and by local resource managers.  We teamed with a middle school teacher who began a summer science camp for advanced students in his rural school district with high participation in federal school lunch program, and he has since received school district funding to continue and expand his program.  Finally, this research directly or indirectly supported 3 master's theses and 6 undergraduate students received training in laboratory and field techniques.  Two of those undergraduate students have been accepted in graduate programs to pursue advanced degrees in life sciences.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/15/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Clay Arango"
