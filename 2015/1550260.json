 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of hunter-gatherer societies around the world, and in the Arctic and Alaska in particular, became a major field within the social and human sciences five decades ago. The goal of the Eleventh Conference on Hunting and Gathering Societies (CHAGS XI) is to continue the development of a unified field of hunter-gatherer studies. The general question of CHAGS XI therefore is how the results of the last 50 years and new research agendas can be utilized for the present and future.  While many hunter-gatherers are forced to give up their ways of life and subsistence practices, they figure prominently in public discourses on ecological and ideological alternatives to industrial society. CHAGS XI will attract a variety of stakeholders in these debates, including indigenous representatives, NGOs, scholars, etc., from the U.S. and other countries.  Based on fieldwork and research from the full spectrum of hunter-gatherer ways of life and from all perspectives scientific disciplines have to offer, the purpose of CHAGS XI is to bring hunter-gatherer studies back to the center of the human and social sciences. The conference will encourage discussions that will provide the social sciences and other research areas with in-depth understanding of hunter-gatherer societies in the United States, Arctic and globally. Through publication of the keynote addresses, results will be widely disseminated to local, national and international groups concerned with hunter-gatherer societies.\r\n\r\nSince 1966 CHAGS has brought together scholars from all over the world to share ideas about social science research. The goal of the Eleventh Conference on Hunting and Gathering Societies  (CHAGS XI) is to continue the development of a unified field of hunter-gatherer studies.  CHAGS XI will offer a venue for U.S. and international scholars to analyze the progress made in the social sciences and hunter-gatherer studies around the world, and in the Arctic in particular. This includes special project sessions, discussion panels, plenary presentations, invited talks by the leading hunter-gatherer scientists and representatives of the indigenous peoples.  Special efforts will be made to ensure presence of as many project collaborators from U.S. hunter-gatherer communities, as possible.  Moreover, its main theme will encourage discussions that will provide the social and natural sciences and other research areas with in-depth understanding of hunter-gatherer societies in global dialogue. Through publication of the keynote addresses, results will be widely disseminated to local, national and international groups concerned with hunter-gatherer societies. The conference will promote interdisciplinary collaboration and include activities for early career scholars. By incorporating indigenous and other stakeholder perspectives of the theme as an integral part, CHAGS XI will encourage these groups of people and scholars to learn from each other now and in the future.",

CHAGS X - held at Liverpool in June 2013 - had put hunter-gatherer studies back at the center of scholarly debates and CHAGS XI made sure that the momentum was not being lost. The Vienna conference was a joint effort by four major anthropological institutions in town &ndash; the World Museum Vienna (formerly the Museum of Ethnology), the Institute for Social Anthropology of the Austrian Academy of Sciences, the University of Vienna, and the Anthropological Society Vienna.</p>\n<p>There were two main rationales for holding and supporting the conference:</p>\n<p>1. To take stock after 50 years of modern hunter-gatherer research and to facilitate moving research on foraging and related issues back to the center of the anthropological agenda.</p>\n<p>2. To make sure that the CHAGS conference series traditon contunues.</p>\n<p>3. To promote high quality research      and ensure high intellectual merit.</p>\n<p>4. To&nbsp;support participation of      Indigenous people, Arctic residents and other underrepresented groups.</p>\n<p>5. To&nbsp;engage early career scholars.</p>\n<p>6. To&nbsp;encourage participation from less developed and remote jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>7. To&nbsp;provide assistance to U.S.      participants, particularly from Alaska.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>GENERAL DESCRIPTION AND INTELLECTUAL MERIT</p>\n<p>The general question of this conference was how the results and lessons learned of 50 years of hunter-gatherer studies &ndash; no matter whether the results and lessons were positive or negative - can be made meaningful to present and future students of hunter-gatherers societies, as well as for these societies themselves, who increasingly are forced to give up their social and cultural lifeways. The general theme \"Refocusing Hunter-gatherer Studies\" was developed in two keynote and three plenary sessions, which used broadly comparative and interdisciplinary perspectives that fit well with the overall conference objectives. The main themes were developed further in a series of conceptually targeted sessions. Additional sessions offered complementary subjects that represent the breadth of current hunter-gatherer research in social anthropology, genetics, and evolutionary anthropology.</p>\n<p>Plenary I: Hunter-Gatherer Research, Human Evolution, and Human Nature - Dialogues and Debates: Diverse models and theories of human behavioral evolution and human nature have been constructed using archaeological, biological, and ethnographic data on hunter-gatherers. For this session advocates of varying viewpoints to a conversation about commonalities and differences were invited.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Plenary II: Hunter-Gatherers in a Changing World: Like many rural communities around the world - hunter-gatherer societies face a number of relatively new ecological and social challenges to which they need to adapt. Despite many hunter-gatherer societies still living in relatively isolated pockets of the world, where much of the natural environment on which their sustenance is based is also still relatively intact - contemporary hunter-gatherer societies are increasingly and rapidly being affected by Global Changes, related both to biophysical Earth systems, and to social systems. Plenary II showed different ethnographic case studies to highlight these topics.</p>\n<p>Plenary III: CHAGS XI: What we have learned: This plenary was the closing summary of the conference, whereby speakers reviewed overall findings at the conference, and identified areas that need further discussion and investigation. Each member of the roundtable was taking responsibility for tracking discussions on a particular topic, or set of linked topics, and identify the lessons learned and ways to move forward on the comparative project of hunter-gatherer research.</p>\n<p>Beside these sessions, which traditionally reprisent differernt foci of general research (concrete historical &amp; general theory) there were regional as well as thematic session categories which focused on more concrete research fields like \"Archeology &amp; Hunter-Gatherer Past\", \"Justice &amp; Representation\", Hunter-Gatherer &amp; Religion\", \"Linguistics, Social &amp; Cultural Relations\", as well as \"Human-Animal Relationship &amp; Ecology\" and \"Food, Subsistence &amp; Economy\".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>BROADER IMPACTS</p>\n<p>CHAGS XI was significantly larger than CHAGS X (Liverpool). We had 48 sessions (with 92 session slots) approved by the Organizing Committee. The Call for Papers opened in December 2014 and closed in February 2015. This NSF grant supported 28 CHAGS XI participants: this included 21 early career scholars (52% from U.S. institutions) and seven (7) indigenous participants and presenters from underrepresented regions (Arctic, South-East Asia). 40% of all funded individuals were from the USA.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>CHAGS XI main themes encouraged discussions that will provide the social and natural sciences and other research areas with in-depth understanding of hunter-gatherer societies in global dialog. Through publication of the keynote addresses and other papers (three CHAGS XI-based books were published in 2016-2017), results have been widely disseminated to local, national and international groups concerned with hunter-gatherer societies.
