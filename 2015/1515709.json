 "awd_abstract_narration": "Among the fundamental questions about human origins is how our hominin ancestors lived. This study uses a multidisciplinary approach (paleontology, paleoecology, comparative anatomy, experimental biology) to ask questions about how extinct populations of hominins behaved on their natural landscapes. Specifically, the investigators will analyze lower jaws (mandibles), among the most commonly represented parts of the skeleton in the early human fossil record, of modern great apes and two early species of extinct hominins (Autralopithecus), to understand how the structure of the mandible is related to changes in feeding behavior and diet. The research will provide new data about how changes in diet and feeding behavior transformed our anatomy across time, permitting more robust explanations of the processes by which we became human. Broader impacts will include undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral training in the latest analytical techniques for fossil analyses; outreach to primary and secondary school science teachers and students using hands-on experiences and web-based content designed to enhance teaching and learning about human origins; and the production of a unique collection 3D data for modern apes and rare fossil specimens that will be available to the scientific community.\r\n\r\nMandibles are the most common element in the hominin fossil record after teeth; they are used to diagnose species, test phylogenetic hypotheses, and infer feeding behavior and diet. However, extensive theoretical and experimental work on extant primates has not clarified which aspects of variation in mandibular form are related to variation in the positions of the tooth row, jaw muscles and jaw joint, which are related to the mandible's resistance to internal forces, and how these relate to feeding behavior and diet. Furthermore, the classical consensus on the relationship between dentognathic morphology and diet in Plio-Pleistocene hominins - adaptation to processing mechanically resistant foods - has been challenged by recent inferences from dietary isotopes, occlusal microwear, and finite element modeling, which do not converge on a shared view of early hominin diets and feeding behavior. This lack of consensus is especially glaring in light of the rich fossil record of mandibles for the Australopithecus anamensis-A. afarensis lineage (4.2-3.0 Ma), which documents clear changes in dentognathic morphology and carbon-isotope signatures over time. The primary focus of the proposed research is an integrative investigation of how spatial and mechanical determinants of mandibular form track change in diet and feeding behavior in extant hominids (great apes and humans) and early Australopithecus.  The research is organized under three specific aims: 1. Quantifying and comparing the location, magnitude and nature of external and internal morphological variation in mandibles of extant (Homo, Pongo, Pan, and Gorilla) and fossil (A. anamensis, A. afarensis) hominids via computed tomography and geometric morphometrics; 2. Testing specific hypotheses about the biomechanical significance of variation in hominid mandibular morphology via finite-element models; and 3. Evaluating the extent to which spatial positioning of masticatory system components (tooth row, jaw joint, and muscle attachment points) explain variation in mandibular morphology across extant hominids and early Australopithecus. The project will provide new data on the structural and functional determinants of early hominin mandibular morphology, to help identify the factors that drove these morphological changes and allow tests of adaptive hypotheses about the early evolution of the genus.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDiet is one of the most important aspects of a species\u2019 biology, affecting everything from habitat use, social structure, locomotor adaptations, to the anatomical structure of the jaws and teeth, and more.  One of the key innovations associated with the appearance of the human lineage is thought to have been a shift from a reliance on ripe fruits to the ability to process not only fruit, but harder-to-chew foods like nuts, tubers and seeds.  This shift is thought to have allowed human fossil relatives to be able to inhabit not only forests, where fruits grow, to a much wider variety of habitats, enabling them to expand their geographic range and be successful in the face of changing climates and environments and ultimately leading to the success of the human lineage.  It also is thought to have led to the adoption of upright walking, which we know characterized some of the earliest members of our lineage, from the genus Australopithecus.  However, new fossils have revealed that the earliest Australopithecus indeed walked upright, yet their jaws appear to have been less well-adapted for heavy chewing than later species.  Understanding what these apparent changes in jaw structure tell us about possible changes in diet throughout early Australopithecus, and to what extent these jaws may tell us something new about the relationship between diet and hominin origins, requires a robust understanding of the relationship between feeding and jaw structure in modern animals.  With this information, we can make more accurate interpretations of the fossil record.\n\nOur sweeping collaborative project provides a robust framework for interpreting the functional significance of changes in jaw structure in early Australopithecus.  To do this, we considered not just the external anatomy of the jaws, we also used micro-CT imagery to investigate the internal bone structure as well.  Further, we investigated this structure in modern humans and our closest relatives, chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans. This is important, because we know the diets of modern animals and can test the relationships between anatomy and function in modern animals and apply our findings to understanding the fossils.  We used advanced methods of measuring and comparing internal and external jaw structure in three dimensions to quantify differences among species and evaluate the extent to which spatial positioning of chewing system components (tooth row, jaw joint, and muscle attachment points) explains variation in mandibular morphology across extant hominids and early Australopithecus.   We also used an approached borrowed from engineering called finite element analysis to model different ways of biting and chewing, and how different jaw structures are able to withstand the forces involved.   \n\n We have been able to complete the most accurate finite element models of modern ape mandibles yet created and validated them with data from actual feeing behavior in living animals.  In our lab at Missouri, our contribution to the project was to take the jaws of the earliest Australopithecus to the NECSA scanning facility in South Africa to take microCT scans of these fossils.  We brought the data back to our lab and used advanced software to use these images to create 3D models of each specimen that show the internal and external architecture of these specimens.  Other team members will then create full reconstructions of these specimens and apply results of the 3D morphometric analyses and finite element modelling done on the modern animals to interpret these fossils, and to compare them to more recent Australopithecus.  Results from this research will provide important new insights into the role of diet in the origin and early evolution of the Australopithecus-human lineage.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/14/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carol V Ward"
