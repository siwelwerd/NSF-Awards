Their applications range from laser printers and optical storage to optical communications and medical instruments. Stable, high quality emission from microlasers is very important for almost all applications. The work proposed in this project will provide for the first time full comprehensive information on the characteristics of a newly proposed PT symmetry lasers. The findings will provide valuable and detailed understanding for these structures and identify any shortcomings compared to other single mode microlasers.\r\n\r\nTechnical: The proposed research will provide a systematic evaluation of the properties of PT symmetric lasers and provide a comprehensive characterization of their static and dynamic properties.  These studies are essential for painting a full picture of the future research activities in this direction. Particularly, the results of our studies can either transform the research landscape in the field of microlasers by confirming the potential future of PT lasing structures or identify the limitations of these new lasers over current microlasers.The proposed research includes accurate numerical evaluation of the combined supermodes modes of PT symmetric photonic molecules, nonlinear laser rate equation to study the temporal dynamics of the laser emission as a function of the design parameters and the pump current levels, and investigating effects such as carrier diffusion, heating and filamentation.",
