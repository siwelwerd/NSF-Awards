 "awd_abstract_narration": "The NSF-IRES program International, Interdisciplinary Student Research in a Biological Hotspot of Southern Ecuador will provide 8-week field research opportunities for students from the University of Idaho (UI) in collaboration with the Univesidad T\u00e9cnica Particular de Loja, Ecuador. Six students (4-5 undergraduate, 1-2 graduate) per year will conduct team-based research at three main field sites in southern Ecuador including dry-forest, Amazonian lowlands and high Andes cloud forest and paramo ecosystems. Training will emphasize cross-disciplinary synthesis, sensitivity to varying cultural/political norms, and the flexibility to conduct rigorous scientific investigations in landscapes with uniquely varied research challenges. Participating students from the UI will work in interdisciplinary teams of 2-3 students addressing individual research questions within the scope of a broad unifying topic focused around our umbrella theme of biodiversity conservation. Six UTPL faculty with expertise in conservation biology, conservation genetics, mammalian ecology, limnology, insect ecology and phylogenetics, plant ecology and phylogenetics, and rural sociology will serve as local project mentors. \r\n\r\nEcuadorian students from UTPL will collaborate with UI student team members to develop and implement research projects. UI faculty with expertise in landscape and organismal ecology, conservation biology, population ecology, conservation genetics, hydrology, limnology, watershed management, rural sociology, natural resource policy, and entomology will serve as co-mentors and collaborators. Educational activities will include a spring planning and proposal development course that emphasizes program logistics, the ecology, natural history and human dimensions (sustainable development, culture, indigenous issues) of southern Ecuador, interdisciplinary research methods, and the development of summer research proposals. After an 8-week field season collecting data in Ecuador, students will take a fall course designed to facilitate data analysis and manuscript preparation, in a continued interdisciplinary setting, and culminating in a final oral presentation and project report. Participating students will gain experience with a rich array of cultures, thus building a sophisticated, externalized perspective on science. Ultimately, graduates of this program should excel at addressing the critical, multi-facetted conservation dilemmas that face us as global citizens.",

Loja is a vibrant, midsized city, located in a mountain valley, a short distance from the Amazon basin to the East and the dry forest coast to the West. Loja is bisected by two rivers- the Zamorra and the Malacatos- that join at the South end of the city- and the local people are completely dependent on the health of the regional watershed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As part of a collaboration between the UI and the Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja (UTPL), teams of 4-6 students from the United States spent two months a summer between 2016 and 2019 conducting social science and ecological research in the Loja watershed, as well as in a nearby dry forest on the Peruvian border.&nbsp; We wanted to better understand how different land use patterns impact ecosystem integrity and biodiversity. &nbsp;Some students focused on water quality and sampled streams in protected forests, agricultural fields and urban corridors, assessing various indices of water quality and contamination. The complex biota on a river rock (known as periphyton) can yield complex information on stream degradation, as can levels of phosphorus or dissolved nitrogen.

Almost everyone in Loja uses the Zamorra and Malacatos rivers for washing clothes, for children?s playtime, for recreating at the local park, for household use in peripheral communities and sometimes for waste disposal or other less benign uses.

Citizens in Loja, whether urban or rural, are often very aware of some impacts to their water systems (such as runoff from mines or urban roads), but they often see these impacts as things that originate somewhere else such as upstream, or in an industry that is several steps removed from their own lives.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Students in our program faced a number of challenges (road wash-outs, torrential downpours, midges, local suspicion in the face of interviews), but also experienced unique experiences- such as the identification of a new species, the Lojano frog <em>Pristimantis lojanus</em>, indigenous meals in rural farmsteads, and the comradery and cultural exchange with new colleagues at the Universidad Tecnica Particular de Loja.
