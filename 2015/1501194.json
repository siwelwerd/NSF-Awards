 "awd_abstract_narration": "Keeping computers and information systems secure is a major challenge. Business, industry, and government need well-prepared technicians who can prevent, detect, and investigate cybersecurity breaches, and the growth of cyber-threats has created a need for many more workers who have appropriate, specific knowledge and skills. Many key companies in the Ohio region are finding it difficult to locate skilled cybersecurity technicians. In response to this need, Columbus State Community College, Franklin University, a consortium of technology-focused area high schools, and regional cybersecurity companies are collaborating to develop a comprehensive \"2 + 2 + 2\" Cybersecurity Technician Training Pipeline. This program will target high school graduates, college-aged students, adult learners, and incumbent workers and will include multiple entry and exit points for these students and stackable certificates that lead to entry-level, mid-level, and management-level cybersecurity careers.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to increase the supply of qualified cybersecurity professionals for industry and government. Major activities include:\r\n(1) Developing and implementing a 60 credit-hour Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree and related academic certificates in cybersecurity at Columbus State Community College, which will prepare high school graduates and incumbent IT and non-IT workers to obtain the (ISC)2 Systems Security Certified Practitioner (SSCP) certification.\r\n(2) Conducting workshops for high school teachers and establishing a pre-college program for regional high schools, which will serve as the first link in a \"2 + 2 + 2\" educational pathway in cybersecurity.\r\n(3) Establishing a model articulation agreement with Franklin University, which will serve as the final link in the \"2 + 2 + 2\" pathway, allowing AAS graduates from Columbus State to transfer seamlessly into a BS degree program in cybersecurity.\r\nMany components of the new curriculum, as well as the professional development activities for faculty, will draw on resources offered by the National CyberWatch Center.",
