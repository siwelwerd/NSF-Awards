The goal of the conference to is examine successful practices and lessons learned and aggregate the findings in a manner that can productively inform and support current and future efforts of this kind. The key objectives of the work will be to identify approaches that broaden reach, increase the effectiveness of researcher/outreach organizational partnerships, and make recommendations for amplifying the strategic impact of these projects.\r\n\r\nPrior to the conference the PI will conduct a multiphase process of document review, online interviews, and questionnaires.  Two virtual workshops will be conducted with a subset of previous grantees and their media partners noted for effective collaboration and outcomes.  The first workshop will have participants sharing findings on project strengths and areas needing improvement based on past experience.  They will identify possible generic tools and a framework that could be shared across projects.  The second workshop will focus on the identified successful strategies might be implemented more widely.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this multi-component conference will help future grantees better understand, expand, and work more strategically with their outreach partners.",

Through the discovery, survey, and workshop phases, the researchers learned about grantees\u00c6 experiences in crafting their projects, successes and challenges as well as implications for future work. From this experience, we have distilled outcomes for the participants and recommendations for the field in general.\n\n Value-Added Effect of CRPA\n\nA key theme that emerged in the workshop was the \"add-on\" value of the CRPA program: in addition to the direct value of the funded media or museum project, both research PIs and media partners reported a range of positive outcomes that went beyond the direct project activity. In many cases CRPA grants conferred status and visibility on PIs that went beyond their specific academic world, garnering attention from deans, public affairs offices and outreach departments at their institutions, and legitimizing communications efforts. CRPAs helped both PIs and media partners conceptualize and plan future proposals. They made such work much more viable and practical. The connections made during CRPAs to product staff, education staff, and partners, created a set of relationships for continuing outreach efforts in both formal and informal ways. It is notable that these catalyzing characteristics of CRPAs benefited both novice and experienced grantees. The CRPA approach supported capacity building and relationships that were highly beneficial in either context. Participants showed strong interest in continuing work of this kind and many are now champions of the need for public communication of science and continue to pursue such efforts in their institutions and communities.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe other key outcome of this research is a set of recommendations for improving communications efforts. Drawing on research across all project phases, there was almost universally shared desire for additional resources and activity falling into two broad categories: 1) support resources and 2) growth opportunities.\n\n \n\nSupport Resources\n\nTo broaden reach and increase the effectiveness of researcher/outreach organizational partnerships we recommend the following:\n1. Collection of existing production and outreach tools and development of new ones as needed.\n2. Access to just-in-time one-on-one mentoring resources that would provide support tailored to specific needs and questions during all phases of the grant activity.\n3. Development of a partnership \"match-up\" venue, a resource in which researchers could find media/outreach partners and vice versa.\n4. Enhance efforts that build a shared community of practice for both PI researchers and media partners engaged in, or considering, media-based outreach efforts.\n \n\nGrowth Opportunities\n\nTo further amplify the impact of CRPA projects, we recommend the following:\n1. Support aggregation and strategic use of resources by collecting and tagging the products of grants for digital curation and distribution.\n2. Facilitate greater shelf life and broader distribution for completed projects during and after the grant period.\n3.
