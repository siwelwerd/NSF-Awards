This proposal addresses a key challenge to realizing microbial catalysts, namely increasing the rate and efficiency that a microbial catalyst can produce the fuel or chemical.  This proposal will substantially improve microbial catalysts by investigating the underlying enzyme regulation that limits catalyst productivity.  While the regulation of many enzymes has been studied in isolation, the systems-level, condition-dependent regulation of enzymes has proved difficult to elucidate, but this understanding will be essential to engineering high productivity microbial catalysts.  If successful, this proposal would impact the biomanufacturing competitiveness of the United States by reducing production costs of a wide range of drop-in replacements for diesel, jet fuel, and gasoline, as well as chemicals used to make plastics, preservatives, flavors and fragrances, and many other consumer products.   The proposed work will also train students at the undergrad, master and doctoral levels through research, a new course in Global Health and Biotechnology and a certificate program in Sustainability and Global Health.  The certificate will provide future biological engineers with an integrated understanding of biotechnology, challenging societal problems, and tools for market analysis and risk. The certificate will be piloted in the current proposal as a master?s program.  This program will result in greater STEM educational infrastructure and promote interaction of under-represented minorities in low-income countries with STEM trainees. This will benefit our global partners through increased scientific activity and collaboration, technoeconomic analysis of country-specific societal challenges, as well as our society by training globally minded engineers.\r\n\r\nThe rationale for the proposed work is to enable high flux metabolism in the absence of cell growth for highly productive non-growth-associated biomanufacturing processes.  Developing cells with fast, non-growth product metabolism would remove a major barrier to a thriving biomanufacturing economy, by optimizing substrate conversion to product without sacrificing substrate consumption for cell growth. However, many biochemical products are growth-coupled, and in general non-growing cells have low metabolic rates. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify allosteric regulation and post-translational modification (enzyme-level regulation) that represses glycolytic metabolism in non-growth conditions. The central hypothesis is that enzyme-level regulation dominates metabolic downregulation in stationary phase.  The proposed work will launch two new methods for engineering and characterizing metabolic regulation and developing a systems-level understanding of non-growth central carbon metabolic regulation. The proposal will generate minimal cells at the proteomic-level, circumventing problems with genetic deletions.  The proposal will also develop a method for rapid, targeted degradation of proteins to engineer bioconversions with near optimal yields by knocking down byproduct enzymes.  The method will enable new biological studies, as it will be useful for making conditional mutants to perturb biological systems in new ways. The second method will identify rate-limiting enzymes, based on thermodynamics, and thus focus engineering efforts on specific enzymes. The developed workflow will determine if reactions are near equilibrium (non-rate-limiting) or away from equilibrium (rate limiting) for a broad range of industrially relevant conditions. The novel workflow will be deployed to study central carbon metabolic regulation to garner a systems-level perspective on regulation of organic acid and terpene production.\r\n\r\nThis CAREER award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSustainable biofuels and biochemicals are only feasible if they can be manufactured at a reasonable cost. While synthetic biology has demonstrated the synthesis of many biochemicals is possible, low productivity bioprocesses have prevented commercialization in most cases.  To improve productivity, this project has developed technologies to better control bacterial enzymatic reactions in biochemical manufacturing.  These technologies should be applicable to a broad range of biofuels and biochemicals.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit:\n\nIn this project we developed technologies to control enzymatic reactions in bacteria and studied the effects of stationary phase and stresses on enzymatic reactions.  The first technology developed was to selectively degrade enzymes that carry out byproduct reactions, thereby allowing more cellular resources to be available for the desired product.  The second technology developed allows the facile activation and repression of specific enzymes in response to changes in glucose, the standard feedstock for biochemical production.  This enables precise control of when growth-related and product-related enzymes are active.  Additionally, we elucidated the metabolic response to cells that could no longer grow and found conditions that allowed eight-fold better metabolic activity than standard conditions.  Finally, we found that stress induced by biochemical production can result in cellular responses that repress enzyme expression and glucose uptake.  Genetic manipulations can prevent these stress responses from reducing productivity.\n\nBroader Impacts:\n\nThis project has resulted in technology and know-how that will accelerate the R&amp;D efforts of biomanufacturing and increase the number of commercial successes in that sector.  In addition, this project has trained four graduate students, one postdoctoral fellow, and two undergraduate students in molecular biology, metabolomics, and synthetic biology.  This project formalized the Sustainability &amp; Global Health Biotechnologies (SGHB) Certificate as part of the Master?s in Biotechnology Program at Northwestern University.  This certificate has provided specialized training in understanding the technical and societal challenges associated with environmental impact of industry and healthcare in resource poor settings.  Ten students participated in this program, including a 10 week internship at the University of Cape Town (South Africa) to experience first-hand the environmental and healthcare challenges.  Finally, the project resulted in the development of a new course ?Biotechnology &amp; Global Health? that now enrolled ~150 students during the project and is on-going. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/18/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Keith E Tyo"
