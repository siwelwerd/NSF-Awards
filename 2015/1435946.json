For the past forty years, the Philippines have been among the top labor exporting countries of the world -- in both absolute numbers and as a percentage of its population.  This project seeks to identify the factors that explain this rate of migration.  The predominant explanation for this phenomenon, in both policy and scholarly circles, has been to attribute high rates of migration to migration itself: past migration produces social networks that facilitate and promote further migration.  The problem with this explanation is that, while it works well to explain migration from certain countries, such as that of Mexican workers to the U.S., it fails to explain the Philippine case, which relies less on friends-and-family networks than it does on a complex state-led bureaucracy that helps coordinate migrants with international labor markets.  \r\n\r\nThis dissertation will assess the role of the Philippine state, and, more importantly, to explain the factors that contributed to the development of the state's labor export system.  Among the factors examined will be the role of elite preference:  Did economic and social elites promote the development of a labor export program as a political \"safety valve\" -- a means to ameliorate social and economic conflicts without making the radical changes required for rapid economic development?  If it can be shown that, in the Philippine case, the very factors that led to the strength of the labor export apparatus were also the factors that obstructed the development of state capacity in agrarian reform and industrialization -- two policy areas critical to economic development, it would suggest that promoting labor migration is unlikely ever to produce the desired development outcomes.  It would suggest that the social costs of such policies are not likely to be balanced by economic growth, and thus, that the people of developing countries are better served by policies that do not rely on large-scale labor migration.\r\n\r\n\r\nScholarship on migration, particularly in the U.S., has long been dominated by the importance of the Mexican-U.S. migration circuit, in which historical links and strong social networks has played a major causal role, while the sending states efforts to intervene in migration has been largely nonexistent.  In the past two decades, new research on other labor migrations, notably from the Philippines, has suggested that states can play a more significant role.  However, migration theory has struggled to incorporate these findings, opting, for the most part, to see the Philippine state?s activities as an extension of the social networks theory a more institutional and structured form under which migration takes place, but both a product of the same forces that produce migration elsewhere and producing effects that are not very different from what would occur without state intervention.  Demonstrating that a domestic causal factor, not directly related to migration itself, was key in the development of the Philippines labor export apparatus, would advance our understanding of international labor migration and states' role in its growth and globalization.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project examines the global surge of economic and labor-driven migrations that began in mid-twentieth century.  The characteristics of this migration are distinct from previous waves &ndash; in the sending and receiving countries involved in migration flows, and structurally, in the greater share of temporary contract labor migrations, and the maintenance of deep social, political, and economic ties with countries of origin.  One aspect of this migration wave that is relatively understudied is the role of the sending state in producing migration flows. What is the range of policies that sending states can deploy to influence migration flows, and what are their impacts?  What are the social and political conditions under which a policy of labor export becomes acceptable?  What kinds of institutional capacities are required to successfully implement such policies? \n\nWe pursue these questions with a comparative historical analysis built around the Philippine labor export program &ndash; the most prominent modern example of sending state intervention.  Relying on two years of field work, including in-depth interviews with government officials and leaders of business and civil society, document analysis in legislative, administrative, and media archives, as well as a review of secondary sources and economic data, we excavate the history of the Philippine labor export apparatus, its emergence and reproduction over time.\n\nFirst, the project builds a foundation for the comparative analysis of the Philippine labor export program to other sending states, by constructing a typology of sending state regimes, based on an inductive analysis of sending state intervention in the latter half of the twentieth century.  This typology maps onto existing theories of migration causation that focus on migrant networks and receiving country-led recruitment, demonstrating that sending states have three ideal-typical responses to migration opportunities: they can (1) accommodate themselves to existing migration without attempting to intervene directly; (2) intervene to facilitate or regulate such flows; (3) intervene to direct, diversify, and manipulate these flows.  Comparing the Philippine case to other sending states demonstrates that the development and successful implementation interventionist policies requires a coherence and bureaucratic capacity hitherto unrecognized in the Philippine state. \n\nThe project then seeks to explain how the Philippine state?s capacity with regard to labor export was developed.  While it is generally accepted that sending states have an economic interest in the remittances of migrant workers, very little is written about how the individual remittances are translated into funds that affect policy at a macrostructural scale.  This research outlines these processes in the Philippine case, which occurred through the complementary relationship between labor migration and the rise of a consumption-driven economy, dependent on construction, real estate, and retail, that displaced the traditional agricultural base and the manufacturing sectors that had grown during the import substitution era of the 1950s and 1960s.  We trace the interdependence of these sectors and labor migration, which have been closely tied since the 1970s, from the construction industry?s competitiveness in foreign markets, which depended on migrant labor, to the role that these sectors currently play in aggregating remittances for capital.  This relationship translates to elite political support for the maintenance of a labor export policy, even in the face of deep civil society opposition.  We further argue that these efforts to build and sustain capacity are facilitated by the structure of labor export which, unlike other economic activities, such as finance or manufacturing, provide fewer opportunities for the extraction of large-scale rents.  \n\nThis project's broader social impact is in the realm of public policy, by contributing to our understanding of sending state labor migration interventions, and their relationship to economic development.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Suzy Kim Lee"
