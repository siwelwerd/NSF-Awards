The grant recipients will\r\nbe expected to report their learning experiences once the conference is over.\r\nSpecial efforts will be made by personal contacts to recruit student participants who are underrepresented\r\nminorities (i.e., African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and Native Pacific Islanders) and/or\r\nwomen, coming from diverse institutions.",
