 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ocean mixed-layer is both conduit and barrier for exchange of momentum, heat and gases between the atmosphere and ocean. Recent modeling has revealed a host of competing submesoscale mixed-layer processes which can either promote or inhibit air-sea exchange. These processes are an observational challenge because of the need for unaliased temporal and lateral resolution, as well as sufficient duration to establish persistent mechanisms. This study plans to dramatically improve understanding of 1-10 km scale lateral processes in three-dimensional mixed-layer dynamics with a 28-day experiment in the North Pacific Subtropical Front, a region of above-average atmospheric forcing, typical mid-ocean mesoscale advection and straining, and typical submesoscale activity, maximizing the likelihood of finding significant signals. The results of this observational program will improve the physical basis of mixed-layer parameterizations, leading to better model predictions for air-sea fluxes, gas transfer and biological productivity. The project will train one graduate student and provide research experiences to undergraduate students.  A cruise blog and experiment website will make the results of the project available to the wider scientific community and general public\r\n\r\nMultiple ship surveys, profiling float array deployments (16-20 floats measuring temperature, salinity, horizontal velocity and microstructure) and a drifting air-sea flux platform will sample the upper-ocean's response to winter storm forcing in the presence of the mixed-layer fronts that characterize the central ocean gyres. The arrays will profile in sync every 30-40 minutes to eliminate space-time aliasing, cycling between the surface and 100-150 m depth (below the transition layer). During and between deployments, the region will be surveyed repeatedly with (i) a tow-yo body and a shipboard Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler to provide larger-scale context and (ii) a multi-depth flow-through temperature and salinity system to resolve smaller horizontal scales in the upper 2-5 m.  Submesoscale variability in the surface mixed-layer leads to dynamical processes which do not readily satisfy the quasigeostrophic or 1-D surface layer approximations in common use. Although these processes have been examined in isolation or idealized conditions, observational evidence to date is insufficient to clarify whether these subinertial processes are able to operate in the presence of high-frequency atmospheric forcing and strong internal-wave shears. The planned 5-7 array deployments of 3-5 days each will be of sufficient duration to separate the evolution of low-frequency dynamics from near-inertial shear that dominates short timescales, allowing evaluation of mixed-layer restratification and destratification rates by mixed-layer eddies, wind-forcing and vertical processes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe SMILE observational program was designed to test 3-D submesoscale (1-10 km) surface mixed-layer restratification/destratification mechanisms that impact surface-layer stratification and air-sea exchanges using (i) EM-APEX profiling float arrays (measuring u, v, T, S and temperature microstructure), (ii) shipboard SWIMS towyo (T, S, O2, Chl), ADCP and throughflow surveys, and (iii) an air-sea flux buoy.  Theoretical subinertial submesoscale restratification mechanisms are already being implemented on OGCMs with reported success but have yet to be validated observationally in the presence of high-frequency atmospheric forcing and internal-wave shears for sampling intervals of adequate duration to isolate the subinertial mechanisms.  Measurements were made at 3 sites in the North Pacific Subtropical Front during March 2017.  The measurement program collected multiple surveys spanning ~O(1-10 km) of sufficient duration to filter out reversible internal-wave effects and characterize 3-D mixed-layer processes.\n\n \n\nFieldwork was conducted during March 2017 aboard the R/V Sikuliaq.  Data was successfully collected at 3 sites (26N, 30N and 35N) in the North Pacific Subtropical Front region between Hawaii and Newport, OR with (i) Lagrangian arrays made up of EM-APEX profiling floats and a drifting surface flux buoy, enclosed by (ii) shipboard surveys that followed the array movements.   All instrument systems performed well and provided quality data.  Anomalously shallow mixed-layers and calm conditions prevailed.  Tidal and near-inertial motions were typical.  At the third site, restratification of a 60-70 m thick mixed-layer was captured.\n\n \n\nLargely closing the mixed-layer buoyancy budget with direct observations has allowed further analysis of the limitations of both the observations and the 1-D mixed-layer models.  The advective contribution is found to have much larger magnitudes than the MLE parameterization predictions and to be in the destratifying sense over the whole time-series while the MLE parameterization always acts to restratify.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/18/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J.
