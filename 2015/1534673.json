 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposal is for hosting the Second Polar Data Forum (PDF II) in Waterloo, Canada on October 2015. The PDF II will be building on the success of the first Polar Data Forum (PDF I) held in Tokyo, Japan, October 2013. The goal of the PDF II is to refine relevant themes and priorities and establish actions to address the target issues. This includes meeting the needs of society and science through promotion of open data and effective data stewardship, establishing sharing and interoperability of data at a variety of levels, developing trusted data management systems, and ensuring long-term data preservation.  The workshop will provide a critically important venue for U.S.-based and funded polar data initiatives and to showcase polar data management systems funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and other U.S. agencies, while learning from global partners and working collaboratively to continue developing an international vision and action plan. Beside providing a contribution to managing polar data on a global scale, making data available to future generations, the workshop will involve young researchers and underrepresented groups through the engagement of Indigenous organizations to ensure participation of Indigenous people of the Arctic. Moreover, a data management training workshop targeted at the needs of graduate students and researchers is being planned, co-organized by APECS and the ArcticNet Student Association.",

Understanding their complex dimensions (environmental, climatic, social, economic, and geophysical) is critical to grasping the global system and defining our future. Data are an invaluable resource. The coordinated capture, analysis, storage, stewardship, and sharing of scientific data along with Indigenous knowledge helps society better understand the regional and global impacts of Polar changes. But these data management activities present considerable technical, social, policy and economic challenges.\n\nIn October of 2015, more than 110 people gathered at the Second Polar Data Forum at the University of Waterloo, Canada (PDFII)  to address these challenges.  PDF was co-hosted by the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado.  Data managers, scientists, funding program managers, Indigenous people and their representatives, students and others from more than ten nations shared their knowledge, experience and ideas on how to make polar data more useful and valuable in solving global problems.\n\nIn keeping with the areas of intellectual merit proposed, the key outcome of the  PDFII was the identification of key themes that are relevant to polar data management:\n\ni.  Arctic Indigenous perspectives.  In this time of change, Indigenous knowledge and the underlying observations of Arctic peoples are more important than ever.  The perspectives of Indigenous people must be heard directly. This will enhance understanding of how their knowledge andobservations can be used appropriately.  \n\nii.  The importance of broad community building was recognized.

Therefore, data, Indigenous knowledge (especially of Elders), and all the necessary descriptive information must be preserved. Too often preservation is forgotten and data managers must pursue \"data rescue\"activities. Strategic data rescue programs must be developed and preservation must be prioritized as a long-term investment and cost saving measure.\n\niv.

Through knowledge sharing and coordinated effort, participants  made concrete progress in moving towards an inclusive, interoperable polar data management system that is part of the emerging global system.  Major progress was made with respect to including Indigenous perpsectives in the dialogue.  As indicated, representatives from a group of data oriented projects using Indigenous knowledge stated their intention to link their efforts to the broader polar data community, a clear example of a..."
