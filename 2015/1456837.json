 "awd_abstract_narration": "The skeleton of the sea urchin embryo is a powerful model system for how genetic information is transformed into anatomical features. An intricate network of more than 100 regulatory genes is known to be involved at the top level. The role of this \"managerial\" network, however, is primarily to make decisions, not to do any of the actual work. It was recently discovered that proper development requires that a small group of cells in the embryo send a message to another group, the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs), using a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). PMCs are the cells that lay down the skeleton, and once given the word, they do this pretty much on their own. The research team hopes to learn how PMCs respond to the \"go\"-signal they receive from other cells, what genetic programs they run that affect the shape of the skeleton, and what kind of behavioral and structural changes result from running these programs. In the big picture, this would help understand how top-level decisions in the cell lead to actual changes in cell behavior and the emergence of a skeleton with complex architecture, and will hopefully contribute to an understanding of how such mechanisms evolve. An important part of the proposed activities is the development of lab modules for undergraduate engineering students, the integration of undergraduate researchers in the project, and outreach activities at local high schools using a mobile sea urchin lab.\r\n\r\nSpiculogenesis in the sea urchin embryo, i.e. formation of the endoskeleton by primary mesenchyme cells (PMC), is the result of a stereotypical sequence of morphogenetic events. Key steps include an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, patterning, and cell-cell fusion. In the late gastrula stage, PMC syncytia begin secreting the endoskeleton. While the current model of the skeletogenic gene regulatory network (GRN) is arguably one of the best understood in any organism, there is currently a gap in our understanding of how the high-level GRN circuitry is integrated with regulation of complex cellular behavior. Recent work identified the importance of ectoderm-derived factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The Principal Investigator and collaborators discovered that a recombinant VEGF has a dramatic concentration-dependent effect on the shape of spicules deposited by PMC in vitro. Triradiates, i.e. branching spicules that closely resemble those initially deposited in the embryo, require a threshold concentration of rVEGF. Below this concentration, markedly different spicule shapes are formed. VEGF is, thus, an important extrinsic regulator of morphogenetic events in PMC. The research team will therefore perform a series of in vitro experiments that aim to unravel the role of VEGF signaling in PMCs. Specifically, they will: a) determine the influence of rVEGF concentration on the skeletogenic GRN and its downstream circuitry by a combination of quantitative PCR and deep sequencing; b) investigate the effect of VEGF on cell behavior before the onset of spiculogenesis, including proliferation, survival, motility, and patterning, and c) study the effect of VEGF on ultrastructure, specifically cytoskeletal rearrangement, in the PMC syncytium. The proposed research will not only help integrate a mechanistic view of PMC skeletal morphogenesis by connecting top-level regulatory circuits with more proximal control over cellular behavior, but also provide a basis for understanding how such regulatory networks evolve to give rise to different morphological features.  Since VEGF is also a key player in the development of vascular, nervous, and tracheal networks, this research may help discern functions of this ligand during evolution. An important part of the proposed activities is the development of lab modules that cast sea urchin skeletal morphogenesis in the context of an entry-level chemical and biological engineering/materials science class, the integration of undergraduate researchers in the project, and outreach activities at local high schools using a mobile sea urchin lab.",

This is because many skeletal substances are hierarchically structured composites comprised of biomacromolecules and inorganic compounds, and frequently display properties that are far superior to those of their building blocks. Yet, fundamental aspect of the biological processes that result in the synthesis of such structures remain poorly understood. Activities carried out as part of this proposal revolved around improving our understanding of a very specific aspect of the development of spicules in the sea urchin embryo. Spicules are constructed by primary mesenchyme cells (PMC) and consist of a single crystal of calcium carbonate that branches very early in development. In prior work, the research team had linked this branching event to signaling from other cells in the embryo to the PMCs, using a soluble factor, VEGF. Specifically, PMCs, even in vitro, were found to create branching crystals in the presence of a sufficient concentration of VEGF. The primary objective of research team was therefore to elucidate how VEGF signaling affects PMCs at different levels. The intellectual merit of the work performed under this grant is the result of three complementary tasks. In task 1, the team use next generation sequencing to identify genes that were up- or down-regulated in response to VEGF. In task 2, methods were developed to study whether cell-cell interactions are required for PMCs to build spicules in addition to VEGF. This required developing a workflow to manipulate single PMCs in vitro. In task 3, the team analyzed the role of two specific sets of soft cytoskeletal elements, namely actin filaments and microtubules are involved in the generation of spicules generally and branching in particular. This was done using a combination of fluorescence microscopy and biological transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Taken together the team made progress towards connecting gene regulatory circuits with cellular mechanisms and behaviors that are involved in creating the branching skeletal element. Looking forward, this will help define the elementary structural processes inside the PMCs and connect the morphogenetic events inside the cell with the control over crystal growth that is the focus of interdisciplinary interest. Broader impacts of the work carried out under this grant are related to the impact on multiple communities that do not normally interact. The work created cross-training opportunities for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows. For example, an undergraduate student with a background in biology was exposed to analysis of the crystalline spicules, and a Hispanic-American graduate student from Materials Science and Engineering was deeply involved in the analysis of the impact of cytoskeletal proteins on crystal growth. Even the PI benefited directly by participating in a course on quantitative analysis of RNA sequencing data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/01/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Derk&nbsp;Joester</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1456837/1456837_10382189_1575238115439_VEGF--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1456837/1456837_10382189_1575238115439_VEGF--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Branching morphogenesis in the sea urchin embryo.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1456837/1456837_10382189_1575238115439_VEGF--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Branching morphogenesis in the sea urchin embryo.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Strongylocentrotus purpuratus primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) deposit branching spicules when treated with recombinant VEGF.
