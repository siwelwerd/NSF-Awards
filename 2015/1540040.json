 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Arizona State University IUCRC site of the Net-centric and Cloud Software and Systems (NCSS) I/UCRC will transition to a Phase 2 Site. The NCSS involves University of North Texas (Lead Site), Southern Methodist University, University of Texas at Dallas, Missouri University of S&T and Arizona State University. The site has already established the necessary intellectual base and marketing infrastructure to attract and retain industry partners for Phase 2, and has an excellent track record of industry membership and engagement within the NCSS. Networked sensing systems are important in homeland security, Net Centric defense systems, industry applications, health monitoring and other areas. The Phase 2 center will enable the creation of new capabilities in sensor signal processing and will bridge the gap between sensor development and large scale sensor deployment. The center is uniquely positioned to promote fundamental research, education, scholarship, and industry activities in an innovative manner that will continue integrating well in the existing Net-Centric umbrella. \r\n\r\nWith the NCSS, this Site focuses on research areas such as digital signal and image processing, sensor networks, information technologies and algorithm and cloud software development for wireless communications.  Specific areas of planned research advances and contributions include:  a) Advances in radar direction of arrival estimation using virtual sensor arrays, b) development of networked sensor monitoring algorithms and cloud software which predict process failures, c) fault detection in sensors monitoring networked PV arrays, d) networked imaging sensors for activity detection, and e) net centric approaches with camera arrays for image understanding.",

Specific research problems that our I/UCRC site worked on include: information extraction, wireless transmission, signal processing, machine learning, and interpretation of signals acquired from integrated sensing systems. Such sensing systems are important in the defense, sustainability and healthcare areas and in a variety of important industry applications requiring AI-based research and analytics. &nbsp;During the Phase 2 of this I/UCRC program, the ASU NCSS site signed I/UCRC membership agreements with several companies including: Alphacore,&nbsp; CI Labs, Intel, Lightsense, NXP, ON Semi, Prime Solutions Group, Poundra, Qualcomm, Raytheon, Resonea, Samsung, and Sprint (now T-Mobile).&nbsp; In Phase 2 (2016-2022), the ASU I/UCRC SenSIP site trained more than fifty PhD and Masters students several of whom are working in high-tech companies.&nbsp;The center also hosted an NSF SenSIP REU site that trained a diverse group of more than forty students.&nbsp; Four former students of the PI have started their own companies and three others have been hired as tenure-track faculty. The center has also established internships with industry partners.</p>\n<p>Capabilities and facilities established during the I/UCRC Phase 2 award enabled us to establish&nbsp; several other NSF projects including: CPS, RAPID, IUSE, IRES, MRI, RET and REU. In addition, sponsored international collaborations have been formed with Dublin City University, Imperial College, Tec de Monterrey, and University of Cyprus. All international collaborations had outcomes in terms of research, publications and student internships/visits. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Faculty affiliated with this ASU site, have developed intellectual property in digital signal processing machine learning, imaging, solar energy monitoring and sensor systems. In all, more than twenty US patents were established and several pre-disclosures were filed by the PI and his colleagues. Center projects have been established in several research areas that involve signal processing, machine learning, PV monitoring, quantum computing and sensor systems.&nbsp;Collaborative research in these areas resulted in establishing publications and book monographs.&nbsp;Recent work in quantum machine learning brought in research sponsorship from General Dynamics and NSF.&nbsp; Additional sponsored work in software defined imaging and calibration of accelerometers was also part of our Phase 2 activities. Sustainability endeavors of the center include a project on embedding sensors and machine learning algorithms in utility-scale photovoltaic arrays (efforts supported by NSF GOALI and Poundra LLC). In all, more than twenty five annual core research projects have been established by the center during Phase 1 and Phase 2 at the ASU I/UCRC site.</p>\n<p>Important facilities established include a dedicated LTE picocell, an 18kW solar monitoring facility at the ASU MTW, privileged access to the ASU IBM quantum hub, and several GPU-enabled computing facilities for deep learning research.&nbsp; The Phase 2 site continued its outreach to several high schools and community colleges and an NSF RET project for teachers was established.&nbsp; Research activities with industry and research sponsors will continue after phase 2 and updates and new results will be posted at <a href=\"http://sensip.asu.edu/\">http://sensip.asu.edu</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 05/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Andreas&nbsp;S&nbsp;Spanias</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1540040/1540040_10398027_1685303607976_ASUSENSIPNCSSMEMBERSHIPSITEScreenShot2023-05-28at12.36.55PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1540040/1540040_10398027_1685303607976_ASUSENSIPNCSSMEMBERSHIPSITEScreenShot2023-05-28at12.36.55PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Membership History of ASU I/UCRC Site.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1540040/1540040_10398027_1685303607976_ASUSENSIPNCSSMEMBERSHIPSITEScreenShot2023-05-28at12.36.55PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Membership History of ASU I/UCRC Site.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This chart shows the industry members of the ASU I/UCRC site during the Phase 1 and Phase 2 periods.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">ASU SenSIP</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Andreas&nbsp;S&nbsp;Spanias</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Membership History of ASU I/UCRC Site.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1540040/1540040_10398027_1685305428294_sensipmeetings2023--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1540040/1540040_10398027_1685305428294_sensipmeetings2023--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"I/UCRC IAB meetings at ASU\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1540040/1540040_10398027_1685305428294_sensipmeetings2023--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"I/UCRC IAB meetings at ASU\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The picture shows one of our I/UCRC industry Advisory Board (IAB) meetings at the ASU University Club.
