 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study will test a long-standing concept in ecology that if two species utilize very similar resources, either one or both will evolve to use different resources, or one will be driven locally extinct. This concept is foundational to our understanding of how biological communities are organized. Using microbes found in the water-filled leaves of pitcher plants, this project will test this principle and its predictions about how species interactions evolve. A novel experimental approach will be used that compares the evolution of multiple species occurring in communities of increasing species diversity. Much of community ecology assumes that each species has its own ideal ecological role, called the niche, and that evolution can lead species to change their niche to limit resource competition from other species.  Darwin's finches provide a good example, where these bird species evolved to be more different when together on islands, as compared to when they were alone.  However, predictions about the evolution of the niche become more difficult in complex communities where many species may evolve at the same time. In addition to conducting greenhouse experiments involving pitcher plant microbial communities, the PIs will train undergraduate and graduate students as well as develop educational activities that target Florida science standards.    \r\n\r\nThis work will address long-standing hypotheses that competition leads to niche partitioning and character displacement. The evolutionary patterns of protozoa species will be quantified in 1-, 2, and 4-species communities, using pitcher plants grown in the greenhouse. This design can be used to ask if species evolve differently in communities of increasing complexity. The theory of niche partitioning, which is thought to lead to coexistence, will be supported if species co-evolve to have reduced competitive interactions, while niche convergence would be supported if increased competitive interactions evolve in multispecies systems.  Specific traits such as cell size and other physical characteristics associated with feeding in the protozoa will also be quantified. Next-generation DNA sequencing will be used to quantifying how the protozoa evolving in different combinations affect the underlying bacterial community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nRecently, there has been a lot of interest in the intersection between ecology and evolution.  All natural systems are the result of ongoing evolution and, so, to understand the current state of natural communities, we need to understand both past and ongoing evolutionary processes.  This study is one of the first studies of ongoing evolution in multi-species communties, asking in part how the evolution might change when more species are interacting simultaneously.\n\nSuch studies are best conducted wtih naturally co-evolved species that have relatively short life-spans to allow for sufficient time to observe evolutionary change.  We chose to work with the small aquatic communities that occur in the purple pitcher plant.  This is a well-studied experimental system that can be maintained in the greenhouse under relatively natural conditions.  Each leaf contains a little food web that has a top predator of mosquito larvae, which feed on rotifers, protozoa, and mites, which all in turn feed on bacteria (see image of the inquiline food web).  These bacteria break down the prey captured by these carnivorous plants, releasing nutrients that can then be used by the plant.\n\nWe chose to follow the evolution in a suite of protozoa by creating communities in leaves in the greenhouse that had either one, two, or four species of protozoa, then comparing traits of these species both before and after 12 weeks growing together (see image of plants in the greenhouse).  We also can compare the effects these species have on their resources by sequencing the bacterial communities both before and after selection.  The 12 weeks provides about 250 generations over which evolution may occur.  From previous work, we predicted that (1) species that were poorer competitors would evolve faster than those which were better competitors due to the frequency of intra- versus interspecific section and (2) that more species would interfere with selection, ultimately slowing evolution as diversity increased.\n\nThese predictions were largely supported.  Initially poorer competitors did evolve to become perform better in competition, while dominant species appeared to not evolve at all.  Further, the effects of diversity on the rate of evolution was non-additive; that is, more species did not result in greater rates of evolution.  These results are important extended what we know about evolution in one- and two species mixtures into more realistic multispecies communities.\n\nWe had two broader impact projects.  Precovid, we worked with several local schools to bring students out into the local forests where pitcher plant bogs occur.   We helped the students to experience ecosystems at various scales, from the entire long-leaf forests of North Florida, to the bogs with interesting carnivorous plants and orchids, to the individual leaves with the unique little aquatic communities.  Covid created social distancing concerns, so we switched to just bringing teachers into the field and providing experiences and materials for these teachers to take back to their own students, both online and in person.
