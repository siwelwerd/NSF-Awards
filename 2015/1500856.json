 "awd_abstract_narration": "Combinatorics considers finite structures, many of which play a crucial role in problems that arise in science and technology.  Preeminent among these structures are finite binary sequences (strings of zeroes and ones) that are used in the communications networks, cryptographic systems, remote sensing, acoustic design, and efficient operation of scientific instrumentation.  Other finite structures arising from polynomials, sets, and graphs also find use in a wide variety of technological and scientific endeavors.  To achieve an engineering goal or understand a natural process, one must often find the structures that are extremal (minimal or maximal) with respect to a certain feature.  For example, we might seek a family of binary sequences that resemble each other as little as possible in order avoid mutual interference in a multi-user communications network: this is the problem of low correlation.  The solutions to such extremal problems often involve mathematical objects with a large amount of structure. This research project aims to investigate some problems in extremal combinatorics and the mathematical structures involved in these extremal problems.\r\n\r\nThe organizing principle of this project is to investigate important problems in pure mathematics involving highly structured discrete objects, many of which are of great interest in science and technology.  For example, the problem of minimizing aperiodic autocorrelation of binary sequences is of vital importance in engineering applications like remote sensing and communication.  Later, physicists noted that the minima describe the ground states of certain systems in statistical physics.  Yet the problem is also related to questions in harmonic analysis raised by Littlewood in 1966 and still actively researched, with recent contributions from the principal investigator that are being further developed.  Problems such as this are rich in connections to other branches of mathematics, because the optimal or best known discrete structures for them often come from fields like number theory, algebra, or geometry.  For example, the sequences with lowest known asymptotic aperiodic autocorrelation derive from the Fekete polynomials in analytic number theory.  The Weil sums studied in this project originate in number theory and arithmetic algebraic geometry: they provide a method for counting points on curves over finite fields.  In technology, they determine the nonlinearity of functions used in cryptography, the weight distribution of error-correcting codes, and the cross-correlation properties of linear recursive sequences over finite fields.  New techniques to bound the maximum number of instances of a pattern in a finite set of points in the plane utilize diverse techniques that range from order relations to topological arguments.  The interplay of all these ideas, pure and applied, leads to a mutual enrichment of mathematics, engineering, and science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to generate and characterize highly structured mathematical objects that achieve some design goal, such as avoiding self-similarity (e.g., sequences with low autocorrelation) or avoiding mutual similarity (e.g., sequence pairs with low crosscorrelation).  The primary purpose of this project was to advance the state of knowledge in collaborations with students, thus allowing them to experience research that will prepare and encourage them to consider becoming researchers in mathematics, science, and engineering.\n\nSequences of binary digits are used to modulate signals in digital communications and remote sensing.  In a multi-user communications network, one needs many sequences (for the many users) that do not resemble each other and do not resemble time-delayed versions of each other.  Sequences with low mutual resemblance at all time-delays are said to have low crosscorrelation demerit factor.  The PI provided a rigorous analysis of the crosscorrelation of an important family of sequences called m-sequences, and discovered that although most pairs of m-sequences have roughly average crosscorrelation performance (represented by the large lobe in Figure 1), there are some pairings that have significantly better than average performance (evidenced by the small lobe to the left of the main one in the same figure, indicating less mutual resemblance than average).\n\nThere is also the problem of autocorrelation, which determines how much a sequence resembles time-delayed versions of itself: it is important that this resemblance be low in systems that require synchronization, such as radar.  Sequences that perform well in this regard are said to have low autocorrelation demerit factor.  Kelly T. R. Boothby and the PI found pairs of sequences (derived from number-theoretic sources called finite field characters) that simultaneously have exceptionally low autocorrelation and crosscorrelation.  A combined measure smallness of autocorrelation and crosscorrelation performance, called the Pursley-Sarwate criterion, is about 2 for randomly selected sequences, but Boothby and the PI found some sequence pairs with Pursley-Sarwate criterion around 7/6, which is far superior, since the theoretical minimum is known to be 1.  They proved theorems that describe the performance of such sequences in the limit as the sequences become very long.  The performance is measured with autocorrelation and crosscorrelation demerit factors, with low values indicating superior performance.  See Figures 2 and 3, where the horizontal dimension tracks specific parameters used to enumerate the sequence pairs under consideration and the vertical dimension tracks demerit factors.  These show that the limiting values of demerit factors from the theorems of Boothby and the PI (shown as curves) are actually quite good predictors of the performance of sequences of modest length (shown as data points).\n\nLee, Trunov, and the PI studied the correlation behavior of another family of sequences called the Rudin-Shaprio-like sequences.  Lee, Trunov, and the PI discovered that it is possible to find pairs of these sequences that have an even lower Pursley-Sarwate criterion than the sequences discovered by Boothby and the PI.  This trend of improvement finds its definitive end in the work of Moore and the PI, who found a precise classification of the sequences that have Pursley-Sarwate criterion exactly equal to the best possible value of 1.  The optimum sequence pairs are called Golay complementary pairs, of which infinitely many are known to exist.\n\nThe sequences mentioned up to this point have been non-repeating, or aperiodic, sequences.  There are also periodic sequences, and their correlation properties are also important in information theory.  Furthermore, knowing the crosscorrelation performance of periodic m-sequences is equivalent to knowing about the nonlinearity of permutations of finite fields of interest to cryptographers.  The mathematical objects that link these problems are called Weil sums of binomials.  Analysis of the information-theoretic and cryptographic properties mentioned above often relies on knowledge about the divisibility of a given family of Weil sum by powers of a certain prime number.  Langevin, Lee, Sapozhnikov, and the PI were able to prove an upper bound on how many powers of the prime can simultaneously divide all the Weil sums in certain families.\n\nOne of the main tools in the study of correlation is discrete Fourier analysis, so there is an interest in advancing our basic knowledge in this area.  Garcia, Karaali, and the PI proved uncertainty principles for the discrete cosine and sine transforms and many other relatives of the Fourier transform over finite fields.  Such results show that a nonzero function cannot simultaneously be highly localized and have a highly localized Fourier transform.\n\nThe PI collaborated with many researchers, including fourteen students from California State University, Northridge, on the problems investigated in this project.  Many of the PI's undergraduate collaborators have gone on to graduate school, and some of the students who worked on this project are now perusing doctoral degrees.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel Katz"
