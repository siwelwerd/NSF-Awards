 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ice-core records are critical to understanding past climate variations. An Antarctic ice core currently being drilled at the South Pole will allow detailed investigation of atmospheric gases and fill an important gap in understanding the pattern of climate variability across Antarctica. Critical to the interpretation of any ice core are: 1) accurate chronologies for both the ice and the trapped gas and 2) demonstration that records from the ice core reliably reflect climate. The proposed research will improve the ice and gas chronologies by making measurements of snow compaction in the upstream catchment in order to constrain age models of the ice. These measurements will be a key data set needed for better understanding and predicting time-varying conditions in the upper part of the ice sheet. The research team will measure the modern spatial gradients in accumulation rate, surface temperature, and water stable isotopes from shallow ice cores in the upstream catchment in order to determine the climate history from the ice-core record. The new ice-flow measurements will make it possible to define the path of ice from upstream to the South Pole ice-core drill site to assess spatial gradients in snowfall and to infer histories of snowfall from internal layers within the ice sheet.  The project will be led by an early-career scientist, provide broad training to graduate students, and engage in public outreach on polar science.\r\n\r\nIce-core records of stable isotopes, aerosol-born particles, and atmospheric gases are critical to understanding past climate variations. The proposed research will improve the ice and gas chronologies in the South Pole ice core by making in situ measurements of firn compaction in the upstream catchment to constrain models of the gas-age ice-age difference. The firn measurements will be a key data set needed to form a constitutive relationship for firn, and will drive better understanding and prediction of transient firn evolution. The research team will measure the modern gradients in accumulation rate, surface temperature, and water stable isotopes in the upstream catchment to separate spatial (advection) variations from temporal (climate) variations in the ice-core records. The ice-flow measurements will define the flowline upstream of the drill site, assess spatial gradients in accumulation, and infer histories of accumulation from radar-observed internal layers. Results will directly enhance interpretation of South Pole ice-core records, and also advance understanding of firn densification and drive next-generation firn models.",

This project contributed to these two needs in order to enhance the interpretation of the South Pole ice core record. In addition, the field-data collection, data analysis, and modeling conducted as part of this project have advanced understanding of how snow densifies to ice - termed firn densification. The work has also improved understanding of the history of climate and ice-flow of the South Pole. This was a collaborative research project between the University of Washington and Dartmouth College, with field support from the U.S. Antarctic Program.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Since the South Pole is at least 180 km from an ice-flow divide, ice drilled at the South Pole ice core site originated upstream from the drill site. This research helped determine what changes in the ice-core climate histories were due to actual climate change at the South Pole, and which ones were due to the ice having originated upstream in a different climate. The work also allowed a novel method for determining the ice flow history. Using the first network of surface-velocity measurements, this project showed that the flow direction has been largely unchanged for the past 10,000 years while flow speeds have increased slightly during that time. This analysis also showed that most of the variations of layer thickness in the South Pole Ice core result from ice flow rather than variations in accumulation through time. These results provide new data that can help improve models of ice flow over the last 10,000 years.</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In addition, this project studied the uppermost part of an ice sheet, called the firn layer, which consists of snow that is compacting into ice. Atmospheric gas can be exchanged through the firn and is not trapped in the ice until the firn is fully compacted. This physical process takes time and the compaction rate depends on many factors, but understanding the process is necessary to (1) constrain the age of the trapped gas in ice cores and (2) interpret measurements of ice sheet surface elevation change from satellite altimetry. However, firn-compaction measurements are sparse, especially on the Antarctic Plateau, and more data are needed to advance firn models. This project measured firn-compaction rates and firn temperatures continuously for two years, as well as density from firn cores. This suite of data provided critical constraints to better understand the physical processes controlling firn densification, allowed us to test existing firn-compaction models and contributed to the development of a new firn model.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The broader scientific impacts included collaboration with and contribution to the South Pole ice core project, including involving students and postdocs in research activities of the ice-core community.

This project engaged early-career researchers to address questions of past climate change and ice dynamics, as well as trained multiple graduate students and postdocs in field work, instrumentation, data analysis, and modeling. Central to the broader impacts is that new understanding of Antarctic history, ice-sheet processes, and ice-core records has broad appeal to public audiences, and the project team shared the outcomes widely.
