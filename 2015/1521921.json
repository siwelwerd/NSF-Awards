The goals of doctoral consortium are for students to discuss research, have an opportunity to talk about their research, build professional connections with other researchers, and receive individual mentoring from a senior member of the community.  \r\n\r\nThe outcomes of the project will be assessed with pre- and post-surveys administered to the students.  Special efforts will be made to select students from underrepresented groups and from smaller groups who have fewer opportunities to interact with international researchers.  Participation will help graduate students network with other researchers, and develop into global scientists.  In the longer term, this will help advance science and high-tech industry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project funded a selected group of Ph.D. students from the US to attend the Doctoral Mentoring Consortium at the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI), which was held in Buenos Aires, Argentina,  July 25th to July 31st, 2015. \n\nThe Doctoral Mentoring Consortium consisted of a full day of activities, including an invited speaker who talked about the process of develooping and writing the PhD dissertation,  a career panel, short talks by the students who had an extended abstract on their research accepted for publication in the conference proceedings, and poster presentations.\n\nSharing research ideas and collaborating on research projects across national boundaries is becoming critical to accelerate the research progress, avoid duplication, and produce a greater return on investment.  The fact the Doctoral Consortium included students who are not studying in the US (none of which funded under this grant) exposed the students to different cultures and broadened their professional networks outside their own institution and their own country, preparing the foundations for long term international cooperation and better cultural awareness.\n\nThe students funded by this project have received unique and highly valuable training.  A valuable part of training new researchers is giving them the opportunity to interact with leaders in their research field outside their own research group.  This helps the students to see their work in a broader context, gives them opportunities to receive feedback, and enhances their independence as researchers.  The students also had multiple opportunities to extend their professional network to other students and senior researchers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Maria L Gini"
