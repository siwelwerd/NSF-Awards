It is also not clear how motivating, inspiring, and/or effective these education tools are to general users, especially novice users who have rarely dealt with privacy issues.   \r\n\r\nThrough interdisciplinary research between a computer scientist and two social scientists, this project aims to exploit both group-sourcing and crowdsourcing approaches to develop effective education tools for online privacy. Research activities include: (1) designing novel methods to generate collective wisdom from non-expert user groups for the development of innovative ideas of privacy education tools; (2) investigating the main characteristics of a wise group that is capable of developing creative and high-quality ideas for privacy training; (3) developing methods to enhance the originality and practicality of the ideas generated by the non-expert groups; and (4) integrating group-sourcing, crowdsourcing, and experts' opinions to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed privacy training tools.\r\n\r\nThis interdisciplinary, high-risk, high-payoff project will dramatically advance  research in security/privacy and social science. The research results will be disseminated broadly through curricular materials appropriate for computer science, College of Arts and Letters, and MBA students.",
