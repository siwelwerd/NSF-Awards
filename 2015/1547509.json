This meeting focuses on security within the individual architectures of each project, future systems research topics, and a meeting for students from the various FIA projects to discuss their specific research projects.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:  The discussion of security issues is intended to summarize and explore security design choices within each of the funded FIA network designs. The results of this workshop should serve to better understand the implications of security issues, and to improve communication and understanding between the design teams.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: The broader goal of the NSF FIA program is enhancing the relevance and impact of the NSF program of network research, intellectual enrichment of the network research community, and the contribution of new concepts and thought leadership to the future of the Internet. The program, and the workshops in particular, are a means to train a cohort of academic network researchers in the practice of long-range architectural thinking. The program has the potential to contribute to a future Internet that is materially more secure, robust, economically viable, and fit for the needs of society than the Internet of today. The results of this workshop, which will be posted on the FIA website http://www.nets-fia.net/ for public dissemination, will be a contribution to this broader goal.",
