Current research topics that will continue during the extension period include nano-electronics devices, simulations of electrodes and ion movement in supercapacitors, and development of electrochemical biosensors. In addition, education and outreach activities conducted with PENN will continue. The PENN-UPRH PREM has been very successful in recruiting minority students for careers in materials science. A total of 14 new PhDs have graduated from PREM students and 23 are currently in graduate programs in the USA and Puerto Rico.",
