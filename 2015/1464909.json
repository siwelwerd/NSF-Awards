The field of dusty plasmas constitutes a fully developed interdisciplinary field with direct connections to astrophysics, nanoscience, fluid mechanics and colloidal physics through experimental, theoretical and computational studies. This workshop will bring together researchers from around to the world to (1) provide a review of recent advances in the field of dusty plasmas, (2) help to define new and existing research questions and challenges and (3) help to strengthen the interaction between dusty plasma researchers and facilitate interactions between the field of dusty plasmas and other related research disciplines.  The involvement of graduate students will contribute to the formation of the next generation of scientists working in this area.",
