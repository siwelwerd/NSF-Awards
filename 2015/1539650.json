 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a conference on algebraic combinatorics and applications, to be held at Michigan Technological University, Houghton, Michigan, during August 26-30, 2015. Various structures studied in algebraic combinatorics, such as combinatorial designs, finite geometries, and graphs, have found applications in designing error-correcting codes that provide for reliable transmission of digital data, and for maintaining the integrity of data recorded on CDs, DVDs, hard drives, and flash memory devices.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this conference is to bring together researchers and graduate students interested in algebraic combinatorics and its applications to communications, error-correcting codes, cryptography, and information security, in order to promote new linkages and collaborations. The conference will provide opportunities for research faculty and graduate students to learn about the latest developments in these areas, and explore different visions for future work. The list of speakers will include representatives from both the theoretical and applied communities; the interactions with experts from the applied communities will prove particularly beneficial for faculty and graduate students specializing in the area of discrete mathematics, who wish to learn more about the contemporary applications of algebraic combinatorics.\r\n\r\nThe conference webpage is at www.math.mtu.edu/~tonchev/aca015.htm",
