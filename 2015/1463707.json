 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Division of Chemistry is funding Professor Richard R. Schrock of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to carry out fundamental studies on olefin metathesis catalysts based on the two earth abundant elements, molybdenum and tungsten. Olefin metathesis is a reaction that consists of breaking and rearranging carbon-carbon double bonds in organic molecules. The olefin metathesis reaction has revolutionized the synthesis of organic molecules relevant to natural and unnatural products for treatment of diseases such as cancers and AIDS, as well as the synthesis of specialty materials.  Professor Schrock is studying ways to make the catalysts more reactive, selective, and durable than any previous catalysts. The broader impacts of the research could be wide ranging in terms of furthering the role of olefin metathesis in chemical science, advancing commercial uses of olefin metathesis, and training and educating students.\r\n\r\nThe Schrock research group is performing synthetic, mechanistic, structural, and reactivity studies of newly designed catalysts for the olefin metathesis reaction. Four new catalyst classes are being investigated with a focus on several specific challenges in olefin metathesis catalysis:  synthesizing new oxo alkylidene complexes of tungsten that are activated through binding of a Lewis acid to the oxo ligand; supporting well-defined oxo alkylidene metathesis catalysts on silica; developing  imido alkylidene catalysts that contain a sterically demanding 2,6-disubstituted phenylimido ligands in order to limit reactions to ones in which only anti-alkylidene isomers can form; and creating potentially more reactive, coordinatively unsaturated cationic complexes paired with a weakly coordinating anion.  Heterogeneous metathesis catalysts are employed for the largest volume metathesis reactions, but the least is known about how to prepare them as single, well-defined species on the surface and to control their reactivity at a molecular level. This research has the potential to generate new classes of metathesis catalysts and advance the general understanding of metathesis chemistry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n This project was aimed at developing a fundamental understanding of a catalytic reaction in which carbon-carbon double bonds can be rearranged to form a different set of carbon-carbon double bonds, and that employ catalysts that contain molybdenum (Mo) or tungsten (W).  The reaction was discovered approximately fifty years ago and is called the Olefin Metathesis Reaction.  Beginning in the mid 1980's catalysts were prepared and the principles established for carrying out the many variations of the basic metathesis reaction.  These catalysts contain a metal-carbon double bond and the crucial step is a combination of a metal-carbon double bond and a carbon-carbon double bond to form an intermediate that contains the metal and four carbon atoms in a four-membered ring.   \n\n         The major finding in the last years of research in olefin metathesis have been a method of making selectively two types of new carbon-carbon double bonds.  One is called a cis C=C bond.  The ability to make solely cis C=C bonds has been an outstanding goal in the field for nearly fifty years.  The other type that can now be made selectively is a trans C=C bond.  The ability to make one or the other is crucial to the synthesis of one product instead of a mixture.   \n\n         Olefin metathesis has been said to be one the most significant contributions to chemistry in the last 50 years.  It has revolutionized much of organic chemistry and polymer chemistry and has led commercial processes in the areas of seed oils, fragrances, polymers, materials, and pharmaceuticals.  A measure of the importance of this work was a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2005 \"for the development of the metathesis method in organic synthesis\" (shared by myself, R. H. Grubbs and Y. Chauvin).  A Nobel Prize is typically for work that is judged to be of greatest benefit to mankind. \n\n         So far I have supervised a total of 81 PhD students and a total of 112 postdoctoral students.  As of this writing research in this and related areas have led to a total of 608 publications.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/18/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard R Schrock"
