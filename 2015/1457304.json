 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability of many animals to navigate through their environment far exceeds what humans are able to do without the help of technology. Exceptional navigation is not limited to animals with large brains, like birds and mammals. It can also be found in animals with simpler nervous systems. The tropical amblypygid, a scorpion-like animal, is able to find its way home at night through dense, tropical forest understory.  The study of how different types of sensory information (visual, chemical, tactile) are processed by amblypygids as they solve navigation problems can reveal fundamental design properties of simple nervous systems that are somehow capable of controlling complex, learned behavior. These design properties can inspire engineering solutions applicable to robotic and artificial intelligence systems. The study of charismatic tropical amblypygids also serves as an alluring gateway for teachers to introduce K-12 students to the importance of neuroscience for understanding how organisms acquire and process information from their environment and how this information influences learning and memory. To support engagement with K-12 students, their teachers and the general public, researchers supported by this grant will develop internet-based educational materials in both English and Spanish. \r\n\r\nBy conducting behavioral experiments that assess amblypygid (Phrynus pseudoparvulus) movements after displacement from a home refuge, researchers will assess the relative importance of visual, chemical and mechanical information in supporting navigation. These experiments will either involve manipulation of animal sense organs or the sensory cues in their environment. The neurobiological work will focus on a brain area known as \"mushroom bodies\", which are thought to support spatial memory. In parallel with the behavioral work, researchers will explore the nervous system routes by which information from different sensory stimuli is sent to the mushroom bodies. Particular attention will be given to how the mushroom bodies \"engineer\" or \"integrate\" the different sensory inputs.  The integration of sensory inputs is hypothesized to be necessary to support complex navigation and will likely have applied potential for design of sophisticated artificial systems. Finally, the importance of the mushroom bodies in navigation, and their capacity to combine different sources of sensory information, will be tested under the same conditions of the behavioral experiments noted above, except using animals whose mushroom bodies are impaired.",

Whip spiders, related to true spiders, are a notable example of a nocturnal navigator capable navigating back to their home refuge even after being taken to locations they have never been before 10 meters or more from home.

Most of our research was carried out in a lab setting using arenas designed to enable experimental subjects to learn the sensory properties of a home refuge where they could escape from light. We have shown that when presented alone, whip spiders can use olfactory, tactile and visual information to navigate to and recognize a home refuge, but perhaps surprisingly, they do not seem to be able to use variation in the ambient magnetic field. Of more importance, we have shown that when a refuge is characterized by two sensory qualities of different modalities, in our case olfactory and tactile, whip spiders learn to recognize a shelter by integrating information from both sensory cues resulting in neither of the single sensory inputs by themselves now being sufficient for recognition. However, in the case of learning two sensory cues of the same modality, in this case two olfactory stimuli, the same kind of integration does not take place.
