 "awd_abstract_narration": "How complex traits and behaviors originate and diversify during evolution is a major question in biology. Bioluminescence, the production of light by living organisms, occurs in many different animal taxa. Marine ostracods, tiny shrimp-like crustaceans, use light for both avoiding predators and for behavioral displays. Over 64 bioluminescent flashing patterns have been observed throughout the Caribbean but only one third of the species have been collected and described scientifically. The proposed research will bring together a group of collaborators from institutions in Wisconsin and California to investigate the diversity of bioluminescent ostracods in the Caribbean and address how bioluminescence and complex behavioral displays have evolved within the group. Research will involve students and faculty at multiple stages in their careers, archivists of digital and morphological materials, and members of the science education media. The timing of this research is especially crucial as the assembled team of researchers includes two emeritus experts on bioluminescent ostracods who will participate in field collections and taxonomy workshops. The products of this research will include a diverse group of newly trained undergraduate and graduate students, a large comprehensive data set of newly described species that will be shared publically through museum and online curation, advancement in the bioinformatic analysis of transcriptome DNA and behavioral traits, and a better understanding of the link between genetics and complex trait evolution. \r\n\r\nThis collaborative project by researchers at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse, California State University - Los Angeles, and University of California - Santa Barbara will use a diverse set of complimentary techniques to investigate phylogenetic relationships within Cypridinidae and the evolution of bioluminescence and complex behavioral displays.  Specific aims are: 1) to reconstruct a new data rich phylogeny of Cypridinidae based on transcriptome datasets from 71 different species, 2) calculate divergence times and diversification rates within the group, 3) test for correlation between bioluminescent behavioral displays and diversification rates, and 4) investigate the molecular evolution of luciferase, the protein that catalyzes the light reaction. Understanding the biochemical origins and properties of luminescent chemicals is important because cypridinid luciferases are widely used as reporter genes in molecular biology and medicine.",

Bioluminescence is widely used in biomedicine and biotechnology, for example to image live tumors or to track when genes are being used by cells. It can also be used to monitor pollutants in the environment. Biologists have long been interested in knowing how bioluminescence evolves, and how using bioluminescence for defense and communication improves the survival and reproductive success of species. When considering the evolutionary relationships among all life forms on the tree of life, the ability to glow appears to be scattered throughout the branches of the tree. Light production has evolved independently in at least 50 different groups of organism including bacteria, fungi, invertebrates, and even in some vertebrates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our project focused on tiny marine crustaceans called cypridinid ostracods (Fig.1), that are found worldwide in marine habitats. The family Cypridinidae contains over 200 species, and about half produce bioluminescence that is chemically different (independently evolved) from any other organism. Cypridinid ostracods produce luciferase and luciferin molecules in glands of a light organ and release them into seawater where the biochemical reaction takes place. Cypridinids can produce a big cloud of blue light to deter predators, or short trails of small clouds to communicate for reproduction (Fig.2). Each different type of courtship display pattern found on a Caribbean coral reef habitat is produced by a single species. Because of their spectacular displays, groups of cypridinid ostracods have been studied within Caribbean coral reefs since the 1980&rsquo;s. Our task was to discover new species of ostracods throughout regions of the Caribbean, describe their morphological features, document where they live, and report the details of their mating displays. We used information from genes to test how the new species are related to known groups, how bioluminescence evolved in the group, and how using light in complex courtship displays influences speciation rates and the origin of new species.</p>\n<p>Field collections were conducted in Belize, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Panama, and Honduras. Across these locations we discovered 39 new species and documented the unique luminescent behaviors of each (Fig.2). Our work resulted in the description of a new genus containing one new species and 6 previously described species. We improved taxonomic methods for studying ostracods by applying new microscopy approaches.<em> </em>An evolutionary tree of the luminescent ostracods from the Caribbean and related non-luminescent groups showed that bioluminescence evolved only one time in cypridinid ostracods and originally functioned only for defense. The courtship behavior evolved later and is only observed in the Caribbean. Analyses of the display behaviors suggests that direction and pulse duration are the most important traits allowing females to find same-species males. Species living in the same location also differ in the timing at which they begin displaying and specific reef habitat where they are found. We have identified the luciferase genes of multiple species. Comparing them will help us to understand how luciferase evolved, what molecular features are shared among species, and why some courtship display pulses are brighter or faster. Preliminary findings clearly support that there are differences in the chemical interaction of the luciferase and luciferin molecules produced by different species.
