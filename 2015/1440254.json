 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) project will use a global network of radio telescopes employing the sophisticated technique of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) to resolve and image the regions near two nearby supermassive black holes. One in the center of our own Milky Way Galaxy (\"SgrA*\", pronounced \"Sagittarius-A star\") has a mass four million times that of our own Sun; the other, in the center of a massive galaxy 50 million light years away (known as \"M87\"), has a measured mass several billion times that of the Sun. These regions will be imaged at radio wavelengths, showing detail on the scale of the apparent black-hole diameter (\"Event Horizon\"). The study of massive black holes has many applications in astrophysics and is of great popular interest; such objects are thought to fuel the most powerful activity seen in far-distant galaxies. Supermassive black holes are extreme examples of Einstein's theory of General Relativity, but the actual mechanism by which they form remains uncertain. Because of the popularity of black holes, the numerous public outreach efforts of this project will enthrall thousands of members of the general public.\r\n\r\nThe Event Horizon Telescope includes using the recently completed, NSF-funded Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), as well as other large, high-precision radio telescopes worldwide. This project will support assembly of a wideband VLBI correlator to process the torrent (5 Petabytes per session) of EHT data, construction of a VLBI system at the Large Millimeter Telescope (LMT) in Mexico, and development of a robust data processing pipeline. Through these developments, the EHT will track time-variable structure at the Event Horizon of SgrA*, and search for periodic signatures of orbiting inhomogeneities in the innermost accretion flow. Observations of M87 will target study of the jet-launching region of a radio-loud AGN, to cleanly distinguish between models of jet genesis whose predictions differ markedly close to the black hole. New polarimetric EHT data will reveal Schwarzschild scale magnetic structures, providing unique constraints on accretion models, as well as General Relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations. \r\n\r\nThe Event Horizon Telescope will test General Relativity (GR) in the strong gravity limit, and as its ultimate and most fundamental prize, the EHT aims at detecting the signature of the photon orbit (and enclosed \"shadow\") predicted by GR. In addition, while only a few sources can potentially be imaged in the innermost regions, the array has the ability to provide unique and vital time domain information with high angular resolution on the structure and magnetic fields for many other active galactic nuclei (AGN), probing a spatial region of the jet outflow which is very poorly studied with current instrumentation. These topics are all at the forefront of work in AGN physics, and the anticipated data have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of black holes and their environments and to greatly enhance our understanding of the formation and evolution of jetted sources.\r\n\r\nBroader impacts of the work include hands-on training of students and early career scientists in radio astronomy instrumentation and mm/submm interferometry, and those mentored within this project will emerge with unique observational and hardware skills that will be invaluable in the era of ALMA. All EHT data will be made available to the astronomy community, which will maximize its broad astronomical impact across many fields and disciplines, both nationally and internationally. The project includes a public outreach effort through a Scientific American blog, a possible partnership with the Smithsonian Channel, and Center for Astrophysics' traveling exhibition.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a successful effort to make the first image of a black hole.  Black holes are the most mysterious objects in the night sky: caused when sufficient matter is crushed to high enough densities, their gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape.  Astronomers now believe that supermassive black holes, weighing millions or even billions of times more than our sun, reside in the centers of most galaxies.  The EHT project?s goal was to image the strong bending of light around such a black hole to test Einstein?s theory of gravity in the most extreme natural cosmic laboratory, and to prove that supermassive black holes do indeed exist. \n\nTo do this, the EHT developed and installed specialized instrumentation at radio dishes across the globe to record radio waves from the black hole at the center of the Virgo A galaxy, also known as M87.  At each dish, radio waves were captured on high speed recorders and stored on banks of hard disk drives.  Then the data from across the global array were combined at a central supercomputer to create a virtual Earth-sized telescope.  This process of combining data from many dishes is analogous to what a mirror does in an optical telescope, and by making a telescope as large as the Earth, the EHT was able to image the extremely small region surrounding the black hole.\n\nThe team supported by this award joined forces with scientists from around the world, and led this international group to make observations of Virgo A in April 2017.  This award also supported development of novel imaging algorithms to analyze the data and produce the first images.  In April 2019, the EHT team revealed the first image of the Virgo A supermassive black hole (Fig 1), and the announcement was made in multiple international press conferences, with the result that the image was on the front page of most major newspapers (Fig 2).\n\nThe observed ring of light has dimensions that match the predictions of Einstein?s theory, confirming our current ideas of gravity.  These results also confirm theories of how black holes absorb matter around them and grow over cosmic time.  The asymmetric brightness, for example, in the image is due to gas flowing around the black hole at near light-speeds.  On the bottom of the image, the ring is bright because gas is moving towards us, making the emission brighter, and at the fainter portion of the ring near the top of the image is due to the gas there moving away from us.  This circular motion is what one would expect as matter spirals closer and closer to the black hole.  This work has laid the foundations for new projects that will make the first movies of black holes, allowing us to understand how these supermassive black holes can launch jets of material that can disrupt entire galaxies and affect the structure of the night sky. \n\nBy using novel instrumentation at existing radio dishes, the EHT team (Fig 3) made exceptionally efficient use of US and international resources.  Instead of building an entirely new instrument, our team linked over $1 Billion in already-built infrastructure to form the Earth-sized array.  It is likely one of the best science returns on investment in the history of astronomy.  It is hoped that the EHT success, and its international team will serve as an example of how to tackle larger and more complex challenges that face our entire planet.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/21/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sheperd S Doeleman"
