 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract\r\nFilms and membranes are a critical area of chemical and materials research for applications including separations, catalysis, and energy technologies.  The development of new films and membranes that possess next-generation properties will be enabling for many of these applications.  With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, this project will produce a general method for preparing new membrane materials that contain small particles of a highly porous solid imbedded within the membrane.  These membranes will exhibit new and interesting properties that cannot be achieved with existing materials.  We will also use these membranes to demonstrate proof-of-concept studies for their use in removal of toxic molecules from water.  In addition, this proposal includes support for the Science Policy Internship Program, which supports STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) students at the University of California Center in Washington D.C.  The program includes activities such as coursework, seminars, tours, and science policy internships.  This distinctive program engages primarily underrepresented and women students, across the University of California system, toward the goal of creating a generation of scientists that better understand and value their role in society and government.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nThis research program will develop hybrid membranes prepared from both hard metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and soft organic polymers (termed MOF/polymer composite membranes or MPCMs).  A general, versatile, and scalable method has been developed for preparing supported and free-standing MPCMs.  Drop casting combined with 'doctor-blading' methods will be used to create supported and free-standing MPCMs.  This program will develop MPCMs that:  a) can be readily prepared and scaled; b) employ a wide range of MOF materials; and c) can operate as membranes for chemical separations.  This proposal will greatly advance the use of MOFs by establishing a general approach for casting uniform, hybrid films that can be delaminated into robust membranes that can be manipulated, integrated into devices or systems, such that the physical properties of MOFs can be exploited in otherwise inaccessible applications. The utility of these materials will be demonstrated in separations and water purification.",
