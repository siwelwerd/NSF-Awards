 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proteins are the 'workhorse' molecules in cells.  Their interactions with each other, nucleic acids, ligands, and other molecules underlie many important cellular processes.  Therefore, elucidating protein interactions, preferentially at the atomic level, is important to understanding these processes and treating them in diseased cells.  Protein docking achieves the purpose computationally by finding the protein conformation of the lowest free energy values.  Solving such a free energy minimization problem is challenging for two reasons.  First, the search space is extremely high-dimensional because proteins are not rigid bodies but rather flexible when interacting.  Secondly, the free energy function is very costly to evaluate and rugged to optimize. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThe proposed research directly addresses these challenges to protein docking at the refinement stage.  First, the dimension of the search space will be substantially lowered.  Although proteins consist of hundreds to thousands of atoms, not all collective motions of those atoms are physically meaningful.  The proposed methods will decompose the space of collective atomic motions into that of rigid-body motions and that of a few relevant flexibility motions by applying novel normal mode analysis (NMA) tools.  Second, the search efficiency for the energy minimum will be substantially improved.  Energy landscape in the reduced search space will be characterized and state-of-the-art search methods will be applied for energy minimization in the space.  The proposed research will also produce insights on the reduced conformational space of protein interactions and the landscape of free energy functions in the reduced space.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe ability to predict how proteins interact with efficiency and accuracy is of tremendous value to understanding the structural and functional organization of life, developing diagnosis and therapeutics tools to cure diseases, and discovering approaches to improve bioenergy yields.  The proposed research is interdisciplinary and thus expected to be useful to biologists who need protein docking tools to aid their study as well as computer scientists who need to apply or develop dimension reduction and optimization methods.  Project will provide training opportunities to students in developing interdisciplinary skills.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe most abundant molecule only after waters in our bodies, proteins are the \"workhorse\" molecules that enable many daily functions of our bodies: turning genes on or off, responding to bacterial infection, digesting foods, relaying senses to brains, and so on.  At the molecular level, cells can be viewed as systems of biomolecules (including proteins) in reactions and interactions.  Understanding how proteins interact thus help us deeply understand molecular mechanisms of biology and rationally design therapeutic strategies to treat patients. To fulfill this goal, since proteins' functions depend on their 3D shapes (structures), we need computational tools to help predict how proteins interact and form a complex structure (also known as protein docking), especially when not all protein interactions are amenable to high-throughput, direct experiments. \n\nOur overarching goal is to develop computer algorithms for protein docking.  This is similar to but much more difficult than teaching computers to put two pieces of jigzaw puzzles together because of two reasons.  First, how fit two puzzle pieces are together can be quantified by geometric complementarity; but for proteins, the fit depends on complementarity in not only geometry but also physicochemical properties and these complementarity are inaccurate yet costly to evaluate.  Second, proteins do not have rigid shapes as puzzle pieces; in fact, even small proteins consist of thousands of atoms that are mobile but with constraints.  Therefore, from the perspective of computer algorithms, even though protein docking can be re-cast as an optimization problem, solving this optimization problem is very challenging because it is hard to search for the optimum of a noisy and inaccurate landscape in an extremely high-dimensional space.\n\nOur project directly addresses the aforementioned challenge in optimization problems for protein docking.  While taking advantage of state-of-the-art objective functions to optimize, we focus on reducing the dimensionality and narrowing the range of the search space as well as developing efficient optimization methods to navigate the search. First, we have developed a unified framework cNMA (complex-based normal mode analysis) that generates directions better at approximating how proteins change structures during interactions than conventional methods do; for the first time, this framework considers both individual proteins' flexibility and their impact on each other.

Taken together, we have developed dimension reduction, range reduction, and novel optimization methods for efficient protein docking. \n\nOur results have been disseminated to several communities in 7 journal articles and 8 conference presentations so far, including an article published in the most impactful journal in bioinformatics and several talks given at the most selective conferences in the field.  Our codes have been provided with open access on GitHub.com, a popular hosting service for computer codes (https://github.com/Shen-Lab/cNMA/).  We have also made a web server and shared it (https://shen-lab.github.io/software) in a way that any user can install and try the web server on his or her own computer.  A YouTube video was made to help everyone try the web server and see how to calculate, visualize, and analyze our results (https://youtu.be/EWudd774Sm4).\n\nBeing intrinsically inter-disciplinary, our project also generate results that help break the boundaries among disciplines.  Our web server provides a friendly interface for biologists to study cases of their interests using our algorithms.  Our codes lower the barrier for computer scientists to access the challenging field and make their unique contributions.   \n\nThe project has also provided training experiences to 2 postdoctoral researchers, 2 doctoral students, 4 master's students, and 3 undergraduate students, including 2 from historically underrepresented groups in the interface field of bioinformatics.  Many of them had no prior experience in the field but gained interests and fostered skills in the field.  One undergraduate and one master's student are now pursuing advanced education in bioinformatics; 3 master's students are pursuing a career in data science, including one who has graduated and started his first job as a data scientist.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yang Shen"
