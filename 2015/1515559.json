 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will study an important class of massive stars, which have bright eruptions of material from their surface.  These stars are in the last stages of their stellar life cycle, sometimes just before stellar explosions as supernovae (SNe). The investigators will use telescopes of the University of Arizona to study Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) stars. They will study the material ejected around nearby LBVs and the connection between SNe brightnesses. The material from the LBVs appears as bright rings of gas surrounding the stars.  The material is visible in observations with optical telescopes and sensitive cameras.  These observations provide the only way to measure the ejected mass and speed, as well as the typical time period between large eruptions. The investigators will study the environments of LBVs in the Milky Way and nearby galaxies.  \r\n\r\nThe investigator will mentor in CAMPARE, a program that fosters diversity in science by recruiting minorities and statistically underrepresented groups for a summer undergraduate research experience at Steward Observatory.  The investigator will continue as a Sky Ambassador, working with Tucson elementary and high-school science teachers. As part of this program, they will develop instructional materials concerning the Sun and stars, supernovae, and the origin of the elements.  There research program will also fund one Ph.D. thesis and several undergraduate researchers, providing them with experience with complex multi-wavelength observational data and time-variable phenomena. \r\n\r\nThe investigators focus on observations to understand the stellar life cycle and explosive deaths of massive stars, since SNe dominate feedback in galaxies.  SNe enrich the interstellar medium with elements, and they can be used probe conditions in the distant universe. The use of SNe to estimate of distances to galaxies hinges upon understanding the connection between massive stars and the various types of SNe they produce. Eruptive mass loss is influential in stellar evolution, and violent eruptions preceding core collapse can lead to some of the most luminous SNe known. \r\n\r\nThis LBV/SNe connection was initially controversial because stellar models place massive LBVs in an earlier phase, but recently a dramatic confirmation of the connection between LBV stars and SNe was observed.  In 2009 an LBV star was noted in a survey of massive stars, and then in 2012 this star became a core-collapse SNe.  LBV-like eruptions may hold critical clues about stellar instability during the final phases of nuclear burning, vital to understanding core collapse. \r\n\r\nDuring these studies, the investigators will detect a large number of extragalactic transients, and constrain the luminosity, mass-loss rates, duration, and outflow speed of the eruptions. Some of these eruptive transients will soon explode as SNe, so the observations will have tremendous value for understanding the prelude to core collapse of massive stars.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe aim of this project was to study explosive astronomical tranients,\nincluding supernovae and non-supernova transients, and to connect them\nto the late evolution and deaths of various types of massive stars.\nSometimes these explosions mark the final death of a massive star, as\nin a core-collpse supernova, and sometimes they trace a violent but\nnon-terminal event before the supernova, such as a stellar eruption or\na merger of two stars.  We are trying to understand the mapping\nbetween stellar evolution for different mass stars, mass loss, binary\nstar evolution, circumstellar material, and explosive ends.  Evidence\nindicates that massive stars lose mass in steady winds at such a low\nrate that the steady winds are not as important to evolution as\npreviously thought.  Instead, the evolution and fate of massive stars\nis strongly influenced by brief episodes of mass loss, either as\neruptive mass loss events in single stars or binary interaction events\n(mass transfer, common envelopes, mergers).  These brief events happen\nfast andare very rare, so they cannot be studied directly by examining\npopulations of nearby quiescent stars, which is why we focus on\ntransient events.  Explosive transient events are rare in any one\ngalaxy like the Milky Way, but modern sky surveys that search for new\nsources in many nearby galaxies are able to find many examples.  This\nNSF program did not undertake a survey to discover new transient\nsources, but the aim was to use the telescope resources of the\nUniverity of Arizona and other telescopes to obtain detailed followup\nphotometry and spectroscopy of the many transient sourcers being\ndiscovered and reported by existing surveys.  We are also studying\ncircumstellar material around nearby massive stars on a case-by-case\nbasis, and we are investigating the environments of massive stars in\nthe Milky Way and nearby galaxies.\n\nData collected as part of this program used resources such as the\nLarge Binocular Telescopoe (LBT), the 6.5m MMT Observatory, the dual\n6.5m Magellan telescopes at Las Campanas, the 2.3m Bok telescope on\nKitt Peak, the 1.5m Kuiper telescope on Mt. Bigelow, the Hubble Space\nTelescope, and numerous other telescopes with data contributed by\ncollaborators.  Photometric and spectroscopic data sets were collected\nfor well over 100 explosive transient sources, yielding over 100\npapers in refereed journals.  Many of these were papers with a\ndetailed analysis of an individual supernova or other transient event,\nwhile some investigated samples of multiple objects, as well as\nstudies of nearby stars that have suffered historical outbursts (like\nthe massive star Eta Carinae) and massive variable stars in nearby\ngalaxies like the luminous blue variables (LBVs) in the Large\nMagellanic Cloud.  Undergraduate students, graduate students, and\npostdoctoral scholars were involved in the research and led many of\nthe papers.\n\nAlthough the program involved the study of many individual events,\ncollectively there were recurring themes that altered our\nunderstanding of some types of explosive transients.  The main\nemphasis in this study was on supernovae that seem to suffer major\neruptive mass-loss episides shortly (i.e. years to decades) before\ntheir final death, as well as the precursor eruptive events\nthemselves.  The properties of the pre-supernova mass loss are\ninferred from the observable sugnatures of strong shock interaction\nthat occurs as the explosion blast wave sweeps through the surrounding\nmaterial.  One common finding was that from an analysis of the time\nevolution of spectra, it was clear that many of these events are\nhighly asymmetric, with gas and dust surrounding the exploding star\ncommonly showing signs of disk-like or bipolar shapes, rather than\nspherically symmetric.  This is very suggestive that the impulsive,\neruptive mas loss that occurs shortly beforte the SN explosion is\nrelated to violent interactions of two stars in a binary system\n(mergers, stellar collisions, mass transfer events) rather than\nnuclear bursts in single stars.  The reason why this binary\ninteraction occurs shortly before the star's death remains uncertain,\nbut the interaction could be triggered by the swelling of one of the\ntwo stars in its final burning phases.  Another major finding was that\nit was common that the eruptive pre-supernova mass loss was occurring\non longer timescales than previously expected, suchs as decades or\ncenturies (in some cases even millenia), rather than just 1-2 years\nbefore core collapsde.  This definitively rules out some ideas for\ncauses of the pre-supernova eruptive mass loss that are related to the\nvery final nuclear burning stages in the last 1-2 years of a massive\nstar's life, and instead (like the asymmetry mentioned above) strongly\npoints to more prolonged violent binary interaction.  Lastly, another\ncommon result from transient sources was that during the shock\ninteraction between the supernova blast wave and surrounding material,\nobservations showed clear evidence of rapid and efficient formation of\nsolid dust grains in these supernova events, which can make important\ncontributions to the dust production budget in galaxies.  Another\neffort of this program involved studies of massive stars in nearby\ngalaxies and their surrounding environments, some of which are\neruptive variables like LBVs.  A common result of these studies is\nthat the ages of their environments do not agree with the expected age\nof the star based on its luminosity, suggesting that the stars have\nbeen altered by and are products of previous binary interaction\nevents like binary mergers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/15/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nathan Smith"
