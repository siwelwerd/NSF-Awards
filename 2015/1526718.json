 "awd_abstract_narration": "Branchless banking brings much-needed financial services to the unbanked in both the developing\u00a0and developed worlds. Leveraging\u00a0ubiquitous cellular networks, these services are now being deployed as smart\u00a0phone apps, providing an electronic\u00a0payment infrastructure where alternatives such as credit cards\u00a0generally do not exist. Over 30% of the GDP in\u00a0many such nations can now be attributed to\u00a0branchless banking applications, many of which now perform\u00a0more transactions per month\u00a0than traditional payment processors including PayPal. Although widely\u00a0marketed as a more\u00a0secure option to cash, these applications are generally not subject to the traditional\u00a0regulations\u00a0applied in the financial sector, leaving doubt as to the veracity of such claims.\u00a0Accordingly, very little\u00a0is known about the technical security of this revolution in financial services, let alone how it will\u00a0interact with\u00a0the financial infrastructure of the developed world.\u00a0\r\n\r\nThis project is conducting the\u00a0first in-depth security\u00a0analysis of branchless banking applications and their emerging web interfaces. The project is evaluating the current state of security in such systems and developing financial applications with stronger security characteristics.",
