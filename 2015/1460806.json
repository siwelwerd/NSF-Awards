 "awd_abstract_narration": "At this REU Sites called \"A Research Incubator REU Site in Chemistry at Furman University\" funded by the Chemistry Division at the National Science Foundation, Professors Karen L. Buchmueller and colleagues at Furman University will provide research opportunities for ten students for ten weeks. The Site will involve three visiting teams, each consisting of a faculty mentor and two students who will come to Furman each summer to conduct research. Four Furman teams, each consisting of a faculty mentor and one student, will join them. Research topics may be developed independently by the visiting teams, or in collaboration with one of the Furman teams. Early in the summer, a customizable workshop schedule will provide safety and ethics training, career advising and hands-on experience with key analytical instrumentation. Social and outreach activities will complement focused laboratory research to encourage the intellectual development of young scientists. Additional mentor-focused development activities will help to advance long-term sustainable research programs at the partner institutions.\r\n\r\nThis REU Site will serve as a \"research incubator\", resulting in beneficial impacts well beyond the host institution's summer program and the participation of the immediate undergraduate. This will be accomplished by hosting faculty/student teams from partner institutions or schools where internal research activities are limited or non-existent. Potential partners will include 2-year institutions and institutions with diverse student populations. The approach will encourage continued faculty/student research activity after the formal summer program, while simultaneously providing an outstanding experience for those students directly involved in the program.",
