 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cities provide ready and efficient access to facilities and amenities through shared civil infrastructures such as transportation and healthcare. Making such critical infrastructures resilient to sudden changes, e.g., caused by large-scale disasters, requires careful management of limited and varying resources. The rapidly growing big data from both physical sensors and social media in real-time suggest an unprecedented opportunity for information technology to enable increasing efficiency and effectiveness of adaptive resource management techniques in response to sharp changes in supply and/or demand on critical infrastructures. Within the general areas of resilient infrastructures and big data, this project will focus on the integration of heterogeneous Big Data and real-time analytics that will improve the adaptive management of resources when critical infrastructures are under stress. The integration of heterogeneous data sources is essential because many kinds of physical sensors and social media provide useful information on various critical infrastructures, particularly when they are under stress. \r\n\r\nThis Research Coordination Network (RCN) will promote meetings and activities that stimulate and enable new research on integration of heterogeneous physical sensor data and social media for real-time big data analytics in support of resilient critical infrastructures such as transportation and healthcare in smart cities.  As first example, the RCN will support participation from young faculty attending the Early Career Investigators' Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems in Smart Cities (ECI-CPS) at CPSweek (April of each year) and young faculty attending the Workshop on Big Data Analytics for Cyber-physical Systems (BDACPS). As a second example, the RCN will support contributions to a Special Track on Big Data Analytics for Resilient Infrastructures at the IEEE Big Data Congress. As a third example, the RCN will support participation in International meetings organized by other countries, e.g., Japan's Big Data program by Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). The project will also maintain a repository of research resources. Concretely, the RCN will actively collect and make readily available public data sets (e.g., physical and social sensor data) and software tools (e.g., to support real-time big data analytics). The technologies and tools that arise from RCN-enabled research will be applied to socially and economically impactful areas such as reducing congestion and personalized healthcare in smart cities.",
