 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nThis research seeks to improve our understanding of the relationship between Mesoscale Convective Systems (MCSs) and the diurnal cycle of warm season rainfall over sub-Saharan Northern Africa.  The study specifically addresses the observed warm season spatial and temporal distribution of MCSs; as well as how the development, propagation and lifetimes of these systems are influenced by local and regional environmental factors.  This study combines observational analysis with high-resolution mesoscale modeling to advance our understanding of the development of warm season MCSs and their relationship to the daily cycle of precipitation.  \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit\r\nThis study will add to our understanding of rainfall variability, physical mechanisms and the processes associated with these temporal and spatial differences.  The statistics and other metrics that will be developed will have the potential to impact present and/or future development of weather model parameterization schemes. The results will be of importance to rainfall forecasting, which will have implication for communities in the region.  The use of convective-permitting high space-time resolution weather model simulations, with typical parameterization schemes turned off, will allow the explicit calculation of the dynamics needed to generate convection.  \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nImproving empirical and theoretical knowledge of the factors controlling precipitation in sub-Saharan North Africa will allow those living in the area to better anticipate and prepare for periods of both drought and extreme rainfall events. Efforts to accurately reproduce observations with high-resolution weather models will provide guidance on the most appropriate model settings for short-term predictions of the development of large thunderstorm clusters and rainfall in this specific region of the globe.  This project is ideally suited to train graduate students in state-of-the-art observational analysis and atmospheric modeling techniques. Student participation in research activities will assist in the development of important critical thinking and scientific communication skills.  This study offers the opportunity to teach many scientists about the important factors controlling rainfall in this region of Africa.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project improved our understanding about the physical processes important for controlling the development of mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) and role of MCSs in determining the diurnal cycle of precipitation over sub-Saharan Northern Africa.  MCSs are clusters of organized thunderstorms over a space scale larger than an individual thunderstorm that generally last longer than a typical individual thunderstorm.  Over sub-Saharan Northern Africa we found that MCSs are associated with a significant amount of the total rainfall, and that attributes of MCSs, including size, count, and intensity vary synchronously with the diurnal as well as annual cycle of rainfall.  Furthermore, peaks in rainfall activity at different times of the day for a given location can directly be associated with MCSs of different origin and intensity.\n\nMultiple factors are identified as being influential for MCS development over the study region.  They include the role of the intertropical front/dryline across the Sahel, the low-level transport of moisture into the region via the low-level West African westerly jet, the vertical zonal wind shear over the Sahel, and the indirect influence of cold pool outflow regions from prior convective activity upstream. These factors, combined with large-scale synoptic forcing from African easterly wave disturbances, are found to influence the formation and development of MCSs over the study region.  Knowledge of these processes is helpful for improving our ability to better predict rainfall over sub-Saharan Northern Africa by directing forecasters to the physical processes most relevant for storm development and organization.\n\nFinally, we found that models with spatial scales greater than 10 km do not represent MCS development over the diurnal cycle well due to their dependence on model parameterizations to represent the sub-grid scale processes.  However, models run at convection-permitting spatial scales less than 4 km can realistically capture the MCS development and the diurnal cycle of rainfall over the West African Sahel.  Thus, model results from this project demonstrate the potential usefulness of convection-permitting modeling to better understand and predict storm development, including for intense rainfall events over the sub-Saharan Northern Africa. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/05/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward K Vizy"
