 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry Division and the Office of Multidisciplinary Activities in the Mathematics and Physical Sciences Directorate at NSF are funding Professor Kevin Caran and colleagues in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at James Madison University (JMU) to host an REU site entitled 'A Regional Summer Research Program Integrating Deaf and Hearing Participants in Chemistry Research. This REU site provides research opportunities for regional, and deaf and hard of hearing students. The students include those from JMU as well as students from outside institutions that do not have extensive research infrastructure. All undergraduate researchers have access to a range of research opportunities in disciplines including biophysical, organic, environmental, inorganic, and materials chemistry. Undergraduate interpreting students, working under the direction of a professional interpreter, research topics relevant to the challenges of interpreting in a scientific environment. All students participate in hands-on research, seminars and research group meetings.  Students are exposed to good practice guidelines for writing papers and making scientific presentations. These experiences are designed to help participating students acquire valuable skill sets for future careers in the sciences. External faculty participants from regional colleges both add to the program and presumably will take elements of the research culture surrounding this program back to their home institutions.  \r\n\r\nThe deaf and hard of hearing students perform research under the direction of a faculty mentor and have access to professional interpreters and interpreting students who are fully integrated in the research laboratory, seminars, and social activities. Deaf students gain experience in a hearing environment that may help in their success after completion of their four year degree. Hearing participants also gain experiences that will help in their future success as they benefit from the diversity and novel atmosphere provided by the program that results in a better understanding of the unique challenges and skills of the deaf and hard of hearing participants. The inclusion of student interpreters is expected to be mutually beneficial and enhance the experience in the research laboratory with the goal of promoting the pursuit of STEM careers by deaf students.",

This award directly supported thirty-seven students from JMU and outside institutions who spent 10 weeks learning by doing, over the course of four summers.  NSF-supported participants included chemistry students, as well as students training to become professional American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters. This award also continues to provide the organizational foundation for our long-standing summer research program, which includes many additional students and faculty supported by the department, the college or individual faculty grants. All students worked alongside of JMU and external visiting faculty.  Students worked on a variety of research problems addressing current topics such as the environment, disease, designing new drugs and new materials, and developing basic science that will ultimately enhance the scientific toolbox.  Students and faculty worked together in an inclusive environment aimed at educating the next generation of scientists and ASL interpreters.  Visiting faculty were able to use the equipment and research time to move their research forward and obtain the results to help them expand their own research program at their home institutions.  Hearing, Deaf, and hard-of-hearing participants worked with faculty in a variety of well-equipped research laboratories.  Interpreting students were mentored by a professional interpreter while working on their own research projects aimed at developing tools to assist interpreters and working towards their national certifications.  Interpreting students gained unique hands-on experiences interpreting in the research laboratories, and in other scientific environments, that allowed the student interpreters to familiarize themselves with a laboratory settings and develop unique methods to enhance communication in complicated settings.  Students participated in research projects, sign-lunches, multiple social events and professional events aimed at helping them develop as scientists and scientific communicators.  In addition to gaining important research skills, all students learned to work in an inclusive environment that was particularly suited to enhance access for Deaf students, enhance future interpreters ability to interpret in the sciences and provide hearing students with unique learning experiences that will enhance their ability to provide inclusive experiences in the future.  Students? results were presented at regional and nation meetings, and 36 publications were produced that acknowledged NSF support from this award.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/09/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin L Caran"
