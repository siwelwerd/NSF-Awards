 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the body of knowledge about the importance and conduct of undergraduate and graduate research experiences in recruiting and retaining underrepresented individuals into STEM studies, and preparing the next generation of STEM professionals. The connection of faculty to research and thereby the students to culturally and geographically relevant research is an important step in producing retained students who are more likely to pursue advanced degrees. For those students entering the workforce directly from a tribal college it is equally important that they have a well-defined skill set in mathematics, science, and technology for entry into the STEM workforce. \r\n\r\nNorthwest Indian College (NWIC) and Western Washington University (WWU) will collaborate to increase and modify the geosciences curriculum at the tribal college, establish an educational continuum that will facilitate the articulation of NWIC graduates into the graduate geoscience curriculum at WWU, and develop a shared research agenda between the two institutions that uses the ecosystem of the Bellingham Bay as a theme for scholarly studies and place-based instruction.  Administrative changes at both institutions will include student mentoring, articulation agreements, co-listing courses, and cross-cultural faculty development.",

Thus, the overarching goals of this project were to support and serve Indigenous students in the STEM fields, with an emphasis in the geosciences, through increase capacity building of partnering academic institutions, and to develop a pathway to increase the number of Native American students with graduate degrees in geosciences now and in the future. Using the metaphor, &ldquo;<em>Paddling together in a shared canoe</em>&rdquo; to ground our work, Northwest Indian College (NWIC) and Western Washington University (WWU) collaborated to create stronger pathways for Indigenous students to enter STEM graduate programming through a &ldquo;4 plus 2&rdquo; model in which Native American students would complete their four-year B.S. degree in Native Environmental Science at NWIC and then apply to graduate school at WWU&rsquo;s Huxley College of the Environment (or at other institutions if desired).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To accomplish these goals, we did the following: 1) We addressed the gaps in student preparedness for geoscience graduate school by hiring an additional geoscience faculty member at NWIC to teach classes, such as organic chemistry, which often act as a barrier to graduate school. At WWU, we hired a tenured track faculty in the geosciences whose research focus is based in and around the Salish Sea Basin (the shared waters of both NWIC and WWU), and who has a strong commitment to, and background in, mentoring and advising Native American graduate students. WWU also committed to making this a permanent hire, not contingent on grant dollars after the NSF grant expired. 2) We conducted multiple faculty training opportunities to foster an environment with multiple ways of knowing and to support cross-cultural awareness across institutions. 3) Through the resources provided by this grant, we were able to support graduate students in this program with both an annual stipend and tuition waivers. WWU provided additional tuition waivers to bolster our capacity to support students. 4) We developed a successful and popular, quarterly Salish Sea Seminars that rotated between WWU and NWIC to foster a shared culture of understanding and connection to place. &nbsp;5) We held annual cross-department gatherings and retreats to create a community through shared activities, and shared meals. These activities are integral to Native American traditions, particularly Coast Salish cultures, where sharing meals serves as a mechanism to build trust and commonality. 6) We identified and carried out shared, place-based research opportunities, both at the undergraduate and graduate student level, through summer internships and undergraduate research.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the end, we endeavored to create a welcoming environment where multiple worldviews are validated, and professors and mentors encourage and support projects that resonate with Native American ethics and values.&nbsp;
