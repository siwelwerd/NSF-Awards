 "awd_abstract_narration": "Both lasers and plasmas have the ability to alter a substance on contact. The key is to alter that substance to some particular aim; to create a new material, new product, or new technique. The U. of Illinois is part of the multi-university Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for Lasers and Plasmas for Advanced Manufacturing (LPAM) anchored at the U. of Virginia. The Center focuses on the next advances in manufacturing. U.S. country makes all kinds of things. This support from the NSF allows LPAM to continue working with industrial members to use the latest in laser and plasma technology to make those things better, or cheaper, or faster, or all three.\r\n\r\nThe U. of Illinois's role in the Center is in specific uses of plasma engineering. The site brings a wide spectrum of plasmas and plasma manufacturing techniques, and works towards solving a multitude of research problems in plasma manufacturing that are both near-term and long-term. More specifically, the U. of Illinois focuses around development of large-scale plasma deposition system, directed etching assisted by lasers, and atmospheric plasma induced polymerization.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF Center for Lasers and Plasmas for Advanced Manufacturing\n\nIllinois Site\n\nSite Director:  Prof. David Ruzic\n\n \n\nProject Outcomes for the Life of the Award\n\n \n\n                This award and the Center it allowed to be created at Illinois had tremendous benefits to society.  The first of these is education and work force development.  Over the last 15 years, on the order of 50 graduate students and post-docs worked on Center projects and are now active members of the scientific/engineering community.  In addition over 100 undergraduate students participated and have gone on to graduate school or engineering employment.\n\n                The second major benefit has been the research itself.  On the order of 50 refereed journal publications and almost that many MS and PhD theses have been published adding to the scientific knowledge base.  Even one patent was a direct result of the work sponsored by and conducted though the Center. This knowledge advances the field and leads to advances throughout the community.\n\n                The final benefit has been to the industrial sponsors.  Beyond employing many of the graduates, their research agendas and product development has been shaped by the work done in the Center.  New products, now selling and being used through out the world were a direct result of the work done under this award.  Most notably is Starfire Industries \"IMPULSE\" HiPIMS power supply which is being distributed by the Kurt J. Lesker Co.  Both of those companies were founding members of the Illinois site.\n\n                The Centers influence has not ended with the end of the NSF funding.  The \"graduated\" Center at Illinois has morphed into the Illinois Plasma Institute, which is devoted to competitive research as opposed to pre-competitive research as was done in the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC).  Already we have two industrial partners who have each put in over $2M each.  That would not have been possible without first having the NSF supported I/UCRC.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/17/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David N Ruzic"
