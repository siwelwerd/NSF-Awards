 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides funds from the United States Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) to support the International START Secretariat?s regional research and capacity building programs in Africa and Asia during the 5-year period CY2015-CY2020.   Continued USGCRP support for START?s regional GEC research programs will serve to strengthen global change research and assessment through which capacity building for GEC science in Africa and Asia is enhanced. This support is essential for meeting the significant need for GEC research in the developing world, and for leveraging resources that build lasting partnerships for advancing regional knowledge. With continued support, START will be able to promote research and capacity building that contributes to and advances the interests and strategy of the USGCRP agencies and that advances the objectives of the Belmont Forum and the Future Earth Initiative. This program directly supports the USGCRP mandates to 1) Coordinate U.S. activities with other nations and international organizations on global change research projects and activities; 2) Promote international cooperation and access to scientific data and information; and\r\n3) Participate in international global change research by developing nations.",
