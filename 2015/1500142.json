This project will develop a number of interrelated topics in complex variables theory which may serve to open up new directions within that theory and to build bridges from that theory to other mathematical areas.  It is expected that the project will help to build human infrastructure by involving students and younger investigators.\r\n\r\nThe specific problems to be addressed by the principal investigator include geometric and variational problems connected to Fefferman measure and Webster curvature; the study of partial differential equations serving as boundary compatibility conditions for various overdetermined boundary value problems arising in several complex variables; the study of competing partial complex structures on boundaries of certain complex euclidean domains arising from considerations of projective duality; the study of constants for  of Poincare-type  inequalities on Hardy spaces; and the study of boundary norms for solutions of holomorphic constant-coefficient partial differential equations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMuch of the work supported by the grant concerns real three-dimensional hypersurfaces in two-dimensional complex projective space (this space has real dimension four).  The hypersurface is strongly pseudoconvex if it is strongly convex after a local holomorphic change of coordinates; it is strongly C-convex if it is strongly convex after a local projective change of coordinates.\n \nOne historically important problem is to determine when a (complex-valued) function u on a strongly pseudoconvex S can be decomposed as the sum of a boundary value of a holomorphic function and the boundary value of a conjugate-holomorphic function.  We show that there are vector fields X,Y tangent to S so that u admits such a decomposition if and only if  XXYu=0=XXY(conjugate of u) (for compact S the single equation XXYu=0 suffices).\n \nIn the case of strongly C-convex S, each point of the hypersurface has a unique complex tangent line which may be coded as a point in the dual projective space; this construction leads to a diffeomorphism from S to a strongly C-convex hypersurface S-dual in the dual projective space.  In analogy to the earlier problem , we may ask when a function u on S may be decomposed as the sum of a boundary value of a holomorphic function and the boundary value (along S-dual) of a holomorphic function on the dual projective space. We show that there are vector fields X,T tangent to S so that u admits such a decomposition if and only if XXTu=0=TTXu\n(or by  the single equation XXTu=0 if S is compact. \n \nFor a strongly C-convex S, the Leray transform is an explicit non-orthogonal projection operator from the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions on S to the subspace consisting of boundary values of holomorphic functions.  We compute the exact norm of this operator on two families of model hypersurfaces; it is expected that these results will contribute to the understanding of the Leray transform on general S.\n \nWe show that any rotation-invariant compact strongly C-convex S must have points at which S has an \"exceptional resemblance\" to a (projective image of) a sphere.  This is in line with a long series of geometric results starting with the famous \"four-vertex\" theorem from (real) plane geometry.\n \nA famous accomplishment of Lebesgue?s measure theory is that arc length of a rectifiable curve, defined as the limit of partition sums, can be well-understood in measure-theoretic terms.  We have developed corresponding results for four different non-euclidean plane geometries.\n \n(Most of the work discussed above is joint with various co-authors.)\n \nMy work with undergraduates, graduate student and postdocs has contributed to the development of young researchers in complex analysis.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David E Barrett"
