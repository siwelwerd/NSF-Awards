 "awd_abstract_narration": "Salt Lake Community College (SLCC) has received an NSF Scholarships for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) award for their project entitled the SLCC (pronounced Slick)-STEM Scholars Program that will provide scholarships to academically talented, economically disadvantaged students that often experience low retention and graduation rates. The program has a special focus on women and minorities since these groups are at higher risk for not completing STEM degrees.  In this way the project will ensure a robust, diverse workforce. Over the course of 4 years, SLCC-STEM will provide approximately 48 incoming students with a $10,000 scholarship for full time study over 2 years leading to a STEM degree. In addition, the project will provide scholarships for approximately 32 \"near completers\" to finish STEM degrees. \"Near completers\" are students who are within 30 credit hours of completion of a degree, but have been absent from college for at least 2 semesters. \r\n\r\nSLCC will draw on its extensive network of relationships with area high schools and community partners to recruit students into STEM programs. In addition to financial support, SLCC-STEM will provide other support mechanisms including faculty mentoring, focused advising, opportunities for undergraduate scholarship, transfer assistance to baccalaureate programs, and a supportive social network. SLCC-STEM will work very closely with existing science research programs and the TRiO/Student Support Services Program to provide these services.  Project evaluation will be both formative and summative assessment with qualitative and quantitative data collected from multiple sources to assess recruitment, retention, and graduation rates, as well as the effectiveness of the SLCC-STEM student support systems.  The data generated will provide information on the most effective means to support underrepresented STEM students and to re-engage students who have nearly completed their degrees but have left school for a variety of family or financial reasons.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSalt Lake Community College's SLCC-STEM Scholars Program was designed to provide specialized support to academically talented students with financial need.  Students from an array of educational programs in science, math, and engineering fields were eligible for support.  The project successfully met the following specific goals:\n1. Increase the number of academically talented, financially disadvantaged students that complete STEM degrees with an emphasis on women in STEM.\n2.  Provide opportunities for scholarly activity to awardees.\n3.  Enable talented near completers to finish a STEM degree.\n\nOver the grant period, the scholarship program assisted 71 students in reaching a successful graduation or transfer outcome with approximately 41% of program participants being women.  Support for program participants was provided in partnership with the TRIO programs at Salt Lake Community College with activities that included focused advising, financial aid counseling, social and networking events, transfer advising, and academic tutoring.  In addition, participants could choose mentored research activities and presented their research findings in various scholarly forums such as at the American Chemical Society Annual Meeting, Bruin Brains Conference, or the Science, Math, and Engineering Symposium.  The final evaluation of the SLCC-STEM Scholars Program showed the program was highly successful in meeting the goal to increase the number of academically talented, financially disadvantaged students reaching a successful completion point at Salt Lake Community College.  These participants had an improved grade point average, showed greater retention, and graduated more often when compared to similar students that were not participating.  With respect to the National Science Foundation's merit review criteria for intellectual merit and broader impacts, the project had the following notable outcomes:\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nUtah's economy has experienced unprecedented growth over the course of the project and demand for STEM graduates is at an all-time high.  This project enabled a large number of students to reach successful completion points that will now go on to contribute to Utah's ongoing economic expansion.  Supporting students from financially challenged circumstances means the economic expansion will more equitably benefit communities that need access to high quality employment opportunities.  Finally, the development of opportunities to advance students into scholarly activities and provide ongoing support at the earliest levels of scientific preparation are known best-practices that yielded excellent learning and retention.  These experiences will continue to be impactful at Salt Lake Community College long after the scholarship program has ended.\n\nBroader impacts\n\nThe project had significant effects on Salt Lake Community College's application and award processes for scholarship management.  In part, it was a stimulus to better organize application reviews and award notification processes.  In addition, the project prompted creation of better student tracking processes and mechanisms for identifying student progression in STEM programs of study.  The program leaves a legacy of new forums for scientific expression and creativity with at least one event, the annual Bruin Brains Conference, specifically created by S-STEM Scholarship recipients.  Finally, the project built new ways for students to participate in research experiences which enabled new and powerful learning experiences for all STEM students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/22/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Craig Caldwell"
