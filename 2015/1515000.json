 "awd_abstract_narration": "With an ever-increasing part of our nation's critical infrastructures in the hands of public and private employees via computer systems, the need for a cybersecurity educated workforce has never been so great. Since the operation of these infrastructures is heavily dependent on control systems, it is imperative that the future workforce be educated and trained on the security of such systems. This project will serve as an instrument to that purpose and its novelty in enhancing cybersecurity education--in particular control systems security--is predicated on total learning immersion utilizing problem-based-learning techniques and hands-on experimentation. Collectively, the activities and the corresponding evaluation process for continuous improvement present a transformative educational system that is replicable at the national setting. Most importantly, this project is well-positioned and has the capacity to bring about unprecedented improvement in cybersecurity education particularly to members of the underrepresented groups.  \r\n\r\nRecognizing the urgent need to protect our nation's critical infrastructures, this collaborative capacity building project undertakes a series of intertwined tasks with the primary objectives of developing control systems security curriculum materials, enhancing cybersecurity curricula by offering professional development workshops to instructors of community colleges and 4-year institutions, evaluating the effectiveness of these learning and teaching materials, and disseminating these materials for widespread national adoptions. The project presents a unique opportunity for faculty to expand and retool their cybersecurity curricula to address the current gap in control systems security education and research. The collaborative effort in the design and implementation of the course modules and the virtual testbed facilitates the adaptability of those curriculum tools and materials in all levels of higher education. The project builds on two highly successful grant projects: the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded Critical Infrastructure Security and Assessment Laboratory (CISAL) project that was completed in May 2013 and the Department of Defense (DoD) sponsored gamification of security awareness training project that was completed in December 2013. The portable and cost-effective toolkit that evolved with the CISAL project and the freely accessible course modules provide generous motivations for widespread curriculum adoption across national settings.\r\n\r\nThe Advanced Technological Education program is providing co-funding for this project in recognition of the project's contribution to technician education in community colleges.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Capacity Building for Control System Security Collaborative Project 2018\n\n Today?s critical infrastructures such as utilities, defense systems, manufacturing, and production rely more upon the use of control systems for daily business than ever before.  As smart technologies increase in use, so does the need for a trained cybersecurity workforce to protect such systems from threat actors seeking to steal information or cause damage to processes critical in daily life.  In order to prepare the future workforce, it is imperative that colleges and university faculty be prepared to inform learners on critical systems and the vulnerabilities that currently exist within such systems.  The main goals of the Capacity Building for Control System Security Collaborative Project were to:\n\nDevelop control systems training modules, toolkits, and experiential exercises for faculty use in two-year and four-year computer science and industrial systems degree programs\nProvide professional development for faculty to support the implementation of modules, toolkits, and experiential exercises in current curriculum\nDevelop and expand collaboration and resource sharing among college faculty on the importance of protecting control systems through defense and vulnerability testing \nDetermine the effectiveness of such resources as related to student engagement and knowledge impartment\n\n\nProfessional Development and Training Modules\n\nThe Capacity Building for Control System Security Collaborative Project was a three-year project designed to provide two-day workshops once per year for selected faculty from the United States.  The two-day workshops were intended to provide pre-developed shared resources such as training modules and hands-on laboratory exercises for faculty to implement in current curriculum at each respective college noted in Table 1. The Control System Security Modules.  The participants were afforded lecture material, physical equipment, and laboratory exercises for use in the classroom environment.  During the two-day workshops, the participants experimented with laboratory exercises and curriculum modules in order to prepare for implementation in their selected courses. \n\nAs a requirement, participants attended a final symposium to report the outcomes of the project?s validity as related to student engagement, knowledge expansion, and efficiency of the resources provided in the workshops. The Symposium, held in December of each year, asked participants to report their findings on the effectiveness of the training modules, toolkit and laboratory exercises once implemented in the courses.  Outcome data was provided through student surveys and faculty feedback during the allotted time the materials were in use.          \n\nResource Sharing\n\nResource sharing is an important part of any educational training endeavor.  As a result of the three-year grant, Jacksonville State University created a resource portal to afford each participant and anyone interested in teaching control systems cybersecurity the ability to download training materials for use as individual modules or a complete course.  The repository is open to all interested in teaching control systems cybersecurity modules at their respective colleges and universities.  Participants also reported that additional laboratory exercises were created based on existing materials for use in the classroom.   The additional exercises can be used to build the current repository for faculty to employ in their degree programs.  Due to the high interest from most students studying in the computer sciences and industrial systems fields, faculty made requests for additional toolkits to deploy during laboratory training sessions.\n\nEffectiveness and Student Engagement\n\nMany colleges and universities reported that control systems cybersecurity was not part of the current curriculum taught.  The Capacity Building for Control System Security Collaborative Project modules are developed in such a way so that faculty can teach brief or expanded sessions in control systems cybersecurity.  An overwhelming number faculty reported that students were very engaged with the hands-on portions of the modules related to deep packet inspection and basic programmable logic control programming. The various penetration testing exercises were deployed in basic and intermediate networking courses to expose the learners to the concepts of data communication in control systems.  Student surveys found the labs very rewarding from a knowledge standpoint and fostered a desire to expand their education of basic networking concepts.  In many cases, learners decided to increase their knowledge of critical infrastructure during times not designated as classroom instruction.  Overall, the Capacity Building for Control System Security Collaborative Project was able to provide a foundation for future cybersecurity professionals to understand the importance of critical systems and current threats associated with such systems.\n\nThe Capacity Building for Control System Security Collaborative Project has made a significant contribution towards enhancing the skillset of student learning in the industrial controls and technology fields.  In addition to achieving desired outcomes, the Capacity Building for Control System Security Collaborative Project was recognized nationally at the 3CS Conference in 2018.  The collaborative project was awarded first place in the Faculty Development category for the 2018 National CyberWatch Center Innovations in Cyber Security Education program.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/19/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Greg Randall"
