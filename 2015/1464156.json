 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 18th Galway Topology Colloquium and 30th Summer Conference on Topology and Its Applications will be held, respectively, June 22 and June 23-26, 2015 at the National University of Ireland, Galway. Motivated by many examples from the real world, topology is a mathematical field that aims to study the shape of a space. It often requires the use of tools from other mathematical fields, giving rise to various subfields in topology. The main goal of the conference is to bring together a group of the world's leading researchers in these subfields and to build connections between subfields, between topology and other areas of math, and between PhD students, junior faculty and the most distinguished stars of the field. The aim of the Colloquium is to provide a supportive environment for PhD students and early career faculty to connect, and prepare for the main conference.\r\n\r\nInvited contributed talks will be presented in the four special sessions: (1) Topology+Foundations, (2) Topology+Analysis, (3) Topology+Dynamical Systems, (4) Topology+Geometry. Each special session features one plenary speaker, two invited  speakers and 30 to 40 other contributed presentations. Each special session will host a workshop for graduate students and other interested participants. Participation by women and members of other underrepresented groups is encouraged and supported. Graduate students and young topologists will receive substantial financial support to attend the conference.\r\n\r\nConference web site: http://www.conference.ie/Conferences/index.asp?Conference=393",
