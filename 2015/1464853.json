 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports a project with the goal of elucidating the interdependence of deformation history, microstructure and thermomechanical properties in surface generation by novel impression and burnishing-based processes. To accomplish this, an experimental study will utilize controlled deformation platforms and a suite of advanced characterization methods to resolve local material conditions in the modified subsurface. Predictive models of microstructure and thermomechanical properties will be calibrated using these results to enable multi-role surface modification. The primary educational objective is the creation of a series of immersive experiences for students to elicit interest in manufacturing research. This includes deep dives in coupled design/manufacturing problems for minority high school students and a series of hands-on manufacturing design challenges for undergraduates. Graduate students will also engage in mentorship of high school students on semester-long design projects. These educational experiences are complemented by the integration of research outcomes in curricula and development of an interactive manufacturing speaker series.\r\n\r\nIf successful, the research will result in new manufacturing processes that enable direct control of surface properties for a broad range of engineering components. This capability will benefit the nation's economy in enabling domestic manufacturers to be globally competitive in automotive, aerospace and biomedical systems applications where component surfaces strongly influence performance, service life, and operating cost. Societal benefits of the research include the rapid development of a new class of high-performance, surface-engineered components (e.g., turbine blades, bearing seals, hard-tissue implants) that will improve quality of life through enhanced performance. The integrated educational activities will help to develop the future domestic manufacturing workforce by promoting interest in manufacturing-related studies among high school students and undergraduates through novel experiential learning opportunities. Students will also gain globally-aware perspectives in problem solving activities as they will be connected across academic levels and cultural backgrounds in formal mentor-mentee relationships. Doctoral students will benefit from collaborative research opportunities in the form of international research exchanges and industrial internships.",

For example, increasing the yield strength and wear resistance of surfaces through strain-induced grain refinement affords an attractive route to extend component life due to the non-linear increases in strength concomitant with grain size reduction. Prior to this project, most experimental surface engineering investigations have been empirical, with limited demonstration of predictive control of surface microstructure. The primary goal of this research was to elucidate a process-oriented framework for understanding the heterogeneity in the deformation and microstructure of surface generation by localized deformation, and the implications of these surfaces for mechanical performance. Towards this goal, the objective was to understand interdependence of deformation history, microstructure and thermomechanical properties in surface generation by impression and burnishing-based processes that are common machine-based methods that can be implemented to control surface characteristics. The final outcome of this work is that the research established fundamental science needed to realize next-generation surface engineering methods that can harness topographical and microstructural characteristics of surfaces.</p>\n<p>To achieve this outcome, this research exploited the use of novel experimental platforms and advanced characterization<em> </em>methods to directly resolve conditions in the material subsurface during processing. In situ techniques for tracking material flows were used to dynamically assess deformation parameters and the final state of the surface based on novel optical and x-ray measurement techniques. These methods were used to quantify the plastic zone in terms of deformation parameters and their decay into the subsurface. These data were then correlated with multi-scale assessments of evolving microstructure and properties made with site-specific electron microscopy, electron backscatter and x-ray diffraction, micro/nano-indentation and calorimetry. These data were incorporated and used for derivation and validation of plasticity models and provide a generic framework for describing mechanics and microstructure evolution, This framework will inform processing conditions needed to engineer surfaces with diverse microstructure-performance profiles. Further, this framework will enable informed design of future platforms for controlling surface microstructure and other elements of surface integrity. The results that were generated were then used to calibrate predictive models that manufacturers need to enable multi-role surface modification. The processing knowledge established in this work will enable future study of deformation phenomena central to surface generation and other general sliding contact problems including, but not limited to, shear banding at the free surface, regions of stagnant or rigid body flow and surface folding which promotes crack formation. These phenomena are often associated with defects in surface integrity, and knowledge of the deformation conditions leading to their occurrence will enable avoidance of these phenomena and generation of defect-free surface layers in manufacturing.</p>\n<p>In terms of broader impact, the functional performance of engineering components is strongly dependent on the surface microstructure and its effect on thermomechanical properties. The research assembled the experimental and analytical tools needed to characterize and predict surface microstructure and properties in deformation-based surface generation. The tools now will enable product/process designers to make informed decisions when designing components with surface profiles customized for microstructure characteristics and gradation in depth. Thus, these outcomes will ultimately enable sustainable design of surfaces and will facilitate the rapid introduction of novel surface engineered components by various communities (e.g., automotive, aerospace, biomedical). The insights gained into the surface generation process were also beneficial in elucidating the nature of deformation phenomena central to failures in many tribological applications, which are dependent on the characteristics of the local deformation. For these reasons, this research will provide a pathway for design and adoption of more advanced surface engineering methods than those currently used by the discrete products sector. Finally, students that were engaged in the research project participated in beneficial experiences with industrial partners interested in commercializing and deploying the technologies, as well as with an collaborating international research institution in an emerging economy. These experiences have enriched the research efforts of these students in terms of commercialization and globalization perspectives.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
