 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University to support improvements to the Virginia Tech Insect Collection.  Founded in 1888, this is the oldest and largest entomological collection in the Commonwealth. Its nearly half-million specimens represent the rich insect diversity of the eastern United States with emphasis on the Appalachian region. This collection is an exceptional repository of pollinators, endangered insects, and many native species, once common but now disappearing from habitat loss. Museum specimens provide a critical baseline for comprehending biological change through time, tracking the spread of insect disease vectors and agriculturally destructive invasive species that threaten our ecosystems, agriculture and public health. This collection is a frontier for the discovery and description of biodiversity, representing hundreds of undescribed new species. This award will provide support for personnel and new cabinets and drawers to improve conditions for specimens. Specimen data will be digitized and made accessible through online resources, improving access to \"dark data\" conserved alongside the physical specimens (more than 98 percent of the material is currently not digitized). Several scientifically valuable collections in the museum will be conserved, including specimens of Federally Endangered species, endemic Appalachian species, and critical pollinators.\r\n\r\nDespite the continuous use and constant growth of this collection, the storage and curation methods are antiquated and it is currently located at a temporary storage facility.  This project will provide critical support to the collection and will accomplish the relocation of the collection to campus, improve the physical storage infrastructure for specimens, and address digitization, cataloguing, and documentation of specimens. Over the duration of this project, undergraduate and graduate students along with a new full-time collections manager will be trained in collections research, including curatorial best practices, digitization, and networking biodiversity data. Public outreach events will target the underserved Appalachian population. Science curriculum kits will be developed for elementary students, and old insect cabinets and drawers will be upcycled as mini-natural history collections and donated to local nature centers. An insect collection exhibit will be developed for the University's annual Bug Fest and Bug Camp for elementary school students. With a revitalized presence on campus and a greater capacity to engage the public with insects and science, the Virginia Tech Insect Collection represents a unique and powerful resource to translate the importance of biodiversity and science to the historically underserved Appalachian region.  All data resulting from this project will be shared with iDigBio (https://www.idigbio.org/), ensuring accessibility to researchers and the public.",

Founded in 1888, its 400,000 specimens represent Virginia's rich insect diversity, highlighting the Appalachian region. The collection faced significant challenges that threatened its overall research and educational value. In this project, we provided critical support to the collection and accomplished the following objectives: (1) relocated the collection to a central location on campus, (2) improved the storage infrastructure of the specimens, and (3) digitized, catalogued, and georeferenced specimens. Our collection includes many historical treasures (e.g., the American Burying Beetle collected from Blacksburg in 1893, now extirpated from our state) and is actively used for numerous research projects. With this support, the VTEC is an improved resource for insect science in Appalachia, supporting research of 20 faculty members at Virginia Tech and providing outreach opportunities to the broader community. With a committed and enthusiastic group of collections personnel, including a curator, three graduate students, six undergraduates, and a collections manager, we upgraded the collection to avert critical threats to its security and longevity. With&nbsp; support for personnel and new storage infrastructure (cabinets and drawers), the VTEC has been returned to campus, and is once again a premier research and educational resource at Virginia Tech.<br /><br />We re-established the VTEC on campus and significantly improved the condition of its specimens by replacing drawers and cabinets, digitizing and cataloguing material and networking the collection data with public biodiversity repositories through Symbiota Collection of Arthropods Network (SCAN), Integrated Digitized Biocollections (iDigBio), and Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). Several scientifically valuable collections were saved, including specimens of Federally Endangered species, endemic Appalachian species, a historical Aquatic insect collection, a large glass slide collection, and 170,000 pinned insects. We published a peer-reviewed article on collection management (http://bdj.pensoft.net/articles.php?id=9583), established a website (https://collection.ento.vt.edu/), and social media (https://twitter.com/vtbugcollection).<br /><br />Appalachia in southwestern Virginia and neighboring states is biologically rich, but threatened by habitat loss. The VTEC's 170,000 pinned insects are mostly from this region; however, they were historically uncatalogued and unknown to researchers, which compromised their scientific utility. Upon cataloguing specimens online with publicly accessible databases (SCAN, iDigBio, GBIF), the collection has become a valuable resource for conservation, agriculture, and public health. Over the duration of this project, nine students and a staff collections manager were trained in natural history collections research, including curatorial best practices, digitization, cataloguing, and networking biodiversity data. The ways in which the collection was used were diverse. Public outreach events included annual Hokie Bugfests, educational Hokie Bugcamps, and delivery of curriculum kits for elementary students. We donated our old insect cabinets and drawers as mini-natural history collections to local nature centers. Insect specimens housed in the collection were used as therapy aids for treating insect and spider phobia cases in collaboration with Virginia Tech's Child Study Center.
