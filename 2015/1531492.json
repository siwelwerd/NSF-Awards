 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project deploys a high-performance computer system that enhances the research, education and training activities at Stony Brook University (SBU) and partner institutions across the state of New York. Research topics include modeling storm surges and associated damages to inform the design of resilient coastal infrastructure and emergency response; genomics analysis to explore biodiversity and how to conserve ecosystems into the future; analyzing data motion within computer systems to enable more energy efficient designs; development of scalable models of brain function; atomistic simulations of materials proposed for use in fusion reactors; and simulation of supernovae and x-ray bursts fundamental to astronomy. Over sixty graduate and undergraduate courses at SBU regularly use the system, which also creates numerous opportunities for undergraduate research. Through collaborations with the SBU Center for Inclusive Education (CIE) and other organizations, the instrument operates to substantially broaden participation in science and engineering research by women, underrepresented minorities, persons with disabilities, and high-school students. External partners include the SUNY system and the all-women School of Arts & Sciences at the College of New Rochelle. \r\n\r\nThe instrument supports both sophisticated and entry-level users through command-line and web-portal access, and is reconfigurable to move resources between batch and cloud workflows. It includes 165 nodes connected via InfiniBand for a total of 4516 cores with 20.7TB total memory, and is supported by a fast 1PB General Parallel File System (GPFS). The cost-effective, high-performance and high-productivity computing accelerates and expands research, and prepares the research projects and users to exploit the larger national computing facilities. Once operational the system will be used for research and training by forty NSF-sponsored research projects at SBU, and by multiple other projects supported by industry or other agencies, including the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (AFOSR), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the State of New York.",

The computer system became fully operational on schedule in September 2016 with a final configuration that exceeded what was originally proposed. The peak speed of the system is 240,000,000,000,000 operations per second (double-precision floating point), and there are 4,592 Intel cores system-wide. In the last calendar year, the system delivered about 44M core hours of service with over 90% utilization.<br />There are now over 580 distinct active users, many of whom were not envisioned in our original proposal. These span over 30 departments from Physics to Neurology to Sociology to Mechanical Engineering. SeaWulf is associated with research from over 240 unique, externally-funded projects at SBU of which about 70 are directly funded by the National Science Foundation (the original proposal identified 33). The system has been used to teach multiple courses with over 300 students. Two professional system administrators oversee a team of 10 students (undergraduate, master's, and doctoral) who are supported (roughly 10 hours per week) to enable and support science on the system. A few focus primarily upon system-related tasks, but the majority are assigned specific groups to work with, consciously targeting the 'long-tail' of science and aiming to break down barriers between groups/users and their use of Seawulf and computing in general.<br />There are two major other outcomes from the project. First, this new research computing instrument lays the foundation for a new research computing infrastructure on the SBU campus with broad support across campus for research and education. Recognizing the necessity and impact of data and computation in modern science, engineering and scholarship, the university leadership has established a new research computing organization on campus with new staff. Second, the computer benefits a broad and diverse community beyond SBU including external users from the region, New York State, across the nation, and internationally. High school and undergraduate students from SUNY and the region routinely use the system. One of many events associated with the project was \"Drawing Diversity to Academia\" with a keynote talk from Dr. Richard Tapia (a distinguished figure nationally in building diverse participation in computational science). Multiple companies from New York State and the Long Island region have benefitted from SeaWulf either by directly using the machine or through collaboration with SBU faculty/students on open (publishable) research. This project was coordinated with the HPC-NY consortium that was supported by the New York State economic development agency (NYSTAR), which also contributed to the initial purchase of SeaWulf.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/11/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robert&nbsp;J&nbsp;Harrison</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1531492/1531492_10399131_1549832037864_SeawulfDoor--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1531492/1531492_10399131_1549832037864_SeawulfDoor--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SeaWulf being installed\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1531492/1531492_10399131_1549832037864_SeawulfDoor--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SeaWulf being installed\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">One of the cabinets of SeaWulf on the first day of installation.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Robert J Harrison</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;J&nbsp;Harrison</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SeaWulf being installed</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1531492/1531492_10399131_1549889148298_IACS-HPCSupport20171206copy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1531492/1531492_10399131_1549889148298_IACS-HPCSupport20171206copy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SeaWulf_cluster_team\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1531492/1531492_10399131_1549889148298_IACS-HPCSupport20171206copy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SeaWulf_cluster_team\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">SBU undergrads and grads help cluster users maximize their time on SeaWulf</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">SBU</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;J&nbsp;Harrison</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SeaWulf_cluster_team</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
