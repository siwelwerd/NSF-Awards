 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the conference \"Clifford Lectures on Algebraic Groups: Structure and Actions\" held March 2-5, 2015 at Tulane University in New Orleans, Louisiana. The conference will stimulate research on the interplay between geometry and number theory. An important  goal of this conference is to prepare graduate students for research in the areas of algebraic group theory, algebraic geometry, and number theory, in particular to suggest thesis projects. The Clifford Lecture Series is a medium-sized conference and it provides ample opportunities for its participants to interact with each other. This atmosphere is invaluable especially for graduate students and junior researchers new to the field. It is anticipated that the meeting will lead to active collaborations between the participants, including students and faculty from non-Ph.D.-granting institutions. \r\n\r\nThe main speaker is Michel Brion (University of Grenoble, France). His talks focus on the structure and actions of algebraic groups over arbitrary fields, the applications of algebraic group theory to algebraic geometry (automorphism groups and their birational analogues) and number theory, and various aspects of homogeneous varieties and their equivariant embeddings (algebra, algebraic combinatorics, geometry).\r\n\r\nConference web site:  http://tulane.edu/sse/math/news/clifford-lectures-march-2015.cfm",

The main speaker, Michel Brion has presented some fundamental results on the structure of algebraic groups and their actions on algebraic varieties. \n\n2. David Anderson explained some of the basic properties of the operational K-theory and showed how to use it to obtain new information about usual K-theory. He described the Riemann-Roch and equivariant localization theorems for operational theories, and concluded with applications to toric and spherical varieties.\n\n3. Jeremy Blanc discussed the possible structure that we can put on the group Bir(X) of birational transformations of an algebraic variety X. \n\n4. Brian Conrad presented a variety of examples illustrating how the notion of pseudo-reductivity can be useful, and how these objects are necessary for studying reductive groups.He introduced the \"standard construction\" of pseudo-reductive groups and discussed some of their general features (such as root groups, root systems, and pseudo-parabolic subgroups).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Alexander Merkurjev gave basic definitions of a cohomological invariant and a classifying space of an algebraic group. He showed how to determine the degree 3 invariants of split reductive groups. As an application he showed how unramified invariants can be used to detect non-rationality property of classifying spaces of algebraic groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Gopal Prasad explained the proof that every pseudo-reductive group is \"standard\" away from characteristics 2 and 3, and introduced \"exotic\" con- structions in these small characteristics. He presented some examples to motivate the important notion of \"minimal type\".\n\n7. Zinovy Reichstein revisited classical problems of simplifying polynomials in one variable by Tschirnhaus transformations. He presented his recent work in this area. In addition, he gave an informal introduction to the theory of quadratic forms and discussed a theorem of his showing that the 3rd Pfister number can grow exponentially with the dimensions of the form.\n\n \n\nParticipant names (along with their gender, carreer stage, and whether they received support or not) is listed as follows: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.
