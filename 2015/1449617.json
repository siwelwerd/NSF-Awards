 "awd_abstract_narration": "Research at the interface of water and energy cycles is critical to inform solutions to meet human needs for water and energy.  This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award will prepare master?s and doctoral students at Syracuse University with the tools needed to advance understanding of hydrocarbons, the primary energy source for current societies, and linkages to water quality and availability.  The domestic and international field components of this program promote integrated technical training and global awareness of research with significant societal impact.  In addition to technical knowledge, students will develop the professional skills in communication, public policy, management, and law that will prepare them to share the science and engineering discoveries with diverse audiences.  The program will produce a cadre of highly skilled trainees in a field where graduates often pursue a wide range of non-academic careers as well as research careers.  By filling critical gaps in knowledge on the complete pathway of hydrocarbon production and interconnections with the water cycle, this training program contributes to our national competitiveness and environmental security.\r\n\r\nThis NRT program bridges chemistry, engineering, and earth science to tackle issues at the water-energy nexus.  The research theme spans the complete pathway of hydrocarbon energy production, from deposition and origin of hydrocarbons, to production from shale, to environmental effects of hydrocarbon use, and the linkages of the energy and water cycles.  Trainees will address knowledge gaps on hydrological and geological controls on the development of productive shale plays, characterization of produced water and gas from shale, and how changes in emissions, fuel sources, and infrastructure for hydrocarbon transport impact the environment.  The program provides training beyond core academic competency with comprehensive technical and professional development training that will develop student understanding of how knowledge in one area can be applied to another.",
