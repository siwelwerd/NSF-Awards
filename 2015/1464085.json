 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor David A. Shultz of the Department of Chemistry at North Carolina State University will develop detailed relationships between a molecule's structure and how it transports electrons.  The goal of this research is to develop lucid connections between a molecule's shape and structure and electron transport, which are useful to the design of materials and devices that rely on electron transport.  The results will have application in the next generations of molecular electronics and \"spintronics\" (electron spin-based electronics), photonics, organic light-emitting diodes and artificial photosynthetic reactors.  The proposed research contains elements of molecular synthesis, structure, spectroscopy, reactivity and theory, and is thus well suited for an integrated education of scientists.  The Shultz group has extensive experience in training scientists (including undergraduates and those from underrepresented groups) who go on to careers in academia, government laboratories, industry and entrepreneurship.  Outreach activities involve hosting and training undergraduate summer researchers from Shaw University, a local Historically Black College/University (HBCU).  \r\n\r\nElectron donor-acceptor interactions control electron transfer and transport at the molecular level.  They are thus crucial, foundational elements in biological and artificial electron transfer and photosynthesis, solar energy conversion and molecular electronics/spintronics.  The first thrust of the proposed research describes continued efforts in the Schultz group toward an elucidation of electronic coupling in Donor-Bridge-Acceptor systems in which the donor fragment is a metal-semiquinone and the acceptor is a nitronylnitroxide radical, and the magnetic electron spin-spin exchange coupling between the two is directly proportional to the square of the Donor-Acceptor electronic coupling.  The second thrust of the proposed research describes studies aimed at using exchange coupling in photogenerated biradical excited states (via ligand-to-ligand charge transfer) to probe and ultimately to control excited state processes and to mimic exciton-polaron interactions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe project entitled, \"Metal Complexes of Donor-Bridge Acceptor Biradical Ligands: Testing Models for Electron Transfer/Transport/Quantum Interference and Controlling Excited State Wave Functions,\" sought to understand how electrons within molecules communicate in order to (1) better understand electron transport through molecules and, (2) facilitate rational design of future electronic devices based on molecules.\n\nQuantum computing promises ultrafast computations for problems that are intractable with current computing capabilities. Molecule-based materials for quantum computing include those possessing electrons not involved in chemical bonds, so-called ?unpaired? electrons.  A small collection of unpaired electrons which ?communicate? with each other leads to quantum mechanical phenomenon, including superposition of states, that provide the basis for quantum computing. Thus, an in-depth understanding of how the unpaired electrons in these new materials \"communicate\" is desirable to design better materials for quantum computing.  Our research has demonstrated fundamental relationships between portions of molecules called \"electron donors\" and \"electron acceptors\" both of which contain unpaired electrons that impact quantum information processing.  Specifically, our research has shown how this communication changes as a function of the molecule's length, shape and pattern of bond connectivity -- all of which can be controlled by rational synthesis methods.  We have also demonstrated how the communication between unpaired electrons can control the lifetimes of a molecule?s ?excited state,? formed by shining visible light on our molecules.  These excited states can be used to prepare and manipulate unpaired electrons useful for quantum computing.\n\nOur research has led to a new way of understanding critical design features of molecule-based current rectifiers (diodes).  These findings fill a void between actual devices and high-level calculations, and will be useful to chemists who design molecules for molecular electronics.  Recently, there has been much discussion in the literature about how specific molecules conduct electricity, and our work has made ? and will continue to make ? significant contributions to this area. \n\nAll of our discoveries are at the fundamental level, but could play an important role in theories of electron transport, and in new single-molecule devices and quantum computers.  As such, our research is of interest to chemists, physicists, materials scientists and engineers.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that this research has provided the training ground for several excellent students who are now employed in academia (NC State University, Georgia-Gwinnett College, Kennesaw State University, and Howard University) as well as companies such as Advanced Liquid Logic, BASF, Cree, Dyna-Tech, and Combi-Blocks and others.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/15/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David A Shultz"
