 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climates are currently warming at unprecedented rates. Species must move to track the changing climate or evolve to tolerate warmer conditions; those that fail to do so face extinction. Most plant species, especially forest trees, rely on intimate associations with microbial species living in soil in order to capture the resources they need for proper growth. Little is known about how these invisible, but very important, soil microbes are distributed across the continent, and how they will respond to climate change.  In this project, the genetic, taxonomic, and functional biodiversity of soil microbial communities from forests across the eastern US will be characterized to test for parallel latitudinal patterns with respect to climate. Trees and soil microbes will likely not move at equal speeds as climates change. Therefore, experiments will test the functional consequences for tree growth for situations where microbial species migrate slower or faster than trees. This research will allow for more precise predictions about how forests will change as a function of the changing biodiversity of the fungal symbiont community during climate warming. \r\n\t\r\nThis research will have several broader impacts for society at large.  The project will incorporate citizen scientists from across the eastern US in collecting samples for the soil survey, in order to connect the public with original research. Undergraduate students (including women and underrepresented minorities) will be mentored in hands-on research experiences during the project and encouraged to develop independent research projects. By helping to improve our ability to predict ecological changes in response to climate change, this research will increase our ability to mitigate and adapt to the undesirable consequences of a rapidly warming world.",
