 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides core funding for the Committee on Geological and Geotechnical Engineering (COGGE), a standing committee under the National Research Council's Board on Earth Sciences and Resources.   COGGE is the focal point within the Board on Earth Sciences and Resources for scientific, technical, and public-policy issues pertaining to the engineering applications of Earth Sciences. The committee's scope encompasses Earth processes and materials, including the mechanics of rock and soil, and focuses on safe and responsible human development, risk assessment, and mitigation of natural anthropogenic hazards. The committee organizes and oversees studies: 1) to identify, investigate, and report on questions relating to geological and geotechnical engineering to government, industry, academia, and the public; 2) to provide scientific and technical information to inform public policy on geological and geotechnical engineering issues; 3) to identify new technologies and potential applications; and,  4) to promote the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge.  In addition, the committee provides a forum for discussion among academic and professional groups, government agencies, and private industry to enhance national and international cooperation and exchange of information. \r\n\r\nThe committee activity spans all areas of geological and geotechnical engineering, will identify new areas of needed research, and will provide increased understanding of the importance of geotechnology in addressing societal needs. The COGGE's mission is driven by the need to promote the responsibility of the geoengineer throughout the lifecycle of geoengineered facilities and structures; from site selection and facility design, to construction, operation, maintenance, and decommissioning. Issues include the geoengineering concerns associated with natural and built environments, radioactive and hazardous waste isolation and remediation, mitigation of natural hazards (e.g. earthquakes, landslides, rising sea levels), environmentally sound and safe recovery of natural resources, and interest in defense structures in rock. Projects undertaken, whether mandated by Congress, requested by federal agencies, or self-initiated, will be conducted by ad hoc committees under COGGE. Projects, governed by NRC guidelines, will result in peer-reviewed reports, and will provide geoengineering advice for decision makers.",
