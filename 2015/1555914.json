 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project was developed during a NSF Ideas Lab on \"Cracking the Olfactory Code\" and is jointly funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes program in the Chemistry Division, the Mathematical Biology program in the Division of Mathematical Sciences, the Physics of Living Systems program in the Physics Division, the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems, the Division of Biological Infrastructure, and the Division of Emerging Frontiers. The sense of smell is essential for maintaining quality of life in humans, and its decline can be an important harbinger of neurodegenerative disease. Moreover, since nearly all animals aside from primates rely on olfaction for most survival functions, understanding chemical sensing has immense practical value, for example, in the control of agricultural pests or in training animals to detect odors relevant for bomb, drug and cancer detection. In spite of its importance, the understanding of olfaction lags far behind the other senses, which is in part due to the lack of understanding of the physical space of odors. The understanding of the neural bases of vision and audition were greatly advanced by investigations of the physical dimensions of visual and auditory stimuli. It is therefore likely that a similar in-depth investigation of odor space - how natural odors occur and the backgrounds against which they must be detected - will reveal a new depth of richness of neural representations of odors in the brain. Insects such as the fruit fly and honey bee are excellent models for this research because of the accessibility of their central nervous systems, because of their ease of use under controlled laboratory conditions, and because of the functional similarity of how odors are processed in insect and mammalian brains. This research will characterize how odor flowers and fruits with respect to behavioral value for honey bees (food) and fruit flies (food and egg laying sites). Further monitoring of neural activity in early and later stage processing in the brain, when combined with computational modeling, will reveal significantly richer neural representations than have heretofore been described. This new understanding stands to have an impact on understanding how healthy brains encode sensations and memories of odors and how brains fail under disease conditions. It will also have an impact on understanding how the sense of smell may be built into engineered devices. Finally, both insects are also of economic importance to agriculture for crop pollination (honey bees) and damage to fruit (fruit flies). The PIs will teach and work with undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students and especially recruit students from underrepresented groups in science. \r\n\r\nThis research will quantitatively characterize the real-world statistics of multi-component natural odor scenes and investigate how they drive behavior and processing in several brain regions. The focus will be on honey bee as well as fruit fly adults and larva as models, where it will be possible to characterize a library of ethologically relevant natural odors associated with a diversity of behavioral outputs. The work will begin by quantitatively characterizing the detailed statistical properties of natural odor scenes in defined ethological contexts. This will build on the rich literature on identified natural odors in insects and mammals. Naturally occurring plant and fruit odor samples from the natural environments of each insect will be collected and chemically analyzed. Nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques and approaches based on sparse coding will determine the dimensions of odor space that are most salient for behavioral decisions. Such a quantitative deconstruction of the sensory input would be unprecedented in olfactory neuroscience, and should allow the PIs to effectively and comprehensively drive olfactory circuits for the first time. The hypothesis is that the stimulus dimensions that are most behaviorally relevant to the animal will be most efficiently extracted by the olfactory system. Synthetic odor blends will be specially constructed to vary along relevant sensory dimensions, to probe neural codes and adaptive behaviors in the olfactory system. As in research on the visual system, analysis of such evoked neural responses using statistical methods that take into account natural odor statistics will reveal novel olfactory computations and behaviors that have been previously inaccessible. The project will generate datasets of immediate use and importance to scientists in theoretical biology and mathematics, engineering and biology.",

We effortlessly recognize and parse natural odors in our environment as we make sense of our surroundings, but how we do this remains poorly understood. The extraordinary homology of olfactory circuits from insects to mammals suggests that olfactory behavior is shaped by conserved principles of circuit anatomy and dynamics. These principles may extend to other areas of the brain. Olfactory circuits emerged from natural selection and evolution and are thus likely optimized to recognize and deconstruct natural odors. Our contribution to this collaborative proposal is to map the detection and analysis of natural odors to the small circuits of the Drosophila larva.</p>\n<p><strong>The olfactory connectome</strong><br />Our first major outcome was in connectomics. We assembled a complete map of the wiring diagram of the larval antennal lobe (Berck et al., 2016). This connectome has proved to be an essential framework for understanding olfactory recognition and odor-evoked behaviors. A principal discovery was the presence of two parallel circuits. One canonical circuit is comprised of uniglomerular projection neurons (uPNs) that relay ORN activity to the mushroom body and the lateral horn. A second, parallel circuit with multiglomerular projection neurons (mPNs) and hierarchically connected local neurons (LNs) selectively integrates multiple ORN signals already at the first synapse. These parallel circuits were essential to a subsequent project (Vogt et al. 2021) where we found that they play a role in experience-dependent plasticity. The complete wiring diagram continues to support experimental and theoretical studies that bridge the gap between circuits and behavior (Fig.1).</p>\n<p>Berck, M.E., et al (2016).

We developed a new microfluidic device that allows us to control arbitrary mixtures of primary odors and record simultaneously from entire populations of neurons.&nbsp; We used this setup to characterize, to an unprecedented level of breadth, how a complete olfactory system encodes diverse odorant molecules across a broad range of concentrations from below the limit of detection to saturation. Odor perception allows animals to distinguish odors, recognize the same odor across concentrations, and determine concentration changes. We found that the activity of each ORN scales with the concentration of any odorant via a fixed dose-response function with a variable sensitivity. We discovered that sensitivities across odorants and ORNs follow a power-law distribution. Much of receptor sensitivity to odorants is accounted for by a single geometrical property of molecular structure.

One of the puzzles of the olfactory connectome is that it contains two major populations of output pathways from the primary olfactory processing system. We reasoned that these populations might serve different behavioral functions. By systematically modulating the circuitry within the antennal lobe and the two output pathways, we determined that the two separate pathways (one comprised of multiglomerular projection neurons and one comprised of uniglomerular projection neurons) play different roles in odor attraction and repulsion. Most interestingly, fed and starved animals will often shift their preference from repulsion in the fed state (when the animals are choosy) to attraction in the starved state (when they will try to eat anything). We established how a state-dependent switch in the antennal lobe produces olfactory decision-making. We found that certain odors repel well-fed animals but attract food-deprived animals and that feeding state flexibly alters neural processing in the first olfactory center, the antennal lobe. Hunger differentially modulates two output pathways required for opposing behavioral responses. Upon food deprivation, attraction-mediating uniglomerular projection neurons show elevated odor-evoked activity, whereas an aversion-mediating multiglomerular projection neuron receives odor-evoked inhibition. The switch between these two pathways is regulated by the lone serotonergic neuron in the antennal lobe, CSD.
