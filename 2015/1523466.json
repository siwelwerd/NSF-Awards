The first conference will take place at Emory University on October 16-18, 2015. The second conference will take place at the University of Georgia in October 2016, and the third at Georgia Tech in October 2017.  The aim is to sustain and grow collaborations between mathematicians in the Southeast, and to nurture a new and diverse generation of students and postdocs, by providing a regular series of exciting mathematical activities and a forum to meet peers and attend talks by leading experts in the field. \r\n\r\nAlgebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry are some of the most established and active areas of mathematics and have deep connections with many other subjects. In addition to their central role in mathematics, they have important applications in encryption, physics, engineering, biology, and a host of other sciences. The conferences will aim at presenting the latest advances in these fields to a wide audience of local researchers, students, and postdocs. \r\n\r\nSymposium web site:  http://research.franklin.uga.edu/gags/",
