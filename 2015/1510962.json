While a lot of research has been done to understand how lift forces are generated around solid wings, it is important to also understand why and how soft, flexible wings are used to generate lift. Fundamental knowledge generated through this work can impact both biological sciences as well as the autonomous drone industries (commercial and military).\r\n\r\nA lot of prior research work has been done on rigid wings, showing that wing kinematics can alter the strength and position of the shear layer that feeds the so-called leading edge vortices (LEVs) that are responsible for the bulk of the lift forces. The vortex dynamics have been shown to result in fluid dynamic forces. More recently, LEVs have been observed on moderate Reynolds number, and in morphing and compliant wings during low speed flight and maneuvering of insects. The proposed project will advance this area of research by investigating wing compliance effects, by examining the vortices generated at the leading edge at moderate Reynolds numbers (where the LEV is a significant but not necessarily dominant source of lift) and by quantifying importance of wing compliance and vortex dynamics to lift force production.  Furthermore, educational activities are proposed via integration of research results into university courses as well as the development of several instructional materials for local K-12 schools in both Massachusetts and Maryland.",
