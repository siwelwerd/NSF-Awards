 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stretching from 670 kilometers depth below the Earth's surface to the core-mantle boundary at 2,900 kilometers depth, the lower mantle comprises more than half of our planet by volume. Information on its chemical composition and petrological constituents is crucial for understanding the solid Earth, but is very scarce, especially for the inaccessible deep lower mantle (DLM) underneath 1800 kilometers. The extremely high pressure and temperature conditions of the DLM make it very difficult to simulate and investigate in the laboratory, and numerous unresolvable mysteries remain. Ho-kwang Mao proposes to use his newly developed high-pressure multigrain crystallographic (MGC) technology to delineate the crystal structures of the mantle rock in-situ under the DLM conditions, and use the focused ion beam technique combined with electron microscope to probe the compositions of various mineral phases in the quenched samples.  The results will shed light on many key features of the DLM, including the geochemical reservoir, the core-mantle exchange, the source of mantle convection, the root of rising plumes and the graveyard of subducted plates.  \r\n\r\nThe prevailing theory was that the majority of the lower mantle is made up of a ferromagnesian silicate, (Mg,Fe)SiO3, called bridgmanite. It was thought that this mineral did not change structure over the enormous range of pressures and temperatures found in the lower mantle except at the very bottom D\" layer beyond 110 gigapascals. Very recently, in simulating the conditions of the lower mantle using laser-heated diamond anvil cells brought to pressures between 95 and 101 gigapascals and temperatures between 2,200 and 2,400 Kelvin, Mao's team found that ferromagnesian bridgmanite is unstable. It disassociates into two phases: one magnesium silicate bridgmanite without the iron, which is represented by the Fe-free portion of the chemical formula, and one iron-rich and hexagonal in structure, called the H-phase. Further tests showed that this iron-rich H-phase is more stable than when the iron is incorporated in the ferromagnesian bridgmanite, much to everyone's surprise. There could be many more unidentified phases down there in the DLM as well, waiting to be identified by the present project.  Discoveries and characterizations of these phases will lead to a fundamentally new paradigm of the deep Earth.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Our experimental studies have revealed dramatically altered chemistry at the high pressure-temperature lower-mantle conditions that can produce a highly oxidized form of FeO2 by pressure-induced decomposition of goethite (FeO2H) and releasing free hydrogen.  Generalization of this reaction indicates that in the presence of iron or iron oxides, the water cycle in the lower mantle deeper that 1800 km turns into a water-down-hydrogen-up cycle.  When the subducted plates continuously supply water to meet the inexhaustible reservoir of iron in the core, hydrogen will be released and make the core-mantle boundary (CMB) a gigantic hydrogen generator, that provides a constant source for formation of hydrocarbons and other biochemical ingredients.  Meanwhile, the oxygen will be left to form FeO2, that amasses in oxygen-rich patches at the CMB.  The anomalous seismic behaviors of the D? layer above the CMB are consistent with the elastic properties of FeO2. \nSustained accumulation of the metastable oxygen-rich patches through geological time would eventually reach a critical point of massive oxygen outburst at the CMB.  Impacts of the oxygen outbursts offer a singular, unified theory for multiple global, environmental, biological, geodynamic, and volcanic catastrophes during the Earth?s long history.  The surge of oxygen is obviously a convenient new explanation for the great oxidation event (GOE), as well as the five mass extinctions and snowball Earth that are closely correlated with large fluctuations of oxygen in the geological records. The oxygen outbursts add chemical driving force and perturb the steady-state thermally driven mantle convection, leading to super plumes and catastrophic formation and rifting of supercontinents. The additional hydrogen, oxygen, and associated volatile components could also lower the mantle rock melting point and cause massive magma generation to feed into the large igneous provinces (LIP) and flood basalts and to trigger catastrophic environmental changes.
