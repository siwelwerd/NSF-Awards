 "awd_abstract_narration": "UCLA will host a workshop that will discuss, debate and define the scientific, engineering and data challenges and opportunities in understanding the coupled food-energy-water (FEW) systems in California. The workshop will cover multiple aspects of the FEW systems, including resource demand and availability under variable climates, land use change, population and economic growth, practical applications/implications from stakeholders perspective, and innovative solutions and best practices.  The workshop will bring together relevant scientists, managers and stakeholders, and provide a platform to increase the understanding and problem definition of the FEW nexus issues among all stakeholders. The workshop gives students and early-career researchers a unique exposure to the FEW nexus approach from multiple perspectives.\r\n\r\nThis workshop seeks to advance the nexus approach to addressing the food- energy-water (FEW) system and its impact on security problems in California. The overall objective is to create a platform for interdisciplinary research communities and multisectoral industrial practitioners so that concepts, issues, opportunities and resilient solutions of the intricately coupled FEW systems are thoroughly discussed, debated and culminated into research questions and sustainable partnerships. Specifically, the workshop seeks to 1) foster a holistic understanding of the risks and opportunities of the complex and dynamically interconnected regional FEW systems under the changing conditions; 2) identify research, technological and governance gaps and needs for effective and robust implementation of the food-energy-water system nexus approach; 3) forge partnerships among interdisciplinary researchers and practitioners from relevant stakeholders; and 4) create an interactive platform to further consolidate and follow-up on the workshop outcomes and recommendations. The workshop will take place over three days through panel discussions, breakout working-group sessions and invited and contributed presentations.  The deliberation and findings of the workshop will be available to researchers, educators and practitioners through publications and online materials.  The workshop results are transferable to other semiarid regions characterized by water scarcity and rapid population and industrial growth.",
