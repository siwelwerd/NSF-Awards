 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed CAREER study uses a comprehensive mixed-methods design to develop measures of motivational beliefs and family supports for Spanish and English speaking Mexican-origin youth in high school physical science.  The research examines a three-part model which may provide a deeper understanding of how Mexican families support youth through their general education strategies, beliefs about physical science, and science specific behaviors. This approach incorporates motivation and ecodevelopmental theories while pursuing an innovative line of research that examines how the contributions of older siblings and relatives complement or supplement parental support.  The study has four aims which are to (1) to develop reliable, valid measures of Mexican-origin adolescent motivational beliefs and family supports in relation to high school chemistry and physics, (2) to test whether family supports predict motivational beliefs and course enrollment, (3) to test how indicators in Aim 2 vary based on gender, culture, English language skills and relationship quality, and ( 4) to examine how family supports strengthen or weaken the relationship between school-based interactions (teachers and peer support) and the pursuit of physical science studies.  \r\n\r\nSpanish and English-speaking  Mexican-origin youth will participate in focus groups to inform the development of a  survey instrument which will be used in a statistical measurement equivalence study of 300 high school students in fulfillment of Aim 1. One hundred and fifty Mexican high school students and their families will participate in a longitudinal study  while students progress through grades 9-12 to examine Aims 2- 4. Data to be collected includes information on science coursework, adolescent motivational beliefs, supports by mothers and older youth in the family, and family interactions. All materials will be in English and Spanish. \r\n\r\nThe educational and research integration plan uses a three pronged approach which includes mentoring of doctoral students, teacher outreach, and the evaluation of the ASU Biodesign high school summer internship program using measures resulting from the research. It is anticipated that the study findings will provide research-based solutions to some of the specific behaviors that influence youth motivation in physical sciences. Specifically, the study will identify youth that might be most affected by an intervention and the age of maximum benefit, as well as valid, reliable measures of youths' motivation that can used in interventions to measure outcomes. The study will also identify family behaviors that may be influenced, including education strategies for school preparation, beliefs about physical science, and sciece-specific strategies such as engaging in science activities outside school. The findings will be broadly disseminated to science teachers, scholars, and families of Mexican-origin youth.  This multi-tiered approach will advance current scholarship and practice concerning Mexican-origin adolescents' pursuit of physical science.",

Because few studies had examined these topics among Latinxs, my first goal, which my team and I achieved, was to develop reliable measures of Latinx adolescents&rsquo; motivational beliefs in math, biology, chemistry, and physics, as well as parenting. To test these measures, we collected survey data on 1,200 9<sup>th</sup> grade high school students.

Survey data were collected from students and their science teachers 9<sup>th</sup>-11<sup>th</sup>, from parents and older siblings 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup>, and from their record data all four years. In addition, we have qualitative interviews with students, parents, and siblings in 10<sup>th</sup> grade, and video-taped interaction data between the students, parents, and siblings in 9<sup>th</sup> and 10<sup>th</sup> grade.

First, what Latinx parents believe and do matters for high school students&rsquo; science motivational beliefs and outcomes. For example, in one study we tested whether support from parents, siblings, teachers, and friends predicted adolescents&rsquo; science motivational beliefs. Although adolescents reported high support from teachers, teacher support alone was not a strong correlate of their motivational beliefs. Feeling supported across home and school may be necessary to sustain adolescents&rsquo; science motivational beliefs which, in turn, predicted their engagement in science class. In another study, we took a closer look at parents to examine which beliefs and supports mattered. Latinx parents&rsquo; value of science, but not their beliefs about their adolescents&rsquo; science abilities predicted their subsequent support. In other words, parents who felt science is valuable supported their adolescent in science regardless of their perceptions of adolescents&rsquo; science abilities. Parents&rsquo; support, in turn, predicted increases in adolescents&rsquo; beliefs about their science abilities. These findings suggest that family involvement at home matters for Latinx high school students. However, our findings suggest that these processes may be somewhat different for Latinx boys and girls. For example, Latinx parents in this study were less likely to act on their value of science if they were parents of girls compared to parents of boys, which contradicts previous research. One possibility is that the masculine stereotypes about science coupled with traditional gender roles emphasized in Latinx culture could create counter-productive mechanisms for girls in science. Another possibility for these differential transactional processes is due to girls&rsquo; typically more advanced maturity and higher academic achievement compared to boys.
