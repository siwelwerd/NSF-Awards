The Conference brings together scientists, clinicians, industry, and government stakeholders to facilitate dialogue for establishing new and innovative research platforms and technologies and identifying new challenges in the field. One of the goals of the meeting is to educate students, young investigators, investigators from underrepresented groups, and female investigators in the latest developments of this topic. \r\n\r\nThe meeting will focus on all aspects of extracellular vesicle (EV) research, including fundamental research on the cellular processes that lead to EV biogenesis, EV biomanufacturing, and deployment of EVs as biopharmaceuticals.  Specific Conference topics will include Purification and Characterization Methods of Extracellular Vesicles (EVs), Scalable Biomanufacturing of EVs, EVs in Drug and Gene Delivery, EVs as Biomarkers, Preclinical Animal Models of EV-related Physiology, Mathematical and Computational Modeling of EV Trafficking and Physiological Roles of EVs.",

The meeting was highlighted by four plenary speakers, including Nationa Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Dr. Francis Collins, Nobel Laureate Dr. James Rothman, and National Academy of Science members Dr. Gary Ruvkin and Dr. Xandra Breakefield. There were 20 poster sessions as well as 27 oral sessions during the 3.5 day conference, with a total of 487 abstracts presented, including 65 late-breaking abstracts. Additionally, new this year were 9 &ldquo;Meet the Experts&rdquo; sessions where eminent scholars in subdisciplines of EV research presented overviews of the field and engaged in the audience in discussion of critical issues and future challenges. Despite these sessions being held at 8:00am, they were well attended and audience members expressed enthusiasm for continuation of these sessions at future meetings. Another highlight was a live interview conducted with plenary speakers Collins, Rothman, Breakefield, and ISEV president Jan Lotvall to address key issues in the field. This was done at the end of a plenary session and featured over 500 attendees. In addition, an &ldquo;Education Day&rdquo; was held in conjunction with the NIH Extracellular RNA Communication Consortium that featured over 400 attendees and allowed for those new to the field to learn all the latest developments in various areas from experts.
