 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project is far-reaching.    A preliminary market study indicates that 1.5% to 2.5% of the developed world?s population suffers from heart arrhythmias while the WHO reports ~0.5% of the global population.  For Atrial fibrillation, in the USA alone this disease will afflict  ~7.7 million people by 2015, afflicts ~460,000 new patients every year and the patient load is projected to grow to 12.1 million by 2050 (CDC).  Atrial fibrillation and its complications (stroke, congestive heart failure, seizures, death, etc.) add $26B to the nation?s annual healthcare costs and kill nearly 80,000 people/yr. The global load of Atrial fibrillation patients is a staggering 33.5 million with 4 million newly diagnosed every year which equates to ~$100B to treat the disease and its complications worldwide. Fully 25% of these patients have paroxysmal Atrial fibrillation so their % burden needs to be diagnosed in order to guide and monitor therapy. Together with reducing the economic impacts, it would also be enormous benefit to human health to create an easy-to-wear for long-periods device that guides individual therapy, thus substantially improving the quality of life and medical outcomes for arrhythmia patients. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed project has the following intellectual merits: A detailed model and validation methods will be developed to understand how ultra wideband (UWB) radar signals interact with human tissue; a prototype UWB radar sensor will be developed to validate the modeling effort; an optimization of the UWB radar sensor will be carried out to improve the operational characteristics of the radar motion detection system in order to enable robust heart motion monitoring; This project is expected to enable the development of a radar-based, non-invasive, low-power, long-duration-wearable, heart motion monitor that can sensitively diagnose and detect intermittent arrhythmias including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter as well as numerous other arrhythmogenic heart motions; This will provide an alternative and much desired means to monitor patients for extended periods of time (> 2 weeks and up to 1 year), something not feasible or practical to accomplish with existing electrical or EKG monitoring systems like the Holter or other externally-mounted cardiac event monitors.",

This will save lives, improve the quality of life for those affected and ultimately the cost of providing healthcare by more accurately diagnosing and treating dangerous arrhythmias and their likelihood to turn into stroke and death.\n The impact on the development of human resources: The project will eventually lead to employment of grad students and postdocs in the STTR funded company.  Fundamentally, this project helps engage electrical engineering students/postdocs/professors in the field of medical device research, development and commercialization.  \nThe impact on technology transfer: This STTR project is done in full collaboration with a university partner.  As such, skills, technologies and infrastructure from the university in partnership with a private company are being used to commercialize a new medical device that can improve health quality and save lives of the public.\n\nThe impact on society beyond science and technology: The medical device(s) being developed in this project will make a dramatic change in how cardiac arrhythmias are discovered, treated and monitored.  This will save lives, improve the quality of life for those affected and ultimately the cost of providing healthcare by more accurately diagnosing and treating dangerous arrhythmias and their likelihood to turn into stroke or even death.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/10/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dennis L Matthews"
