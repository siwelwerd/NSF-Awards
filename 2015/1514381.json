 "awd_abstract_narration": "Despite significant effort on novel wireless and mobile applications for sighted people, novel wireless and mobile applications to improve the wellbeing of visually impaired individuals remain largely underexplored. The biggest everyday challenge for visually impaired individuals is safe and quick navigation to reach a desired destination in unfamiliar outdoor/indoor environments. Outdoor navigation for unsighted people can be greatly facilitated by GPS-based aids which unfortunately do not work in indoor environments lack of GPS signals. This proposal outlines a challenging research plan on developing, prototyping, and evaluating a secure and usable indoor navigation system for the visually impaired. The scientific promise of the proposed research will expand the fundamental understandings about indoor navigation for the visually impaired with the potential to open a new research direction. Successful development and implementations of the proposed techniques will have profound impact on allowing visually impaired individuals to have indoor navigation and wayfinding as sighted people, thus significantly improving the mobility and wellbeing of millions of visually impaired users in the US and around the world. \r\n\r\nThe proposed research consists of six main research thrusts. The first thrust is to investigate novel crowdsourcing-based techniques to construct accurate indoor floor plans for arbitrary indoor venues with or without large open spaces. The second thrust is to develop secure cooperative techniques to detect and minimize the impact of fake mobility traces submitted by dishonest crowdsourcing workers. The third thrust is to investigate crowdsourcing-based construction of an indoor image database that can well characterize and visualize an indoor venue. The fourth thrust is to develop crowdsourcing-based techniques to enable accurate point-to-point indoor navigation for the visually impaired. The fifth thrust is to investigate novel techniques that can provide visually impaired individuals enhanced indoor navigation experience similar to what sighted persons can get. The last thrust is to implement the proposed indoor navigation system and thoroughly evaluate its efficacy, efficiency, and usability.",

As one of the most promising indoor positioning techniques, WiFi-based indoor positioning systems explore the ubiquity of indoor WiFi Access Points (APs) and estimate a user's location by matching the user's Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurement with the RSS fingerprints stored at the IPS server. WiFi-based IPS is unfortunately vulnerable to various attacks that cannot be thwarted by traditional cryptographic techniques. For example, any WiFi-fingerprint-based IPS requires the server to collect many RSS fingerprints at different locations to construct and maintain a fingerprint database, for which a cost-effective approach is to rely on mobile crowdsourcing by outsourcing collection tasks to many mobile users. However, we have identified three malicious data injection attacks on crowdsourced WiFi-based IPSes, where a crowdsourcing worker submits fake data to induce a low fidelity RSS fingerprint database at the IPS server. As a countermeasure, we have also developed several defense mechanisms to filter out malicious data injected by the attackers. As another example, we have identified two practical signal strength attacks on WiFi-fingerprint-based IPSes, in which an attacker can control the RSS experienced by a victim user at target locations through fake APs, leading to either a large location error or the server misled into returning a fake location of the attacker&rsquo;s choice. As a defense, we have designed a novel RSS-fingerprint-matching mechanism that can ensure high positioning accuracy in the presence of signal strength attacks. Last but not least, existing secure WiFi-fingerprint-based IPSes all suffer from an inherent tradeoff between positioning accuracy and attack resilience. In other words, strong attack resilience comes at the cost of low positioning accuracy in the absence of signal strength attack. In view of this limitation, we developed a novel WiFi-fingerprint-based IPS based on optimized multi-voting that can simultaneously achieve high positioning accuracy and strong attack resilience.<br /> <br /> Indoor navigation systems must be combined with an accurately labeled floor plan to provide usable indoor navigation services, but such labeled floor plans are often unavailable or involve a prohibitive cost to manually obtain. To tackle this challenge, we have designed a crowdsourcing-based context-aware indoor navigation system that can automatically generate an accurate context-aware floor plan with labeled indoor Point of Interests (POIs). Our system combines the Wi-Fi fingerprints of indoor walkers with the Wi-Fi fingerprints and POI labels provided by POI employees to produce a high-fidelity labeled floor plan.
