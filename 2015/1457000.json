 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deer mice inhabit the broadest altitudinal distribution of any North American mammal, from below sea level (Death Valley) to above 4000 m where hypoxic conditions are the norm and the deer mice must adapt their physiology to satisfy oxygen demand. It appears from recent research that previously described hemoglobin/genetic adaptations exert very modest effects on oxygen acquisition and are insufficient alone to explain the success and activity levels of deer mice at high altitude. Deer mice also display changes in organ sizes (e.g., heart, lung) that vary along the altitude gradient and are correlated with improved aerobic performance necessary for high levels of activity. This project will investigate the extent to which changes in lung size and function contribute to the observed increases in activity in adult mice acclimated to high altitude. Students will participate in all data collection aspects of the proposed research and contribute to the development of educational modules for undergraduate classes and outreach efforts to the public and citizen science workshops in the Southern California region.  Results from the study will be further disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at scientific meetings.\r\n\r\nPreliminary data from the principle investigator's lab suggests that the capacity of the lung to deliver oxygen at high altitude is the first critical limit in the oxygen cascade and that, in deer mice, the lung has the capacity to remodel to meet that demand.  Such pulmonary plasticity would be highly adaptive if species are moving upward in elevation as the climate becomes warmer.  This project will therefore test the hypothesis that some animals have the capacity to remodel lung architecture and optimize function throughout their lives.  Changes in the cardio-pulmonary tissues between the high- and low-altitude acclimated mice will be assessed through histologic and physiologic assays.  Modified gas composition will be used in direct respirometry tests of lung performance in control (normoxic) and altitude-acclimated animals.  Lung volume, alveolar surface area, capillary density and blood gas composition will be tested to determine the extent to which organ size, architecture, and composition changes contribute to high altitude acclimation.  Results from this study will inform our understanding of how small mammal populations that are forced to move to higher altitudes and harsh or variable conditions as a result of climate change will cope with their relocation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur project had two specific goals.  First, we wanted to understand how gas exchange tissues of the lungs change when mice move to from low to high altitude to support the increased oxygen demands of life at high altitude.  Second, we aimed to understand if there were complementary changes in blood delivery to and from the lung that supported gas exchange in mice moved from low to high altitude.  All of this work was part of ongoing work to understand how animals deal with environmental extremes and is particularly relevant as small mammal populations are moving to higher altitude as the climate warms.  We found that, when mice move to high altitude, the immediate response is to sudden low atmospheric oxygen is that their aerobic performance declines.  After an eight-week acclimation, however there are statistically significant increases in overall oxygen delivery to the blood.  This increase is largely because lung volume increases as do the percentage of alveolar cells that are responsible for oxygen delivery rather that production of surfactants to keep lungs inflated.  The changes, overall, while subtle allow mice to have significant increase in their aerobic performance so that they can be as active as they were while they lived at low altitude.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/24/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kimberly A Hammond"
