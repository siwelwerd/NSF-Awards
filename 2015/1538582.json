 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key goal of ecology is to understand how species interactions -- competition, predation, mutualism -- influence the structure (e.g., biodiversity) and functions (e.g., productivity) of ecological communities and contribute to the stability and resilience of ecosystems. Kelp forests along the West Coast of North America have been a model ecosystem in which marine ecologists have explored these questions. That work has provided evidence that predators, including sea otters, sea stars, and fishes, can be important in controlling sea urchins that otherwise overgraze forests and create alternative \"barrens\" states, devoid of kelp. However, other examples suggest that disease and disturbance, not predators, suppress urchin overgrazing. Here we employ experiments and surveys to determine whether and how sea otters and sea stars act separately and in combination to control the rapid growth of sea urchin populations that is occurring in concert with a sea star \"wasting\" epidemic along the West Coast of North America. The results of this work will (i) advance our understanding of how multiple predators interact to influence community structure, stability and resilience, and (ii) shed light on how species interactions contribute to the stability of these forests that are the foundation of productive commercial and recreational fisheries. The project will involve citizen scientists contributing to surveys of sea otter abundance, foraging behavior and diet, and underrepresented (largely Latino) undergraduates and results will be disseminated in several public outreach facilities and K-12 educational programs. \r\n\r\nThis project will advance our understanding of the combined roles of species diversity and predators in contributing to the stability and resilience of community structure. Though both predators and diversity have been the focus of numerous studies, fewer have explored how predator diversity does or does not enhance the resilience of marine ecosystems. The investigators will determine the relative contributions of southern sea otters (Enyhda lutris lutris) and two species of sea stars (Pycnopodia helianthoides and Pisaster giganteus) in controlling the density and size structure of two prey species, the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) and a snail (Promartynia pulligo), and the cascading effects on survival and density of giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera). Orthogonal manipulations of predator access in large field enclosures/exclosures will be used to assess the relative roles of redundancy, complementarity and \"sampling effect\" (i.e. particular importance of either species) among the two predators on both direct mortality and indirect (trait-mediated) foraging behavior of their prey. The PIs will evaluate whether results from the experiments \"scale up\" to explain geographic variation in the relative densities of predators (otters and stars), prey (urchins) and the major primary producer (giant kelp) and the ability of sea otters to compensate for declines in sea stars to control the rapid growth in purple sea urchin populations that can otherwise cause phase shifts (forests to barrens) of these ecosystems.",

We investigated the causes andconsequences of these declines and the ecological mechanisms of ecosystem resistance and resilience.</p>\n<p>Loss of giant kelp forests along the Monterey Peninsula in central California coincided with (i) the localecological extinction of the sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), a significant predator of seaurchins, in 2013 and (ii) a marine heatwave that persisted from 2014 to 2016. Loss of Pycnopodia wasassociated with the sea star wasting disease (SSWD) epidemic. During and since these events, weobserved outbreaks of the purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus), which created a spatialmosaic of ?urchin barrens? devoid of macroalgae, and remaining kelp forests.</p>\n<p>We combined community surveys with field and laboratory (mesocosm) experiments to test alternativeexplanations for these urchin outbreaks. Surveys of community structure before, during and after theSSWD and MHW revealed a decline and persistent loss of Pycnopodia, increase in counts of purple seaurchins, and the coincident decline in densities of kelps and other algae. Many sites that exhibited thistransition from forested to ?urchin barens? have persisted through 2021.</p>\n<p>Surveys of purple urchin size structure (i.e. relative abundance of urchin sizes) and size-baseddemographic modelling indicate that rapid increases in counts of large (4-5 cm diameter) purple urchinswas initiated by a foraging response, with subsequent larval recruitment contributing to the persistenceof barrens. With the loss of a predator and declining abundance of kelp, purple urchins emerged fromcracks and crevices and possibly migrated from deeper depths to overgraze algae. Field and labexperiments substantiate that the lack of predators and drift kelp precipitate the emergence of purpleurchins and overgrazing of kelps.</p>\n<p>We evaluated the role of alternative predators, sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis) and the red rock crab(Cancer productus), in reducing grazing by urchins in barrens and facilitating forest recovery. Weexplored direct numerical responses and indirect behavioral responses of predators and their urchinprey. The number of sea otters specializing on urchin prey caused an increase in urchin consumption,increase in sea otter survivorship, and local population size. However, sea otter foraging was confined toenergetically profitable urchins with high gonad volumes within remaining forests and not linked to highdensities of urchins with poor gonad condition in barrens. Therefore, while sea otter foraging enhancedthe resistance of remaining forests to overgrazing, it did not contribute to the decline of urchins inbarrens. Nonetheless, the remaining forests are the sources of kelp spores required to reforest barrensand thereby enhance forest resilience.</p>\n<p>To evaluate the role of rock crabs, we conducted experiments in lab mesocosms (1.1 m 3 cattle troughs),and on small (0.5 m 3 ) and large (6 m 3 ) caged rocky reefs in the field. These experiments differ in theircontrol, accuracy, and frequency of observations (mesocosms&gt;small cages&gt;large cages) and how wellthey represent the natural environment (large cages&gt;small cages&gt; mesocosms). Results across theseexperiments demonstrated that rock crab, unlike sea otters, kill gonad-poor sea urchins from barrensand reduce grazing rates and kelp loss by at least 50%. Moreover, the direct mortality of urchins and the<br />behavioral response of urchins to seek shelter from predators contribute equally to the increasedsurvival of kelp. Efforts to quantify the abundance of rock crabs in urchin barrens are ongoing.</p>\n<p>We observed forest recovery in one of the monitored urchin barrens.
