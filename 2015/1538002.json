 "awd_abstract_narration": "Friction of rubbery materials against a stiff surface is of great practical importance in many applications. For example, it determines the performance and efficiency of tires, windshield wipers, and seals.  Much of the previous work on control of their friction mechanisms has either varied surface chemistry or altered properties of the rubber itself.  Recent research on biological attachment devices has shown how adhesion of rubbers can also be strongly enhanced by design of their near-surface architecture, but usually their sliding friction is reduced rather than increased. The principal goals of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)project are to investigate surface architectures for enhancement of sliding and static friction against rough and smooth surfaces.  The target application is improving friction of tires, and the planned research requires work on design & theory, fabrication, and testing under realistic constraints and conditions.  For this reason, the project is a collaboration between two university labs (at Cornell and Lehigh) and an industrial researcher at Michelin North America.  The Lehigh group is responsible for fabrication and experiments, the Cornell group for theory and modeling, and Michelin for testing under realistic conditions and constraints.  The project will train graduate students in use-inspired and industry-relevant collaborative research and will provide research opportunities for undergraduate students.  The results of this research will be incorporated in an ongoing collaboration with the Da Vinci Science Center in Allentown, PA, for informal science education.  A new exhibit will be designed for the general public on bio-inspired design of surfaces to bring out the immediacy and impact of national investments in research and education.\r\n \r\nPreliminary work has shown that certain surface architectures, for an appropriately designed set of materials and geometrical parameters, exhibit significant enhancement of sliding friction and maintain static friction enhancement against rough surfaces. For example, a film-terminated ridge-valley design (an anisotropic structure with direction-dependent frictional properties) can strongly enhance sliding friction in a direction orthogonal to the ridges by complex internal deformation mechanisms that dissipate energy.  For certain combinations of parameters, sliding friction along the ridges can also be enhanced.  Such film-terminated fibrillar structures also results in strong enhancement of static friction that is substantially retained even against rough surfaces.  These bio-inspired surface architectures have the potential to be transformative by providing dissipation mechanisms at the micron scale that can be optimized by quantitative design of the architecture.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project, a team of researchers including participants from Lehigh, Cornell, and Michelin worked on design of structures to enhance friction of rubbery materials with potential application in tires and other soft materials. \n\nIntellectual Merit: We discovered a film-terminated ridge-channel structure that strongly enhances sliding friction against smooth and rough surfaces.  This structure offers a new way to build in energy loss in the material, leading to a novel method by which to increase sliding friction.  We investigated how adhesion under rolling and indentation can be quite different for anisotropic structured interfaces.  This finding shows how measurement of such surface mechanical properties can be very sensitive to how the test is done.  Finally, we discovered two new mechanisms for control and enhancement of friction: one based on hysteresis enhancement in elastohydrodynamic friction by surface structuring, and the second based on surface structures that interlock with a mating surface by shape-complementarity.  This new approach offers a significant enhancement and the ability to tune properties.  \n\nBroader Impact: These discoveries, in addition to providing options and alternatives for tire surface design, have potential applications in a variety of soft materials.  Our project supported the training of a graduate student in use-inspired research in an interdisciplinary team environment.  We collaborated with the Da Vinci Science Center in Allentown (PA) on an exhibit to demonstrate and teach concepts of friction to the general public.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anand Jagota"
