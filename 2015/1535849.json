 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a workshop to identify advanced manufacturing research needs for the emerging Smart Goods industry to help U.S. manufacturers more quickly advance Smart Goods into the marketplace.  In 2012, the U.S. information technology industry, from semiconductors to telecommunications and other information services, contributed over $1.7 trillion to U.S. gross domestic product.  By 2017, about one half of spending on information technology equipment in the U.S. is projected to be in smart computing as sensors, actuators, wireless communications, and low-power computation become embedded in everyday objects called \"Smart Goods\", i.e., the Internet of Things.  Future smart computing requirements are challenging conventional wisdom in semiconductor manufacturing making the U.S. information technology industry vulnerable to foreign investments aimed to leapfrog current advantages held by U.S. firms in silicon microelectronics.  The main objectives of the workshop are to:  (1) examine and review the state-of-the-art in manufacturing materials and process technologies for the emerging Smart Goods industry; (2) gather the Smart Goods industry perspective of the advanced manufacturing research needs, gaps and challenges upstream of the \"big data\" value stream; and (3) formulate recommendations for the next steps to advance manufacturing technologies within the Smart Goods industry.   \r\n\r\nThe workshop will be held in the Portland, Oregon-Vancouver, Washington metropolitan area, also known as the Silicon Forest, containing almost 900 semiconductor and electronics companies. The workshop will bring together an academic and national laboratory audience with invited industry speakers and panelists to identify advanced manufacturing research needs for the emerging Smart Goods industry.  An organizing committee consisting of state, university and federal laboratory members will work with an industry advisory team to select 15-20 distinguished members from industry to deliver presentations and populate panels.  Sessions will involve both presentations and panels discussing future computing requirements for many Smart Goods including the integration of low-power computation with new sensors and small power sources on complex three-dimensional surfaces.  Technologies to be discussed include inkjet printing, the scaling of near monodispersed functional nanomaterials, and the photonic sintering of particle films into multifunctional films and devices.  The organizing committee will compile a report after the workshop recapping the key challenges and opportunities in advanced manufacturing research for Smart Goods, and outlining the next steps for aligning universities and industry interests around a common pre-competitive research agenda.  The report contents will be disseminated through the workshop website and an appropriate journal.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The promise of the Internet of Things (IoT) is dependent upon the ability of companies outside of the traditional information technology (IT) supply chain to assimilate wireless sensing capabilities within their products i.e. to develop \"smart goods\".  Therefore, to accelerate the adoption of IoT technology, a national consortium is needed to bring together the needs of smart goods companies with the burgeoning capabilities of the electronics industry to address the common materials, design, manufacturing and educational challenges facing the emergence of an IoT industry.\nSmart goods are the \"things\" in IoT consisting of everyday objects with the embedded computation, memory, sensing and wireless connection to cloud computing needed to enhance product performance. The growth in the number of smart goods over the next five years is expected to fuel a global economic impact of more than $9 trillion by 2020, driving massive expansion in the IT industry, creating new jobs in personalized medicine, precision agriculture, smart grid and the industrial internet.  However, the emergence of smart goods represents a seismic shift in the way IT is being designed, produced, distributed and marketed.  Smart goods companies are typically not inside the traditional electronics supply chain.  Consequently, while a great deal of potential exists for advancing IoT technologies into products, many potential smart goods manufacturers are unaware of how to capture the potential of IoT.  Further, a gap exists between what is possible and what is needed.\nIn an effort to capture the state-of-the-practice in smart goods manufacturing and identify emerging research needs for companies producing smart goods, a National Science Foundation workshop on \"Advanced Manufacturing for Smart Goods\" was held on May 14 and 15, 2015, in Portland, Oregon.  Key research needs and knowledge gaps identified by participants included:\n\nDevelopment of Smart Components and Interconnects.  Persistent themes included reduced power requirements, enhanced battery life, energy harvesting, smaller form factors and lower costs.  Advances are needed in reducing the size, complexity and power consumption of interconnects.  New digital printing and 3D printing methods offer opportunities to transcend existing board-level strategies for component integration.  \nSustainable Design and Manufacturing of High-Performance Materials.  On one hand, higher performing structural, electrical and optical materials are key to meeting the needs of new smart components and interconnects.  On the other hand, due to their ubiquitous nature, smart goods must be recyclable, compostable or biodegradable.  Current biodegradable metals are difficult to handle offering higher electrical resistance.  One promising area of research is the development of a digital material science that can predict the properties of gradient materials made possible by digital printing.  \nScaling of High-Performance Functional Materials.  Scaling functional inks with desired ink-substrate interactions simultaneous with weak ink-print head interactions is extremely challenging.  A major challenge includes the ability to characterize nanomaterials during high-rate synthesis to ensure proper size and shape distribution. \nConversion and Integration of Functional Inks.  Nanoparticle sintering methods that can create the traces at low temperature are of immense interest to industry. Most current work focuses on single materials, and issues such as incompatible chemistries and interfacial bonding are rarely addressed.  A related challenge involves the ability to integrate the nanomaterials into heterogeneous systems without losing their functional properties.  \nLow-cost, Large-area 3D Integration.  Efforts are needed to improve the resolution of conformal printing onto curvilinear surfaces.  Significant innovation is required to enable digital printing that is compatible with roll-to-roll, multi-head processing at an industrial scale..."
