 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Climate Variability Hypothesis (CVH) proposes that the range of temperatures species can tolerate increases with the annual range of temperatures they have experienced over evolutionary time. Climate variability increases with latitude and thus it is expected that temperate species will have wider thermal tolerances, higher dispersal ability, and wider distributions than tropical species. Researchers previously asked if temperate mountain stream insects from Colorado have larger elevation range sizes than tropical species from Ecuador; however, range sizes could only be estimated for common species and specimens could only be collected once. To strengthen this work, stream insects will now be sampled over time (temporal sampling) and a DNA approach will be used to identify all species (common and rare). Temporal sampling will allow researchers to track species' elevational positions as they drift from higher to lower elevations over time. Because the flow of water constantly pushes larvae downstream and temperate larvae spend more time in stream, temperate zone larvae are expected to drift farther downstream during development than tropical species. This work will allow researchers to detect previously overlooked rare species. These advances strengthen an already extensive test of the CVH by incorporation of species movement and rare species into estimates of distributions of elevation range sizes. Results of this work will provide information about how natural selection resulting from climate variability influences species dispersal ability and range sizes with general implications for understanding speciation and the evolution of biodiversity. \r\n\r\nLarval aquatic insects will be collected 6 times over a yearlong period from streams located along transects from ~1500-3500m in the Colorado Rocky Mountains and the Ecuadorian Andes (11 sites at each latitude). On each sampling date at each site, insects will be collected for 5 minutes from all microhabitats within a 100m stream reach using a D-frame net. Samples will be preserved in ethanol and insects will be separated from sediment and detritus. For each sample, all insect tissue will be homogenized and DNA will be extracted and purified using commercially available kits. The animal DNA barcoding gene, Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I (COI), will be PCR amplified. Full-length DNA barcodes will be generated by shotgun sequencing and assembly of COI amplicons using next-generation sequencing on an Illumina platform. DNA barcodes will be queried against a regional reference library to determine the composition of samples, re-estimate elevation range sizes for taxa, and compare range sizes and dispersal ability among latitudes.",

For this initial comparison, spearheaded by a doctoral student for his dissertation, we focused on characterizing EPT communities at many locations spanning a large elevational range and multiple watersheds. These collections were achieved at the expense of being able to visit sampling locations multiple times. Additionally, we focused on numerically abundant species. While the elevational range sizes determined based on this sampling approach were partially in line with our expectations based on theory, discrepancies between our expectations based on prior knowledge, field observations, and our initial results suggested that our analysis could potentially be improved.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To strengthen this original dissertation research, we submitted a Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant proposal to the National Science Foundation for additional collections and analyses. The goal of the proposed research was to more comprehensively characterize the number of species and their distributions across a portion of our original study area using alternative methods. Specifically, we proposed to re-sample a subset of sites on a monthly basis for four months in both Colorado and Ecuador. The motivation for this collection regime was to capture the changing species composition of individual sites through time. Rather than focusing exclusively on numerically abundant taxa, we also proposed to use a new method called &ldquo;DNA metabarcoding&rdquo;, which allows sampling of all species in the community, including species present in low numbers. We hypothesized that these methodological changes could improve our understanding of latitudinal differences in species diversity and distributions in important ways. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>We observed important differences in EPT communities between results based on single collections and results based on combining samples from multiple collections. Using DNA metabarcoding, combining samples from multiple collections (Fig. 1 DDIG time points one through four [T1&ndash;T4]) revealed more stream insect species than found at any single time point during new collections (DDIG T1, T2, T3, or T4). However, working at only eight of the original 26 sampling sites reversed the observation of higher species numbers in Ecuador than Colorado found during the original dissertation research (Dissertation <em>versus</em> DDIG T1&ndash;T4). At both latitudes, communities were strongly affected by elevation (Fig. 2). Additionally, within Colorado, we observed a structuring of communities through time that was not present at higher elevations in Colorado or in Ecuador (Fig. 3). Overall, as predicted by theory outlined in the original Dimensions of Biodiversity project, we observed more species with small elevational ranges in Ecuador than Colorado (Fig. 4). This latitudinal difference was made clearer using the Doctoral Dissertation Improvement Grant methods (Fig. 5), which had the effect of increasing the average estimate of elevational range sizes in Colorado and decreasing estimates in Ecuador.</p>\n<p>Collectively, this research tests a key prediction of a classic hypothesis in ecology and evolutionary biology by comparing the distributions of animals in the temperate zone and the tropics. Together with data on species physiology and population genetics, these distributional data help us predict how species will repond to climate change at different latitudes. For stream ecologists and entomologists, this research also provides insights into several important ideas regarding latitudinal differences in how these species survive and reproduce, specifically that temperate species have long life cycles with few generations per year whereas tropical species have short life cycles with many generations per year. Moreover, the species inventories developed for this study have increased our knowledge of insects by discovering new species and describing their distributions, data that will prove useful for applications such as the monitoring of water quality using insects as indicator species.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/28/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Brian&nbsp;A&nbsp;Gill</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1502008/1502008_10354150_1535492792563_Fig.1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1502008/1502008_10354150_1535492792563_Fig.1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1502008/1502008_10354150_1535492792563_Fig.1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
