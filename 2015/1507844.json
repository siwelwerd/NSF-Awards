There is tremendous interest in using such materials as a basis for using the quantum nature of spin states in computers, because these materials allow control and manipulation of the spins using either applied magnetic or electric fields.  The research group in this project uses ultrafast laser pulses in the mid-infrared to measure the dynamics of these electronic states in single nanowires in order to understand what fundamental interactions dominate their behavior.  With this information the group can optimize the physical nanostructure for specific properties which can be used in both fundamental physics and also for new technologies.   This project involves training undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the art techniques for fabricating and measuring nanostructures which is considered a critical need for the future economic growth in the United States.\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\n\r\nThis project is to research the properties of semiconductor nanowire heterostructures which have large spin-orbit interactions, which usually are also materials with small band gaps.  These materials are considered important candidates as a basis for development of spintronic devices because the spin states can be controlled and manipulated using applied magnetic and electric fields.  The research group uses pump-probe measurements of the Rayleigh scattering efficiency in the mid-infrared from single nanowires in order to probe the electronic states and their dynamics in applied electric and magnetic fields.  The fundamental goal of this research is to understand what fundamental interactions in the nanostructure control their dynamics in order to find ways to design the nanostructure in order to control these states.  Such optimized nanostructures can be used as a basis for the study of new physics and the development of new technologies.  Both graduate and undergraduate students in this project are trained in state-of-the-art synthesis techniques as well as optical spectroscopies which provide sensitive measure of energy states and their interactions within single nanostructures.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was to investigate the electronic states confined to materials which are composed of heavy atoms such as beryllium, tellurium or antimony were the spins (small magnets) exhibit extremely strong interactions.  In addition to these magnets interacting with magnetic fields they also can be controlled by electric fields.  These materials are of strong interest in the development of new very low power and ultrahigh speed devices which might replace our standard computer chips in existing technologies.  This project used light to interrogate particular states in these materials by controlling the energy and polarization of the light, and to look at how these states interact as a function of time by using extremely short pulses of light which are less than 1 picosecond long.  For comparison light travels only 3/10 of one millimeter during that time.  At the same time we looked at how these states and their interactions can be modified by controlling the physical structure of these materials, either through forming needles called semiconductor nanowires, or very thin two dimensional materials.  One of the major results discovered in this project was that if you confined these electronic states within very thin tubes alined along nanoscale semiconductor nanowires (think about a needle which is 1/100 the width of a human hair) it is possible to confine the states to an extent where the quantum wavelength of the electron becomes important.  We actually measured the size of these confined states using electric fields in a single nanowire device, utilizing the quantum confined stark effect.  The electric field perturbs the quantum wavelength in such a way that you can directly measure its confinement.  We showed that as they became hotter it was possible to drive these confined states into delocalized states which are free to move which provided another way of measuring their confinement.  A second major result was to measure how hot carriers which are created by an intense short pulse of light lose energy as a function of time and how that might be controlled.  We found that if the physical structure was controlled through putting an outer layer of a different material surrounding the nanowire, one could make the hot carriers relax extremely slowly by over an order of magnitude when compared with wires which did not have that structure.  This is an extremely important result which is relevant to solar cells.  The solar panels you see on buildings typically lose a large amount of energy to heat which limits their ability to create electric energy we can use.  If one were able to extract the electric energy of the hot carriers before they lose energy solar panels could be made much more efficient.  Such solar cells are called ?Hot Solar Cells? and are of intense interest in the scientific community.  A final important result was in the study of the semiconductor tellurium.  Tellurium is an example of an extremely complex material where the atoms form chains have either left- or right-handed symmetry (envision for example a left- or right-handed screw).  Such chiral materials (meaning left or right handed symmetry) exhibit one of the lowest symmetries available and exhibit quite complex electronic structure which are topological in nature.  In fact this complex structure is in fact enabled and protected by its chiral structure.  Using extremely short light pulses we have shown that it is possible briefly to break the chiral symmetry of the material which changes the protected states in a way which can be measured directly.  This might make it possible to modify similar topological materials which have similar low symmetries.  This project made some important small steps in our understanding of materials composed of heavy atoms where electronic spins and their interactions might be controlled either through electric and magnetic fields or through the physical nanostructure fabricated.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/31/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Leigh M Smith"
