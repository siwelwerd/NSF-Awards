 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concentrated industrial and commercial zones on international borders are frequently promoted by their developers as both engines of economic development and catalysts for improved political relationships. Social scientists have been more skeptical, pointing out that when the countries involved have unequal power, special economic zones may perpetuate instability through increased economic and political inequality. However, there is little research on the on-the-ground processes through which either positive or negative outcomes are realized. University of Chicago doctoral student Jeremy Siegman, who is supervised by Dr. William Mazzarella, will undertake research in a commercial contact zone in the Israeli-occupied West Bank to address this knowledge gap. This is an ideal site because the idea that developing economic ties between Israelis and Palestinians might lead to peaceful coexistence between them and throughout the region has been a mainstay of foreign investment in the region. This will be the first detailed study of Israeli-Palestinian commercial contact in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\r\n\r\nThe researcher will undertake a 12-month ethnographic study of Israeli-Palestinian contact as it takes place in daily practice. He will focus on Israeli-controlled commercial and industrial zones where many Palestinians work and sometimes shop. Research methods will include participant observation of market practices, supplemented with content analyses of media and activist materials; extensive interviews with Israelis and Palestinian workers, shoppers, security agencies and activists; and interviews with local economic analysts. These data will allow him to assess how, through everyday work and shopping practices, Israelis and Palestinians frame their relations to each other and how such framings may also be disrupted or undermined by such ordinary events as workplace disputes, gendered tensions, political or religious debates, and security activities. Only detailed participant-observation and interviews, conducted in both Arabic and Hebrew, can shed light on these complex spaces where two separated social worlds come together. Building on previous experience in the area and his linguistic fluency, Stiegman's research will shed new light on the puzzle of Israeli-Palestinian commercial contact.",

The study found that everyday work and shopping activities entail significant, though subtle, everyday tensions and struggles between Israelis and Palestinians. These include hiring and policing practices that significantly favor Jewish-Israelis, as well as violent encounters around market sites that spike along with the broader political escalations such as wars. The research focused, however, on how and to what extent political identities, antagonisms and tensions manifest within market encounters. Here are four. First, contrary to the notion of the market putting political questions aside (as many social theories have suggested), a dominant group can infuse a particular nationalism into the marketplace, such as through the content of marketing or brazen assertions of power over racialized workers. Such moves can undermine the orientation favored by marketers and diplomats, of acting as if political differences are irrelevant. Second, spurred by expressive, even playful aspects of the retail environment, the dominant group and the marginalized group may engage in explicit performance of what the co-PI is calling &ldquo;playful antagonism,&rdquo; such as poking fun at each other or play-fighting. Third, members of the marginalized worker population may find room to address each other in distinct ways, constructing spaces of their own limited power within the dominant population&rsquo;s space. Finally, the dominant population employs various actors (in this case including military and secret police) to police workers from the marginalized group, which has the twin effects of highly constraining that group&rsquo;s avenues for expression, and, when police actions come to the fore, once again undermining the apparently non-conflictual character of the marketplace.</p>\n<p>Thus the research preliminarily suggests the possibility of market relations informally coming to take on some of the functions of public space, as a venue for socio-political boundaries to be materially and discursively contested and expressed, in ways that formal politics cannot account for.
