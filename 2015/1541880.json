 "awd_abstract_narration": "1541880\r\nPotts\r\n\r\nDrought is pushing California's intertwined food, energy, and water systems to the breaking point. Reservoirs are at historic lows, fields lie fallow, and energy systems struggle on high demand days. Beyond the current drought, California's food, energy, and water systems are further stressed by legacy infrastructure, prior land use decisions, and a population pushing towards 50 million. As the largest agricultural producer in the US, California faces food, energy, and water systems challenges with impacts extending far beyond its own borders, into domestic and international markets. Nearly 46% of California's $46.4 billion in agricultural products is exported internationally; exported along with this food are the water and energy resources used in its production. The interconnectivity of global agricultural markets ensures that California's food, energy, and water systems challenges are likely to be especially acute in dairy, fruit, vegetable, and nut markets. Regionally, as with many western states, California's energy and agriculture systems are dependent on large-scale, snow-fed hydrological systems subject to high climate variability and possess a legacy of polluted soil and groundwater. At the local scale, growing urban populations experience increasing food prices and water use restrictions while rural communities struggle to remain viable in the face of persistent water shortages.\r\n\r\nTo work towards creating more secure, safe, productive, and resilient food, energy and water systems from the local to national scales, the University of California, Berkeley seeks to host a Developing Intelligent Food, Energy, and Water Systems workshop on September 21-22, 2015. Using California as a test bed, the workshop will develop a targeted multi-dimensional research agenda towards the development of intelligent FEWS that increase efficiency across space, time, and applications. The proposed workshop will bring together 60 investigators in the physical, natural, computer, and social sciences, along with engineers, economists, policy-makers, and practitioners from diverse backgrounds. The PIs goal is to enable cross-disciplinary exchange that will identify tractable research questions, promote resourceful problem-solving, and identify educational challenges for the next generation of citizen-scientists. Immediate outputs from the workshop will include: (i) a set of tractable research questions that cut across elements of food, energy, and water systems; (ii) outlines of future research efforts and identification of lead authors for white papers to be generated by 12/31/15; and (iii) ideas about how new scholars should be educated in this set of cross-disciplinary efforts. Specifically, the DIFEWS workshop will explore the synergies across four areas: agroecology; sustainable environmental engineering; consumer behavior; and the application of cyber-physical systems research to food, energy, and water systems. Agroecology, in its application of ecological principles to sustainable food systems, opens up new and traditional channels to food production that can lessen absolute water and energy use. Sustainable environmental engineering uses new approaches to the design and operation of water collection, treatment, and distribution. For example, engineering innovations developed by the NSF's Engineering Research Center for Reinventing the Nation's Urban Water Infrastructure decrease energy use, facilitate resource recovery, and enhance the resilience of water systems. On the energy front, recent investments by public utilities in smart grid infrastructure support real-time coordination of demand- and supply-side responses to changing system conditions. Behavioral economics and the social sciences are actively exploring how consumers interact with these technologies and, in particular, are experimenting with the use of economic incentives to substantively enhance energy efficiency. Finally, the rapidly evolving domain of cyber-physical systems has enabled the use of sensors in physical objects to coordinate optimal allocation of resources across space and time. This technology is utilized in food, energy, and water systems, for example, to safely operate distributed systems for controlling energy and water. At the undergraduate level, workshop themes will be integrated into a large introductory environmental science course and an upper division course on the economics of energy and the environment. At the graduate level, the members of the organizing committee will run a Developing Intelligent Food, Energy, and Water Systems graduate seminar at UC Berkeley during the fall semester of 2015. All seminar participants will be invited to the workshop and will have the opportunity to be an integral part of the team that writes the white papers and subsequent peer reviewed publications. In addition to contributing to the interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students in one of the nation's most ethnically and culturally diverse regions, the organizing committee will reach out to key California food, energy, and water systems planners to share the workshop findings and will partner with Berkeley Energy & Resources Collaborative to reach out to the public on California's food, energy, and water systems issues.",
