 "awd_abstract_narration": "Language is a window into the inner working of the human mind. A great deal of previous work has examined how English speakers understand their mother tongue, and how English speaking children develop their reading, writing and conversational skills to become sufficient English users.  Comparatively little is known about whether speakers of different languages adopt qualitatively or quantitatively different strategies in language communication.  A good understanding of potential cross-linguistic differences bears directly upon a variety of important issues relevant for U.S. society, including the development of more efficient learning and teaching strategies for foreign languages, and of sophisticated technological tools to extract information from foreign text, websites, and written or spoken corpora. The language under investigation in this project is Mandarin Chinese, which, as the official language of China, is a language with significant national interest to the U.S., due to the growing influence of China's economic and political power.  Chinese immigrants also form one of the largest foreign-born groups living in the United States. \r\n\r\nThe particular empirical domain of the current project is on the structure of questions in Chinese. The project consists of two major components. First, a series of behavioral experiments will investigate how Chinese speakers, conditioned by the particular grammatical properties of the Chinese language, make decisions about how to best memorize, recall and anticipate linguistic information encoded in Chinese questions. Second, detailed computational and statistical models will be developed to provide a framework to explain these behaviors. Technological tools will also be developed to work with Chinese corpora. The combination of the behavioral and computational methods makes it possible to answer questions about what differences exist between English and Chinese, and how language users adapt to these differences so as to maximize communicative efficiency in each language. A substantial part of the project also includes training students in cutting-edge research questions, methods, and establishing close international collaboration with leading language researchers and institutions in China.",
