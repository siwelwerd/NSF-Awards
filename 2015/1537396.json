 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Organizational Communication and Information Systems (OCIS) doctoral consortium at the 2015 Academy of Management meeting in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, will bring together approximately 25 dissertation-stage OCIS doctoral students for one and a half days of talks and interactions with distinguished OCIS researcher faculty. The Academy of Management is a well-established professional organization for scholars, social scientists, and management leaders, and OCIS is a division of the Academy. The OCIS division at the annual AOM meetings provides a leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of research and practical issues related to the use and impact of information and communication technologies in organizations.\r\n\r\nThe doctoral consortium provides highly-talented students with feedback on their work from other students and faculty members, allowing them to enhance their own research proposal. As well, because of the diversity of the communities involved, the consortium will allow students to make connections beyond their own disciplines. Both faculty and students are diverse on several dimensions, notably research topics, methodological approaches, and cultural background. As a result, participation will allow students to develop a better understanding of the different research communities, which will facilitate their participation in future inter-disciplinary research. This event has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding OCIS researchers, in the past. It provides feedback to students in order to develop higher quality and more relevant research in the field of organizational communication and information systems.",
