The ISEE is piloting new Chapters to expand beyond the University of California, Santa Cruz, where ISEE is headquartered. This expansion has been driven by the impact of ISEE's programs and by ISEE alumni's enthusiasm for staying connected to a community that values education and mentoring efforts. ISEE alumni from institutions across the U.S. will share ideas about the challenges and important positive steps needed to build influence toward inclusive teaching and mentoring at their home institutions. \r\n\r\nRecommendations from this workshop will be applicable beyond ISEE and collaborating institutions, to the astronomy community in general. The recommendations from this workshop will contribute to an expanded plan for leaders in astronomy, and related fields, to engage with a more diverse community of scientists.",
