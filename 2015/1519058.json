The PI's group has recently demonstrated low-energy, low-emission, net-zero water reuse, converting comingled black and grey water to drinking water at a university residence hall. While such technology has not been feasible for remote field deployment due to operational complexity and energy demand, the advent of new, energy-efficient, low-maintenance, small, light microplasma ozone generation modules along with the emerging UV-ozone advanced oxidation make such a vision possible. \r\n\r\nCurrent advanced oxidation and membrane filtration technologies require chemical dosing or other operationally-intensive procedures, and/or disposal of a concentrate stream, making remote deployment impractical. However, emerging UV-ozone advanced oxidation technology, coupled with new, low-energy, low-maintenance microplasma ozone generation modules, offers promise of clean water production anywhere, at any time. Therefore, design principles for chemical? and maintenance-free remote production of clean water, with annual lamp replacement, occasional rainwater makeup, and no human wastewater contact will be developed. Principles will include the integration and sizing of UV-ozone, microplasma ozone generation, and low-maintenance separations, mixing, and hydraulic technologies. Knowledge of kinetics and mechanisms of UV-ozone soap/foam mineralization, and the critical science of microbial and Ebola viral inactivation, will be advanced. This project, will develop a field-deployable, UV-microplasma-ozone net-zero water wash station (NZWWS) for Ebola decontamination. Tasks include industry-collaborative design and prototype construction using technology and equipment from the PI's current NSF Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation project.  Kinetic tests of soap/foam mineralization; and viral inactivation using Bacillus thuringensis spores, MS2 bacteriophage, and Cystoviridae as Ebolavirus surrogates by current EPA collaborators.  Spartan Environmental Technologies, LLC expects to be in a position to manufacture units by late 2015. The project will include two industry seminars, and continued scientific training of under-represented populations, part of a team of 70 students to date, including 34 female, 1 African-American, and 14 Hispanic undergraduates and high school interns. Graduate students will supervise 1-4 ten-week high-school internships, over summer 2015. Finally, two students of CAE 542 Environmental Health and two students of CAE 540 Environmental Chemistry will collaborate on a term project involving kinetic testing of the operating prototype.",

Viruses under surveillance by the World Health Organization in this regard are Lassa fever, Nipah, Rift Valley fever, SARS, MERS and emerging coronaviruses, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, Chikungunya, Zika, and Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS). Rapid response at the point of outbreak is critical to containment, and clean running water at that point in time and location can be critical to effective response. In fact, a critical step in containment is removal of protective gear upon exit from quarantine, CDC guidelines for which include multiple hand washings. Unfortunately, many emergency health care centers may lack local running water.

Specifically, the system should achieve a roughly 85% recycling rate, and accept local rain, ground, or surface water as available. At a minimum, the system was to provide effective sterilization (&gt;12-log reduction in virus) and complete mineralization of organics (&lt; 0.5 mg/L total organic carbon, TOC) in 260 gal./day of water, at an energy demand of~1300 W continuous power (17 gal. diesel fuel/week). The system should operate without the need for the addition of chemicals, and with no human wastewater contact, ultimately incorporating new high-efficiency microplasma ozone generation with emerging UV-ozone advanced oxidation treatment. Tasks included industry-collaborative design and prototype construction using technology and equipment from the PI&rsquo;s current NSF EFRI project; kinetic tests of soap/foam mineralization; and kinetic test of viral inactivation using <em>Bacillus thuringensis</em> spores, MS2 bacteriophage, and <em>Cystoviridae</em> as Ebolavirus surrogates by current US Environmental Protection Agency collaborators.</p>\n<p>Principal intellectual outcomes of this RAPID project (funding for one year to address an urgent need) comprise chemical, microbiological, and design principles for remote production of clean water, in hot, humid, and arid, remote locations.

The final two-tank, fed batch system design roughly meets the goals proposed in terms of recycled water production per unit of energy required. That is, although the average male/female contribution of body organics to shower drain water was higher than anticipated (30 mg/L), a wash water recycle rate of 85% was achieved, with complete mineralization of 82,400 mg TOC/d (68.0 mg TOC/L, surfactant, conditioner, and body organics), and effective sterilization, at a flow rate of 320 gal/d. Hence, at 10 gal/shower, the system can supply 2240 gal of water (224 showers) per week, at 1920 W of continuous power (~25 gal diesel fuel per week) using only ~336 gal of input water per week, reducing the need for expensive water importation. Treated water meets drinking water standards, except for (a) bromate, which may be controlled by eliminating bromide from soap and conditioner, and (b) nitrate, derived from body organics, generally of concern only for infants.
