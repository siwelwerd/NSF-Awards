 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides partial support for The Fourth International Conference on the Effects of Noise on Aquatic Life will take place in Dublin, Ireland, July 10-16, 2016. This meeting follows the very successful meetings on the same general topic held in Nyborg, Denmark (2007), Cork,Ireland (2010), and Budapest, Hungary (2013). The major goal of the conference will be to define the current state of knowledge on the impact of underwater noise and, in particular, explore the progress made in this field in the three years since the previous Conference. The extension of renewable energy and petroleum projects to offshore waters, the prospect of industrial development of previously pristine waters (e.g., polar regions), and recent proposals to open new areas for petroleum lease (e.g., US Atlantic coast) has resulted in greater interest in the effects of underwater noise on aquatic life on the part of regulators, industry, and scientists.\r\n\r\nThe meeting should help shape future research and understanding of effects of noise on aquatic life. Based on experience from the earlier meetings, the interactions and networking that took place has resulted in new collaborations between investigators, a broader understanding of the science that can be used in their work by regulators, a better understanding of regulatory issues by scientists and industry, and substantial cross-fertilization of experimental design and approaches by investigators.",

The meeting served to provide for scientific presentations, discussion, and networking to enable sharing of ideas and knowledge.</h3>\n<p class=\"Times12\"><strong>APPROACH</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Times12\">The meeting was organized by five investigators, with Dr. Popper (PI on this proposal). Drs. <i>C<strong>hristine Erbe</strong></i> (Australia) and <strong><i>Joseph Sisneros</i></strong> (USA) helped with the organization of the 2012 meeting.&nbsp; Drs. <strong><i>Anthony Hawkins</i></strong> (UK) and <strong><i>Arthur Popper</i></strong> (USA) founded and ran the first three meetings, and are in the processing of turning over responsibility for the meeting to the other organizers. Dr. <strong><i>Frank Thomsen</i></strong> (Denmark) just joined the group to being an additional representative from Europe and someone with expertise in marine mammals. Funding was provided by many organizations including BOEM. See our web site for a complete list.</p>\n<p class=\"Times12\"><strong>WORK</strong> <strong>COMPLETED</strong></p>\n<p><i>The Effects of Noise on Aquatic Life </i>took place in Dublin, Ireland in 2016. Dublin was selected since the Irish marine science and marine industries are strong and because Dublin is easily accessible from anywhere in the world.</p>\n<p>This conference brought together scientists, regulators, environmentalist and industry representatives to learn about and discuss the potential effects of man-made noise on aquatic organisms. Emphasis was on cross-fertilization of ideas and findings across species and noise sources. This kind of sharing of material is of exceptional value since there are many commonalities in issues that never get appreciated except at meetings that cross disciplines and ideas. Participants learned about matters that they normally do not encounter. For example, scientists learned about the concerns of regulators, while industry representatives learn about the latest data, etc.</p>\n<p class=\"Times12\">The number of participants at the conferences has been steadily growing since the first meeting in Denmark in 2007. There were 202 delegates and 134 presentations in Nyborg; 244 (2007) delegates from 22 countries and 111 presentations in Cork (2010); 243 delegates from 24 countries and 125 presentations in Budapest (2013); and 323 delegates from 23 countries and 229 presentations in Dublin. Indeed, it was necessary to limit the number of registrations in Dublin and to keep a waiting list as the venue was reaching capacity.</p>\n<p class=\"Times12\"><strong>IMPACT/REVIEW</strong></p>\n<p>The meeting was highly successful and was, as indicated, attended by 323 delegates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An online survey was set up at the end of the conference and 189 participants (60%) responded within two weeks (a full copy of the survey results, without identifying material of responders, can be made available upon request from funders). The age distribution of the meeting (Table 1) shows that almost 50% of the participants were under 40 years of age, suggesting that there is an increasing number of younger people interested in the topic of the meeting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;About 28% of participants were graduate students and postdocs, and another 24% university faculty (Table 2), meaning that almost half of the participants represented other stakeholders. This is of particular importance since one of the major purposes of the meeting is to bring together people from various backgrounds and employment sectors to discuss issues of underwater noise. Also, 23 countries were represented at the meeting.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;There was general satisfaction with the overall meeting (Table 4). The major criticism regarded the poster space, which was too small due to an unanticipated number of submitted abstracts. People very much liked the talks and particularly the speed talks, as well as our opportunity to present awards to the best student papers (Coates Award). Participants quite uniformly appreciated that we did not have parallel sessions. And, most importantly, people commented on the exceptional opportunities for conversations and networking.</p>\n<p><strong><br /> PUBLICATIONS</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike past meetings, we did not require participants to provide papers for publication. All abstracts, however, are available for download on the meeting website (<a href=\"http://www.aquaticnoise2019.org/2016/index.html\">http://www.aquaticnoise2019.org/2016/index.html</a>).</p>\n<p>In addition, all participants receiving any meeting support were required to submit papers to a special volume (#27) of the <i>Proceedings of Meetings on Acoustics</i> (POMA), a scientific journal of the Acoustical Society of America (ASA). The papers are open access and can be found at:&nbsp; <a href=\"http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/poma/27/1\">http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/poma/27/1</a>.
