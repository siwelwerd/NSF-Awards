 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, funded by the Division of Chemistry, Indiana University will host a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site with an emphasis in materials chemistry and assembly.  Research training and mentorship will be provided for eight students for ten weeks during the summers of 2016, 2017, and 2018. The overall goal is to give REU students a unique educational experience that facilitates learning about how materials assemble from smaller entities over different length scales (i.e., nanometers to micrometers) and the function of assembled forms. Broader impacts are addressed in that as students are exposed to cutting-edge research in materials chemistry and assembly this will promote the idea of pursuing a career in the sciences while refining students' skills to ensure their succeed in STEM programs and careers. Each student is expected to produce and disseminate high-impact research. Students who do not have the opportunity to participate in interdisciplinary research at their home institutions, and those whose research experiences could be augmented through participation in a program at a research-intensive institution are targeted for recruitment. In particular, students from Primarily Undergraduate Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), and 2-year colleges are especially encouraged to participate through new and existing partnerships. The participation of women and first generation college students is emphasized. \r\n\r\nThe projects for REU students include both synthesis and characterization of assembled materials and their building blocks. The scientific and training objectives of the program are to enable students to: (1) identify interdisciplinary research and the unique skill sets that must be developed to approach this type of research; (2)learn chemical concepts that drive their research and specific skills to execute experiments; (3) conduct literature searches relevant to research and evaluate papers for key findings and tested hypotheses; (4) learn key aspects of effective scientific communication through interactions with subject-matter experts, knowledgeable peer groups, and the general public; (5) expand their understanding of opportunities within STEM disciplines through roundtables with faculty, question-and-answer sessions with current graduate students, and an introduction to entrepreneurship; and (6) conduct research in an ethical and safe manner through classroom and hands-on training.",
