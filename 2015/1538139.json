 "awd_abstract_narration": "Innovative connected vehicle solutions can address major societal problems of safety, mobility, energy, and air quality. This research is to study the role of wireless connectivity and how information from vehicle and transportation system infrastructure based sensors can be integrated, processed, and disseminated. A technical challenge is enabling drivers and/or autonomous vehicles to take advantage of new and intelligent technologies, and estimate how they will respond to new forms of information, and how feedback (early warnings and control assistance) can help improve performance. Especially important in this context is driving volatility, characterized by hard accelerations/braking, jerky movements, sharp lane changes or turns, and abnormally high speeds. Can these be mapped to a combination of local and global traffic states surrounding the vehicles? Are they related to how surrounding vehicles behave and are they related to socio-demographics of drivers? These questions will be answered by leveraging connectivity and cooperation between vehicles and civil infrastructure. The research will involve the development of analytic procedures for understanding driving volatility, and the use of data for generating information and driver feedback. The research will advance the multidisciplinary field of driver behavior and cyber-physical systems, broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research, and enhance engineering education.\r\n \r\nThe objective of this research is to model computationally efficient algorithms for predicting driver actions and volatility using information about their prior behaviors combined with positions and motions obtained via wireless communications. A Markov Decision Process framework will be used to develop models that anticipate instantaneous driver maneuver decisions. Driver-specific estimates of rewards and penalties for available maneuver choices in driving situations will be learned using Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning and gossip algorithms. The effect of social persuasions from other drivers in a connected and cooperative vehicle system environment will be quantified. Subsequently, systematic representation of individual driver policies, along with emergent cyber-physical system information will enable: 1) preemptive warnings and assists to drivers based on anticipated maneuvers that are potentially unsafe, 2) expanded spatio-temporal sphere of influence to slow down vehicles approaching an incident, reducing chances of cascading incidents, and 3) maneuver suggestions to drivers that are sequentially optimized for the entire group (or small clusters) of following vehicles in the event of an incident. The potential widespread adoption of the research findings will benefit society by advancing key methodologies at the boundaries of connected vehicles systems.",

CAVs generate large amounts of data that enables deeper analysis of individual drivers&rsquo; decision mechanisms and helps transportation agencies develop and disseminate information-based solutions for safe and efficient mobility. New ideas are needed to fully harness the large-scale CAV datasets that have increasingly higher specificity in terms of time and space (see Figure 1). The new idea proposed in this project is to understand &ldquo;volatility&rdquo; in instantaneous driving decisions and where possible reduce it thereby increasing driving and locational stability (see Figure 2). After defining volatility as the extent of differences from normal driving, it was operationalized at both the driver/vehicle level, i.e., when drivers undertake trips, and at the transportation network level, i.e., at intersections, ramps, and road segments.</p>\n<p>Fundamentally, driving volatility is a construct that can be measured using different metrics. The idea is to use vehicle trajectory data to understand and quantify deviations in instantaneous driving decisions and their correlates (see Figure 3). Furthermore, by tethering the trajectory data spatially, volatility of vehicle passings at specific locations can be explored for developing proactive solutions. The knowledge generated in this study provides a strong behavioral basis for CAV solutions that can be used by transportation agencies and applications including hazard notification, cooperative decision-making in traffic, and real-time or predictive in-vehicle driver feedback that can be helpful to vehicle manufacturers. Empirical analysis shows that driving volatility is a &ldquo;leading indicator&rdquo; of crashes and risky behaviors. Also, driving volatility itself is related to various factors in the driving environment, such as traffic density, roadway types, and driver distractions. Overall, the foundational methods for extracting useful information from CAV and related data are developed that will enhance safe and efficient mobility. In particular, by developing and applying new data analytic techniques, the study enables generation of actionable information for innovative real-life solutions that transportation agencies and private sector companies can use.</p>\n<p>The project outcomes include expanded knowledge about understanding and predicting instantaneous driving decisions by developing computationally efficient algorithms using information about drivers&rsquo; prior behaviors combined with their positions and motions obtained via wireless communications and global positioning systems. Methodologically, we have successfully introduced applications of Markov-Decision Processes, Gossip Algorithms and statistical models to harness large-scale CAV data. Using Basic Safety Message data from instrumented vehicles, Dynamic Markov switching models were estimated for drivers&rsquo; decisions to accelerate, decelerate and cruise on several trips undertaken on various roadway types. Such techniques contribute to the scientific analysis of real-world connected vehicle data and extract actionable information embedded in such data, e.g., predicting driving regimes at a specific instant of time while accounting for the effects of instantaneous driving contexts. Additionally, Gossip Algorithms developed in this study capture the social influence of other drivers in the largely physics-based car-following traffic models that are at the core of transportation simulations, needed to improve vehicle movements. The team also simulated safety of traffic characterized by a mixture of human-driven and self-driven automated vehicles. In terms of technology development, we have contributed to the engineering of CAV systems by developing algorithms and driver warning applications/tools that take advantage of modern sensors and vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity.</p>\n<p>Diverse spatial contexts were considered in this project and algorithms were developed for vehicle merging at on-ramps with vehicle-to-vehicle connectivity and cooperative drivers. Specifically, the team field-demonstrated the successful use of dedicated short-range communication technologies to help with cooperative advisory-based freeway merging and also passing slower vehicles on rural roads. Furthermore, connected vehicle trajectory data was used to proactively identify dangerous intersections and roadway segments in urban areas. Such information will help transportation agencies identify locations where crashes may be waiting to happen.</p>\n<p>The project has enhanced the infrastructure for research and education in intelligent cyber-physical systems by developing Virtual Reality capability to capture interactions among several connected and automated vehicles in simulated environments (see Figure 4). Furthermore, the project has engaged and informed students by developing and deploying a scientific framework for next-generation research on CAVs. This research is at the intersection of vehicular traffic data and computer-based applications, which helped provide interdisciplinary training to five Ph.D. students and four undergraduate students; several middle-school students also benefited from exposure to short summer courses. In particular, graduate students benefited from courses offered by faculty and through hands-on experience with emerging sensor-systems and wireless communications. Graduate students were also exposed to data capture and processing, algorithm development, optimization and field implementation. Overall, the insights obtained from this project can aid transportation agencies and private sector companies in proactively developing intelligent solutions that can target rapid diffusion of CAV technologies to enhance safe and efficient mobility in transportation networks.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/31/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Asad&nbsp;J&nbsp;Khattak</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538139/1538139_10393439_1546286195740_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538139/1538139_10393439_1546286195740_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538139/1538139_10393439_1546286195740_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Overall framework for \"Driving Volatility\" study</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Khattak</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Asad&nbsp;J&nbsp;Khattak</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538139/1538139_10393439_1546295025707_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538139/1538139_10393439_1546295025707_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538139/1538139_10393439_1546295025707_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Measuring \"Driving Volatility.\"</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Khattak & Wali</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Asad&nbsp;J&nbsp;Khattak</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538139/1538139_10393439_1546295353578_Figure3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538139/1538139_10393439_1546295353578_Figure3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538139/1538139_10393439_1546295353578_Figure3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Visualization of Basic Safety Message data?gray dots indicate ?Driving Volatility?</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Liu & Khattak</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Asad&nbsp;J&nbsp;Khattak</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538139/1538139_10393439_1546295483092_Figure4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538139/1538139_10393439_1546295483092_Figure4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538139/1538139_10393439_1546295483092_Figure4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example screen-capture image from driving simulator</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Chakraborty & Khattak</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Asad&nbsp;J&nbsp;Khattak</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
