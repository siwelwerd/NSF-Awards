 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Biomaterials program in the Division of Materials Research to Clemson Univerity is to provide student support to attend the conference titled \"Frontiers in Biomagnetic Particles IV\" in Telluride, Colorado. The focus of this three-day symposium is on the synthesis, characterization and control of biomagnetic nanomaterials as carriers with a wide range of biomedical, environmental and industrial applications. This international event will bring scientists, engineers and biomedical professionals together, and they will present their recent studies and results, and discuss this rapidly growing and highly interdisciplinary field. The symposium builds upon earlier three successful conferences organized by these investigators. The broader impact goal of this proposal is to increase the participation of women and underrepresented minority students in science and engineering areas. This travel support would provide them with a unique opportunity in interacting and networking with other scientists outside of their normal educational experiences. Additionally, the organizers would make every effort to have at least 50% women and minority students as session chairs in leading the discussion on the research topics being presented at the conference.\r\n\r\nMagnetic particles are an enabling technology for a wide variety of biomedical, chemical, electronic, and functional materials applications, and these particles are expected to  provide a unique handle in manipulating and sensing nanostructures. Since this field would greatly benefit from multidisciplinary interactions from chemists, biologists, physicists, and engineers, the main goal of this conference would be to create a technical and professional environment in which participants from diverse disciplines could interact. This conference will be designed to discuss recent trends and activities related to biomagnetic nanoparticles and initiation of future collaborations among the attendees. Biomagnetic nanoparticles are unique materials, properties of which could be controlled, transported and imaged using external fields. Four specific topic areas will be highlighted at this conference: a) Biosensors and imaging; b) Biomagnetic separations and transport; c) Biomedical applications such as drug delivery; and d) Career and professional development opportunities for students.",
