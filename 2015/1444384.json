 "awd_abstract_narration": "Volcanic lightning is a common but understudied phenomenon that is poorly parameterized. This project focuses on learning more about the properties of ash particles relating to their role in the generation of electrical fields in volcanic plumes and in volcanic lightning. In addition to being a charge carrier, volcanic ash may also influence the production of lightning due to its potential role in ice nucleation and as polarized, conducting particles. A range of material laboratory testing and characterization techniques will be used on samples obtained from several Alaskan volcanoes to determine if ash samples of different mineral and structurally bound water content will affect the functionality of conducting/insulating ash materials, and their ice nucleation affinity. Generation of volcanic (silicic glass) spherules as an indicator of the production of specific ash grain textures during volcanic lightning episodes will also be sought for.  \r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the proposed research include the training of undergraduate students, creation of teaching materials, and the support of an early career researcher. Improved understanding of volcanic hazards for the aviation, communication, and power generation industries are additional potential societal impacts",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project analyzed the chemical, mineralogical, and grain size characteristics of volcanic ash to determine which properties affect its electrical conductivity, influence on water electrical conductivity, and ability to form ice crystals in the atmosphere.  This information is relevant to knowledge of hazards to electrical infrastructure and water supplies following explosive volcanic eruptions and the likelihood of particular volcanoes to produce volcanic lightning. \n\nResults indicate that volcanic ash is an insulating material, having very low electrical conductivity when dry at room temperature.  Variations in bulk chemical composition or mineral content do not affect its conductivity, but samples with a mixture of smaller and larger ash grain sizes appear to have higher conductivities than samples with dominantly larger grains.  Thus, the size distribution of volcanic ash particles will affect the electrical conductivity of the deposit.  Although minerals present in volcanic ash will not influence the electrical conductivity when it is dry, introducing that ash into water supplies will have an effect on water chemistry.  Minerals containing magnesium, calcium, and sodium will cause increased electrical conductivity of any contaminated water supplies.   From all of the samples tested, those with a high abundance of olivine and pyroxene-group minerals had the most significant impact on the electrical conductivity of exposed waters.  Therefore, eruptions of magma containing these particular minerals may influence the local and regional water quality in regard to these dissolved elements, and thus, electrical conductivity.\n\nIce nucleation experiments were conducted on ash samples of various compositions from several volcanoes and show that volcanic ash is a very efficient ice nucleating particle in both the deposition-mode and in the immersion-mode.  Deposition-mode nucleation occurs when ice crystallizes directly from the vapor phase onto ash grains, and regardless of ash composition and mineral content, all samples display similarly efficient behavior.   If an ash grain is surrounded by water and reaches the appropriate altitude in the atmosphere to freeze the water droplet, immersion-mode nucleation occurs.  The most efficient samples in the immersion-mode were high silica ash samples with low mineral contents (i.e., high glass contents) and low amounts of the transition metals manganese and titanium. These efficient samples heterogeneously nucleated ice at -20 oC, and water will homogeneously freeze at -39.55 oC.   Ash abundance, which creates more available surface area on which ice can freeze, has the greatest effect on immersion-mode freezing compared to composition and mineralogy.  Greater amounts of ash in water droplets caused more ice to form at each temperature investigated.  Therefore, introduction of high-silica, fine-grained ash into the atmosphere will cause ice crystals to form at a much lower altitude than normal. \n\nThe explosive energy of a volcanic eruption controls both the proportion of ash generated and the size of the ash particles.  More explosive eruptions tend to produce smaller ash particles, and a wide range in ash particle sizes will make the ash more electrically conductive.   Additionally, highly explosive eruptions of compositionally evolved magmas reflect the necessary parameters for nucleating ice on ash grain surfaces, which permits triboelectrification due to collisions between ice particles and contributes to the frequent occurrence of volcanic lightning within the eruptive column and plume during these events. \n\nResults of this research allows us to classify volcanoes as more electrically hazardous to water supplies if the magmas contain certain minerals enriched in magnesium, calcium, and sodium.  We can classify volcanic ash as more electrically conductive if it contains a wide range of grain sizes, but volcanic ash is insulating when dry at room temperature.  We can classify explosive eruptions as more likely to produce volcanic lightning when the explosion produces a high concentration of very fine particles (&lt;32 &mu;m) and the eruptive column or plume reaches the -20 oC isotherm in the atmosphere. \n\nThis project supported three graduate students during their thesis research and results were presented at several international scientific conferences. Findings allow a better assessment of the hazards posed by volcanic ash to various aspects of human society, including the electrical infrastructure that we all depend on and water supplies that exist for human consumption, livestock, and agriculture.  Results of this project allow scientists (and subsequently, government and public officials) to more accurately evaluate the susceptibility of local and regional communities to these hazards based upon the eruption characteristics of individual volcanic events and knowledge of the erupting magma composition and mineral content. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kimberly D Genareau"
