 "awd_abstract_narration": "It has become increasingly evident that the health of plants, like that of humans, depends largely on their close interaction with microbes.  This hidden world of microbes influences processes critical to the storage of carbon in the soil, which in turn stabilizes the soil to prevent erosion, and provides a source of nutrients and water to support plant growth.  Many plant species form associations with certain types of fungi that grow around their roots.  These fungi, known as ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF), engage in a symbiosis, exchanging nutrients for sugars, thereby promoting belowground storage of soil carbon.  Using carbon from the host plant as fuel, EMF branch out from the root surface to form networks and improve surface area for nutrient uptake.  However, when the carbon supply from the plant is limited, EMF may compete with free-living (non-symbiotic) microbes for both nutrients and carbon.  Alternatively, instead of direct competition, EMF could also \"cheat\" or capture the degraded products generated by the action of other microbes in the community.  This project supports ongoing dissertation research to establish whether EMF might use plant degradation products released by another organism (i.e. \"cheat\").  Results of this research will contribute to a better understanding of the role of fungi in plant litter degradation.  The results will also improve predictions about the effects of climate change on decomposition.  The broader impacts of this study include the training a doctoral student as well as opportunities for training of several undergraduate students.\r\n\r\nMicrobial species vary in their ability to break down recalcitrant plant polymers, such as cellulose and lignin, into easily metabolized monomers.  The diversity of gene combinations for extracellular enzymes (ECE) seen in microbial genomes points to a differential ability to degrade these polymers.  The preliminary tests of this project leveraged model organisms grown in controlled microcosms, thereby profiting from a controlled experimental setting and sequence data available for well-studied species.  These tests demonstrated that polymer-degrading enzyme activity in EMF is not directly reflective of the presence of enzyme-degrading genes.  The current project will bolster the initial results via metatranscriptomic analyses, shed light on competitive interactions between EMF and free-living saprotrophs at the gene expression level, and show how EMF optimize their success in a particular environment. The researchers will be comparing mRNA sequences to full genome sequences, using standard methods to map each sequence read to a corresponding genome. This will allow for quantification of expressed ECE genes in EMF in competition with other microorganisms and without a carbon supply from a host plant.  Shifts in expression of these genes, coupled with physiological data, will allow the researchers to verify whether those organisms that consume polymer degradation products are also expressing ECE genes (i.e., whether they are cheating).  The knowledge gained from this research will enhance our understanding of the role of EMF in decomposition and to incorporate their activities in carbon cycling models.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEcosystem processes regulated by plant-microbial interactions include nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration in soils.  However, these processes are also affected by interactions among microbial groups, which are less well-understood.  Saprotrophic fungi and ectomycorrhizal fungi compete for organic compounds released during the decomposition of plant litter.  Saprotrophic fungi absorb organic molecules to use as both carbon substrate and as a source of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus).  To gain access to additional organic compounds, saprotrophic fungi release extracellular enzymes that break down plant polymers.  In contrast, ectomycorrhizal fungi form a symbiosis with woody plant species roots, in which carbon fixed by the plant is exchanged for nutrients (primarily nitrogen and phosphorus) that the fungus takes up from the soil.  This mutually beneficial symbiosis supports the growth of both partners.  Ectomycorrhizal fungi scavenge both inorganic and organic forms of nutrients from the soil, competing with saprotrophic fungi for organic compounds.  However, because ectomycorrhizal fungi are typically supplied carbon substrate by their plant partner, many of these species have a reduced ability to secrete the extracellular enzymes necessary for polymer degradation, and may still rely on saprotrophs for this step.  Thus, ectomycorrhizal fungi may simultaneously compete and depend on saprotrophs, creating a situation where the ectomycorrhizal activity may be best described as \"cheating\", and this may have consequences for nutrient and carbon dynamics in forest ecosystems.\n\nActivities on this project focused on controlled experiments using metatranscriptome sequencing and various physiological measurements.  This involved education and training opportunities for co-PI and Ph.D. candidate N.

We tested the hypothesis that both ectomycorrhizal and saprotrophic fungi would shift gene expression in response to direct interactions, but that the ectomycorrhizal fungi would be able to take up degradation products released by activity of a saprotroph. \n\nWe grew three ectomycorrhizal fungal species (Cenococcum geophilum, Laccaria bicolor, and Boletus edulis) and two polymer degrading saprotrophs (Phanerochaete chrysosporium &amp; Talaromyces stipitatus) in monoculture and co-culture, pairing each ectomycorrhizal species with each saprotroph.  Experiments were performed in microcosms containing sterile leaf litter.  Using Illumina sequencing of mRNA extracted from the microcosms, we detected numerous gene transcripts expressed by saprotrophic fungi that were significantly up-regulated or down-regulated in expression due to co-culture with ectomycorrhizal fungi.  Enzyme activities of co-cultures primarily reflected values seen in saprotrophic organism monocultures, or were slightly reduced.  However, total biomass in co-cultures tended to be higher than in monocultures.  Likewise, respiration increased due to presence of the ectomycorrhizal fungus B. edulis compared to either P. chrysosporium or T. stipitatus alone, and respiration increased in C. geophilum+T. stipitatus microcosms compared to T. stipitatus alone.  Respiration also increased relative to the saprotrophic microbe monocultures due to the presence of L. bicolor, but not nearly the extent that could be expected from L. bicolor monocultures.  Although additional analysis of transcriptome data is needed for verification, cheating by the ectomycorrhizal fungi is one potential explanation for the increases in biomass and respiration, without a concomitant increase in enzyme activity.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/06/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher B Blackwood"
