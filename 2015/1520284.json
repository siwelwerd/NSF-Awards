 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phase I project is to improve the quality of care for patients who suffer from internal\r\nscarring triggered by abdominal surgery. Patients with severe scar formation often require a\r\nfollow-up surgical procedure called adhesiolysis. Adhesiolysis is performed to cut away the\r\ninternal scars that have bridged different organs or caused intestinal obstructions. Annually,\r\n540,000 adhesiolysis procedures are performed in the US. These secondary surgical\r\nprocedures can also cause additional scar formation resulting in cycles of repeat procedures.\r\nWhile current barrier products reduce the severity of internal scarring by 51%, they all degrade\r\nafter a few weeks. Furthermore, none are approved for use during laparoscopic procedures, a\r\npreferred technique for adhesiolysis. Traditionally, products used for scar reduction have been\r\nmade from materials that degrade. In contrast, the proposed device is made from a nondegrading\r\nmaterial that has been safely used in the body for the past 40 years. This stronger\r\nmaterial enables laparoscopic use and ensures separation of internal organs. As such, this\r\nproposed device has shown promising results in pilot studies and could lead to a new standard\r\nof care for patients at risk for severe internal scar formation.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project aims to develop an implantable barrier film to reduce scar\r\nformation inside the body after abdominal surgery. Current conventional thinking in biomaterial\r\nselection for scar reducing barrier films has relied primarily on resorbable materials. However,\r\nthese barriers do not perform well enough to be utilized in severe adhesion cases nor\r\nlaparoscopic procedures. The implementation of a permanent barrier in this space stems from\r\nthe development of non-resorbable synthetic meshes for the repair of abdominal and pelvic\r\nhernias. Furthermore, the non-degrading property of the permanent film ensures long-term\r\ncontrol over the surface topography, which has been shown to play a substantial role in cell\r\nadhesion. The project goals are to evaluate a non-resorbable barrier that maintains an\r\nextremely smooth, mildly hydrophobic surface in the healing process of internal tissue surfaces.\r\nA twelve week definitive animal (rabbit) study utilizing an established surgical adhesion\r\nabdominal model will determine the efficacy of the proposed device to reduce surgical adhesion\r\nformation as compared to a control group and a commercially available product. If successful,\r\nthe results will influence decisions concerning material composition for future anti-adhesion,\r\nanti-scarring, and other implants in addition to providing a better understanding of internal\r\nwound healing pathways",
