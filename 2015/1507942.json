 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThe development of stable and efficient batteries for a variety of applications, ranging from micro devices to electric vehicles to energy storage from renewable sources, is an important societal need which can benefit from the results of basic research on materials. Improvements to current battery technology require innovations in the materials making up the positive and negative electrodes, the electrolyte materials through which ionic species moves, the interfaces between these materials, and the integrated battery itself.  Recently, there has been considerable progress in developing batteries constructed with all solid state components.  These have efficiency and stability advantages over batteries developed with liquid or gel electrolytes. \r\n\r\nThis award supports computational research and education that focus on using a variety of computational techniques to study several solid electrolyte systems and their interfaces with ideal electrodes.  Computer simulations of solid electrolyte crystals and their interfaces with electrode materials will be used to identify compositions and structures of ideal stable and metastable materials and to establish attributes which control their ionic conductivities. \r\n\r\nThe research team composed of the PI and several undergraduate and graduate students will work in close collaboration with several experimental groups.  In this mentoring environment, undergraduate students will receive their first exposure to scientific methods, and graduate students will learn and develop basic skills and practices needed for their professional careers as scientists.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL SUMMARY\r\n\r\nThis award supports computational research and education on the development and use of simulation methods to make realistic models of materials, focusing on solid electrolytes and their interfaces with electrodes relevant to the development of all solid state batteries. In addition to studying the equilibrium properties of these systems, development of the simulation methods to study transport properties will also be pursued. Close collaboration with experimental collaborators will provide opportunities for iterative refinement of the computational tools and for enhanced understanding of the material systems.\r\n \r\nBy using first principles simulation methods in tandem with empirical potential molecular dynamics techniques, the best strengths of the two approaches will be used to develop both a quantitative and qualitative understanding of the real battery systems. The project also includes educational and training opportunities for undergraduate students who will receive their first exposure to scientific methods, and for graduate students who will learn and develop basic skills and practices needed for their professional careers as scientists.",

The focus on solid state electrolyte materials designed for use with pure Li or Na anodes, was motivated by growing evidence that these offer significant stability and efficiency advantages over the battery technology available today.  For example, in conjunction with experimental collaborators, we studied the electrolyte Li2OHCl which has significant Li ion conductivity at temperatures somewhat above room temperature.  At these warm temperatures, the system is known to have a disordered cubic structure.   The disorder includes both the orientations of the OH bonds and the distribution of Li ion vacancies.  In order to well-represent the disorder in this material, simulation methods were adapted with the help of sampling techniques.  Additionally, molecular dynamics simulations were analyzed, finding that ion motion in Li2OHCl is highly correlated in an interesting way.  The OH bond orientations participate in a sort of gating mechanism for Li ion conduction.\n\nBroader impacts &ndash;\n\nThe broader impacts of this work include possible technological developments in battery technology and careful training of new computational scientists.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/07/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: N.
