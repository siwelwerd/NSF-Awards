 "awd_abstract_narration": "Additive manufacturing, often called 3D printing, is poised to revolutionize manufacturing. Its transformation into a manufacturing platform requires the ability to reliably create shape as well as desirable properties. Currently there is little understanding on how the mechanical properties of 3D printed parts relate to the printing process. This award supports fundamental research on mechanics of the layer-by-layer photopolymerization process common to many 3D printing system. It provides knowledge on how mechanical properties of the printed materials emerge from the printing process and how distortions occur. The knowledge gained provides solutions to the selection of printing parameters that yield parts with desirable properties. Such knowledge will enhance the use of photopolymerization based additive manufacturing for a wide variety of applications in healthcare, biomedical, aerospace, and automotive industries. This research involves several disciplines including mechanics, physics, chemistry, manufacturing, and materials science. The associated activities include underrepresented groups in the multidisciplinary research.\r\n\r\nIn photopolymerization based additive manufacturing there exist strong interactions of optical absorption, chemical reaction, species diffusion, phase change and volume shrinkage. Consequently, the layered deposition processes result in a material with dramatically different mechanical properties than the same polymer processed in bulk. This award supports research to investigate the relationship between print parameters and resulting product characteristics. The outcomes will bridge the knowledge gap between the printing process and the geometry and properties of the printed part. The research team will perform experiments to systematically investigate mechanical properties of the material within the printed layers and of the interfaces. The experimental observation will facilitate the establishment of theories and computational models. These models are defined in the context of continuum mechanics considering not only stress and strain but also the printing conditions and chemical processes. The computational models will be used to conduct parametric study to identify optimized printing parameters.",

First, this project gained the understandings of the evolution of mechanical properties of photopolymer during the photocuring process. These understandings led to the development of a material model to predict the dramatic property change of the polymer when a UV light is irradiated on the polymer resin. Second, the new material model was further used to establish a numerical model framework that simulates the photopolymer 3D printing process, in which the change of polymer properties can affect the shape and quality of printed parts. This numerical model framework can then be used to study how printing parameters, such as light brightness, light exposure time, and layer thickness can be optimized to obtain parts with improved shape and quality control. Third, based on the new understandings, a new method of using light brightness and property evolution to achieve controllable deformation of the printed thin part was developed. This method can be used to print a thin sheet that can fold into complicated 3D structures after printing. Fourth, a new two-stage curing method was developed, in which the polymer resin is first photocured to form a shape and then is thermally cured to improve the mechanical properties. This new method allows 3D printing high-performance engineering polymers, such as epoxy, which cannot be printed previously. Lastly, a new method of 3D printing functionally graded materials was developed. In this method, both light brightness and the two-stage curing were used to print part whose properties can vary dramatically from one region to another region with precise control within the part.

This is generally solved by using the trial-and-error approach, which is very time consuming and expensive. The numerical simulation framework that was developed based on the fundamental understandings allows a user to simulate the printing process with different printing parameters then to use the best parameters to print the part.
