In this competition, undergraduate student teams (usually at a junior/senior level) from across the nation submit an initial abstract with their prototype idea and design for a device that addresses a need in rehabilitation or assistive devices. A cohort of faculty who have design experience review and score the abstract submissions.  Based on these scores, the top six teams (approximately 30 students and their mentors) are invited to attend the conference and present their device, design, and business case at a special podium session.  The team presentations are scored by a set of judges, including faculty and industrial representatives. The undergraduate design competition will impact many undergraduate students and their faculty mentors across the country.  This competition provides a national venue (with many international attendees) for teams to showcase their innovations in the areas of rehabilitation and assistive devices. Undergraduate students attending the conference will participate in a research-driven event with technical sessions, workshops and presentations by faculty, clinicians and industrial representatives who have expertise in device design, rehabilitation, disabilities, and numerous other areas. Attendance at the conference provides valuable networking opportunities for the students, including contacts for graduate school and employment. The inclusion of the competition at the conference also exposes attendees to innovative solutions for needs of individuals with disabilities, or those undergoing rehabilitation.  The inclusion of the undergraduate design competition at SB3C goes beyond the standard senior design projects, offering the opportunity for students to attend an international conference within the US, give a podium presentation, and exchange ideas with internationally recognized researchers.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Undergraduate Design Competition in Rehabilitative and Assistive Devices will be held at the 2015 Summer Biomechanics, Biotransport and Bioengineering Conference (SB3C). The opportunity for students to participate in this competition offers many benefits. SB3C will promote state-of-the-art research, collaboration, and scientific discourse in the broad field of bioengineering with focus on Biomechanics and Biotransport.  Undergraduate students attending the conference, through their involvement in the competition, will learn about bio-solid mechanics, bio-fluid mechanics, device design, rehabilitation, cellular and molecular mechanics, functional tissue engineering, bio-heat and mass transfer, and bioengineering education. Numerous podium sessions, poster sessions, workshops and plenary talks are designed to engage and excite the attendees including the session for the undergraduate design competition.  Further, the students will have opportunities to showcase their innovative devices in the areas of rehabilitation and assistive devices with conference attendees, and discuss the potential of these devices with other faculty and innovators.",
