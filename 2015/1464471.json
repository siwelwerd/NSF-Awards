 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nearly all animals are diploid, i.e., they have two sets of chromosomes.  In contrast, many plants are polyploid and have four or more sets of chromosomes, yet the role of polyploidy in speciation remains sharply debated.  Polyploid plants that cannot interbreed with diploid plants are rarely recognized as different species, in large part because it is uncertain whether diploids and polyploids are ecologically distinct.  This project combines field observations and transplant experiments to investigate reproductive barriers between diploid and polyploid populations of wild yarrow, a native perennial wildflower, and rigorously test the nature of polyploid speciation. The project will use naturally-occurring polyploid lineages and new polyploid mutants that arise spontaneously within diploid populations to separate the effects of ecological divergence and ploidy-based barriers on reproductive isolation. \r\n\r\nThis project has broad implications for the interpretation of global biodiversity patterns.  Taxonomic recognition of polyploids, which are common at high latitudes, could double the number of flowering plant species and fundamentally alter understanding of species diversity, which is generally thought to be greatest in tropical regions. This project will involve faculty and graduate students not only in the laboratory and field research, but also in development of a public education and outreach program on urban forests and their conservation.  Urban forests provide critical habitat for wildlife as well as recreational opportunities for urban and suburban citizens, yet are increasingly threatened by habitat fragmentation and invasive organisms. The project will develop urban forests as sites of formal and informal biology education and as a public resource.  \r\n",

Many plants, however, have four or more sets of chromosomes, a condition known as polyploidy. Polyploidy has evolved repeatedly during the diversification of angiosperms, and now occurs in most plant families and genera. Wheat, cotton, potato, and banana are polyploid, and most diploid crops have polyploid relatives of agronomic importance (e.g., for harboring genes for pest resistance or drought tolerance).

For example, in agricultural&nbsp;systems, experimental induction of polyploidy alters growth and physiological attributes of plants. In wild species, related diploids and polyploids have different geographic and climatic distributions. Population genetic processes differ between diploid and polyploid populations, which theory predict to differ in responses to selection. Integration of observational, experimental, and modeling approaches is needed to critically test the adaptive significance of polyploidy, which is still debated by botanists.</p>\n<p>Research supported by this NSF CAREER award has studied the contributions of polyploidy to plant traits and ecological attributes,&nbsp;first by evaluating the historical occurrence of polyploidy in select taxonomic groups (using tools of molecular systematics), second by studying cytotype populations across species' geographic ranges, and third by performing common garden and field transplant experiments; the latter in some cases included new polyploid mutants (neopolyploids) and thus measured immediate effects of ploidy on traits of interest. Most research was conducted on wild yarrow, a widespread native perennial, with several key findings. On a coastal transect in California that included tetraploids and hexaploids, we found neohexaploids to be physically larger than their progenitors and have corresponding differences in physiology and growth. Some novel features of neohexaploids were evident in wild hexaploids (which occur in comparatively drier habitats than tetraploids) while others were not. On an elevational transect in South Dakota that included only tetraploids, we found striking size and growth differences of populations at small spatial scales; divergence was associated with climate and edaphic features of the landscape and achieved without further polyploidization.

The former evaluated polyploidy and natural area invasion (revealing that climate associations with polyploidy across the native range have also developed in the introduced range) and the latter evaluated polyploidy and ecological speciation (revealing that pre-zygotic factors like habitat and phenological isolation augment intrinsic crossing barriers between cytotypes). &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Beyond polyploidy research, this award had broader impacts by supporting conservation, community outreach, and educational activities. For example, Ramsey Lab personnel leveraged their skills in plant identification and field sampling to identify old-growth forest stands in upstate New York based on structural indices (contribution of tree size classes to basal area) and stand ages (inferred from tree cores). This work identified 24 old-growth stands and documented patterns of canopy tree recruitment and understory diversity in these communities. Similarly, in South Dakota, Ramsey Lab personnel mapped, identified, and assessed health of trees across the Black Hills State University campus, which had been impacted by major early season snowfall (Storm Atlas) the year before. This work revealed that a handful of pest-prone species (blue spruce, apple, green ash) represented most trees on campus. Also in South Dakota, Ramsey Lab personnel initiated a photography library for Black Hills and Great Plains vascular plants and organized plant specimen collection efforts in underrepresented counties (Bennett, Butte, Harding, and Fall River counties).
