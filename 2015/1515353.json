 "awd_abstract_narration": "Continental hydrothermal systems have immense scientific and practical significance and are critically important to the Earth?s thermal budget and geochemical cycles. Continental hydrothermal systems are a primary source of economically important metal deposits, provide geothermal resources, support exotic ecosystems that are just beginning to be explored, and in some settings pose a significant geologic hazard via hydrothermal explosions. The subsurface conditions and processes that control these systems are poorly understood because they entail the flow of multi-phase and multi-component fluids through rocks with heterogeneous permeability fields that are perturbed by a multitude of geological and environmental processes. Carefully designed multidisciplinary field experiments and modeling efforts are \r\nrequired to understand the coupled processes that drive these dynamic systems and control their response to geological and environmental forcing. This project is focused on quantifying the response of continental hydrothermal systems to tectonic, magmatic, and climatic processes operating on time-scales from seconds to thousands of years. The PIs address important and timely scientific questions, such as: How do multi-phase fluids and dissolved constituents flux through hydrothermal systems? How do these systems redistribute elements to produce mineral deposits and microbial habitats? How do earthquakes and magmatic activity perturb hydrothermal systems? What triggers hydrothermal explosions? How do environmental processes and climate affect continental hydrothermal systems? \r\n\r\nThe study will involve a combination of fieldwork, data analysis, and modeling. The field program uses a combination of innovative instrument networks and sediment coring activities that will be integrated through modeling activities to study the response of the Yellowstone Lake hydrothermal system to tectonic, magmatic, and climatic forcing. Yellowstone Lake is an ideal site for this research because it hosts an active hydrothermal system located in a region with high levels of tectonic and magmatic activity that has been influenced by a broad range of climate conditions in postglacial times. Research activities will include components of geochemistry, seismology, geology, geodesy, heat flow, micropaleontology, limnology, paleoclimatology, statistics, analytical modeling, and numerical modeling, all of which are essential for unraveling the coupled processes that drive system behavior. Working on a lake-floor system provides an exceptional opportunity to study forcing-response relationships on an expanded range of time-scales spanning more than 11 orders of magnitude.",

Two identified volcanic ash layers, Mazama (~7.6 ka) and Glacier Peak (~13.6 ka), and 15 new radiocarbon dates constrain the timing of geologic events. The lacustrine sedimentary record provided abundant evidence of active faulting, hydrothermal deformation, slumping, and multiple hydrothermal explosions ranging from ~13,000 cal yr BP to a small event ~150 years ago. Two major hydrothermal explosions, Mary Bay at 13,000 cal yr BP ka and Elliott's Crater at 8000 cal yr BP, were registered by massive sedimentary units in many of the cores. The triggering mechanisms for these explosions relate to faulting and seismicity, deformation, slumping, tsunami, and sudden lake-level changes. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Despite recurrent hydrothermal disturbances in and near Yellowstone Lake, the long-term development of vegetation and fire activity in the Yellowstone Lake watershed and the diatom community composition of the lake showed little long-term change associated with these events. Similarly, no changes were seen in the&nbsp;&delta;<sup>18</sup>O&nbsp;diatom record, the&nbsp;&delta;<sup>30</sup>Si&nbsp;record, or the DSi record to suggest that past hydrothermal explosions affected lake level, lake water balance, or Si cycling. Instead, the terrestrial and limnological records are better explained as a response to changing Holocene climate, probably because its large size and watershed mute any climatological response. &nbsp;In contrast, a multi-proxy data set from a sediment core at Goose Lake (44.5414N, 110.8425W) in Lower Geyser Basin revealed a very sensitive history of past hydrothermal activity and its impact on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. From 10,300 to 3800 cal yr BP, thermal waters discharged into Goose Lake, as evidenced by the deposition of arsenic-rich sediment, fluorite mud, and relatively high &delta;<sup>13</sup>C<sub>sediment</sub>&nbsp;values. These partially thermal waters affected the limnobiotic composition, while the prevailing climate, fire regime and rhyolitic substrates maintained&nbsp;<em>Pinus contorta</em>&nbsp;forest like the rest of the region. At 3800 cal yr BP, thermal water discharge into Goose Lake ceased, as evidenced by a shift in sediment geochemistry and limnobiota. Pollen and charcoal data indicate the development of a local grassland with limited fuel biomass and little fire activity, despite late Holocene climate conditions that were conducive to expanded forest cover. The shift in hydrothermal activity at Goose Lake and establishment of a treeless geyser basin may have been the result of a tectonic event or change in hydroclimate.
