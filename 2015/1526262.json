 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing rates of socioeconomic change are associated with widespread increases in social distress and related mental illnesses, yet health systems often struggle to develop the capacity and knowledge for responding to mental disorders. Focusing on the biological dimensions of mental illness, scientists predominantly search for biomedical solutions. Recent studies, however, have called into question the effectiveness of biomedical treatment models, noting unexpectedly good mental-illness prognoses among populations with scant historic access to biomedical interventions. These positive prognoses have been attributed to cultural and familial practices. This project, which trains a graduate student in how to conduct rigorous empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, seeks to understand the impact of rapid socioeconomic change on the mental health and treatment of marginal populations. \r\n\r\nCornell University graduate student Ting Hui Lau under the supervision of Dr. Magnus Fiskesjo, will examine indigenous mental illness categories and traditional healing practices in rural Southwest China where ethnic and religious minority populations are undergoing rapid socioeconomic change. Her study includes the following two major components: First, she will document and analyze indigenous illness categories, religious cosmologies, and associated healing practices. Second, she will ethnographically evaluate the transformation of these practices in the context of rapid development. Her project advances social scientific understanding of mental illness by (1) evaluating the impact of rapid social and economic change on marginalized minority communities and their mental health; (2) deepening scholar's and policymaker's understandings of how marginalized communities derive resilience from indigenous spiritual practices in the face of social distress; and (3) contributing to scientific knowledge of the nature and origins of mental illness by giving more consideration to the social and cultural dimensions of mental illness.  Methods include participant observation, open-ended interviews, and the collection of life histories, all of which are widely accepted and standard ethnographic approaches for this type of study.",

Perceived rise in adult mortality\n\nIn the research site of this project, there is a general perception that people are dying younger and more suddenly than before. Despite overall improvements in primary healthcare services, rates of adult mortality (the chance of a fifteen-year-old person dying before the age of 65) seems to remain high and may even be increasing. Deaths by accident, landslide, street-fighting, suicide, and mysterious illnesses are said to be ever more common. \n\n2. Perceived rise in mental illness, especially anxiety \n\nMental illness is also perceived to be on the rise. It is common to hear Lisu describe feeling \"heart pain,\" an illness with symptoms similar to those of panic disorder. Severe \"heart pain\" can lead to hallucinations, phantom pains, and confusion. My research documents how these symptoms can be relieved through culturally appropriate local social support. But as development processes in China intensify and social support breaks down, rates of mental illness are likely to increase.\n\n3. Loss of autonomy\n\nAs part of the poverty-alleviation drive, Lisu farmers are being forced to give up traditional farming practices and move into urban settlements. Unaccustomed to this way of life and wary of the modern capitalist economy, many Lisu fear that they will \"starve to death\" without farming. Such sentiments signal the Lisu?s intense anxiety about loss of autonomy and cultural sovereignty. \n\n4. Loss of heritage\n\nChina is developing its hinterlands and border regions in a bid to maintain economic momentum in a period of slowing growth and increasing demographic transition (falling birth and death rates). Development and infrastructure projects, such as the One Belt One Road Initiative, are transforming the geographical, cultural, social, and political landscape of rural Southwest China. Marginalized minority communities like the Lisu are seeing their traditional ways of life destroyed. Many perceive development as breaking down Lisu society.
