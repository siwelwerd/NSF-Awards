 "awd_abstract_narration": "Indigenous students are one of the most underrepresented groups in science.  This team of indigenous scholars and scientists will develop a network of indigenous scholars, students and community members to study processes and practices that foster indigenous knowledge and scholarship through community engagement. By fostering a dialogue about the production of science that bridges both western and indigenous world views, the network will engage indigenous communities in science.  In addition, they will identify research needs and priorities, develop ethical research protocols to guide research with Native communities, mentor young scholars, and recommend mechanisms to strengthen and sustain the network beyond the length of the award.  This project supports the White House 2020 goals in higher education by assisting in the preparation of indigenous people for the new economy through maintaining their engagement in science.\r\n\r\nThe Research Coordination Network (RCN) for Facilitating Indigenous Research, Science and Technology will develop a network of indigenous scholars from the continental U.S., Alaska, and Hawaii for the purpose of developing indigenous scientific epistemologies and investigating their inclusion in scientific inquiry. Over the course of the RCN the project will outline a methodology that fosters indigenous knowledge and scholarship in scientific research, a process that is integral to the engagement of indigenous communities in science. The training and development of indigenous students and the inclusion of indigenous community members as collaborators is at the core of this project.  \r\n\r\n",

First, to better understand how Indigenous research centers are organized and operate, FIRST network steering committee members traveled to Aotearoa/New Zealand in 2015 to meet with leaders from Ng&#257; Pae o te M&#257;ramatanga, New Zealand&rsquo;s M&#257;ori Centre for Research Excellence. Through our work with Ng&#257; Pae o te M&#257;ramatanga, we were able to understand the development of a national, pan-tribal research center focused on assisting tribal communities in meeting their research needs. We also learned about the importance of supporting Indigenous graduate students, and early-career academics, as they develop into researchers and educators. Second, the network explored current and recent research projects that have been conducted in Indigenous communities around the United States, and with whom these communities are collaborating. To facilitate this work, in 2016, the network held a collaborative workshop in Chugiak, Alaska, bringing together Alaska Native community members to discuss their experience with research projects as well as the research needs of their communities. During this workshop, we asked participants to describe the research needs of their communities and organizations, inviting them to prioritize those needs, and to provide information concerning whether their research needs are currently being met through collaboration with outside researchers. Third, the FIRST network held the Mentoring Our Own Native Scientists (MOONS) workshop at Haskell Indian Nations University in 2018, bringing together established programs designed to mentor Indigenous graduate students and early career academics from universities and organizations across the United States. The workshop explored the strengths and weaknesses of current programs aimed at supporting Indigenous participation in STEM fields. One goal for this workshop was to ensure the impact of the network outlives the project period of this grant. The MOONS report outlines the presentations, discussions, and recommendations of this three-day workshop. Our fourth goal was to encourage Indigenous leadership in all aspects of research including building a communities ability to establish their own research agenda, relationship building between researchers and Indigenous communities, establishing the cultural protocols to be observed during research collaborations, describing how research projects will be negotiated and permitted, defining the research methods and practices that will be utilized, preserving community control over data collected during research, and establishing how the research will be evaluated and findings disseminated. The work conducted by the FIRST project led to the publication of a special issue of <em>Environment &amp; Planning: F </em>in 2023. This special issue, entitled &ldquo;Indigenous Research Sovereignty,&rdquo; was edited by project steering committee members Johnson, Brewer, Nelson, Palmer, and Louis, and most of the 15 articles and commentaries were authored by early-career Indigenous academics. While the COVID-19 pandemic did disrupt the work of the FIRST network, we were ultimately able to complete all of our original goals successfully.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 04/10/2024<br>\nModified by: Jay&nbsp;T&nbsp;Johnson</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
