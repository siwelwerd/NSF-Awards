This can occur by properly providing and focusing energy on liquids.  One potential application of this knowledge is that, since the bubble comes into existence and grows fast while at micro-scales, it can help design micro-scale actuators commonly used in small devices.  Both undergraduate and graduate will be involved in, while K-12 students and their teachers will also be exposed to, the research.\r\n\r\nThe PIs propose a combined experimental and modeling approach to (1) determine the range of parameters over which explosive boiling in quiescent flows will occur and, under this condition, (2) to gain fundamental understanding of the dynamic growth of a single vapor nucleus, and (3) to explore the dynamics of multi-nuclei growth.  Current research in the field is almost exclusively experimental in nature, and many crucial aspects cannot be probed quantitatively due to the complexity of experimentation.  The numerical modeling will facilitate interpreting experimental results, which will be acquired using high-speed imaging, yielding much-needed quantitative insights and helping to solve problems over a broader range of engineering problems involving rapid evaporation.  If the bubble growth dynamics is captured, it can be used as an actuator by properly focusing energy onto its initial growth that occurs at micro-scales. The results can improve understanding of energy focusing phenomena at the micro-scale involving bubbles as actuators if successful.  Similarly, it will help to improve the design of flash-boiling atomizers and the processes involving transport and storage of volatile liquids or large scale energy generation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAn experimental apparatus consisting of a column of heated liquid was constructed to bring droplets of suitable test liquids to a superheated state, allowing for the initiation and study of explosive-vaporization phenomena.  Superheating, under the right conditions, can result in the heating of a liquid far above its normal boiling point.  The evaporation that commences when the superheat limit temperature is reached can be abrupt and violent, leading to what is termed a \"vapor explosion,\" with potentially catastrophic results.\n\nIn this work liquid droplets of diethyl ether ranging in diameter from approximately 0.5 to 3.5 mm were injected at the base of the column consisting of heated glycerol liquid.  Liquid diethyl ether normally becomes superheated at a temperature of approximately 147 degrees Celsius (297 degrees Fahrenheit).  The droplet explosion process, including internal vapor bubble initiation and growth and the dynamic motion of the interface between the evaporated vapor and surrounding liquid, was examined using high-speed backlit imaging.  The high-speed imaging was operated continuously, allowing visualization of the entire process from \"start to finish,\" from the initial vapor bubble nucleation to the subsequent vaporized-bubble oscillations.\n\nTests of explosive droplet vaporization were performed for pressures ranging from 1 to 5 bar absolute, allowing for the systematic study of the effect of ambient pressure, in addition to initial test fluid droplet size, on the nucleation, internal boiling, and subsequent vapor bubble oscillation.  Special attention was focused on the interfacial instabilities resulting from the boiling and fluid acceleration.  The pressure field associated with the droplet explosive-boiling events was measured using a wall-mounted, fast response pressure transducer.\n\nAt higher pressures (greater than approximately 3 bar) the boiling that occurs inside the superheated droplet is stable and progresses smoothly until the entire droplet is vaporized.  At lower pressures (1-2 bar), the liquid/vapor interface is observed to quickly become unstable, as indicated by a roughened surface observed by the high-speed imaging.  This instability leads to a vaporization rate at least an order of magnitude higher than for the case of stable boiling.  There does not appear to be a significant impact of the initial droplet size on the vaporization rate for a given pressure for either the case of stable or unstable boiling.  For the case of unstable boiling, the resulting vapor bubble oscillates typically 8-20 times before stabilizing.  As the bubble oscillates, Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities typically form at the vapor bubble/host liquid interface, with a wavelength that generally decreases somewhat over the first few oscillation cycles, before increasing again.  The wavelength of the disturbances resulting from this instability appears to increase with the initial droplet diameter, for a given pressure.  Increasing the ambient pressure appears to decrease the average wavelength of the disturbances. \n\nThe pressure oscillations recorded in the far field (5 cm from the droplet location) correlate well with the droplet oscillations recorded by the high-speed imaging.  At the lowest pressure of 1 bar, the oscillation waveform is generally more complex, possibly suggesting multiple characteristic frequencies in the droplet vaporization/oscillation process.  The oscillations become more regular at higher pressures, with a pattern resembling a damped, sinusoidal waveform.  The frequency of the bubble oscillation roughly doubles as the ambient pressure is increased from 1 to 2 bar.\n\nCompanion numerical modeling of the explosive-vaporization phenomena is performed at Southern Illinois University, Carbondale.  The modeling is focused on simulating the unstable growth of the vaporization front and the instability of the vapor/liquid interface, and has shown significant effects of both the initial roughness of the evaporating surface and the amount of droplet superheating, resulting both in a decrease in the time to the start of interfacial evaporative instability as well as an increase in the rate of growth of the instabilities.\n\nThis research advances our current understanding of the dynamic of rapid evaporation processes and their underlying mechanisms.  This understanding may pave the way for further exploration of boiling in more complex situations involving solutions of more than one liquid, electrostatic or magnetic forces, and so on.  From the technological standpoint, this research may impact the design, as well as operating conditions of processes involving transport and storage of volatile fluids or large-scale energy generation.
