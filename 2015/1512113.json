Desalination has emerged as a potential solution. This collaborative project will examine a novel water desalination technology which does not use membranes. \r\n\r\nCurrent water desalination technologies are either evaporation-based or membrane-based, and they are costly and energy intensive, and also contribute to global-warming CO2 emissions. The proposed research will be driven by the hypothesis that the water solubility in directional solvents can be tuned by varying their molecular structures. Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations will be performed to calculate the phase-equilibria of directional solvents with salt and water as a function of temperature. The knowledge of interactions, obtained from the simulations, between the functional groups and water will form the basis of a correlation between the chemical structure and directionality of water and salt solubilities in the solvent, enabling rational design of high-performance directional solvents. According to the extracted trend, high throughput experimental screening of promising directional solvents will be performed to identify highly efficient directional solvents. Based on the directional solvents, a lab-scale continuous desalination system will be designed and demonstrated.",

In arid parts of the U.S. like Southern California, Arizona, and Texas, groundwater resources are already dwindling, and the supplies that remain are becoming increasingly brackish. Although water scarcity can be partly addressed through a careful water management strategy and water reuse, desalination is the only method that increases the supply beyond what is available from fresh-water resources. Current desalination technologies based on thermal distillation or membrane-based processes suffer from the requirement of large heat source or high pressures. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop a new desalination technology that does not use high temperature energy intensive distillation or expensive membranes and can utilize low-grade, low-temperature waste heat or solar energy to drastically reduce desalination cost and minimize the dependence on fossil fuels.</p>\n<p>The research conducted in this project is based on a process known as directional solvent extraction (DSE) process which relies on the difference in the solubility of water at two temperatures with the property that the water dissolution in the solvent decreases with temperature. Therefore, a process operating on this principle would involve contacting the saline water with a suitable solvent at low temperatures allowing water to dissolve in the solvent. A low-grade heat source is then used to increase the solution temperature to a suitable value at which solvent and water separate due to a decrease in the water solubility at the higher temperature; the solvent is recycled for further extraction, while the fresh water is produced. The concept is demonstrated in Figure 1. For an efficient process: (a) The solubility of water in the solvent at low temperature must be high; (2) the solubility of water should decrease as the temperature increases; (3) the solubility of the solvent in water should be low to avoid the loss of the solvent in water and ensure that the fresh water is not contaminated with the solvent; (4) the solvent should be inexpensive and non-toxic. In this project, we focused on discovering solvents possessing attributes (a), (b), and (c).</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>We used techniques of atomistic simulations in which interactions between molecules is used to mimic the movement of molecules. For the calculation of the solubility of water in the solvent and that of solvent in water, we developed a thermodynamic method and tested the applicability of the method by conducting molecular dynamics simulations of water and carboxylic acids (-COOH functional group) such as n-hexanoic acid, n-octanoic acid, and n-decanoic acid&nbsp; as a function of temperature. Please note that decanoic acid is &nbsp;found in coconut oil, palm kernel oil, and milk. The predictions of mutual solubility were found to be in very good agreement with the experimental measurements reported in the literature (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>We also developed a computational algorithm that can generate a library of compounds as potential solvents for the DSE process. For example, there are 17, 89, and 507 different structures (isomers) for hexanoic acid, octanoic acid, and decanoic acid, respectively, &nbsp;depending on how carbon atoms are connected in the structure. Each of these structures were subjected to electronic structure calculations to determine hydration free energies - indicative of the solubility of a solvent in water. The more negative is the hydration free energy, the higher is the propensity of the solvent to dissolve in water. As can be seen in Figure 3, a large variation in the hydration free energy can be noted for different isomers. The approach is at least ten times faster than conducting molecular dynamics simulations identified above and is suitable for a preliminary screening of solvents before a more expensive thermodynamic method is employed for calculating mutual solubility. We carried out such calculations for the alcohol (-OH) and -COOH functional groups and their combinations: (1) -OH, -OH; (2) -OH and -COOH; (3) -COOH and -COOH. The combination of functional group resulted in approximately 9000 potential solvents with varying extent of dissolution in water. Additional functional groups and their combinations can be easily screened to identify promising directional solvents.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>A Master's thesis resulted from this project. The graduate student is currently applying the technical skills learned during the project at a company engaged in developing simulation software for oil and gas companies.

Upon graduation, one student is working with an oil and gas company while the other is pursuing a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering at a top-ranked university in the U.S. The algorithm developed as a part of this project can be easily extended to generate isomers for various classes of solvents with potential applications in batteries and energy storage devices.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jindal&nbsp;K&nbsp;Shah</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1512113/1512113_10371808_1603976127102_DSE--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1512113/1512113_10371808_1603976127102_DSE--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1512113/1512113_10371808_1603976127102_DSE--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Directional Solvent Extraction process</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Prashanth Chandran and Jindal K.
