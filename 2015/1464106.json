 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project concerns research in number theory, a subject that has many interesting connections to more applied areas such as cryptography and physics.  Number theorists study arithmetic objects by attaching to them invariants in order to make them clearly visible. Each important object of interest in number theory has associated to it certain mathematical objects called its L-functions. As they are functions of complex or p-adic variables, one can evaluate them at integers, getting concrete numbers associated with the object under study. There are two fundamental problems concerning invariants in number theory:\r\nA.  Find a relation (or an identity) among two or more arithmetic invariants of different nature;\r\nB.  Distinguish between the non-triviality and triviality of important arithmetic invariants.\r\nThis project will develop an algebraic theory dealing with Problem B. In particular, the research will study non-triviality of values of zeta functions and their derivatives.  By a well-known principle (for example, the Birch-Swinnerton Dyer conjecture), these L-values encode solutions of deep Diophantine problems, and if we can show non-vanishing or vanishing of zeta values, we should be able to predict how many rational solutions modular and elliptic equations have.  \r\n\r\nThis research project aims to develop a systematic theory for distinguishing between the non-triviality and triviality of important arithmetic invariants.  Earlier work of the investigator and a collaborator developed new understanding of p-adic Galois representations and Hecke algebras, p-adic analytic families of modular forms and their L-functions, and analysis of arithmetic invariants.  This research project will follow on these developments.  For example, the project will investigate how to measure the size of the image of modular Galois representation with coefficients in a big Hecke algebra (a nontriviality question concerning the image).   As another example, the work will study non-vanishing (and non-vanishing modulo a prime)  of p-adic L-functions and non-triviality of modular attempts of creating rational points in rational elliptic curves and abelian varieties.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStudy of classical and p-adic modular forms has seen explosive development since the 1995 proof by Wiles and Taylor of cases of the Shimura-TaniyamaConjecture (STC) as an application of an R = T theorem, and hence, by a 1986 work of Ribet, Fermat?s Last Theorem (FLT).  This is not just a histrically important moment of the solution of a deep conjecture outstanding for more than 350 years but a phenomenal catalyst of new development of mathematics, particularly number theory and arithmetic geometry.  Though we do not list here the many solutions of geometrically and arithmetically significant conjectures we obtained afterwards, but we would like to emphasize two key ingredients of this fscinating development in mathematics (perhaps one of the most exciting developments in the 1000 years of the history of mathematics):\n\n1. p-adic Deformation theory of modular forms and Galois representation for each prime  p;\n\n2. Arithmetic cohomology group of a given Galois representation (called adjoint Selmer group).\n\nThe principal investigator (the PI) is the founder of modular deformation theory who created the ring  T  and is a world top specialist onthe adjoint Selmer group.  By this accomplishment, he was awarded Leroy P. Steele Prize for Seminal Contribution to Research in 2019 from American Mathematical Society (AMS).\n\nSTC is to find a modular form whose Galois representation is the one for a given rational elliptic curve.  FLT asserts that for a given prime  p  the sum of two p-th power of non-zero integers is never equal to a single p-power of a non-zero integer.  If a solution of FLT exists, it gives rise to an elliptic curve with unusual properties.  STC  implies any given rational ellptic curve is associated to a modular form invariant under a given subgroup of integer matrices of determinat  1.  The size of the subgroup is measured by an integer called a level.  The elliptic curve associated to FLT solutuion is so strange to have very small level for which we know no modular forms exists (and hence no solution).\n\nThe ingredient  No.1 is used to show STC.  Deformation theory associates a local ring (an algebra called the universal ring denoted by  R) to a given (small) Galois representation.  The universal ring  R  describes all Galois representation close to the startin small one.  The theorem (called R=T theorem) proven by Wiles-Taylor shows that  R  can be identified with another ring  T  made via modular forms (in the circumstances necessary to prove STC).  The  adjoint Selmer group computes the tangent space of the ring  R=T.  The investigation of  R  and associated Selmer group\n\nThe research done under this grant proves the following new findings:\n\n1. Determination of the ring structure of  R  for almost all primes  p.\n\n2. Determination of the group structure of the adjoint Selmer group for almost all prime  p   (as it is the tangent space of  R (=T)).  The group is identified with  R  modulo an indeal  a  of  R.\n\n3. The Galois representation of modular forms (called elliptic modular Galois representation) has unusually large size except for well-specified cases (which is a philosophical reason why the proof of STC by Wiles-Taylor works).   Moreover even over the local Galois group at the prime  p, in many cases, the representation cannot be reduced to 1-dimensional representation (local indecomposability).\n\n4. By the result 3, Fourier coefficients of algebraic modular form span large algebraic extensions (growth problem of Hecke eigenvalues).\n\n5. The size of Selmer group is expected to be measured by the so-called p-adic L-functions.  In many cases, this L-function is not divisible by  p, showing that for the many adjoint Selmer groups, the ideal  a  in Item 2  does not contain the prime  p.\n\nBroader Impact: As we already mentioned, the PI was awarded AMS Leroy P. Steele Prize in 2019. \n\nThe PI has written his 8-th book to be published in December 2021 by Worldscientific to describe the research outcome of this project.  The proof of the FLT and the developments after the proof of the FLT were described in full details in the PI?s 8 books, which are instrumental in the development of young researchers and new comers into the research area. \n\nBefore the pandemic, the PI disseminated his findings in many international conferences personally, and after 2020, he gave several online lectures for the audiences in the US (NY JNT seminar) and in Europe (Seminaire de geometrie arithmetique et motivique, Paris).  \n\nThe PI is one of the organizers of the online ICTS conference to be held in August 2021 (https://www.icts.res.in/program/ECL2021).
