 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent advances in technology have created new methodologies in documenting endangered languages.  This project will provide an overview of these advances in video format and will be presented by experts in field.  The purpose of the project is to support production of the highest quality of documentary linguistic products and stimulate research in these areas.  The primary audience for these outreach videos are linguists or language experts from minority communities who may engage in language documentation but do not have access to state-of-the-art instruction. Over the long term, greater participation in documenting endangered languages will contribute new knowledge of a wider array of under-documented endangered languages each of which provide unique information on human language and cognition.\r\n\r\nThe videos will be uploaded as YouTube videos and will be freely available online.  They will include information on tools for language analysis (transcription, interlinear gloss creation, and acoustic analysis) and linguistic analysis needed for dictionary, grammar, and corpus creation.  Experts will also review current standards in metadata creation and archiving, and funding mechanisms for documentary linguistic research.",
