This NSF award provides support to organize two workshops whose themes will be on Sensor Signal and Information Processing Systems. This program will positively impact US-Mexico research and education initiatives and will engage a number of qualified students and faculty from two large institutions in the area of sensors and signal processing. The program will engage underrepresented groups within STEM disciplines such as electrical engineering, with broader impacts on improving the engineering workforce base, with commensurate economic benefits to the two countries. The program will disseminate successful academy-industry collaborative models such as the I/UCRC in Mexico. Several application aspects of sensors will be addressed in industrial areas including localization, mobility with extensions to manufacturing, health, and other systems of common interest.\r\n\r\nThe workshops which will engage USA and Mexico researchers, faculty and students and are titled:\r\n\r\n-Workshop 1: Sensors and Signal Processing for Localization and Security Applications;\r\n-Workshop 2: Academy-Industry Collaborations in Sensors and Signal Processing.\r\n\r\nThe two workshops will be organized by the PI who will lead an organizing committee of faculty and industry partners. The first workshop will be in Tempe, Arizona (December 2015) and the second one in will be held in Monterrey, Mexico (May 2016). The objectives of the workshops are to: a) initiate collaborative structures between faculty and industry researchers in the US and Mexico through research and panel sessions, b) develop STEM foundations in the areas of sensor systems through organized tutorials for students and researchers that will support future workforce development efforts, and c) initiate industry-university relations\r\nin Mexico using US industry academia-research models such as the I/UCRC.",
