 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer Research Phase I project is development of novel organic materials necessary to produce high energy density, low cost pseudocapacitors. The active material will be a single substance for both oxidation and reduction. This important property reduces cost and fabrication complexity. The synthetic route to the active material is short, and makes use of commodity reagents. Pseudocapacitors capable of delivering more than 10 Watt hours per kilogram at 5,000 Watts per kilogram will have significant impact on vehicle performance, especially for the heavy vehicles that operate at high power levels getting started, for intermittent renewable sources, and uninterruptible power supplies. The low cost and high performance in these new pseudocapacitors will have important commercial impact in the US manufacturing arena because their fabrication is readily adapted to the existing infrastructure designed for other organic electrical devices.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project is based on organic compounds with unprecedented voltage and redox stability.  Because this active material can be both oxidized and reduced as a single substance, it has the unique advantage of not needing an asymmetric design. Asymmetric or hybrid design is used in capacitors to increase the voltage window when the redox activity is otherwise confined to a relatively narrow band within the voltage window of the solvent and electrolyte. This system has a large voltage separation between the oxidation and reduction half reactions without the need for balancing mass, and without fabrication of two different electrodes.  The single substance advantage combines the best properties of the asymmetric design within a symmetric cell.  The research group has prepared materials with high cycle stability and open circuit potentials of 2.8 volts. Our goal will be to demonstrate that the use of our novel organic electroactive materials can significantly increase capacitance of high surface area double layer capacitors.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this Phase I STTR project was to synthesize and test novel redox active materials developed by Vinazene Inc. for use in pseudocapacitors. The redox active materials are tetracyanohexaaza-anthracene derivatives.  We had previously demonstrated that many of these materials, with a variety of different side chains, had unusual redox properties, showing reversible oxidation and reductions separated by approximately 2.8 volts.  Since the energy of a capacitor scales with the square of the voltage, these materials were attractive candidates for incorporation into supercapacitors.\n\nThere were three primary goals for this project.  First, prepare and characterize a novel form of our three-ring electroactive materials that would be insoluble in common solvents, and which could be introduced into pseudocapacitors. This effort was successful, and we synthesized the desired polymer using a bis-allyl coupling agent.   This polymer was a key part of our efforts to meet the secondary goals of the project, which were to physically or chemically attach redox active materials to the current collecting substrates. \n\nWe surveyed various forms of carbon that could propagate charge into the redox active component.  After substantial testing, we settled on the use of a synthetic graphene made by Xg Sciences, as the primary current collector and substrate.   We then proceeded to use acetylenic carbon powder(Strem), active material, and binder to assemble thinly layered test samples.  In these samples the primary binding of active material was due to the physical interaction between the various components. Evaluation of a large number of test samples and protocols, resulted in small, but statistically significant increases in capacitance compared to the blanks.  However this increase was not deemed to be of competitive utility in the marketplace.\n\n We also invented a novel method of covalently attaching the three-ring active material to carbon substrates by use of an aminosilane.  The aminosilane reacts with oxygen bearing sites on the carbon edges and surfaces.  We then used a new form of the three-ring system, containing a carboxylic acid function, to react with the amino group, forming another covalently linked connection through the formation of an amide bond.  This was a procedure that had not been previously used in carbon electrochemistry.  However our three-ring derivatives are not intrinsic conductors in their neutral state, and the additional capacitance that they provided, seemed to be largely counter-balanced by a loss of surface area and reduced double layer contributions.  Thus we conclude that the most promising approach is via the physically bound, rather than covalently bound, materials.  We have not, to date, found a formulation with dramatic increases in capacitance but we intend to continue experiments in this area, with the goal of finding high pseudocapacitance increments that would support a Phase II proposal and validate commercialization.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul G Rasmussen"
