 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University at Albany (SUNY) and several collaborating organizations, including two other SUNY campuses (SUNY Polytechnic Institute and SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry) and Boston University, to construct and test an aphid-like nanobiosensor whose purpose is to enable real-time monitoring of sugars in living plant tissues. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate in the development of NANAPHID technology. The results obtained in the process of NANAPHID development will be disseminated to the community through lectures, student laboratory exercises and field trips. The project will include a unique Website used to broadcast webinars addressing NANAPHID design, its capabilities, and the latest research results. The NANAPHID will make routine measurements of sugars that will benefit many biological research communities including plant ecologists, investigators at NSF-funded Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites, and scientists involved in a broad range of experimental and modelling studies of terrestrial carbon cycling. Applications in crop plant research and management are also promising. For example, the sensor has the potential to replace refractometry as the method of choice for volumetric analysis of sugars.  \r\n\r\nNon-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) are the currency of energy and growth allocation within plants. These products of photosynthesis are circulated as soluble sugars, whose concentrations are estimated using destructive analytical techniques that have difficulties distinguishing sugars in plant sap from associated cellular materials that get mixed into samples. NANAPHID technology will make real-time in situ measurements of NSC using concentrations in stems, roots, and branches and provide biologists with many new opportunities to monitor critical changes in resource allocation in plants. Tracking these changes in living plants is necessary for directly testing the effect of many environmental changes such as climate, diseases, atmospheric nutrient loads, and acidic deposition.",

One pathway is in the xylem, driven by transpiration, which is affected by climate and soil properties. We measured xylem sap flow in the White Mountain National Forest, New Hampshire in 2018. &nbsp;We monitored trees of five hardwood tree species (American beech (<em>Fagus grandifolia</em>), sugar maple (<em>Acer saccharum</em>), red maple (<em>A. rubrum</em>), white birch (<em>Betula papyrifera</em>), and yellow birch (<em>B</em><em>e</em><em>t</em><em>u</em><em>l</em><em>a alleghaniensis</em>) to analyze the effect of nutrient additions of nitrogen, phosphorous, nitrogen + phosphorous, and calcium on xylem sap flow. Due to high tree-to-tree variation, there was no detectable difference in tree sap flow with nutrient additions (p=0.12) nor among species (p=0.84; Figure 1).</p>\n<p>The other pathway of sap flow is in the phloem, which is tapped to make syrup in some tree species. Sap flows because of the pressure created during the freeze and thaw season. In March 2018, sap samples were collected from five butternut (<em>Juglans cinerea</em>) and five American yellowwood (<em>Cladrastis kentukea</em>) trees in Syracuse, New York. We found that yellowwood had 32% higher sucrose concentration than butternut (p&lt;0.001; Figure 2).</p>\n<p>In March 2017, we collected sap from the trunk and branches of sugar maple, black walnut (<em>Juglans nigra</em>) and white birch in Syracuse, NY. &nbsp;Sugar maple had sweeter sap (p=0.001) but the sap from branches did not differ from that collected from the stem (p=0.80; Figure 3).</p>\n<p><strong>M</strong><strong>yc</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>rr</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>z</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>l outcomes: </strong>Ectomycorrhizal fungi (EMF) form mutualistic symbioses with a variety of tree species and fill a diverse range of functional niches in forest ecosystems. In addition to improving nutrient and water accessibility for plants, EMF also reduce root herbivory and protect plants from soil pathogens. Therefore, a change in the fungal composition of a forest may impact trees in diverse ways.</p>\n<p>The community composition of EMF in forest soils may be sensitive to changes in their nutrient environment in ways that have yet to be fully described. Our research investigated the response of ectomycorrhizal communities to nutrient manipulation in a larger project in New Hampshire northern hardwoods in which nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) had been added in a full factorial design since 2011. Mycorrhizal fruit bodies (sporocarps) were collected five times from July to October 2018, identified by morphology, and quantified in three stands of each of two successional stages: mid-aged (clear-cut between 1970-1979) and mature (clear-cut between 1880-1890). Data from this collection project indicate suppressed fungal fruiting in N addition plots (p&lt;0.0001) and increased fruiting in P addition plots (p=0.05; Figure 4).
