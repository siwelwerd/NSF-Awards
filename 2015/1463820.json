 "awd_abstract_narration": "Children's engineering books and complementary simulation games strategically designed to complement K-2nd grade literacy and science content are examined for their impact on engineering engagement and content learning. The research achieves a broader impact by enabling early understanding of engineering concepts through literature based on story board depictions from an engineering perspective as well as computer simulation games re-enforcing the engineering design process. By studying the impact of these stories in the classroom, new literacy tools and educational computer games that positively transform the way children think about engineering as well as our approach to STEM education can be developed. Engineering provides a meaningful situational context for teaching science and math and results from this study engineering to be a necessary component for effectively teaching science and math in the early years. Once this outcome is realized, results from this study can serve as a catalyst for the development of new pedagogical strategies for engineering education and enable children's book authors and game programmers to consider new strategies for learning for this young population of students. In this way, the conceptual understanding outcomes (content and vocabulary) are sustained in later years and ultimately improve achievement in engineering.\r\n\r\nThis project examines the following research questions: What is the impact of engineering-centered literacy activities on K-2nd grade culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) student learning and engagement in engineering content? How does participation in academic conversations impact sustained engagement in complex engineering tasks? Does the impact vary by student characteristics (language background and achievement level)? To what extent can engineering-centered simulations facilitate requisite science and mathematics concept learning that support the engineering process. What simulation design features maximize this learning for K-2nd grade students? How does engagement with simulations impact students' academic conversations? Specific objectives are to use a single case study approach for studying: (1) engineering design centered computer simulation games and engineering-focused books to promote student engagement and learning; (2) examine growth in instructional effectiveness; (3) research methodologies for improving student engagement; and, (4) analyze improvements in student concept learning. This is among the first studies to address the learning and engagement impact of children's story-book literature that is centered on engineering principles. With an understanding of these best practices, authors can more effectively design STEM content rich books for this age group. An understanding of the mechanisms that advance learning through computer simulation games are also being developed. This understanding is a first step toward developing additional individual and/or group activities. These best practices are examined across cultural and linguistic boundaries to better serve all populations.",
