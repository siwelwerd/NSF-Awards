 "awd_abstract_narration": "Electrophysiology has long played an important role in our understanding of brain dynamics in learning, but only at an individual level. With the advent of low-cost, easy to use electroencephalography (EEG) devices that can measure brain responses from an entire classroom at a time,  it is now possible to study group brain dynamics during learning in a naturalist classroom setting.  This is opportunity to gather data from thousands of students and schools will provide insights not available from earlier approaches.  There is however,  a critical need to rigorously define how this technology might play a role in improving learning. To address this need, the present project will form a research network of experts to develop and test new EEG methods to measure group brain dynamics. This network includes experts in child development, learning EEG technology, classroom teaching and outreach. Collaborative research will be conducted in three geographic areas reflecting diverse populations: San Diego, the San Francisco Bay Area and the Washington DC Area. The research will focus on assessing important foundational skills: using EEG to assess the quality of encoding of speech by the brain, using EEG to assess attention in real-time, and examining the role of temporal synchronization in promoting attentional behaviors. In addition to research the project features a strong commitment to building interdisciplinary connections within science, as well as vigorously engaging the study communities in the research to foster productive dialog among educators, students, and other researchers.\r\n\r\nEEG techniques have made important contributions to understanding dynamic processes in learning, attention, prospection, memory, and executive function. Newer measures, such as the complex Auditory Brainstem Response (cABR) reveal how the brain encodes sound, providing a powerful tool to link brain function to reading and language impairment. Traditional EEG methods are too cumbersome and intrusive for large- scale classroom use. Network researchers have developed a transformative low-cost, dry-electrode, high sampling rate EEG system that is ergonomic and suitable for children. Their software innovations, which enable the synchronization of large-group EEG recordings, will support data recording from twenty+ students simultaneously. These will contribute to at least two innovations in education-based research: 1) It will be possible for a large number of traditional, individual EEG tests to be conducted in parallel, vastly increasing study efficiency, yield and power, and 2) the more revolutionary step of assessing individual and group brain dynamics in ecological learning environments to obtain real-time insight into the dynamics of learning, speech comprehension, and attention. Four experimental goals have been proposed: 1) Identifying Individual Learning Differences with cABR, 2) Developing measures of nested hierarchical processing of speech, 3) Developing protocols for individual and group cognitive state (attention, alertness) assessment, and 4) examining how brain dynamics at a group level reflect speech comprehension in a classroom setting. In addition to its scientific goals, the network will foster scientific dialog by hosting a Workshop on \"Brain Dynamics in Learning\" to develop a roadmap for future research in the field.",

The network was formed by a group of experts in child development, classroom teaching, outreach and brain measurement technology.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The first outcome of the project was the development of a low cost and easy-to-use system for measuring brain activity of a group of people during everyday activities in the classroom.

Second, our system also moved beyond measurements in a single person at a time to enable the measurement of brain activity in an entire group of learners. Third, typical EEG involves measuring brain activity that happens in relation to stimuli presented by researchers and so has limited capacity to measure activity that happens in the real world. Our system included a method to synchronize brainwave measurements with any sound in a person?s environment, such as the teacher's voice in a classroom. These developments open the door to new types of group brain research that are directly relevant to real world learning environments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A second outcome was a series of research studies using this group brain recording system. We developed a new measure of how an individual's brain is able to process the timing of sounds, a skill critical for language understanding and attention. We were able to measure this in several people at once, making it more efficient than traditional methods. Since this study was conducted in a group we also were able to determine how our measure of timing related to how well people are able to coordinate together in time. We found that people whose brains are more sensitive to small differences in timing were also better at coordinating with others in time, a crucial skill that supports a wide variety of interactions. A second study examined the impact of listening to music while reading. A third project, nearing publication, studied how the brainwaves of two individuals were changed after a cooperative interaction. We found that brainwaves were more synchronized following an interaction, indicating a lasting impact of cooperation and also suggesting a possible mechanism that supports cooperative interaction. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>A third goal, and outcome, of the project, serving broader societal impact, was public outreach to increase awareness of brain science in the general public through presentations to students.
