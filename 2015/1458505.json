 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at the Community College of Allegheny County, Allegheny Campus, will provide scholarships, academic support, and wraparound services to talented associate's degree students majoring in Biotechnology, Bioremediation, and Math & Science (BioMaS) who demonstrate financial need. The project will address the need for biotechnology workers, as well as science and mathematics teachers, in the ten-county Pittsburgh region by training scholarship recipients for employment in these high-growth sectors, and providing the support scholars need to excel and become highly-qualified graduates in their fields.\r\n\r\nBioMaS project goals will include (1) providing scholarships and critical wraparound services, including an onsite clinical social worker to assist students with barriers, internship opportunities, and the job search; learning community experiences; and tutoring to improve retention, persistence, graduation and employment rates; (2) strengthening pathways to employment; (3) connecting degree programs to regional industry by linking potential employers and college training to solidify and build sustainability through an employment pipeline; and (4) providing information on STEM training and jobs for high-school and college students, including veterans and underrepresented minorities. The BioMaS project will create pathways to biotechnology and bioremediation employment opportunities, or to further education for graduates, by leveraging well-established business and higher education partnerships. In addition, a partnership with Indiana University of Pennsylvania will provide a pathway for BioMaS Math & Sciences graduates to obtain bachelor's degrees in middle-level education in math and science. Project goals will be evaluated via both qualitative and quantitative analyses of data such as scholar demographics, enrollment and completion patterns, background preparation, and course and program performance; scholar participation rates and feedback regarding optional program elements; and rates of employment. The project is ultimately expected to serve as a model for community colleges, particularly in terms of understanding of how to develop wraparound services for students that will support them as they prepare to contribute to a highly-skilled STEM workforce.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe BioMaS project aimed to recruit underrepresented students into math/science education and the biotechnology Associate?s Degree programs at the Community College of Allegheny County.\n\nThe first goal of the project was to provide wrap-around services to support students? success throughout their academic journey.  This included the use of an embedded social worker, dedicated academic advisor, and student peer-learning leader.  Each of these individuals worked closely with students to anticipate personal and academic barriers to successful degree completion.\n\nThe second goal of the project was to strengthen pathways to employment in the local Pittsburgh area.  This was accomplished by networking with school districts and regional industry and expanding partnerships for internships in research labs in academic institutions.\n\nThe third goal was to connect degree programs with transfer opportunities at 4-year universities.  Several new articulation agreements were created as a result of the project.  While completing the BioMaS program, students were required to perform community outreach and take advantage of additional scientific symposiums and/or expert speakers available in the Pittsburgh region.  Summer science camps and the hosting of high school students' labs encouraged students to showcase their skills and knowledge.\n\nA total of 72 students were served over six years.  Program results are listed below:\n\n40.6% of graduates went on to additional schooling at a 4-year institution\n31.3% of graduates sought and gained employment in a STEM field\n18.7% of graduates both attended a 4-year institution and obtained employment\n90.6% of scholarship graduates achieved one or more stated goals\n\n\nBroader impacts of this project included the enrichment and diversification of the entry-level employment pool for local industry.  The Pittsburgh area is a hub for biotechnology research and STEM education, and this program provided workforce-ready graduates.  Feedback from employers indicated that students are well prepared with an Associate?s degree and have better skills than those graduating from 4-year institutions with Bachelor?s degrees.  Through continuous assessment of the program, changes were made to streamline the curriculum and ensure that students received training that aligned with industry standards. \n\nA newly established social network now exists between previous graduates working in the field and current students completing coursework.  These mentors are invaluable resources for students and provide feedback on specific skills obtained in the program.\n\nThe BioMaS project has resulted in significant enhancements in both degree programs, specifically showing that community college students can be successful in highly technical STEM fields. It has also been instrumental in the College expanding the social worker model in the institution with the addition of three permanent full-time ?navigators? available to all CCAC students, fulfilling the state sustainability piece.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anne Tanski"
