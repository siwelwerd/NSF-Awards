Nano-enabled agricultural fertilizers and pesticides have a greater potential for direct, massive introduction of manmade nanomaterials (MNMs) into the environment than any other use of MNMs. However, the effects of nano-enhanced agricultural chemicals on terrestrial ecosystems are inadequately studied and largely unknown.  Moreover, the properties of these MNMs, and their complex behaviour in soils makes predicting their fate in soils difficult using the risk assessment framework for traditional chemicals.  This international interdisciplinary project addresses essential gaps in knowledge about how soil properties, MNM properties, MNM concentration, and transformations affect the spatial and temporal behaviour of agriculturally relevant metal (hydr)oxide MNMs in soils and their uptake by important crop plants including wheat and tomato.  In addition, the toxicity potential, uptake into soil organisms, and potential for long-term ecological impacts will be assessed.  New methods to track and characterize MNMs in soil at realistic concentrations will be also developed.  This new knowledge will help to understand the risks associated with MNMs used in agricultural products, but also help to design safer and more effective nano-enabled pesticides and fertilizers.\r\n\r\nMNMs are constantly changing size, composition, and distribution as they age in soils.  The particulate nature and inherent instability of NMNs in soils makes many of the test methods for assessing environmental fate unsuitable for MNMs without modification.  These features also make MNM fate likely to be concentration dependent in ways that traditional chemicals are not. Information about the rates of change of MNMs in soils, and how these changes affect the distribution of NMNs between soil and pore water, and bioavailability and toxicity of MNMs over time is acutely needed to accurately assess fate and toxicity potential, and to be able to develop realistic and site-specific models for NMN fate and effects. This project addresses essential gaps in knowledge about how soil properties, MNM properties, MNM concentration, and reaction kinetics affect the spatial and temporal behaviour of metal-oxide MNM-enabled pesticides and fertilizers in soils.  Specifically, the PIs will assess how these variables influence transformation and distribution in soils, toxicity and multigenerational effects on soil organisms, bioaccumulation/trophic transfer, phytoavailability, and therefore the potential for ecological impacts or human exposures from consumption of key food crops.  This project will also develop novel methods to track MNMs in soils and will provide guidance for new assays for assessing fate, bioavailability, and toxicity potential of agriculturally relevant MNMs.  The PIs focus on Cu- and Zn-based metal (hydr)oxides that are used commercially as pesticides or are marketed as micronutrient fertilizer additives.      \r\n     \r\nThe proposed study will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the fate and risks of MNMs used in agricultural products, facilitate efficient and safe design of nanomaterial-based agriculture products through increasing understanding of how the risks and benefits of these products relate to the MNM properties, and provide simple screening tests that can be applied to MNM-based agriculture products to predict their fate and toxicity risks. Overall, this project will create robust models and validated assays for the evaluation of environmental impacts of MNM-enhanced pesticides and fertilizers, and provide a science-based approach to safe design of agriculture products and their management.  The project?s findings will facilitate development of consistent science-based regulations and promote uninterrupted trade of agricultural products (both agrochemicals and food) between the US and the EU. Educational activities will include providing internship opportunities with their industry partners, lab rotations at their international partners, and hosting two undergraduate students per year as part of the CEINT REU program.",

We developed new methods to track and characterize the transformations of Cu-based MNMs in soil at realistic MNM concentrations. We also assessed the potential for long-term ecological impacts from applications of Cu-based NMNs used in agriculture compared to their dissolved metal analogues. The methods allowed us to assess how the rates of dissolution of MNMs in soils affected metal distribution between soil and the pore water that plants take up by their roots, and how these changes affects their bioavailability and toxicity <em>over time scales relevant to agriculture and traditional toxicity testing of agrochemicals.</em> This information helps to better assess the fate and toxicity potential of Cu-based MNMs applied to soils. The measured rates of transformation also enabled the development of models to accurately predict NMN fate and potential for negative effects in soils of varying pH and organic content as is encountered in agriculture. Importantly, we found that the Cu-based MNM <em>solubility</em> was a function of the soil organic matter content and not soil pH, but the <em>rate of dissolution</em> was affected by soil pH. Organic matter is the sink for released Cu ions. So the maximum amount of Cu that can ultimately be released <em>at equilibrium</em> is proportional to the organic matter content of the soil. However, the <em>rate of dissolution</em>, i.e. the time that it takes to reach this maximum amount of dissolution, depends on soil pH. So we have to consider both the equilibrium end point of dissolution and the rate of dissolution when interpreting toxicity studies that may be 96h or 10 days or 30 day. This information helps in understanding how the soil properties will impact the performance and lifetime of added Cu-based MNMs used as fungicides in soils, and can be used to design MNMs with appropriate properties. In addition, the efficacy of different soil porewater sampling methods to recover MNMs from soil was evaluated. We demonstrated that traditional porewater sampling methods were inadequate to recover a significant fraction of MNMs in soils, and developed and tested an alternative method that can recover a large fraction of Cu-based MNMs from soils for further analysis. Recognizing that the applied MNMs may end up in the edible portions of plants, we developed a novel methanol-based extraction method for recovery of a range of MNM compositions from different leaf tissue types with high recovery. Moreover, the elemental composition and size of the recovered particles could be readily characterized to confirm that they were the added MNMs and assess if they had dissolved. Finally, in a variety of soils, we demonstrated that organic acids released from plant roots increased the dissolution of Cu-based MNM compared to bulk soil. This lowers their persistence in soils, but also affects soil bacterial populations related to nitrogen cycling. Thus, future studies assessing the impacts of soluble MNMs on soil should include plants in those systems given the important role of the plant roots on their dissolution. Using these approaches, NanoFARM re-evaluated existing models and tests for risk assessment considering time-resolved CuO NP dissolution measurements and found that the kinetic measurement approaches developed here correlated better with observed effects from the Cu-based MNMs studied in NanoFARM and those of other studies than a typically used single time point measurement. This has implications for selecting standardized soil chemical characterizations in regulatory chemical risk assessment methods, especially those developed for Cu-based MNMs and other partially soluble MNMs used in agriculture. Overall, this new knowledge will facilitate development of consistent science-based regulations to manage the risks associated with MNMs used in agricultural products, and will also help to design safer and more effective nano-enabled pesticides and fertilizers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/11/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Gregory&nbsp;V&nbsp;Lowry</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1530563/1530563_10398017_1623445323130_nanofarm-logo2016--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1530563/1530563_10398017_1623445323130_nanofarm-logo2016--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"NanoFARM Logo\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1530563/1530563_10398017_1623445323130_nanofarm-logo2016--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"NanoFARM Logo\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">NanoFARM Logo</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mireille Mobly</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Gregory&nbsp;V&nbsp;Lowry</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">NanoFARM Logo</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
