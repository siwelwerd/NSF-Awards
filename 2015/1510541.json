The proposed research seeks to develop and understand novel sulfur-tolerant catalysts for the conversion of natural gas to gases used to synthesize liquid fuels and chemicals.  To this end, the work has potential to develop a simplified, efficient process for natural gas conversion without the need for expensive \"upstream\" desulfurization.  The researchers will also advance education and scientific awareness by involving undergraduate students in their research with an emphasis on minority, women, and first-generation students.\r\n\r\nLarge quantities of natural gas are being produced from shale resources, providing opportunities to convert the gas to liquid fuels via reforming reactions.  This study reforms methane by reacting it with carbon dioxide, thus generating feedstocks for liquid fuels while reducing the atmospheric loading of carbon dioxide (a greenhouse gas).  A combination of experimental and theoretical tools will be used to design mixed metal oxide catalysts (combining transition metals and rare earth oxides) that are both sulfur tolerant and less prone to poisoning by coking than current catalysts.  Specifically, the work addresses the hypothesis that the mixed transition metal and rare earth oxide catalysts form stable and active oxysulfides under reaction conditions, with the benefit that the oxysulfides destabilize coke precursors.  Computational methods will be used to predict candidate oxysulfided catalyst materials that will then be synthesized, tested, and characterized, with results used to refine the theoretical predictions.  Beyond the direct research, the two PIs on this project have a strong track record of educational outreach at their respective institutions including involvement of undergraduates in their research programs and Dooley's work with the \"You be the Chemist Challenge\" of the Louisiana Chemical Education Foundation (focused on middle- and high-school students).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project was a joint effort between the Dooley laboratory at Louisiana State University and the Janik laboratory at Pennsylvania State University.  The LSU efforts pursued experimental studies of methane dry reforming over noble metal-rare earth oxide catalysts.  Penn State used computational electronic structure methods, specifically density functional theory (DFT), to examine the stability, structure, and catalytic performance of Ni-ceria and Pd-ceria systems, as well as mixtures of ceria-zirconia. DFT results examining ceria-zirconia suggest that these two oxides should form stable mixtures with incorporation of up to ~30% Zr atoms.  This agrees with the experimental observation of stable mixtures of these two oxides.  Contrarily, an equivalent DFT analysis suggests that Ni is not stable doped into a ceria mixed oxide, suggesting little to no solubility of Ni in ceria.  This agrees with experimental observations that suggest Ni will segregate to the surface.  DFT examination also suggested surface segregation of Ni atoms, though our DFT models also suggested Ni should agglomerate on the surface.  This is contrary to experimental x-ray diffraction studies that do not show formation of a bulk Ni phase in the Ni-ceria materials studied at LSU.  DFT studies of reaction energetics over the Ni-doped ceria surface model suggest facile activation of both methane and carbon dioxide, and that C-C bond formation will be highly energetically unfavorable.  This is in agreement with experimental measurements that suggest well-dispersed Ni on/in ceria catalysts are stable against formation of solid carbonaceous materials.  Collectively, the experimental and DFT studies have suggested that well-dispersed Ni/CeO2 materials can form stable and active methane dry reforming catalysts. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael J Janik"
