 "awd_abstract_narration": "Predictions of future sea level rise require better understanding of the changing dynamics of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. One way to better understand the past history of the ice sheets is to obtain records from inland ice for past geological periods, particularly in Antarctica, the world?s largest remaining ice sheet. Such records are exceedingly rare, and can be acquired at volcanic outcrops in the La Gorce Mountains of the central Transantarctic Mountains.  Volcanoes now exposed within the La Gorce Mountains erupted beneath the East Antarctic ice sheet and the data collected will record how thick the ice sheet was in the past.  In addition, information will be used to determine the thermal conditions at the base of the ice sheet, which impacts ice sheet stability. The project will also investigate the origin of volcanic activity in Antarctica and links to the West Antarctic Rift System (WARS).  The WARS is a broad area of extended (i.e. stretched) continental crust, similar to that found in East Africa, and volcanism is wide spread and long-lived (65 million years to currently active) and despite more than 50 years of research, the fundamental cause of volcanism and rifting in Antarctica is still vigorously debated. The results of this award therefore also potentially impact the study of oceanic volcanism in the entire southwestern Pacific region (e.g., New Zealand and Australia), where volcanic fields of similar composition and age have been linked by common magma sources and processes. The field program includes a graduate student who will work on the collection, analysis, and interpretation of petrological data as part of his/her Masters project. The experience and specialized analytical training being offered will improve the quality of the student?s research and optimize their opportunities for their future. The proposed work fosters faculty and student national and international collaboration, including working with multi-user facilities that provide advanced technological mentoring of science students. Results will be broadly disseminated in peer-reviewed journals, public presentations at science meetings, and in outreach activities. Petrologic and geochemical data will be disseminated to be the community through the Polar Rock Repository.\r\n\r\nThe study of subglacially erupted volcanic rocks has been developed to the extent that it is now the most powerful proxy methodology for establishing precise ?snapshots? of ice sheets, including multiple critical ice parameters. Such data should include measurements of ice thickness, surface elevation and stability, which will be used to verify, or reject,  published semi-empirical models relating ice dynamics to sea level changes. In addition to establishing whether East Antarctic ice was present during the formation of the volcanoes, data will be used to derive the coeval ice thicknesses, surface elevations and basal thermal regime(s) in concert with a precise new geochronology using the 40Ar/39Ar dating method. Inferences from measurement of standard geochemical characteristics (major, trace elements and Sr, Nd, Pb, O isotopes) will be used to investigate a possible relationship between the volcanoes and the recently discovered subglacial ridge under the East Antarctic ice, which may be a rift flank uplift. The ridge has never been sampled, is undated and its significance is uncertain.  The data will provide important new information about the deep Earth and geodynamic processes beneath this mostly ice covered and poorly understood sector of the Antarctic continent.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMt. Early and Sheridan Bluff (87?S) are the above ice expression of Earth?s southernmost volcanic field that lies approximately 300 km from the South Pole.  Their existence provides a unique opportunity to evaluate environmental conditions in the Early Miocene (about 20 million years ago) and the cause of volcanism on the East Antarctic craton for which little is known.  The two volcanoes lie approximately 1000 km from any other exposed volcano and approximately 200 km inland from the shoulder of the West Antarctic rift system, which is the foci of most of the Cenozoic volcanism in Antarctica.  The basaltic volcanoes are approximately 20 km apart and are similar in age with eruption at 19.8 million years ago to form Sheridan Bluff and 19.3 million years ago to create Mt. Early.  Mt. Early is a small volcanic center that erupted under glacial ice which was substantially thicker than the present day East Antarctic ice sheet.  Sheridan Bluff is also a relatively small volcano, however by contrast it is an eroded remnant of a volcano that erupted through a shallow lake and into the atmosphere without ice influence. The evidence for the diverse environmental conditions that closely existed in both space and time strongly suggests the climate and extent of the East Antarctic ice sheet was dynamic in the Early Miocene. \n\nThe volcanic rocks at Mt. Early and Sheridan Bluff consist of basaltic pillow lavas, lava flows and intrusive dikes that have compositions that are alkaline (i.e. high in alkali elements sodium and potassium) and subalkaline (i.e. lower alkali content and higher in silica and iron content). The alkaline compositions resemble those from the West Antarctic rift system and oceanic islands while the subalkaline compositions (i.e. tholeiite) are similar to basalts erupted along mid-ocean ridges.  Tholeiite compositions are extremely rare within the West Antarctic rift system.  It is generally accepted by petrologists that alkaline compositions are formed by lower degrees of mantle melting and tholeiite compositions by higher degrees of mantle melting.  Lavas of both alkaline and tholeiite compositions were erupted contemporaneously at Sheridan Bluff.  For these two rock types to coexist at a single volcano requires simultaneously melting in the mantle.  The cause of different amounts of melting is considered to have been facilitated by the detachment and dehydration of metasomatised (e.g., enriched in volatile elements) mantle lithosphere.  Radiogenic isotopes of strontium, neodymium, lead and oxygen measured on the basalts also indicate that the mantle was compositionally heterogeneous and contained small amounts of crustal sediments that were subducted and incorporated into the upper mantle during ancient times.  The mechanism of lithospheric detachment has not been proposed as a cause for volcanism in Antarctica and may be a unique mechanism to explain volcanism at Mt. Early and Sheridan Bluff.  The detachment and foundering of the lithosphere into asthenosphere under the East Antarctic craton in the region beneath Mt.
