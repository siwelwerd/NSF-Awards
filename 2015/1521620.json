 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phytoplankton are the entry point for mercury in marine food webs, and subsequent mercury accumulation in fish is the primary route of human exposure. Yet despite the fact that phytoplankton form this critical link, their role in marine mercury dynamics is not clear, especially with respect to seasonal and geographic variability. This study is designed to evaluate trends in mercury cycling in highly productive coastal marine environments, with a focus on the seasonal effects of phytoplankton blooms in a range of coastal lagoon systems. Lagoons provide an accessible natural laboratory and are potential hotspots for mercury accumulation in animals. Because the processes at play in coastal lagoons are prevalent in nearshore marine habitats (e.g., the occurrence of algal blooms, the dynamics of freshwater-seawater interaction), results from this study will be applicable to coastal marine systems in general and will close major gaps in our understanding of nearshore mercury-food web dynamics. This topic is relevant to environmental regulators who are tasked with selecting viable remediation alternatives and evaluating strategies for contaminant reduction. Furthermore, because this project is lab and field intensive, it will provide hands on training for 20-30 undergraduate volunteers, many of whom will be recruited from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nCoastlines support a range of productive marine ecosystems that sustain complex food webs. Such environments are particularly susceptible to biologically persistent contaminants, such as mercury, that accumulate exponentially along trophic levels. Phytoplankton represent the first and largest step in this process by concentrating mercury in their cells up to 100,000x above ambient levels. Yet little is known about phytoplankton mercury uptake mechanisms or how phytoplankton growth rate and/or biomass affects uptake rates in diverse ecosystems. To evaluate how effectively mercury enters the food web during algal blooms, and to assess the long-term effects of blooms on seasonal mercury cycling in nearshore systems, three coastal lagoon systems will be studied. Lagoons provide a semi-enclosed water body with a captive food web, and are therefore ideal locations to sample phytoplankton over the entire duration of a bloom cycle. To constrain the drivers of mercury accumulation, field sampling will be augmented with lab-based experiments to (1) quantify how rapidly different species of phytoplankton assimilate mercury, (2) assess the mechanism by which phytoplankton take up mercury (internal assimilation vs. external sorbtion) and (3) evaluate whether groundwater-surface water interaction enhances mercury bioavailability at the coastal margin. This investigation will identify fundamental biogeochemical processes that lead to the toxicity, accumulation, and transport of mercury in coastal marine systems and enable a more accurate account of coastal mercury sources and sinks. These issues are of interest to both research and environmental resource organizations.",

This organic form of mercury, which is called monomethylmercury (MeHg), magnifies in concentration along the food chain. As a result of biomagnification, MeHg can reach harmful concentrations in top level predators, such as tuna. In fact, eating fish is the primary way humans are exposed to mercury. Although phytoplankton form a critical link in mercury biomagnification, factors that influence MeHg-phytoplankton interactions are not well understood. The goal of this project was to assess drivers of mercury uptake by phytoplankton in biologically productive coastal lagoons.</p>\n<p class=\"BodyA\"><em>Field Experiment</em>: In July 2016 we conducted a &nbsp;field incubation experiment at San Elijo Lagoon in Southern California (Fig 1). We filled 21 clear 10L polycarbonate containers with lagoon water and incubated them in the lagoon to maintain natural temperature and sunlight conditions (Fig 2). The containers divided into three groups, with different amounts of MeHg added: 0pM, ~10pM, and ~100pM MeHg. Phytoplankton photosynthesize using chlorophyll, just as land plants &ndash; we therefore used chlorophyll to determine phytoplankton abundance. At the time of our experiment, the lagoon contained approximately 15% picoplankton (0.2-2&micro;m), 55% nanoplankton (2-20&micro;m) and 30% microplankton (20-200&micro;m). Over the first 12 hours of the incubation, chlorophyll increased while nutrient concentrations decreased (Fig. 3), indicating a phytoplankton bloom occurred (i.e., algae bloom). Background total mercury (HgT) and MeHg concentrations were ~4 pM and 0.2 pM, respectively (Fig 4D). Of the four size ranges measured (&lt;0.2; 0.2-2; 2-20; 20-200 &micro;m) the &lt;0.2&micro;m (operationally defined as dissolved) samples had the highest MeHg concentration in the non-spiked containers (Fig 4A). We observed little change in dissolved MeHg concentrations over time despite evidence of a bloom, suggesting MeHg was biologically unavailable, possibly due to binding with natural ligands. Interestingly, the smallest phytoplankton communities (0.2-2&micro;m) did not appear to take up MeHg as readily as the larger cells despite having a larger surface area to volume ratio. Based on the ~100pM containers, which provided the greatest resolution, the 2-20&micro;m phytoplankton communities assimilated MeHg more efficiently compared to the other communities (Fig 4C).</p>\n<p><em>Laboratory Experiment</em>: We also established a methodology for conducting future mercury uptake experiments in laboratory grown phytoplankton to assess how factors such as cell size (i.e., surface area to volume ratio) and changes in salinity influence MeHg bioaccumulation. We conducted a pilot incubation study using <em>T. weissflogii</em> and <em>T. oceanica</em> phytoplankton to evaluate four factors that will be used to design future experiments. We determined that (1) an MeHg spike of ~80pM is sufficient to detect phytoplankton uptake and low enough to compare to natural water systems; (2) confirmed that filtering the growth media through a 0.1&micro;m filter adequately removed background mercury from the solution; and (3) determined <em>T. weissflogii</em> and <em>T. oceanica</em> can tolerate salinities between ~10-35 and ~20-35, respectively. These data will provide a framework for larger scale experiments to evaluate the influence of cell size and salinity changes on mercury uptake by phytoplankton that commonly occur in coastal environments (Fig 5).</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Broader Impacts</span></strong></p>\n<p>A number of students gained valuable research experience participating in this project, including seven undergraduates and one MS student.
