 "awd_abstract_narration": "Volcanic lightning discharges have length scales ranging from tens of meters to tens of kilometers.  Most small discharges occur proximally to a volcanic vent concurrent or within a few minutes of an explosive volcanic eruption.  Large scale discharges typically occur throughout a mature plume formed 5 or more minutes subsequent to an explosive eruption.  This research work focuses on studying the small, proximal discharges that occur concurrent with explosive volcanic eruptions.  The main goal is to better characterize the proximal electrical activity within the context of the eruptive activity to gain a better understanding of the eruptive conditions that are required to produce different types of small-scale discharges.  This characterization will be accomplished by making high-resolution 3-D lightning mapping observations of lighting discharges during small explosive eruptions of Sakurajima Volcano located in the Kyushu region of southwestern Japan.  Other instrumentation (infrasound, video cameras, and electric field change sensors) will be used to monitor the explosive activity, plume development, and changes in electric field caused by lightning. The data will be used to determine when different types of electrical discharges occur relative to the onset of an explosive eruption and in relation to the ascent of volcanic ejecta. Electrical discharges will be characterized by determining the length scales, speeds, and polarities of the discharges, as well as by locating where the discharges initiate.\r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit: \r\nThe research would be the most detailed study of volcanic lightning to date, combining measurements of volcano infrasound, electric field changes, and plume development with high-resolution Lightning Mapping Array (LMA) data and high-speed video observations of volcanic lighting.  The inclusion of electric field change measurements, high-speed video, and visual plume observations distinguishes this project from previous research. The research will increase knowledge of electrical activity that occurs as a direct result of an explosive volcanic eruption.  This will contribute to our understanding of the eruption processes that are responsible for producing electrical activity proximally to a volcanic vent.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts: \r\nBecause small-scale discharges frequently accompany volcanic eruptions of a large range of sizes, the results of the research will be applicable to developing an eruption monitoring system that utilizes VHF observations of lightning and electrical activity. In addition, the results of the research will be used to determine if one can predict eruption magnitudes or ash plume heights based on observations of electrical activity. The research will also provide training for an early career researcher from an underrepresented group and three graduate students.  They will participate in gathering, organizing, archiving, and analyzing the data.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nWe have been studying lightning that happens during volcanic eruptions for the last 12 years.  The goal of this project was to learn how the lightning and similar electrical discharges are controlled by the eruption.  We needed to find exactly when and where the discharges are produced.  The lightning produces lots of radio waves which we can accurately locate with an array of special receivers that we have developed, the LMA (lightning mapping array).  We have used the LMA to get spectacular images of lightning inside thunderstorms.  If we can understand the connection of electrical discharges to the eruption, we can use them to study and monitor eruptions.\n \nWe decided to do this project at the Sakurajima Volcano, a small volcano in Japan that has been having small eruptions almost daily for the last 50 years.  The Japanese scientists there were happy to work with us and provide places for us to work.  During May and June 2015 we had a very successful period of intensive field measurements.  We made measurements during more that a hundred explosive eruptive events detecting electrical activity during most.  We used the LMA with 9 stations, electric field antennas, seismic and infrasound sensors, and special video cameras.  We had two high speed cameras (6000 frames per second), an infrared camera and a low light camera. This field program gave us good measurements of many more eruptive events with electrical activity than we had hoped for.  Most of the explosive events that sent ash clouds at least a mile into the air produced electrical activity, both the continual small discharges (CRF) and small lightning.  These occurred several up to a dozen times a day. \n \nWe have discovered a unique radio signal produced by volcanic eruptions and not thunderstorms.  We call this CRF, for continual radio frequency impulses.  The CRF begins to occur within a fraction of a second of the beginning of the jet of ash and gas from the volcano.  It continues as long as there is a strong ash eruption.  It should be possible to use this to estimate the amount of ash erupted and the strength of the eruption.  This could be used to determine whether to issue warnings to aircraft flying in the region.  This could be used in isolated regions such as the Aleutian Islands where there are major commercial air routes.\n \nIn this project we made an extra effort to study these unique signals from the CRF and the discharges causing them.  We have seen this signal at all the volcanoes we have studied.  CRF has been hypothesized to be caused by many very small lightning?like discharges on the order of 300 ft in length occurring at the vent of the volcano. During the eruptions of Sakurajima we found that CRF is a collection of thousands very short duration RF impulses each second and each are about 160 nano-seconds long. These RF impulses are distinct from those typically produced by lightning. We also observed small, 100?ft lightning discharges occurring near the volcanic vent that were distinct from the source of CRF. Our observations show that CRF is caused by an electrical discharge that is more simple than even a very small (&sim;300 ft) lightning discharge. We conclude that CRF is caused by numerous, small, electrical discharges not more than few feet in length.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/15/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ronald J Thomas"
