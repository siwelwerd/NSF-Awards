 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sign language research has broadened our understanding of human language processing and languages in general. Since the 1960s, there have been a growing number of sign language studies, yet the presence of deaf researchers -- users of signed languages -- is greatly underrepresented in this field. This project aims to broaden the participation of deaf individuals in disciplines that conduct sign language research. This project will support eight deaf students to present and participate in the 12th International Conference on Theoretical Issues in Sign Language (TISLR12). TISLR is the most significant and well-attended international sign language research conference. Immediately after the conference the students will participate in a one-day workshop offered by the TISLR12 conference committee on applied linguistics and the translational implications of sign language research. This project will provide American Sign Language/English interpreting services so these students will have access to this knowledge and opportunities to interact with sign language researchers from all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe selected students will each have three senior mentors who will meet with them prior to the conference, during the conference, and after the conference. The students' experiences, what they learned and/or their experiences and/or their research question and plans will be presented to the group and mentors. The knowledge learned from this program will impact the selected students with both theoretical and translational issues related to sign language research. The long-term projected outcome is an increase in deaf sign language researchers. They will disseminate their experiences to deaf students at deaf schools, in university publications, Center and laboratory publications, in ASL online through social media, and at conferences concerning broadening the participation of deaf researchers in STEM fields.",
