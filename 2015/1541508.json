 "awd_abstract_narration": "A strong background in mathematics is expected of college graduates so that they can thrive in the workforce as science, technology, engineering, mathematics (STEM) professionals, and professionals in other technical and non-technical fields, as well as citizens able to navigate the variety of information available through the media and other sources. To this end, there have been efforts in the mathematical sciences to improve the learning and teaching of undergraduate mathematics. A body of research on learning and teaching now exists that provides evidence pointing to effective strategies for teaching of mathematics to college students. This project will host a workshop to bring together experts in mathematics and mathematics education research to identify and prioritize the most pressing evidence toward translating that research into teaching practice and develop a guide to research-based pedagogical practices in undergraduate mathematics teaching.\r\n\r\nThe Mathematical Association of America (MAA) is the largest professional organization focused on undergraduate mathematics and is the leading source for mathematics faculty professional development as well as resources for teaching and learning undergraduate mathematics. Thus, the MAA is the natural and optimal lead organization to produce a resource intended to infuse research-based pedagogies into the teaching of undergraduate mathematics. The proposed workshop will enable the MAA's Committee on Teaching Undergraduate Mathematics to bring together experts from multiple communities into an immersive environment in which they can focus on the work of identifying priority areas for the envisioned guide. Outcomes of the workshop will include: (1) ascertaining optimal pathway(s) for mathematicians and researchers in undergraduate mathematics education to translate the education research into teaching practice; (2) producing a document that describes, clarifies, and guides the pathway(s) determined in the aforementioned outcome (1); and (3) identifying gaps in the education research knowledge base and prioritizing those gaps into future research agendas.",
