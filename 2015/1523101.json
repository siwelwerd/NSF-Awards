 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many mobile devices with GPS-positioning capabilities allow users to retrieve and share their geographical coordinates and such geospatial data is critical in many areas including traffic optimization, emergency response, disaster rescue missions or military intelligence. At the same time, there are serious concerns related to the security, privacy and trustworthiness (SPT) of the data since users disclose their coordinates and an adversary could derive sensitive information violating users' privacy, or could change the data leading, for example, to wrong conclusions in a crime investigation. SPT for geospatial data has been a subject of intensive research and its results have been gradually transferred into market products. However, there has been no transition to education and this project intends to build capacity for geospatial SPT education by developing six course modules.  They will cover geospatial SPT from several different perspectives, with focus on data management, networking, data mining, and social issues. The modules can be integrated into upper-level high-school, community college, or university courses.\r\n\r\nThe dissemination plan includes workshops, seminars and other outreach activities at high schools, community colleges and universities to increase awareness on geospatial SPT issues and to disseminate project's resources to a broad audience. It is expected that the proposed course modules will be also used in other fields such as law, economics, sociology and other disciplines where mobile technology introduces new opportunities but also considerable challenges. The project intends to reach students from underrepresented groups through collaboration with institutions in the Pathways to Prosperity network.",

All of these are highly interactive tools with rich visual features, which makes them easy to use and engaging for the students. Two of them are web applications for desktop, and one is a mobile app. The tools were developed with the participation of both graduate and undergraduate students. In particular, the GeoCTF tool was developed exclusively through undergraduate research projects.</p>\n<p>(1) <em>GeoCTF</em>: this is a desktop web applications which takes the form of a Capture-the-Flag (CTF) game. The main role of GeoCTF is to raise student awareness on the dangers of sharing location privacy unprotected. The student plays the role of an ethical hacker who accesses the social media profiles of a number of target users. The student searches for geo-tagged information (i.e., geo-flags) within the user profiles, and is able to reconstruct the trajectories of the victims. The tool includes a visualization component that shows the student the trajectories of victims overlaid on a map (this feature is integrated with GoogleMaps). Several victim profiles are provided with the distribution, and additional profiles can be created with a relatively limited amount of technical skill (the GeoCTF manual details the process of creating new profiles using configuration files).</p>\n<p>The three profiles that ship with the tool include a comprehensive set of geo-flags, ranging from easy-to-find ones (suitable for novice users, e.g., location is embedded as text in the post of a victim) to more challenging ones (suitable for advanced users, e.g., coordinates embedded in an image or video). The attached figures [GeoCTF1, GeoCTF2] provide two snapshots of the tool.</p>\n<p>(2) <em>SKATool</em>: this is a desktop tool that allows students to familiarize themselves with prominent techniques for location protection using the spatial k-anonymity model (SKA). The main idea is to construct rectangular regions in the space that include at least <em>k</em> users, hence anonymity is provided for a mobile user by hiding her within a set of users. The algorithms use various computational geometry techniques, and the SKATool breaks down these algorithms into individual steps that are easy to visualize and understand by the students. The attached figures [SKATool1, SKATool2] provide two snapshots of the tool.</p>\n<p>(3) <em>FastTweet</em>: this is a mobile app that interfaces with Twitter and allows students to track a victim Twitter user who has a public profile and posts geo-tagged tweets. A mock-up victim profile is created for this purpose and accessed by the app. A mapping feature is provided, which interfaces with GoogleMaps and shows the victim's whereabouts.
