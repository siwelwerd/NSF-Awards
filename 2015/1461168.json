 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports the renewal of the Research Experiences for Undergraduates site in Physics at the University of Chicago.   The award will support ten students per year for ten weeks of summer research.  The core of the program for each student is a well-defined 10- week summer research project under supervision of a University of Chicago faculty member. Projects are distributed among: high-energy, cosmic-ray and astrophysics, general relativity, condensed-matter physics, non-linear dynamics and biophysics. A series of lectures presented by faculty provides an overview of some of the most important research topics currently pursued in these areas of physics.  \r\n\r\nThe interns will learn to communicate science by submitting a written report and making an oral presentation on their work. The program provides students with exposure to the breadth and unity of physics. It brings the REU students into contact with one another. This creates the peer interactions among students that increase the program's excitement and vitality, and helps prepare them for future careers in Physics and in STEM fields in general.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nIntellectual Merit : \n\nThe Department of Physics at the University of Chicago has run a Research Experiences for Undergraduate (REU) site targeted especially towards women and underrepresented minorities. \n\nThe objective was to encourage these students to pursue careers in physics.  Applications were solicited nationally with emphasis on historically black colleges, minority-serving institutions, and traditional women?s colleges.  The core of the program for each student was a well-defined 10- week summer research project under supervision of a University of Chicago faculty member. \n\n Projects were distributed among: high-energy experiment (9), high energy theory (1), cosmology and astrophysics (22), general relativity (1),  condensed-matter physics (2) and biophysics/medical physics (4).  A series of lectures presented by faculty provided an overview of some of the most important research topics currently pursued in these areas of physics. \n\nBroader Impacts : \n\nWe broadened the scope of our research by introducing many of the ideas of cutting-edge research to a number of underrepresented minorities and women (10 African-American, 18 Hispanic; 25 women). \n\nThe interns learned to communicate science by submitting a written report and making an oral presentation on their work. The program provided students with exposure to the breadth and unity of physics.  It brought the REU students into contact with one another. This created the peer interactions among students that increase the program?s excitement and vitality. \n\nAs our tracking of previous students indicate, our REU interns typically continue in scientific careers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/25/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sidney R Nagel"
