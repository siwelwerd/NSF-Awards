 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to better understand the final fates\r\nof massive stars.  At the end of their lives, all stars more than\r\nroughly ten times the mass of our Sun build an iron core which\r\ncollapses from the size of the Earth to the size of a city once\r\nits mass exceeds a critical limit.  In many cases this results in an\r\nluminous, supernova explosion, but there is increasing evidence\r\nthat this is not the only outcome.  This work will (a) discover\r\nor set useful constraints on the fraction of massive stars that\r\nproduce a black hole without a supernova explosion; (b) clarify\r\nthe boundary between the least luminous supernova explosions and the\r\nvariability of massive stars that does not lead a supernova explosion; and (c)\r\nmeasure the properties of these stars just before their deaths,\r\nincluding pioneering studies of their variability.  The project\r\nwill advance our scientific understanding of these massive stars\r\nwhile training the next generation of scientists.\r\n\r\nThe research steps for a better understanding of the fates of\r\nmassive stars include using unique, multifaceted observational and\r\ntheoretical approaches. The centerpiece is a project using the\r\ntwin 8.4m Large Binocular Telescope to monitor all the massive\r\nevolved stars in 27 nearby star-forming galaxies.  The primary\r\ngoals are to:\r\n(1) Discover or set interesting constraining limits on the\r\n   fraction of core collapses that fail, producing a black\r\n   hole without a supernova explosion;\r\n(2) Measure the properties of SN progenitors while pioneering\r\n   studies of their variability and binarity;\r\n(3) Explore the boundary between the faintest SN and stellar\r\n   outbursts, in particular by better understanding the nature of\r\n   the SN \"impostors\" and the SN2008S class of dusty transients.\r\nWhile doing so, the project will advance the training of students and\r\npost-docs and broaden the public's understanding and interest in science,\r\naided by their fascination with stars and their complicated roads to\r\ndeath.",
