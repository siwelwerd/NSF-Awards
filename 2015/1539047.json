 "awd_abstract_narration": "Location-based service has been ranked as #1 in top 10 technology trends by Time magazine, with potential applications in the area of location-based advertising, recommendation, navigation, asset recovery, gaming, etc. Lots of companies are investigating and improving the location-based services. For example, Google Map is working on adding Google Store Views. However, most of the existing indoor and outdoor maps are relatively static. In reality, the indoor and outdoor environments may dynamically change over time. Therefore, there is a pressing need for novel technologies and systems to improve simultaneous localization, mapping, and navigation in modern cities (both outdoor and indoor). Moreover, in many applications, such as disaster recovery, rescuers have to cooperate with other team members to perform their tasks. Therefore, it is highly desirable that rescuers can accurately know the relative positions of their peers in real-time.\r\n\r\nThis project introduces a holistic approach for providing real-time light-weight and accurate relative positioning techniques to detect peers in both indoor and outdoor environment. The outcome of this research will constitute a significant advance in the development of theoretical foundations and practical algorithms for simultaneous localization and mapping. The broader impact of this work will be further amplified by (i) improving curriculum development with enhanced course projects; (ii) disseminating research results through high-profile tutorials and open-source sites; (iii) raising interest in technology among K-12 students and under-represented minority groups through open houses; and (iv) supporting a talented minority PhD student to successfully accomplish the doctoral study.",
