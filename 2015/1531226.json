 "awd_abstract_narration": "Strong relationships with close others are important for psychological and physical well-being. However, people differ in how willing and able they are to forge bonds in which they feel secure with others. People who achieve greater security in their close relationships (\"attachment security\") have better relationship outcomes, are more confident in pursuing personal goals and are better able to handle challenges. Although attachment insecurity is often a chronic condition, it can and does change with new experiences. This project capitalizes on interactions in romantic relationships, which evoke experiences that have powerful effects in regulating a sense of security. This research introduces relationship strategies, such as communication strategies that strengthen trust or confidence and perception exercises that aid in positive reinterpretations of interactions, that could regulate attachment security. This work will therefore shed light on fundamental questions in attachment research and relationship science, such as what are the interpersonal processes that lead to increased attachment security over time? Specifically, the research will test theoretically-derived pathways through which short- and long-term changes in attachment processes could be achieved. The relationship strategies examined in this research target each type of insecurity and are designed to be incorporated in typical couple interactions and daily events. These strategies may also be adopted in non-romantic settings by individuals who have endured negative interpersonal experiences.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this project is to identify mechanisms through which insecure relational dynamics may be reduced, and attachment security enhanced, over time. Specifically, the research will test whether communication strategies mediate these processes in the short-term; and, whether changes in mental models (beliefs about the self and others) lead to longer-term shifts in attachment security. In a series of randomized experiments, couples are assigned to strategies to target anxious tendencies or avoidant tendencies. The first aim will test the mediating role that communication strategies play in mitigating anxiety versus avoidance. Such communication may reduce immediate relational tension but may not be sufficient to cause enduring changes in attachment security. The second aim, therefore, involves examining interactions and perceptions that can increase confidence among anxious individuals and increase trust among avoidant individuals. The effect of these security-enhancing strategies, combined with communication that mitigates insecurity, will be examined over an extended time. These relatively minor changes in couples' communication patterns and beliefs are expected to ripple into more profound changes in general attachment security, which benefits relationships and promotes meaningful activities that are fundamental to societal well-being.
