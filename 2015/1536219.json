 "awd_abstract_narration": "Axial Seamount is a hotspot volcano and the most magmatically active feature on the Juan de Fuca oceanic spreading center. The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) cabled observatory at Axial provides a ground-breaking opportunity to capture volcano behavior leading up to, during, and following a seafloor eruption. Axial volcano erupted in 1998 and 2011 and, prior to April 2015, seafloor sensors showed that it was inflating with magma again. Over their first six months of operation, the cabled seismometers at Axial Seamount recorded increasingly high rates of small earthquake activity, supporting the inference that the volcano was in the late stage of its volcanic cycle. This was confirmed in late April 2015 when the volcano erupted. The researchers on this grant will work with both graduate and undergraduate students to analyze this first-ever seafloor volcanic event to be observed in real-time with seafloor sensors.\r\n\r\nThis study will use the OOI cabled ocean bottom seismometer network to determine the pattern of earthquake activity at Axial Seamount to understand how stress at the spreading axis is partitioned spatially and temporally. The implications in terms of possible broad structures of hydrothermal flow will be assessed. Changes in the physical properties of the volcano through a volcanic cycle will be documented, with ultimate aim of advancing knowledge about how individual geologic events sum to produce long-term, steady oceanic spreading. Production of near-real time earthquake catalogs for the continuing OOI cabled seismic data stream will allow rapid identification of significant new events. Relocation analysis will yield relative earthquake locations accurate to within tens of meters, bringing structural features in the seismicity into focus. Focal mechanisms, repeating earthquakes, and shear wave splitting parameters will be obtained to further constrain the volcano's dynamics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award supported the University of Washington (UW) component of a collaborative study between the UW and Columbia University to study earthquakes recorded by seismic stations on cabled seafloor observatory at Axial Seamount, a submarine volcano in the Northeast Pacific about 300 miles west of the Oregon coast.  This volcano is located on the Juan de Fuca ocean spreading center.  It rises over half a mile above the surrounding seafloor and is about a mile below the sea surface.  The summit of the volcano comprises elongated horseshoe caldera that measures 5 miles by 2 miles and is up to 500 feet deep.  The volcano erupted in 1998 and 2011 and between writing the proposal and receiving the award it erupted again in April 2015.  \n\nWe created a computer program that automatically analyzes the seismic data from Axial Seamount to create a catalog of earthquake locations (latitude, longitude and depth) and sizes.  This catalog updates very hour and can be found at http://axial.ocean.washington.edu and currently includes over 140,000 earthquakes.  During the 4 months we have data prior to the eruption, the number of earthquakes increased from a few hundred per day to over a thousand.  On the first day of the eruption over 8000 earthquakes were located during a 12-hour seismic crisis.  The eruption lasted about a month during which time the rate of earthquakes steadily decreased to low levels.  Following the eruption, the rate of earthquakes has very slowly increased as the volcano reinflates toward another eruption that is expected in a few years. \n\nThis study allowed us to observe the motion on buried faults that control the formation and deformation of the caldera.  Between eruptions, these faults slip to allow the caldera floor to rise as magma enters the volcano.  When the volcano erupts and the magma leaves the volcano, the caldera floor sinks and the faults slip in the opposite direction.  We discovered that the caldera faults beneath the east and west sides of the caldera slope outwards and likely connect at the north end of the caldera to form a conical ring fault.  The study has provided new insights into the behavior of calderas that are applicable to other volcanoes with calderas.\n\nDuring the 2015 eruption we also documented 30,000 explosive events that occurred on the seafloor at the sites where magma erupted.  Most of these were located up to 10 miles north of the caldera where a thick lava flow was subsequently detected.  We suspect that these explosions are related to steam bubbles forming and then collapsing when magma heats seawater trapped in pockets beneath the lava flow. These explosions will provide a useful means to rapidly detect the location of future eruptions so that scientists can visually observe the eruption and sample the chemistry and microbiology of the hydrothermal fluids that generated from new magma.\n\nWe have used the seismic waves recorded from the earthquakes to create a 3-D image of shear-wave seismic velocities in the volcano that show evidence that there is a lot of steam in the subsurface pore space beneath the southern part of the volcano where there are several hydrothermal vent fields.  We have also looked at how the fractures in the volcano affect the propagation of shear waves and used this to understand how the stresses in the volcano were modified by the 2015 eruption.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/09/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William S Wilcock"
