 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to establish a multi-institution research experience for undergraduate students (REU) in the mathematical biosciences, facilitated by the Mathematical Biosciences Institute (MBI) at The Ohio State University. The objectives of the program are: (1) to introduce undergraduate students at all levels to the field of mathematical biology; (2) to encourage students to pursue graduate study in the mathematical biosciences; and (3) to increase the number of students who enter the workforce with training in this field. Students will work on applying mathematics and statistics to research in areas such as molecular evolution, neuronal patterns, cancer modeling, epidemic models and vaccination strategies, and models of sensory systems, such as vision and smell. The infrastructure provided by the MBI gives the necessary resources to accomplish these goals by providing both an authentic research experience as well as exposure to the field of mathematical biology broadly.\r\n\r\nThe program consists of three components. The first is a week-long Overview of Mathematical Biosciences, which consists of lectures by experts in the field, laboratory tours and field trips, and computer exercises using the Matlab software. This is held at the MBI in Columbus, OH annually in the second week of June. Following completion of the one-week overview session, the students will travel to one of MBI's Institute Partners to participate in an 8-week mentored research experience at the host institution. Finally, the participants will join other students doing research in the mathematical biosciences and present their results at a Capstone Conference hosted by the MBI. Throughout the program, a cohort will be maintained by weekly virtual seminars and discussions among participating institutions.  They will work in pairs under the guidance of one or more mentors to make genuine research contributions in these areas, often leading to publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at conferences. The student participants will develop skills needed to continue work in these areas and to pursue graduate study. Their involvement in this research will expand the group of students trained to work in the field of mathematical biology.",
