CTEMPs offers community support for planning, training, equipment loan and field implementation using distributed fiber optic Raman backscatter Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) to allow for unprecedented observation of the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature for geoscience and environmental applications including but not limited to, snow, groundwater and watershed hydrology, aquatic and terrestrial ecology, karst geology, soil science (including permafrost studies), physical limnology and oceanography, micrometeorology and glaciology.  High resolution DTS systems allow for high spatial (<= 0.25 m) and high accuracy (within 0.1 - 0.3 deg C) observations of river bottom, lake, or estuary bottom, snow pack, soil horizon or atmospheric temperatures over length scales from 0.25 ? 2500 m. at high temporal frequency (1 Hz).  Temperature precision of +/ 0.01 deg C can be achieved when observation are sampled hourly.  When placed in a stream or river, fiber optic DTS allows for observation of the location, temperature, and flux of each groundwater inflow, calculation of an exact heat budget to determine hyporheic exchange, and observation of micro-thermal habitats critical to successful larval fish recruitment.  DTS systems were originally developed for applications in the oil and electrical power transmission industries and for fire detection in high rise buildings.    \r\n \r\nSupport under this grant will allow for: 1) continued provision of high resolution temperature sensing equipment to the geosciences community using a recently expanded DTS instrument pool; 2) develop and promote the use of actively heated optical fiber sensing for the measurement of soil moisture and fluid flux, and 3) to incorporate the rapidly emerging, but logistically challenging, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) technology to hydrologic and earth surface monitoring.  The CTEMPs facility will offer hands-on training and knowledge dissemination, through its formal designation as a CUAHSI Hydrologic Measurement Facility (HMF) Node and formal agreements with CUAHSI to promote two hands-on workshops per year as well as training on both the OSU and UNR campuses.  Outreach to K-8 will also be tested at the T.L. Wells Discovery Museum in Reno through incorporation of DTS in an interactive river display.\r\n\r\n***",

CTEMPs strives to provide measurement of critical earth science processes at the \"next generation\" of spatial and temporal scales. The focus of CTEMPs from 2014 through 2019 was concentrated in two areas: design and delivery of fiber-optic based distributed temperature sensing (DTS) for applications in earth sciences and the development and deployment of small unmanned aircraft systems (sUAS) to image the earth?s surface. Fiber-optic based temperature sensing now allows researchers to monitor the temperature of water, air and soil every 10-20 cm along the optical fiber which can be as long at 50 kilometers.&nbsp; sUAS platforms developed at CTEMPs can resolve topographic and vegetation changes at the centimeter scale, with repeatability far more quickly and less costly than traditional airborne or satellite remote sensing.</p>\n<p>As a community user facility, instrumentation and support services are made available to federally supported researchers as well as state, local and limited private industry.

CTEMPs provides extensive education and training on its instruments through workshops, individual on-site training, remote consulting support, on-site direct assistance, and extensive on-line resources such as calibration programs and literature. CTEMPs operates 12 field deployable fiber optic DTS systems capable of remote operation and autonomous function and eight sUAS to conduct photography, near infrared imaging, hyperspectral imaging and thermal imaging. CTEMPs is jointly operated by the University of Nevada, Reno and the Oregon State University with additional instrumentation contributions from Smith College.</p>\n<p>During this reporting period, CTEMPs supported 82 individual DTS deployment projects, spanning 6 continents.&nbsp; Twenty-three (23) unmanned aircraft projects were supported and collectively resulted in the publication of 83 peer-reviewed journal articles.&nbsp; Instrumentation was supplied to researchers supported by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, NASA, U.S. Forest Service, NOAA and various state agencies and universities. CTEMPs personnel trained over 275 students and researchers in formal workshops over the period, including for the first time, support of the ?Summer of Applied Geophysics Experience? field training camp with over 35 students.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The use of DTS for earth science research has grown extensively in recent years, with CTEMPs supporting projects focusing on surface water and groundwater exchange, groundwater flow in fracture aquifers, lake and ocean dynamics, atmospheric boundary layer mixing and soil moisture dynamics as well as many other topical areas.</p>\n<p>An area of extensive use of CTEMPs fiber optic instrumentation has been the study of internal boundary layers in lakes and oceans.&nbsp; CTEMPs supported work in the Dead Sea, Lake Shasta, Lake Chelan, Foster Reservoir, The South China Sea, and off the coast of California, resulting in at least 5 publications, with several more in preparation.&nbsp; The ability to provide dynamic observation across km length scales has revolutionized these observations, representing a game-changing technology with CTEMPs supporting essentially all of the teams employing this method</p>\n<p>DTS has also been widely adopted in glaciology, with extensive applications in Polar regions.&nbsp; Fisher et al.

Figure 1 shows the DTS derived temperature profile in 750 meters of ice overlying Lake Whillans, and documenting an elevated heat flux both from beneath the lake, but also within the overlying ice.
