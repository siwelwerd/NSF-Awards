This pathway can be activated by double-stranded RNAs called short, interfering RNAs (siRNAs). The specific aims of the proposed work are to: i) define the sequence and structural features of siRNAs that result in the proper processing of siRNAs by the RNAi pathway proteins; ii) characterize the siRNA features that affect binding of the siRNAs by RNAi pathway proteins; and iii) determine the cellular uptake pathways for siRNA-containing complexes that maximize function of the delivered siRNAs. Due to the potential specificity of RNAi and its applicability against nearly any protein target, siRNAs have garnered considerable attention as the next generation of biomolecular therapeutics.\r\n\r\nRNA interference holds promise as a tool for manipulation of biological processes and for the development of a new class of therapeutics. RNAi is initiated by short, interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and results in the knockdown of a targeted protein. To achieve knockdown, exogenous siRNAs must be delivered to the cytoplasms of targeted cells and interact productively with the RNAi pathway proteins. However, siRNA delivery remains a significant challenge. To achieve silencing, siRNAs must first enter the targeted cells by a mechanism that allows them to be active. Currently, the uptake pathways that result in siRNA function are poorly understood. The proposed work seeks to identify the rules that govern the design of siRNAs and the vehicles used to deliver them to cells. Using in vitro and cellular systems, siRNAs and delivery vehicles with unique characteristics will be studied to determine which combination of features results in the highest siRNA activity. The specific aims of the proposed work are to i) define the sequence and structural features of siRNAs that are associated with functional asymmetry using an in vitro system; ii) characterize the sequence features that influence in vitro binding interactions of siRNAs with RNAi pathway proteins using degenerate siRNAs and parallel RNA sequencing; and iii) determine the cellular uptake pathways for siRNA-containing complexes that maximize silencing efficiency of the delivered siRNAs.\r\n\r\nThis award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Program of the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology.",
