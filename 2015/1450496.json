The objectives of the IUPAC Young Observer Program include providing networking and mentoring opportunities that foster interactions of the participants with leading scientists in their field, helping to nurture a future generation of chemistry leaders, providing opportunities for sharing research in a global forum from across the chemical sciences, and fostering international collaborations between U.S. chemists and their international peers. The Young Observer program will enable those who might not otherwise be able to attend the Congress and General Assembly to do so, encouraging the participation of a strong pool of U.S. chemistry talent at these meetings and in IUPAC activities.\r\n\r\nApproximately 12 early-to-mid career scientists (under the age of 45) will attend the 45th IUPAC Congress and 48th IUPAC General Assembly.  The Young Observers will obtain travel grants as well as associated mentoring, networking and career development opportunities. The IUPAC Young Observer program has been in operation since 1977 and has introduced approximately 200 scientists to the international issues and progress in the field of chemistry.",
