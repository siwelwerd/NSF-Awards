The demand for advanced technology technicians educated in the skills, knowledge and attributes of biomanufacturing remains high and is currently not being met by 4-year college graduates entering the job market. \"The Report and Survey of Biopharmaceutical Manufacturing Capacity and Production\" recognized the importance of community college biomanufacturing programs in educating this workforce, and this Center will continue to create local infrastructures and a national network to support the development of a skilled national workforce for the biomanufacturing industry.\r\n\r\nThe Center will use best practices as they relate to professional development, curriculum development, career coaching, partnerships and networks, dissemination and sustainability. Center goals and objectives include the following. 1) New curriculum will be developed for the most recent advances and trends in biomanufacturing, including single use technology, upstream and downstream processing of monoclonal antibody therapeutics, process development and quality by design, biofuels from microalgae and the production of stem cells in a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) environment. These curriculum modules will be introduced to faculty in nine 3-day workshops and as a mini laboratory manual. 2) Partnerships within local networks of educators and employers will be strengthened and expanded to emphasize the pathway for students from high school through college to the work place. There will be a strong focus on high school students with the development of a series of summer workshops allowing students to gain awareness of the field and progress through hands-on activities in different areas of biomanufacturing. 3) Professional development will include topic specific mini conferences for community college faculty, the continuation of \"Protein is Cash\" workshops, and a conference for secondary teachers dedicated to implementing biomanufacturing and biotechnology in the classroom following state and national education standards. Community college students will have real world experience with internships and coaching to find employment in the field.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The Northeast Biomanufacturing Center and Collaborative (NBC2) based at Montgomery County Community College (MCCC) in Blue Bell, PA, is an NSF Advanced Technology Regional Center committed to the education and training of a technical workforce to support the rapidly growing biomanufacturing industry. The NBC2 consisted of five Hubs at community colleges across the nation, each of which developed a local network of biopharmaceutical companies, educational institutions, and trade organizations. The five Hub were centered at the following institutions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>BigPharma Hub at MCCC and Bucks County Community College;</li>\n<li>Upstate New York Hub at Finger Lakes Community College in Canandaigua, NY</li>\n<li>Southern Hub at Alamance Community College in Graham, NC;</li>\n<li>Midwest Hub at Ivy Tech Community College in Bloomington, IN;&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Western Hub at Miracosta College in Oceanside, CA.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">&nbsp;Major Accomplishments</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Partnerships and Mentoring</strong></p>\n<p>The NBC2 Regional Center has partnered with both regional and national trade organizations and scores of representatives from biomanufacturing companies, including GSK, Merck, Pfizer and Regeneron, to determine the needs of biomanufacturing companies and to delineate the skills and knowledge most appropriate for biomanufacturing training programs. In more recent years the Center has also partnered with the Manufacturing USA Institutes, most notably the National Institute of Innovation for the Manufacture of Biopharmaceuticals, NIIMBL, to address biomanufacturing workforce needs and create new training programs.</p>\n<p>A major role of the NBC2 was to connect with and mentor biotechnology programs and faculty at community colleges across the country. More than 100 community colleges offer biomanufacturing education and training in the U.S. The NBC2 has partnered with many biotechnology programs to create new content, courses, and programs. To facilitate this the NBC2 created a designated Instructors Portal on the website hosting over 170 resources including biomanufacturing lectures, labs and exams to assist with biomanufacturing course creation. More than 200 faculty representing 165 two and four-year institutions use the portal.</p>\n<p><strong>Curriculum Development and Dissemination</strong></p>\n<p>Through many partnerships within US biomanufacturing companies, the NBC2 has continued to develop and disseminate industry-endorsed curricular materials for technician training and education. This has impacted the quality and industry relevance of course content in biomanufacturing programs throughout the country. An example is the creation of a comprehensive course on monoclonal antibody production, an area of biomanufacturing that often reports technician shortages. Monoclonal antibodies, such as those used to treat COVID 19 patients, are the major biopharmaceutical currently on the commercial market with over one hundred products already approved by the FDA. The NBC2 at MCCC simulated the commercial production of a monoclonal antibody at a laboratory scale, developed all laboratory processes, directive documents and didactic content for educators to adopt. A lab manual entitled <em>The Biomanufacture of Monoclonal Antibodies</em>&nbsp;was developed and the NBC2 leadership team hosted four miniBIOMAN workshops that trained faculty in various aspects of the process. Other curriculum developed included the manufacture of stem cells and advanced therapies, statistical design of experiments and manufacture of a drug product. A total of 72 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were created, as well as eight curriculum modules that contain all laboratory procedures and lecture materials needed to introduce a topic into an existing or new biomanufacturing course. In addition NBC2 continued to create and disseminate curricular material to introduce the field of biotechnology at the high school level. A new laboratory manual was developed entitled <em>Biotechnology in Your Backyard</em>&nbsp;designed for teachers to introduce biotechnology at the high school level.</p>\n<p>All NBC2 curricular material can be downloaded from the NBC2 website at www.biomanufacturing.org. The material including a textbook, several lab manuals and all SOPs and lectures are entirely open source and free for students and faculty to download. This removes any instructional material costs typically associated with a college laboratory course.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Professional Development Programs for Faculty and Teachers Served 222 Educators and 619 students</strong>:</p>\n<p>NBC2 continued to provide industry relevant professional development opportunities to college faculty, high school teachers, high school students and community college students through a range of activities that included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nine miniBIOMAN 3-day workshops for college faculty serving 91 instructors</li>\n<li>5-day BIOMAN Academy workshops at five regional NBC2 hubs with 131 High School students participating</li>\n<li>5-day <em>Protein is Cash</em> biomanufacturing workshops and one day career workshops for High School teachers serving a total of 103 teachers and impacting a total of 6,413 high school students</li>\n<li>Eighteen biotechnology/biomanufacturing career fairs at six member colleges serving 500 students and providing employment guidance, internship and job opportunities </li>\n<li>Undergraduate research internships with industry partner collaboration involved 16 students at two NBC2 Hubs</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Through the activities described above the NBC2 met the intellectual merit and broader impact goals of the project and significantly impacted the biomanufacturing training and education that prepares graduates to join a much needed workforce for the nation?s bioeconomy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by:
