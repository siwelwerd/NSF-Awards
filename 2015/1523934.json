 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2015, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Jennifer Hodge is \"Evolution of color pattern: function and rates of diversification.\" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of California, Davis, and the sponsoring scientist is Prof. Peter Wainwright.  \r\n\r\nCoral reefs afford an rich environment in which to study biodiversity and the mechanism and rate of adaptive change and evolution as coral reef organisms experience environmental change.  Coral reefs are endangered in many locations around the world and better knowledge of their biology and ecology informs conservation efforts.  The fellowship research uses biological collections from the California Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian, as well as open-access collections of digital photographs and geographic range maps to determine how color pattern has evolved in coral reef butterflyfishes and the primary ecological functions color patterns may serve. Biological collections provide the opportunity to obtain fine-scale measurements of the color patterns of the fish for use in mathematical models to describe the variety of color patterns observed in butterflyfishes.  Results promise to explain how color patterns in butterflyfish have evolved adaptively in relation to ecological niche and to what extent color pattern is important in species recognition and mate selection. \r\n \r\nTraining goals include applying functional morphology as an indicator of ecological niche, mathematical modeling to simulate biological patterns, and comparative phylogenetic analyses to test predictions about trait correlation and rates of trait evolution. Educational outreach includes mentoring undergraduate students participating in the Ecology and Evolution Graduate Admissions Pathways program. Educational outreach activities also include guest lectures and engagement with the community at public science exhibits.",

An organism's appearance can influence how it behaves and interacts with other organisms and its environment. These interactions may contribute to important ecosystem processes, like the transfer of energy through predator-prey interactions. Understanding how biological diversity has arisen and how contemporary patterns of diversity are maintained can inform predictions about how biodiversity might change in the future and the actions necessary to conserve it. Gaining this knowledge requires the generation of large-scale datasets that allow us to ask questions about the evolution of organismal traits.

Specimens were loaned from the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, the American Museum of Natural History, the Field Museum of Natural History, and the California Academy of Sciences, and I also had the opportunity to visit some of these collections. Specimens provided the opportunity to measure and categorize the bold color patterns displayed by different butterflyfish species and to collect more detailed data on body form through a laboratory technique called clearing and staining. During this process the soft tissues are cleared (rendering the specimen see-through), the bones are stained red, and the cartilage is stained blue (Fig. 1). I performed this technique, along with a team of undergraduate and graduate student researchers, on 469 specimens representing 100 butterflyfish species (75% of described extant species). We measured different aspects of body form, including the lengths and orientation of bones, from the cleared and stained specimens and from their photographs. This body-form dataset was combined with data on each species' ecology, geographic distribution, and behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Eight undergraduate and three graduate students gained valuable experience through their involvement as research participants.

I mentored an undergraduate student from Howard University who participated in the University of California's Ecology and Evolution Graduate Admissions Pathways (EEGAP) program, a University of California Historically Black Colleges and Universities (UC-HBCU) Initiative. We developed a project to investigate how variation in fin spine length corresponds to different ecological and behavioral traits. Butterflyfishes have long spines in their dorsal and anal fins that help protect them from predation and we hypothesized that social species that defend territories with known refuge may be less well defended against predators than non-territorial and solitary species. We discovered interesting relationships between defensive morphology, foraging strategy and social behavior, which we continued to develop with a team of undergraduate students. Students worked on all aspects of the project including clearing and staining museum specimens and measuring morphometric traits (Fig. 1). The results identified a previously unrecognized axis of diversity in butterflyfishes where species with robust morphological defenses, like long fin spines, actively hunt mobile benthic prey items, often away from known coral refuge and lack sociality, while species with reduced morphological defenses passively browse on sessile prey close to known coral refuge within their territory, have adaptations for quick escapes and benefit from the vigilance provided by sociality.
