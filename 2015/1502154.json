 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports U.S. participants in the Research School \"Second Latin American School of Algebraic Geometry and Applications (II ELGA)\" held in Cabo Frio, Brazil from June 1 to 12, 2015. The school is the second of its kind in Latin America, with the first ELGA being held in Argentina in 2011. The school has several goals: to introduce a new generation of students and researchers to the subject of Algebraic Geometry, to present a broad view of recent developments in the area, to disseminate new problems and directions of research, to promote greater interaction among researchers and students, and to help young researchers build a network of collaborations. \r\n\r\nAlgebraic Geometry is a fundamental field of research, with applications and connections throughout mathematics and other sciences. The first week of the school will include four mini courses (of 5 hours each) which cover some of the most active topics in the field, as well as reflect the diversity and scope of modern Algebraic Geometry. The main speakers are prominent algebraic geometers: Robert Lazarsfeld, Olivier Debarre, Barbara Fantechi, and Burt Totaro. The second week will be a research conference, with 28 talks given by world class researchers. The hosting institution is IMPA (Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics), in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. There are 6 organizers working in several different countries: Brazil, Chile, Italy, France, Mexico, and the United States. The II ELGA is the only event in Latin America in two years devoted to Algebraic Geometry and explicitly aimed at Ph.D. students and young researchers. The organizers expect a large participation and impact for the school, as Algebraic Geometry is much on the rise in Latin America. The success of the first ELGA school, along with the high reputation of IMPA and the speakers, should guarantee a large international participation. The award funds will be used to support Ph.D. students and young researchers working in the United States. More details about the meeting can be found at http://www.impa.br/opencms/pt/eventos/store/evento_1503.\r\n\r\nThis award is co-funded by the International Science and Engineering (ISE) Section of NSF.",
