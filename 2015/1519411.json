They will conduct 300 interviews, most of which will be video-taped for public engagement and wider distribution. The results of this project will provide guidance for policy makers and others seeking to understand the diversity of fears, risk perceptions, preparedness, and acceptable actions. The Ebola epidemic is not likely to end soon, nor will it be the last infectious virus of global importance.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary \r\n\r\nThis primary goal of this project is the immediate collection of perishable data on seven important social groups in five countries that are significant for the recent epidemic in West Africa. The data will be used to contribute to our understanding of networked knowledge, transmission mechanisms for both disease and information, and perceptions of risk and acceptable actions in response to the recent emergence of the virus in West Africa and the United States. The research team will collect qualitative baseline information on seven groups consisting of approximately 300 interviews. The interviewees are to be selected for their importance to for providing insights about the transmission and treatment of disease, and of information about the disease. They include medical professionals, teachers, youth, the informal sector, and the unemployed. The data will be collected in three African locations (Ghana, Guinea, and Mali) including rural communities, and in two US locations (Baton Rouge, LA, and Minneapolis, MN)",

The health belief model (HBM) links perceptions of disease to changes in behavior. Perceptions of disease (i.e., perceived seriousness, susceptibility, and threat) shape perceived barriers and benefits to action, which in turn shape behavior.  While it is a given that these perceptions are important to understand behavior regarding health and support for various treatments and actions, it is crucial to understand how these perceptions are generated.  Our study demonstrates how individuals construct and modify their perceptions given information from a wide variety of sources and their network of interactions with friends and family.\n\nAlthough details of the Ebola outbreak were reported and debated through both national and global media channels, individual level engagement with these reports varied widely.  Our interviews contribute not only to our understanding about how people make sense of Ebola from diverse social positions, but also whether these understandings in at-risk contexts represent some kind of fundamental change from their prior assumptions about of infectious diseases. In this way, our data help us to answer important questions with important policy implications including: do evolving understandings lead to support for policy actions involving travel and quarantine or changes in practices such as handshaking and washing of the deceased?  For example, did the way people made sense of Ebola in the United States influence their views about whether or not travelers from West African nations should be banned or placed in 21-day quarantine?  Did understandings of the illness lead people to reflect upon their own practices with respect to home care and funerals?  If perceptions and practices did change, was this the result of specific media events or local narrative circulation?  One of our research sites&mdash;Minneapolis&mdash;allows us to examine the ways in which an affected community (Liberians) in the U.S. acquires information and makes decisions about the integration of family and friends from affected areas.  Do they understand risks, treatment, and policies in different ways than non-immigrant populations in Africa and the U.S.?\n\nIn terms of broader impacts associated with the use of these funds the primary impact has been in terms of graduate student training.  Several graduate students were trained in open-ended, informal interviewing techniques. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wesley M Shrum"
