 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Environmental Chemical Sciences Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Matthew Tarr of the University of New Orleans is developing new methods to understand how oil spilled in ocean environments is transformed by sunlight.  Such methods help identify the chemicals formed when crude oil is subjected to photochemical changes in the environment.  The nature and behavior of these products are important in oil spill remediation.  The project involves collaboration with the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.  In addition, the project trains young scientists through direct involvement of high school students, high school teachers, and undergraduate students.\r\n \r\nThis project identifies the types of compounds formed when crude oil is exposed to sunlight and investigates structures of photoproducts present in the gas phase, the aqueous phase, and the oil phase.  The project utilizes fractionation methods, chromatography, and derivatization to assess the functional groups present in photoproducts.  The study also utilizes a wide range of analytical tools, including gas chromatography, liquid chromatography, fluorescence spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry (including GC-MS, LC-MS, electrospray MS, and high resolution electrospray FTICR-MS) in order to gain a complete picture of oil photochemistry.  The results of this project will be important for understanding the fate of spilled oil and improving predictive models for oil spill remediation.  Additional broader impacts include training of future scientists and exposing teachers to environmental research.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to gain knowledge of the specific chemical structures that are formed when petroleum is exposed to sunlight under environmental conditions.  Through the combined use of chemical fractionation, chromatography, and mass spectrometry, we have developed the first clear documentation of structures of oil photoproducts.  The project also provided training for graduate students as well as research experiences for undergraduates and high school students and teachers.\n\nThe major scientific achievements of this project are listed below.\n\n1)    We developed tools to identify aldehyde and ketone products formed due to the action of sunlight on crude oil.  These tools have allowed us to determine the rate of formation of these products, the presence of other oxygen functional groups in the products, and the impact of temperature on their formation.\n\n2)    We developed a method to analyze aqueous carboxylic acid photoproducts from crude oil exposed to sunlight.  This method uses barium to isolate the carboxylic acids from the complex mixture of oil and oil photoproducts so that the compounds of interest can be observed without complicated separation tools.\n\n3)    We verified that phenol containing molecules are present as photoproducts from crude oil exposed to sunlight.\n\n4)    We failed to observed amine containing photoproducts from crude oil exposed to sunlight, suggesting that such products occur in very low amounts if at all.\n\n5)    We adapted tools for determining emulsion capacity to crude oil samples that had been exposed to sunlight.  Methods were refined in order to better understand the processes by which sunlight generates emulsion capacity in oils.  Multiple oils were studied, and it was determined that as little as one hour of exposure to sunlight was sufficient to generate emulsifying photoproducts.  Further study determined that the majority of these emulsifying photoproducts remained in the oil phase and little if any of them moved into the aqueous phase.  Strong evidence was collected to indicate that these emulsifying compounds were carboxylic acids with substantial non-polar character.\n\nThe results of this project have provided a much clearer understanding of the types of molecules formed when crude oil is exposed to sunlight in aquatic systems.  In addition, the data collected reveal the time-dependence and temperature-dependence of the photochemical processes.  Studies on light-driven emulsification provide new details of the behavior of oil spilled in aquatic systems that will help guide spill response.  The project has also provided important new directions of study, including determination of carboxylic acid emulsifying agents that are produced by crude oil upon solar exposure and classes of compounds present in photoproducts that need to be further studied to determine their toxic and genotoxic impacts on organisms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew A Tarr"
