The format of the meeting is a combination of talks and posters, which will promote scientific exchange in both formal and informal settings.  There will be ample opportunity for sharing latest research results and for exploring collaborative possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe field of RNA silencing is fast-moving and many new developments have arisen since the last conference on this topic was held in 2010.  This conference will present the latest research in this area through sessions that include:  small RNA biogenesis and stability, RNA silencing and germ cell fate, RNA-dependent chromatin modification, transcriptional epigenetic inheritance, chromosomal RNA silencing, RNA signaling, DNA methylation and demethylation, and novel biological functions of noncoding RNA.  The conference will be forward-looking with many potential applications in plant breeding and biotechnology.",

The meeting organizers were two leading experts in the field, Drs. Robert Martienssen and Craig Pikaard.  The meeting gathered leaders in the field of RNA silencing from around the world with the specific goal of exploring these emerging new functions, and relating them to what is known about existing mechanisms.  This conference explored their implications for real-world problems in plant biotechnology, plant breeding, genetic modification and plant defense for solutions in sustainable agriculture and bioenergy.  The specific aims were:\n\nAim 1: To understand how noncoding RNAs are generated from specific loci, and are amplified, stabilized or degraded to control their abundance or functions.\n\nAim 2: To understand how noncoding RNAs target specific genomic loci and specify regions of chromatin modification.\n\nAim 3: To understand the relative roles of small RNAs and the Argonaute proteins that bind the small RNAs in RNA-mediated silencing processes.\n\nAim 4: To explore new biological functions of noncoding RNAs and methods that are providing new insights.\n\nAim 5: To provide a forum for junior faculty members, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students to share their work with other experts and trainees interested in RNA silencing in plants.\n\n     The program developed by Drs. Martienssen and Pikaard was designed to combine classical mechanisms of RNA silencing with the most recently discovered biological consequences of these same mechanisms for gene regulation, transposon and virus control, and cell fate specification.  Plenary sessions addressed key challenges in the field and stimulated new thinking especially in the biological significance of the mechanisms that have been uncovered in recent years.  The latest advances in our understanding of the roles for RNA silencing in cells, the molecular mechanisms that underlie these processes, as well as their applications, were presented by leading scientists in the field during this meeting.    \n\n     This meeting brought together an international community of researchers, scholars, and graduate and postdoctoral trainees to share new insights and discoveries focused on the roles of multiple classes of long and short noncoding RNAs in transposon taming, genome organization and stability, DNA and histone modifications, development and epigenetic inheritance.  Collectively, the symposium explored the surprising ways in which RNAs, rather than proteins, mediate critical biological regulatory mechanisms, which is revolutionizing our thinking of how an organism\u00c6s genotype can specify alternative phenotypes. \n\n     There were 173 total attendees at the meeting.  Attendees at this meeting were diverse with regard to gender, ethnicity, stage of career, and institutional affiliation.  More specifically, 34% of the meeting participants were female researchers, and ~2% of attendees who were US citizens or permanent residents self-identified as scientists from under-represented minority groups.  The meeting was highly international, drawing 72% non-US attendees.  Approximately 56% of attendees were students and postdoctoral fellows.  The meeting provided ample opportunity for training and professional development.  Trainees and newer investigators were exposed to dozens of high-quality oral presentations by more senior investigators, who served as models for high-quality research and communication skills.  Plenary sessions also included short talks drawn from submitted abstracts, and the majority of these presenters were given by students, postdoctoral trainees and newer investigators (e.g., Andrea McCue and Molly Megraw).  In addition, three poster sessions also provided a venue for trainees and newer investigators to share their research and to discuss this research with more experienced investigators.  Finally, the unstructured portions of the meetings and the retre..."
