 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will examine the complex and sometimes contradictory contributions of examines urban agriculture to urban sustainability efforts as well as the role of policy and regulation in these processes. Widely celebrated as a key component of the \"sustainable city,\" urban agriculture has enjoyed growing popularity in recent years, with new municipal policies following suit.  Debates among different groups have called into question issues related to the equity of access, social justice, and possible developmental by-products of gardening activity.  This project will provide new information and insights regarding the immediate concerns of food systems planners, policymakers, and practitioners concerned with urban food access and food system resilience.  The project will expand knowledge about the multiple motivations and forms of urban agriculture as well as how these differ across race, class, and gender lines.  More broadly, project findings will enhance understanding in urban geography by emphasizing the complex relational processes that interact to shape cities.  By examining how urban agriculture differs within and among cities and among diverse cultural or socioeconomic groups, this project will facilitate the development of more inclusive food policies that are better tailored to the needs of low-income, underrepresented populations.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will use geospatial analysis, a mail survey, focus groups, in-depth interviews, participant observation, and document analysis to answer sets of research questions:  (1) How do various forms of urban agriculture, the motivations of urban agriculturalists, and engagement with urban agriculture advocacy and food policy making differ within and among cities?  (2) How have the institutionalization and implementation of municipal food policies contributed to and/or perpetuated the uneven social and spatial distribution of urban agriculture?  (3) How have cities learned and borrowed food policy models from each other, and how have these policies opened and/or closed spaces for political engagement?  The investigators will examine urban agriculture as a social and spatial phenomenon that both fosters and contests processes of urbanization.  They will conduct a comparative study of urban agriculture and related processes in Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, British Columbia, but project findings will have implications for many other cities in North America and elsewhere.",

This comparative research project focused on food production in residential yards, community gardens, and larger, market-oriented urban farms in Portland, Oregon, USA and Vancouver, BC, Canada. We examined: 1) the various motivations that led gardeners and farmers to work urban land, their expectations and challenges, and how their motivations and practices differed between different socio-economic and racial/ethnic groups, and in different neighborhoods; 2) the response of policymakers and developers to urban agriculture and the impact of formal policy and regulation on urban agriculturalists; and 3) the inclusions and exclusions that define urban agriculture and how groups navigate these and create new agricultural spaces focused more explicitly on equity and justice. Political elites in Portland and Vancouver define their cities as 'green' and 'sustainable', a vision expressed in policy and marketing documents, and have supported urban agriculture in various ways that help advance their sustainability agendas and strengthening their branding. For example, farms and community gardens are permitted and incentivized to locate on vacant properties awaiting development, while developers also incorporate rooftop gardens, small planter boxes, etc. into development projects to appeal to more affluent buyers interested in green amenities. Many people growing food in both cities share these environmental concerns, particularly among affluent residents with higher levels of formal education, but some have mixed feelings about new municipal regulations related to urban agriculture. There is also the desire to create more inclusive urban agriculture spaces and practices that move beyond sustainability as a framework, in order to address exclusions based on race and ethnicity. Black urban farmers in Portland, for example, have created their own models of food production that speak to issues of food sovereignty, while Chinese gardeners in Vancouver are being increasingly recognized for their contributions to the local food production. These efforts create much needed inclusive spaces within the wider urban foodscape of both cities.</p>\n<p>Through the mapping and spatial analysis of 4,324 home gardens in four neighborhoods in each city; a mail survey of 1,065 home gardeners; an internet survey of 133 community gardeners; interviews with 63 policymakers, organization staff, and practitioners; focus groups with seven urban farmers and 17 community gardeners; and a review of municipal documents and online media this project developed a clearer understanding of the contemporary political economy of urban agriculture, how it is governed, and its relationship to sustainability and gentrification. Our results provide urban studies, critical food studies, and food systems planning literatures with a more nuanced, spatialized understanding of urban agriculture and its multiple motivations and forms, with particular attention to how these differ across race, class, and gender lines. Outcomes of the project include academic presentations and publications, training of research personnel, and public dissemination. Publication of results in academic forums is ongoing. So far, two book chapters and two journal articles have been produced and a number of other journal submissions are in preparation. Moreover, two reports have also been written describing the character of residential urban agriculture and community gardens in the two cities. These works are based on numerous academic conference presentations across a range of relevant fields, including geography, urban studies, food studies. Presentations were also given at a number of academic departments in the US, Canada, and the EU. In addition to two faculty PIs and one senior personnel, researchers included graduate and undergraduate students. Two PhD students, two Master?s students, and an undergraduate benefited from training in a wide range of research techniques, including: data collection (GIS, mail and internet surveys, interviews, focus groups); analysis (using JMP, ArcGIS, MAXQDA); and presentation (reports, maps, article manuscripts). Public dissemination of project findings has included blog entries, radio, and news media interviews.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/23/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Nathan&nbsp;Mcclintock</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539750/1539750_10385938_1595537780521_IJURR_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539750/1539750_10385938_1595537780521_IJURR_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Simpson Street Farm, Portland\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539750/1539750_10385938_1595537780521_IJURR_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Simpson Street Farm, Portland\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Simpson Street Farm, Portland, Oregon</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nathan McClintock</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nathan&nbsp;Mcclintock</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Simpson Street Farm, Portland</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539750/1539750_10385938_1595537075709_pdx_stddev_COMBINED_sm--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539750/1539750_10385938_1595537075709_pdx_stddev_COMBINED_sm--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"PDX_stdev\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539750/1539750_10385938_1595537075709_pdx_stddev_COMBINED_sm--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"PDX_stdev\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Relative concentration of gardens in four Portland neighborhoods</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dillon Mahmoudi & Nathan McClintock</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nathan&nbsp;Mcclintock</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">PDX_stdev</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539750/1539750_10385938_1595537198632_van_stddev_COMBINED_sm--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539750/1539750_10385938_1595537198632_van_stddev_COMBINED_sm--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Vancouver Standard Deviation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539750/1539750_10385938_1595537198632_van_stddev_COMBINED_sm--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Vancouver Standard Deviation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Relative concentration of residential gardens in four Vancouver neighborhoods</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dillon Mahmoudi & Nathan McClintock</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nathan&nbsp;Mcclintock</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Vancouver Standard Deviation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539750/1539750_10385938_1595536811614_McClintock_Miewald_McCann_photo2_sm--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539750/1539750_10385938_1595536811614_McClintock_Miewald_McCann_photo2_sm--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sole Food Farms, Vancouver\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539750/1539750_10385938_1595536811614_McClintock_Miewald_McCann_photo2_sm--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sole Food Farms, Vancouver\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sole Food Farms, Vancouver, BC</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nathan McClintock</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nathan&nbsp;Mcclintock</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Sole Food Farms, Vancouver</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539750/1539750_10385938_1595538530958_NSF_RQs--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539750/1539750_10385938_1595538530958_NSF_RQs--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Research Questions\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1539750/1539750_10385938_1595538530958_NSF_RQs--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Research Questions\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Three research questions</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Nathan McClintock</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Nathan&nbsp;Mcclintock</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Research Questions</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
