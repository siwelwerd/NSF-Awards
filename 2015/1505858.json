 "awd_abstract_narration": "Embedded deep in the ice cap at the South Pole, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) is the world's largest and most sensitive high energy neutrino telescope. It is a 1 billion-ton detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena.\r\n\r\nThis award enables the group to address the development of a globally competitive STEM workforce; increased participation of women and minorities; improved teacher development; improved undergraduate education; increased public scientific literacy; and public well-being. The work has valuable spin-offs from the research, including reactor flux studies relevant to reactor monitoring and the cyclotron development relevant to medical isotope production. \r\n\r\nThe group is motivated by searches for new physics manifested in the neutrino sector. \"New physics\" means a step beyond the discoveries of neutrino mass and three-active-flavor mixing, which are well established. Introducing sterile neutrinos extends the number of mass states and expands the mixing matrix. This can lead to oscillations with squared mass splittings that are anomalously large. The group will pursue this question in two projects, the ongoing IceCube experiment and the future IsoDAR experiment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported the Particle-Astrophysics (PA)-related research of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Neutrino Group, headed by Prof. Janet Conrad. The group?s research focused on beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) searches in the neutrino sector, and especially sterile neutrino searches.  \n\nThis grant has supported three types of experiments:\n\n1)  IceCube, and its proposed follow-on, Gen2.\n\n2)  IsoDAR, and experiment DAEdALUS.\n\n3)  \"Table top\" Particle Physics Experiments which are under development by our group, especially ABRACADABRA.\n\nOn the IceCube experiment, we highlight three results that demonstrate the creativity and impact of the MIT group.   First, we highlight the IceCube 2016 Physical Review Letter paper (PRL 117 (2016) no.7, 071801) that presented the  IceCube muon-neutrino-flavor one-year disappearance limit, which now has 194 citations.  This important work set the stage for most of the rest of our analysis work on IceCube during this grant period.       Second is our 2017 analysis on Lorentz violation (LV), published in Nature Physics.    This analysis set important limits on higher dimensional operators of the Standard Model Extension (SME) that describes Lorentz violation.    This paper was chosen to be highlighted in a Nature blog.   Our third example is Arguelles' \"Postdoc Paper\"  on new limits on dark matter-neutrino interactions, published in Physical Review Letters.  We note this, because this creative idea has set better limits than cosmology for neutrino interactions with dark matter particle masses from 1 to 100 MeV.    However, we also use this to highlight ?Postdoc Papers?  that have the postdoc as the most senior author and allow the postdocs in our group independence and leadership.   Papers 2 and 3 build on new ideas developed by our group.   These types of searches had not been proposed before.\n\nOn IsoDAR we highlight three major successes in the previous 3 years: 1) construction of the highest intensity H_2^+ ion source existing. This will feed an RFQ, funded through an NSF MRI, allowing injection into a 60 MeV, 5 mA H_2^+ cyclotron.   2) Publication of  the Conceptual Design Report (CDR) for IsoDAR at KamLAND.   This is our first extensive site-specific installation report.  However, we are exploring installation at other large detectors such as JUNO, and other sites such as Kimballton Underground Research Laboratory.   However, our biggest success on IsoDAR is 3) the establishment of a credible design for the high intensity cyclotron.      This required a mix of solutions.  First, we select H_2^+ to circulate, which reduces space charge effects because there is 1 total charge for every 2 protons and allows high intensity extraction with minimal losses through use of stripping foils.   Second, we introduced more efficient bunching using the RFQ discussed above.   Third, we discovered how to leverge the space charge effects to induce \"vortex motion\" which produces a very tight emittance during acceleration.  The combination of these three effects are what allows for the breakthrough in intensity\n\nOur contribution to ABRACADABRA was to the magnet design.  This is an axion search with a unique design that is just beginning to bring out results.\n\nOur work led to many broader impacts that are discussed in the final report.  Here we highlight two examples.  \n\nOur principle result with high impact on development of human resources is the CosmicWatch detector.   This is a $100 project for high school students, teachers, and undergraduates.  We have coached more than 500 individuals on this project directly, and reached many more through feature stories in the press and on YouTube.  Each detector takes a novice approximately four hours to build for the first time; a second detector can be built in about an hour.   CosmicWatch has a detailed website to help students with the construction, along with four YouTube instructional videos.    The Practical Engineering YouTube Channel has also featured step-by-step instructions in a video that has &gt;100,000 views. Our website provides parts-lists.  \n\nOur principle example of high impact through technology transfer is the use of the IsoDAR cyclotron to manufacture two important isotopes:   68Ga and 225Ac.   Based on their suggestion, we developed a paper on production capabilities that was published in Nature Physics Review.68Ge is the parent of the PET imaging isotope 68Ga. 68Ge has a 270 day half-life, making it ideal for  storage and delivery, with the 68Ga extracted at the hospital.  225Ac is a valuable alpha-emitter for cancer therapy.   We have found that  our 60 MeV protons can impinge on a natural thorium target to produce,  in a dedicated machine, 20 doses per hour!    This is 1000 times the present world-wide production rate.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Janet M Conrad"
