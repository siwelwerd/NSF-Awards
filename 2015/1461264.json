 "awd_abstract_narration": "Student participants in the Marquette University (MU) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site, \"Computation Across the Disciplines,\" form a research cohort for a 10-week summer program designed to tackle a variety of interdisciplinary, open research questions.  Each student works closely with a faculty mentor in MU's Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science (MSCS) department to design research goals and milestones matched to their shared interests and aspirations.\r\n\r\nMU's REU site focuses on recruiting talented undergraduates who are uncertain about future graduate studies, with little or no research opportunity at their home institution.  Working on different problems with diverse backgrounds, participants nevertheless can witness firsthand the commonalities of foundational research techniques across a wide spectrum of computational areas.  MSCS REU participants may develop tools for managing high-performance computing infrastructure, model oceanographic and volcanic fluid flows, build novel embedded computer systems, analyze the impact of species loss in a complex ecological food web, discover biologically important pathways for gene regulation, or help predict natural gas flow through commercial distribution networks to reduce everyone's utility bills.  Throughout, participants build essential research skills, such as problem solving, technical reading and writing, tool support, research poster construction, and oral presentation.  MSCS faculty mentor expertise spans high performance computing, mathematical models and simulations, data assimilation, and embedded, mobile and ubiquitous systems, as well as math and computer science education.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAcross the four years of this program, 63 undergraduates from around the U.S. came to Marquette University to spend 10 weeks of their summer engaged in full-time research with a faculty mentor.\n\nThe purpose of our Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site is to increase student confidence in their ability to carry out a computational research project in their field.  Students learn to apply abstract concepts learned in the classroom to actual applications, and demonstrate competence in verbal and written communication of research findings and experience to diverse audiences.  Ultimately, the project goal is to better prepare undergraduates for advanced studies in computing disciplines, and to increase the size and diversity of the pipeline of students undertaking such studies.\n\nThe survey data collected from program participants over the past four years provide evidence that most of the students who completed projects as part of the Marquette REU developed their research skills, gained confidence as researchers, built a better understanding of what graduate school and a research career would entail, and were inspired to continue their studies as graduate students (either immediately after undergraduate studies or after first gaining work experience). These positive perspectives of the program were consistent among both recent program graduates and graduates from years past.

Projects undertaken by the REU students have the potential to lower energy bills for consumers; to improve data science tools used for forecasting and allocating municipal resources, such as water and police presence; to identify residential properties that contribute disproportionately to neighborhood decay; to detect security breaches in social robots; to encourage high school students from traditionally underrepresented groups to study computer science; to improve medical device safety; and to help identify the genetic causes of certain kinds of malignant brain cancers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/08/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dennis Brylow"
