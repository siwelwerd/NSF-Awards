 "awd_abstract_narration": "Mobile advertising is a large and quickly growing market, driven by the movement of viewing traffic and advertising dollars from other media to mobile. In 2014, mobile worldwide ad spending is about $40 billion and it's expected to top nearly $200 billion in 2019. Among all the hundreds of thousands of app developers operating today, 90% of which offer free apps that create revenues through \"in-app\" advertising: they get paid when a user clicks on an ad embedded in their apps. Nowadays, these app developers have to play banner ad in their apps, which is a small-sized ad form that usually runs at the bottom of the screen, attracting littler user attention\r\nand thus reducing developers' revenues. The proposed technology \"AdsProphet\" is a novel mobile ads library that is based on the observation that when user using apps, a lot of time has been wasted on waiting for the app to load remote data and such 'freezing time' has not been fully taken advantage of. AdsProphet can find these valuable windows and displays full-screen ads, which attracts user attention 25 times higher than what banner ads can achieve. This I-Corps team assumes app developers can use AdsProphet to display full-screen ads at a rate of 10% of banner ads, then AdsProphet is expected to double developers' revenue without affecting user experiences.\r\n\r\nThe key technique behind AdsProphet is a novel real-time user-perceived delay prediction system on mobile device. It's challenging to propose such a system: first, during each networking delay,only a portion of it is user-perceived delay when user can do nothing but to wait. There is no built-in event for it in any systems. This I-Corps team proposes a novel approach that is able to intelligently\r\ndetect user-perceived delay by combing techniques of network behavior manipulation, image similarity comparison algorithms and user behavior model. Second, the networking condition varies dramatically and frequently on a mobile device: users move their phones from place to place and connect to different networks such as WIFI or cellular network all the time. Moreover, the prediction process must decide whether or not to play ads in real-time; otherwise, it wastes the time to play full-screen ads and affect developers? revenues. The team first proposes an approach to predict user-perceived delay by designing a novel algorithm to efficiently estimate bandwidth as\r\nwell as round trip time to target servers, both of which serve as the most essential indicators of current networking condition. Then, to further accelerate the proposed prediction system, the team proposes a networking history model based on user's history.",

We begin with a systematic methodology to discover ad networks from our dataset. We have identified a total of 201 ad networks in our datasets. To the best of our knowledge, no earlier work has identified this many ad networks.\n During the investigation of large amount of ads and ad networks, we found that most ads are banners, and none of them make use of fragmented user time.  This motivated us to design a delay-aware full screen ad system.  Furthermore, our study of existing ad networks and app developers in the ecosystems help us understand the customers for our AdProphet system. \nRegarding potential commercial impact, AdsProphet can potentially double the revenue of mobile app developers who rely on advertising.  Given that mobile app ad revenues were ~20 billion in 2014 US, this could be a ten billion commercial opportunity.  The key to the revenue potential of AdsProphet is that it enables app developers to display full-screen ads, which are rarely used today.  Full-screen ads have a 25x higher Click-Through Rate (CTR) than banner ads (5.7% vs. 0.23%), and are therefore more valuable.  We predict that mobile app developers can use AdsProphet to display full-screen ads at a rate of 10% of banner ads, which would result in a doubling of advertising revenue. \n\nOutcome of this project: we took the complete course to learn about user needs survey and market discovery.

Unfortunately, we found that our Adprophet idea is a \"nice-to-have\" instead of \"must-to-have\".  So we decided to explore other future techniques for commercialization.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Yan Chen"
