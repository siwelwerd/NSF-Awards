 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Claflin University seeks to increase the diversity in the geosciences and geospatial intelligence workforce while congruently offering interdisciplinary and synergistic human-physical geography curricula. A combination of traditional, online, and field based training will be used to provide the foundation in the geosciences for future professionals destined for diverse careers during the first two years, whereas the third year will be allocated to the development of the new course, its approval process, and the planning for its first year implementation as well as to student mentorship.\r\n\r\nThe proposed project's overall goal is to foster, advance, and strengthen interdisciplinary development and applied training in geosciences and geospatial intelligence of a diverse workforce. The goal will be reached by achieving the following cognitive, affective, and behavioral objectives: Cognitive: Students will (a) learn principles and methods for describing both physical and human earth features; (b) decode, comprehend, analyze (quantitatively and qualitatively) and place maps in their proper spatial and chronological contexts; (c) utilize modern technologies to collect web-based and field data and; (d) create and interpret discipline specific maps. Affective: Students will: (a) be sensitive and aware of a map's spatial, chronological, and cultural context to identify possible bias(es) and the ethics behind manipulation intents; (b) value the role of geospatial literacy in today's job market; (c) understand and appreciate the relevance of minority involvement in geospatial decision-making and; (d) have positive feelings toward geoscience and geospatial intelligence careers. Behavioral: Students will: (a) interact with geospatial phenomena in their natural state; (b) apply/incorporate geospatial concepts and skills into their teaching and other chosen career; and (c) utilize acquired know-how for decision-making at the community, national, and maybe international level.",

The current biochemistry and chemistry tracks focus on providing an in-depth knowledge on chemical principles.  The new track focus is to provide a career specific applied chemistry training, in alignment with current university wide career path initiative.  This is a new initiative as most of the current geospatial science program are not STEM based and administered by either geology or geography department.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Uruthira Kalapathy"
