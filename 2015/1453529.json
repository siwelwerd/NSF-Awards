 "awd_abstract_narration": "Proteoglycans are a major part of the biological \"glue\" that holds cells together in many different animals and in people. Proteoglycans also help cells to sense what is going on outside of them. Because proteoglycans are very flexible and difficult to isolate as pure samples, their structure has been difficult to study using regular experiments. Therefore, this project will apply cutting-edge physics-based computer modeling to proteoglycans. As a result, this project will increase the understanding of the normal growth and development of humans and many other animals. During the project, twelve early university students will be exposed to career paths in science, an advanced university student will receive both research and educational training, five elementary school teachers will receive training in modern computer tools for teaching science, and 500 fourth and fifth grade students from a diverse range of ethnicities and socio-economic backgrounds will receive enriched science teaching and interact with university students studying science.\r\n\r\nThe specific scientific goals of the project are to: (1) develop a high-precision public database of the conformational free energies for all carbohydrates found in proteoglycans to facilitate computer modeling; (2) understand the dynamics and thermodynamics of carbohydrate polymers and the non-covalent interactions between pairs of carbohydrate polymers as relevant to proteoglycans; and (3) transform the extracellular proteoglycan biglycan, the membrane-anchored glypican proteoglycan Dally-like, and fragments of the matrix proteoglycans aggrecan and versican into research platforms that reveal how interactions between protein, carbohydrate, ion, and lipid components affect the structure and dynamics, and therefore functions, of proteoglycans. Standard unbiased molecular dynamics simulations and enhanced sampling and free-energy methods including replica exchange molecular dynamics and Adaptive Biasing Force molecular dynamics will be used to meet these scientific goals, thereby contributing to an area where advancement has been hindered because of limitations in experimental approaches.",

Proteoglycans are composed of a combination of protein and carbohydrate parts. The carbohydrate parts, called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), can be large and flexible, which makes them difficult to study using experiments. Therefore, the United States National Academies of Science had stated, \"proteoglycan structure prediction and modeling tools need to be developed.\" Over the course of this grant, we have worked toward meeting this need. To better understand GAG flexibility, we have developed an atomic-resolution database of the conformational preferences for the different small carbohydrate units that make up GAGs (Figure 1), as well as the linkages connecting these units. This database, which we make freely available, can be used to create realistic models of GAGs at atomic resolution. We have also developed a computer program and protocol that uses this database to create such models (Figure 2). Additionally, we have used atomic resolution physics-based computer models to study how pairs of GAGs interact with each other, how the physiological ions sodium and calcium affect these interactions (Figure 3), and how GAGs are connected to proteins to form intact proteoglycans. Taken together, this work advances the scientific understanding of proteoglycans.</p>\n<p>During the project term, we have worked to expose undergraduate students to career paths in scientific research and education, and to deepen the exposure elementary-level students have to the atomic theory of matter. Participating undergraduate students have gone on to careers or advanced education in scientific disciplines ranging from computer programming to chemistry. In addition to contributing to the scientific component of the grant described above, participating undergraduate students developed educational materials for and taught elementary school students from a wide range of ethnicities and socio-economic backgrounds in a state that receives markedly less-than-average NSF funding per capita. Over the course of the grant, 18 college and post-college level students contributed to this elementary school outreach and directly interacted with hundreds of 4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> grade elementary students and their teachers. We were able to teach these elementary students to use a molecular visualization computer app to better understand how it is that atoms make up everything in our world, including our own selves. We also developed a polished set of lesson plans for elementary school teachers and a full color Science Notebook for elementary school students (Figure 4) on the topic of the atomic theory of matter. These educational materials, along with surveys we developed to measure elementary student learning of this material, are freely available in digital format from a central archive at our university.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Olgun&nbsp;Guvench</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1453529/1453529_10358232_1630260963206_fig1_ijms_4c--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1453529/1453529_10358232_1630260963206_fig1_ijms_4c--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1453529/1453529_10358232_1630260963206_fig1_ijms_4c--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A glycosaminoglycan (long molecule in black-and-white) is composed of smaller carbohydrate units called monosaccharides (shown enlarged in color).
