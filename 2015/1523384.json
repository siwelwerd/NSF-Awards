ACSAC has carved a unique role as a security conference equally attended by academia, industry, and government. In addition to the technical papers, the conference program will include keynotes by distinguished speakers, tutorials, case studies, panels, a poster session, and works-in-progress talks. This project will support attendance by students, with particular attention given to those have a paper, poster, or works-in-progress submission accepted at the conference. In so doing, it will help to provide cybersecurity students with a broad perspective of the discipline.",
