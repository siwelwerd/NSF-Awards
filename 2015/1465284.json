 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Val Vullev of the Departments of Bioengineering, Chemistry, and Biochemistry, and of the Materials Science and Engineering Program at the University of California, Riverside will develop a class of bio-inspired electrets with strong dipoles (electrets are the electric analogues of magnets) and study how they mediate charge transfer.  The research could potentially improve the performance of solar cells, energy-storage devices and organic electronics. This project lies at the interface of physical organic chemistry and bio-inspired molecular engineering. Therefore, it provides a solid foundation for outreach, recruitment, education and retention of diverse cohorts of students with a wide range of interests in science and engineering. The project also has an outreach component directed at students currently underrepresented in science and engineering.  \r\n\r\nThe majority of studies investigating the dependence of charge-transfer (CT) kinetics on the orientation of dipoles use protein helices. Such protein structures, however, mediate CT via electron tunneling, which limits the distance of efficient CT. This project focuses on a new class of dipolar molecular structures, based on anthranilamides, that similar to protein helices have ordered amide and hydrogen bonds resulting in large electric dipole moments. Unlike proteins, however, the anthranilamides have extended pi-conjugation along their backbones, which is expected to provide pathways for long-range CT.  In this project, a diverse range of anthranilamide molecular electrets will be developed to answer the following questions: 1) By tuning the CT mechanism from tunneling to hopping, can the range of charge transfer be significantly extended?  2) How will changing the mechanism from tunneling to hopping affect CT rectification of forward charge migration and the undesired charge recombination? 3) How the dipole-generated fields affect charge trapping along CT pathways?",

Charge transfer (CT) is among the most important processes responsible for sustaining life on Earth (via photosynthesis and cellular respiration) and making our modern ways of living possible (via technological advances in electronics, photonics and energy conversion). Therefore, the significance of understanding and controlling CT cannot be overstated. Concurrently, electric dipoles are everywhere and they present an excellent paradigm for controlling and guiding CT. While the ideas about how dipoles affect CT have evolved since the 1960s, the first experimental evidence for such effects were reported in the 1990s. Since then, the field has grown in different directions, impacting physical sciences, life sciences, energy science and electronics. In 2018, under this project, we published the first review on dipole effects on charge transfer and charge transport (<em>Can. J. Chem.</em> <strong>2018</strong>,<em> 96</em>, 843-858) where we introduce the state of the art of the fundamental concepts and relate them to the advances in this subject from chemistry, biology, physics and engineering. Due to its importance, our publication was selected to feature as a front cover of the journal (Figure 1a).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit. Despite its impacts, the field of dipole-modulated CT has not evolved with rates reflecting its significance. A number of publications on this subject report small and even no dipole effects on CT, which contradicts the expectations. Conjugates with large dipole moments, such as electrets, are essential for investigating such effects on CT. (Electrets are systems with ordered dipole moments, i.e., they are the electrostatic analogues of magnets.) Electrets have to be insulators because any free charge carriers will cancel the dipole-generated fields. At the same time, the electrets have to efficiently mediate CT, which has been the principal challenge in the field since synthetic protein helices (some of the best known molecular electrets) have been regularly used for dipole sources.</p>\n<p>1) Under this project, we developed molecular electrets that have large dipoles, and can efficiently mediate long-range CT. They are polypeptides of aromatic residues (Figure 2), and allow the implementation of proteomic approaches to development of systems with diverse electronic properties, a principal novelty of this project.</p>\n<p>2) Using these electret derivatives allowed us to demonstrate for the first time what is required to harness the dipole effects on CT that are inherently enormous. This breakthrough is THE MOST IMPORTANT OUTCOME OF THIS PROJECT setting transformative paradigms for reshaping the way we think of how dipoles affect CT. We reported these results in 2018 (<em>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.</em> <strong>2018</strong>, <em>57</em>, 12365-12369), and due to their importance, the publication was selected for a ?Hot Paper? and to feature on the front cover of the journal (Figure 1b). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3) In addition to the dipole effects, under this project we discovered new modes for controlling CT that can slow down undesired charge recombination without affecting photoinduced charge separation (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2016, 138, 12826-12832), which is of outmost significance for energy conversion and other fields of science and engineering.</p>\n<p>4) Designing new pigments for light-induced initiation of CT is key for this project. A number of these new dyes manifest properties with significant importance and have been featured as a journal cover (Figure 3a).</p>\n<p>5) Taking something relatively accessible, such as vitamin B12, and derivatizing it for covalent attachment to CT systems will have transformative impacts on many different fields, as evident from selecting our publication describing this work to feature as a frontispiece (Figure 3b) &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts. This project has established fundamental principles about dipole effects on charge transfer that will have transformative impacts on energy science, electronics and photonics. Concurrently, the cross-disciplinary nature of this project proved truly important for recruiting and training students, preparing them for a diverse set of professional career paths.</p>\n<p>1) Under this project, three students of underrepresented-minority descents (one of whom was a female) obtained their Ph.D. degrees. Currently, one of them is a research scientist in Caltech, the other one is a postdoc in Berkeley, and the third one is a senior research scientist in a biotech company.</p>\n<p>2) The charge-transfer theme of this project, along with its broad set of applications, allowed the recruitment of other three graduate students who are currently pursuing their Ph.D. degrees. One of them was awarded an NSF GRFP Fellowship.</p>\n<p>3) This project served as an excellent platform to attract four Ph.D. students from institutions in Europe and South America to pursue international internships in the PI?s group. In addition to the scientific contributions, these students in the lab contributed to important cultural exchanges for everyone. All four students have successfully obtained their Ph.D. degrees and one of them is already a junior faculty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4) Under this project we recruited and provided research training to eight female undergraduate students.
