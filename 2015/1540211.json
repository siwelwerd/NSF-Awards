Specifically, the funds will provide assistance to 30 students from U.S. universities for registration fees and travel related expenses as administered through the Kokes Travel Award program sponsored by the NACS.  The students will present their research at the conference, attend lectures by leaders in the field of catalysis, and provide assistance to the organizers in running the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe biennial NACS meetings are the largest North American meetings dedicated to catalysis.  Student participation helps train young researchers in this vital aspect of science and enginering that supports advances in environmental pollution control, energy utilization, sustainability and greenhouse gas reduction, and competitiveness of the U.S. chemical and petroleum industries.",
