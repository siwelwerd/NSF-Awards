 "awd_abstract_narration": "Columbia College's \"Preparing Students for Careers in Chemistry, Math, and Computing Project\" will provide financial, academic, social support and career preparation to increase the number of students with degrees in chemistry, mathematics, and computer and information science (CIS).  Recruiting efforts will focus on attracting women and minorities to pursue studies that will help to diversify the STEM workforce in South Carolina.  Participants in the program will serve as role models and will inspire middle and high school students to overcome barriers that they may perceive as preventing them from pursuing a STEM major and career.\r\n\r\nThe project will recruit and support an academically talented, diverse group of 20 students with financial need to complete baccalaureate degrees in chemistry, mathematics, or CIS.  The goals of the project are to raise the annual retention rate of these students from 83% to 90% and enable 80% of the participants to enter the STEM workplace or graduate school within one year of degree completion.  Participants will be selected based on academic ability and financial need.  Participants will be grouped in cohorts and participate together in common courses, seminars, field trips, and group dinners that will promote community building.  Participants will be guided by individualized advising teams and be provided with applied learning experiences, professional development, and career coaching.  This project will contribute to the knowledge of how to recruit, retain, and engage women and minorities to major and pursue careers in chemistry, mathematics, and CIS, enabling more students from these underrepresented groups to enter STEM careers.",
