 "awd_abstract_narration": "In an effort to improve an understanding of how computer science (CS) departments can successfully diversify their undergraduate enrollments, this project will support the longitudinal follow-up of students taking introductory CS courses at fifteen (15) universities across the country.  All fifteen CS departments have a stated commitment to diversify their major and are participants in the Building, Recruiting and Inclusion for Diversity (BRAID) initiative.  BRAID institutions have committed to a set of approaches to increase diversity within CS departments, including modifying introductory courses to make them more attractive and less intimidating to underrepresented students.  \r\n\r\nThis research will focus on the ways in which introductory courses promote interest and persistence in CS, with a special focus on what is most successful for women and underrepresented minority students.  Students will be surveyed while taking the introductory course about their experiences in the courses as well as their self-perceptions, perceptions of CS, major choice selection, and career plans. This research will extend a baseline data collection project currently being done into a longitudinal study.  Students from the baseline study will be followed beyond the introductory courses and surveyed annually through the spring semester of the 2018-2019 academic year.  Doing so will allow the research team to assess student experiences beyond the introductory course, such as involvement in CS extracurricular activities, as well as measure a variety of outcomes, such as student enrollment patterns (e.g., choosing CS as a major or minor) and career plans, across time. Findings from this study will provide policy-makers, higher education administrators, faculty, and the general public with new knowledge about the most effective ways to recruit and retain more individuals into the computing field.  Further, this study will provide additional knowledge about how to diversify computing by increasing the number of women and underrepresented minorities who complete CS majors and minors.",

BRAID institutions sought to increase women's and Black, Latinx, and Indigenous (BLI) students' participation in CS by implementing initiatives across four main areas of focus, including modifying introductory courses to make them more attractive to women and BLI students, increasing outreach efforts to high school teachers and students, building confidence and community among women and BLI students, and developing and/or promoting double majors in areas like CS and Biology that may be more attractive to students from marginalized groups.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">The overarching goal of this project was to examine the impact of students' exposure to and participation in departmental best practices on students' decisions to pursue and persist in computing over several years.

Approximately 10,000 unique individuals took one or both of those baseline surveys. Then, we surveyed these students annually for four or five years after completing the course. The project followed both CS majors and non-majors who took an introductory CS course and measured how certain environmental factors, such as the inclusion of real-life problems in introductory courses, participation in computing organizations, or exposure to specific pedagogies, related to outcomes such as completing a CS minor/major or planning to pursue a career in computing.
