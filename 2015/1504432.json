 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project aims at developing and implementing techniques for multivariate, multi-dimensional, and multi-faceted visualizations to support polar climate studies. Specifically, the project will focus on the following objectives. Objective 1: develop a \"PolarGlobe\" virtual earth and map engine with programming interface aided by cutting-edge visualization techniques that will serve as an Arctic research platform. The platform will support virtual scene simulation, volumetric graphics rendering, true terrain rendering, and dynamic scene alternation. Objective 2: A location-aware, cyber-enabled multivariate visualization technique aimed at supporting cross-sectional and longitudinal climate studies. Objective 3: A 2.5D visualization module that realizes seamless service-oriented integration of climate data with true-terrain scenes supported by a highly efficient, high spatial-resolution terrain server. Objective 4: A multi-faceted visualization module for examining complex climate patterns from different perspectives. Objective 5: A general visualization platform to support interactive, intuitive and responsive visualization of polar climate data.  The development of this new polar CI portal visualization technique will serve as an intuitive, interactive and collaborative decision-making platform to uncover the unknown spatiotemporal dynamics in the polar climate and to advance the understanding of regional to global climate complexity. The cyberinfrastructure platform here developed will also serve as a very effective teaching tool for students in climate studies, polar sciences and geographic information science.",

In particular, a novel M-cube technique is developed, that is to enable Multi-dimensional, Multi-variate, and Multi-faceted visualization of space-time big data. A cyberinfrastructure tool called <a href=\"http://cici.lab.asu.edu/polarglobe\">PolarGlobe</a> (http://cici.lab.asu.edu/polarglobe) has also been developed to allow anyone, from climate researchers to everyday weather watchers, to access and visualize climate data. Data in both raster and vector formats and data that are produced in real-time can all be easily and efficiently integrated and visualized in the PolarGlobe platform.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Utilizing cutting-edge streaming and volume rendering technology,&nbsp;PolarGlobe&nbsp;is capable of demonstrating the change in the atmosphere vividly and in real-time. Fundamental challenges in visualization of climate big data, including big data retrieval (Wang, Li et al. 2017), organization (Song, Li et al. 2016), and transfer (Shao and Li 2019), as well as high-performance dynamic rendering (Wang and Li 2019) that hinder the successful integration of visualization into a cyberinfrastructure environment were well addressed. The M-Cube visualization technique has empowered PolarGlobe to support climate studies in both polar regions and at a global scale. It also provides an avenue for widespread sharing and dissemination of scientific results and the generation of new hypotheses and predictions of various climate phenomena and extreme events. PolarGlobe renovates traditional climate visualization tools by removing the dependency for installing dedicated software and putting climate analysis into geographical context by enabling data visualization on a virtual globe.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PolarGlobe serves as an intuitive, interactive and collaborative decision-making platform for uncovering the unknown spatiotemporal dynamics in the polar and global climate. It implements former Vice President Al Gore&rsquo;s vision of a digital earth that enables scientists and citizens across the world to interactively study our planet. It also responds to Climate Action plan by providing a powerful tool that helps uncover the driving factors of extreme weather and climate disasters in the polar regions. This cyberinfrastructure platform also serves as a very effective teaching tool for students in climate studies, polar sciences and geographic information science.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>PolarGlobe has been used to reveal Arctic warming; it has also been used to study the retreating of Greenland&rsquo;s icecap and atmosphere-land interactions by fusing multi-source earth observation data. It was leveraged to track in real-time the development, intensification, and movement of Hurricane Florence which was a Category 4 tropical storm that caused catastrophic damage in the Carolinas in 2018.
