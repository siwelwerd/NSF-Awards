 "awd_abstract_narration": "High performance computing, modeling and visualization continue to impact research providing dynamic processes to view and interact with data to define and analyze problems. The Boise State University CyberInfrastructure (CI) Engineer is the technical ambassador to discern the research projects' needs and leverage centralized university cyberinfrastructure - high-performance computers, high-speed networks and visualization equipment. The CI Engineer enhances research productivity by consulting with faculty on optimal methods, software development, and processes at the beginning of proposals and throughout the research projects. The CI Engineer works with network engineers on the separation of the CI tools into a Science DMZ and programs the Software Defined Networking equipment to speed research data transfers between internal and external data nodes. These contributions by the CI Engineer enable utilization of cyberinfrastructure resources to access, analyze, and visualize the data to achieve advances in scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nThe CI Engineer works to equip a data-science capable workforce, and integrates teaching and research through learning and training. The CI Engineer works directly with graduate and undergraduate students to train and mentor them to gain skills in data management, computational literacy, and parallel computing. To broaden participation in computational sciences, the CI Engineer teams with on- and off-campus research laboratories and key personnel that have a deliberate mission and strong track record of recruiting and involving students underrepresented in science and engineering The CI Engineer broadens research capacity regionally by actively connecting with groups such as the Rocky Mountain Advanced Computer Consortium, Westnet, and XSEDE gatherings.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "This proposal funded the hiring of a campus Cyberinfrastructure Engineer who was responsible for developing, promoting, supporting campus cyberinfrastructure.  The hired  CI Engineer worked in conjunction with a small team of research computing staff to perform the tasks in support of expanding enterprise cyberinfrastructure across the Boise State Campus and in support of a wider regional partnership.\n\nOver the course of the grant award period Jason Watt, the CI Engineer hired through the grant funded had a significant impact on the Boise State University Campus CyberInfrastructure and produced significant outcomes in all areas listed in the both the Intellectual Merit, and Broader Impacts sections of the original proposal.\n\nExtension of CyberInfrastructure:  The campus CI engineer was instrumental in developing and extending a functional Science DMZ for the campus and regional connection with IRON.  Additionally through diligent network testing the CI engineer improved campus to external network traffic for the Idaho Regional Optical Network from 1 Gbps, to 8 Gbps sustained reliable traffic.\nThe CI engineer led and directed development of the campus Science DMZ proejct by reviewing, defining and testing networking components, data transfer nodes, perfSONAR nodes, and MaDDash diagnostics and testing.  Additionally the CI engineer was instrumental in network support that led directly to the completion of a students graduate program.\n\nThe Campus CI engineer acted as regular liason between faculty and campus enterprise infrastructure staff to ensure installed systems met faculty needs.\nThe Campus CI engineer met daily with faculty researchers from across multipl campus colleges, including College of Arts and Sciences and College of Engineering, as well as the College of Health Sciences.  He directly facilitated their utilization of the campus cyberinfrastructure.\nThe Campus CI engineer as the active campus XSEDE champion managed the distribution of XSEDE resources and aided faculty and students in applying for XSEDE resources.\n\n \n\nTo further their professional development and enhance their ability to provide support to campus researchers the CI engineer attend the followign professional development opportunities:\n\nAttended professional conferences and workshops:\n\no PEARC series\no Virtual Residency (ACI-REF related)\no Westnet series regular participation\no ESnet workshop\n\n\nThrough regular contribution to campus Research Days the campus CI engineer trained faculty and staff on how to utilize campus cyberinfrastructure and through direct instruction helped to increase campus CI utilization by five times over the period of the grant.\n\nAddtionally the campus CI engineer has been integral in planning and development of an infrastructure roadmap for CI expansion to include Idaho National Laboratory, Idaho State University and University of Idaho for the next five years.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/06/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven Cutchin"
