 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wolbachia pipientis is a bacterium that infects a large number of insects, including important human disease vectors such as mosquitos.  This bacterium is maternally transmitted and is known to cause a variety of effects in the insect host including manipulation of reproduction and suppression of virus replication.  Because Wolbachia is capable of suppressing virus replication in insect hosts, it is being used to decrease the spread of human diseases (so-called \"pathogen blocking\"). It is critical, therefore, to better understand how Wolbachia infects hosts and alters host cell biology.  Although Wolbachia infect upwards of 40% of insects on the planet, there is surprisingly little known about the exact mechanism used by the bacterium to manipulate its host.  This is largely due to the fact that Wolbachia occurs inside host cells and cannot be genetically manipulated presently.  This project will use a novel approach in this system to identify proteins used by the bacterium to alter host cell biology.  By identifying and characterizing these proteins, much will be learned about the basic biology of Wolbachia and the host cell components utilized during infection. Results will also lead to comparative analyses in other symbiotic systems. Undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in science will be trained with project-based research related to this project on Wolbachia.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overarching scientific goal of this project is to identify the mechanisms by which an extraordinarily widespread bacterium interacts with its host.  Wolbachia pipientis is an intracellular alpha-proteobacterium that forms symbioses with an extremely broad array of invertebrates, including isopods, nematodes, and insects.  Wolbachia is currently of interest with regards to vector control because mosquitoes harboring the bacterium are unable to transmit important human diseases. Because Wolbachia are not currently culturable or genetically tractable, little is known about the molecular basis of interaction with eukaryotic hosts.  Wolbachia encodes a type IV secretion system and is thought to secrete proteins (termed \"effectors\") into the eukaryotic cell to alter the biology of its insect hosts.  This project will use a powerful method to identify and study the biochemical function of probable effectors in Wolbachia.  The investigators will identify candidate effectors through genomics and  bioinformatics.  They will use a yeast genetic screen and a secretion assay in a heterologous system to further identify and characterize these candidates.  Finally, the researchers will investigate the biochemical function and cellular effects of these proteins in the Drosophila host.  These results will be the first comprehensive analysis of Wolbachia secreted substrates and will lead to significant advances in the Wolbachia field and comparative work in other symbiotic strains (such as those infecting filarial nemotodes).",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe studies carry out in this project were desgined to elucidate fundamental principles of endosymbiosis: one organism living within the cell of another organism.  Specifically we examined Wolbachia, a bacteria that resides within the reporductive cells of most insect species on the planet.  We examined how Wolbachia interacts and maniplulates the cytoplasm of these cells.  We discovered that Wolbachia takes advantage of a class of the filaments known as microtubules to move thorughout the reporductive cells.  In addiition, Wolbacia  interacts with a class of motor proteins known as  kinesins to propel it along the microtubules.   Finally we show that Wolbachia must compete with host factors that also rely on kinesins and microtubules for transport.  However we discovered that it has evolved as a weak competitor so as not to outcompete the host factors, else this would result in disruption of key host cellular processes.  We believe this finding will prove to be a general principle of host/endosymbiont interactions:  to use but not abuse the host cellular macinery.  In this way it is efficiently passed from one generation to the next without disrupting host (insect) reproduction.  In addition we identified five candidate proteins that Wolbachia secretes into its host cell ensure its surivival and transmission. \n\nIn accomplishing these studies, our lab engaged and trained a number of undergraduates and URM studies.  Many of these studies have gone on to first rank biology PhD programs throughout the country.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/10/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William T Sullivan"
