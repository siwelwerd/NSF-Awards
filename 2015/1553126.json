 "awd_abstract_narration": "1066658 (Landis). The aim of the proposed research is to identify the optimal disposal options and infrastructure for compostable bio-based polymers based on each of the three pillars of sustainability. To this end, the research team will quantify the life cycle environmental impacts of different disposal options (environment), evaluate organizational (society) and economic barriers (economy), quantify stakeholders? willingness to pay for infrastructure (economy), assess consumers? disposal habits (environment) and evaluate methods to alter disposal habits (society). These factors will be used to quantify the environmental end of life profile for biopolymers and to contribute to the development of compostable biopolymer infrastructure.  The results of the study will contribute to the scientific understanding of infrastructure development for biopolymers, both from the perspective of best management practices, barriers to infrastructure change, and optimal disposal for compostable biopolymers. In addition, the study will result in a comprehensive analysis of consumer disposal habits in the food services industry and will identify optimum disposal scenarios that result in minimum environmental impact while maximizing ease of implementation through stakeholder based life cycle assessment (SBLCA). The research will contribute significantly to advances in methodological development of novel, integrated approaches to assess the tradeoffs and sustainability of a set of alternatives. The results of the project are targeted to aid in the fundamental development and understanding of models that incorporate aspects of human behavior and survey results into life cycle assessment.  The project will contribute to multiple avenues of broader impacts from the proposed collaboration with Sustainable Pittsburgh and local businesses to the PIs? plan for incorporation of the research into curriculum and undergraduate research. Additionally, the PIs are collaborating with Shaler High School and the Carnegie Science Center to create modules that address composting and biopolymers in the environment. The collaboration with Sustainable Pittsburgh will connect local companies to the proposed research. The development of educational materials to be employed during waste audits at local restaurants (e.g. literature and creative methods of sharing information on composting) as well as the development of a Best Practices report and workshop for Sustainable Pittsburgh will provide a unique opportunity for the research to reach a broad range of consumers and business owners",
