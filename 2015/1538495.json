 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coral reefs are amongst the most biodiverse and productive ecosystems in the world, providing millions of dollars of ecosystem services to coastal communities. There is growing concern about the future of coral reefs and the impact of anthropogenic stressors including eutrophication, ocean acidification, warming and sea level rise. However, the lack of knowledge of fundamental coral cellular mechanisms limits our ability to understand and predict responses and to implement appropriate management decisions. This proposal will use a combination of field and laboratory experiments to use immunological techniques to study coral cellular responses to environmental conditions. This project will focus on processes related to calcification, photosynthesis and nutrient uptake and test in nature the relevance of mechanistic models obtained from laboratory experiments. Results from this study could help generate biomarkers for future physiological, ecological and interdisciplinary studies. To maximize the scientific, societal and educational impacts of this research, a coordinated set of activities will include: (1) Training of one graduate student in molecular, cellular, and ecological research. (2) Dissemination of results through journals, conferences and undergraduate and graduate physiology courses. (3) Partnering with the Birch Aquarium at Scripps to build awareness of coral reef biology, ecology and conservation issues and disseminate the findings of this study to the general public. These activities will reach hundreds of thousands of children and adults that attend Birch annually, and millions of viewers through online resources. (4) Engage and train undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities through the Scripps Undergraduate Research Fellowship summer program. \r\n\r\nThis research will use recently developed immunological techniques to localize and quantity proteins in specific coral cell types and determine coral responses to environmental conditions at the cellular level. One enzyme of interest is the vacuolar proton ATPase (VHA), which was recently found in the symbiosome membrane of gastrodermal cells and identified as essential for the coral's symbiotic algae to concentrate CO2 for photosynthesis. Another enzyme, the sodium/potassium ATPase (NKA), was immunolocalized to calicoblastic cells suggesting a role in calcification. Additionally, NKA was found in cells in corals from the Complex but not the Robust clades, suggesting a role in nutrient uptake only in the former. In the project a series of field and manipulative aquarium studies will be used to determine the physiological roles of VHA and NKA in two coral species, one from each clade.  Specifically, this research will: (1) Localize and quantify VHA and NKA in specific tissue layers of Acropora cervicornis and Orbicella annularis from 1 and 5m depth at a lagoonal and an open ocean exposed reef in Bocas del Toro, Panama. (2) Correlate potential differences in VHA and NKA to light, pH, and nutrient levels at the different field sites and depths, to study evolutionary adaptation to environmental conditions. (3) Perform one-year reciprocal transplantations to examine chronic acclimatization. (4) Perform one-month reciprocal transplantations to examine acute acclimatization. (5) In a flowing seawater system expose corals to a range of environmentally relevant nutrient, light and pH levels to determine if any of the single factors are causing changes in the cellular responses. In addition to characterizing responses to environmental conditions on a broad temporal scale from evolutionary, chronic, to acute exposure, this research will examine potential cellular mechanistic differences between Robust and Complex corals. The long-term goal is to generate biomarkers based on specific cellular physiology processes to explain and predict effects of environmental stress (e.g. eutrophication, ocean acidification, and sea level rise) on coral homeostatic responses.",

Uniquely, this project combined <strong>(1)</strong> biochemical and microscopy experiments (to study coral cell physiology in unprecedented detail), <strong>(2)</strong> field and experimental aquarium experiments (to capture the physiology of wild corals and to test the effects of isolated environmental variables), and <strong>(3)</strong> cutting-edge biogeochemical technology (to characterize reef environmental conditions at high temporal and spatial resolution).</p>\n<p><strong>(1)</strong> We focused on two novel cellular mechanisms that had been recently identified in corals through laboratory experiments. The first mechanism relies on \"proton pump\" enzymes in coral gastrodermal cells, and helps control photosynthesis by their symbiotic algae. The second mechanism uses \"sodium/potassium\" pump enzymes in coral calcifying cells, which provide the driving force for skeletal formation. We hypothesized that environmental conditions that are unfavorable for photosynthesis would induce upregulation of proton pump abundance, and that environmental conditions that are unfavorable for calcification would induce upregulation of sodium/potassium pumps. Conversely, favorable conditions would induce downregulation of those enzymes, with the associated benefit of energy savings. Since both enzymes are present in other cell types in addition to gastrodermal and calcifying cells, we used immunohistochemistry, a technique that allows visualizing specific enzymes in specific cells. In addition, we examined aerobic and anaerobic energy production capabilities. In an attempt to identify mechanistic reasons underlying species-specific vulnerability, we studied three coral species: <em>Acropora cervicornis</em>, <em>Orbicella franksi</em>, and <em>Porites astroides</em>. Our analyses have obtained several novel findings. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">One important finding</span> is that, unlike corals grown under optimal aquaria conditions, wild corals display a previously unappreciated heterogeneity in protein expression patterns within a same cell type in different parts of the colony. For example, the VHA expression pattern in wild corals is highly patchy and can be vastly different in groups of cells only a hundred micrometers apart. Similarly, while all calcifying cells from laboratory corals express sodium/potassium pumps at high and similar abundance, their expression pattern in calcifying cells from wild corals is dependent on the position on the coral colony and their distance to seawater. These results indicate coral cell physiology is highly dependent on microenvironment conditions, in addition to \"bulk seawater\" conditions. And while these findings greatly complicate sample analysis and results interpretation, they unveiled an essential aspect of coral cell physiology that needs to be considered in future experiments and in assessments of coral responses to environmental stress.</p>\n<p><strong>(2)</strong> Two field campaigns were conducted during October-November of 2015 and 2016 during which we collected coral samples from an open water reef and a lagoon reef, and from different depths (3, 5, and 8 meters). <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">One important finding</span> was a correlation between VHA abundance in gastrodermal cells and depth, indicating a role in promoting photosynthesis in light-saturating conditions. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Another novel finding</span> was an increased capacity for anaerobic metabolic energy production in <em>P. asteroids </em>from 8m depth, which suggests relatively higher resilience to environmental stress, and to hypoxia in particular. We also brought corals to an experimental aquarium and exposed them to different light, pH/CO<sub>2</sub>, and ammonia levels that were representative of the most extreme conditions found in the wild. The most significant finding was that elevated CO2 levels promoted phostosynthesis in both <em>Porites</em> and <em>Orbicella </em>corals, and that these conditions also resulted in VHA downregulation in gastrodermal cells and reduced oxidative damage, but only in<em> Porites</em>. These results again suggest that <em>Porites</em> will be relatively more resilient (and possibly benefited) by predicted future ocean acidification conditions.</p>\n<p><strong>(3) </strong>While sampling corals from the field, we simultaneously characterized the environmental parameters in each sampling site using an array of pH, salinity, temperature, oxygen, and flow sensors together with discrete water sampling for carbonate chemistry and micro-nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and silica. This allowed us to directly correlate cellular physiology to the actual conditions corals were experiencing at the time of sampling and to better understand the prevalent environmental pressures corals experience at each sampling site.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong> </strong></p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts</strong> This NSF project trained two female PhD students, four Masters students (including two female, one of them Latina), and multiple undergraduate students who participated in field and laboratory activities either as their main thesis topic or as side projects. Results from this project were presented at undergraduate and graduate courses during 2016-2019, as well as at several international scientific venues. Uniquely, this project funded the 2018 public lecture <em>\"Coral doctors: the effects of global climate change on coral reefs?</em>\", which was attended by ~100 people and is available online and has ~25,000 views since June 2018.
