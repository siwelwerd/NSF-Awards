 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators will model the magnetic field in our Milky Way Galaxy.   The Galactic Magnetic Fields (GMF) were found to have much larger scale structures than previously thought. The magnetic field extends far above the Galactic plane, much as the magnetic field of the Earth extends far beyond the Earth's surface. These investigations will precisely determine the structure of the GMF, and better-constrain the distribution of cosmic rays (relativistic electrons and atomic nuclei), which are deflected from straight paths by the magnetic field.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will continue their work with \"WINS\", a program to foster women's participation in science, mentor high school students and expand their public lectures on astronomy.  \r\n\r\nKnowledge of the large scale structure of the GMF and cosmic rays is of fundamental importance for understanding the evolution of galaxies and has implications for understanding the structure and properties of the early universe. It is also of practical importance, for determining how the emission from our galaxy effects Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. This research will build on the groundbreaking work of investigators, who discovered the extended component of the GMF by using two complementary types of available astronomical data, namely 1) Rotation Measures (RMs) of polarized light from distant quasars, and 2) maps of polarized emission from distant clusters of galaxies.\r\n\r\nIn the next phase of work the investigators will: 1) Incorporate the Planck Satellite polarized synchrotron emission maps, which will fill in a critical region. 2) Incorporate much more sophisticated and realistic modeling of the cosmic ray distribution. 3) Take advantage of greater computing power to accurately model the disturbed components of the GMF. Their work will be used by physicists studying Dark Matter, either through annihilation or decay, and for identifying the sources of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays.",

When the project started, the leading model of the GMF was the one developed by the PI and her grad student R. Jansson and published in 2012, known as the Jansson-Farrar (JF12) model.  That model has proved very difficult to improve upon.  It consisted of a 3-component model of the ordered field (spiral disk, twisted poloidal halo field and accompanying \"striated\" component) and an associated model of the spatial variation of the intensity of the random field.  The JF12 model was fit to the all-sky Faraday rotation measures of extragalactic sources, mainly from NVSS, and to WMAP synchrotron maps, using the only models of thermal and cosmic ray electron distributions available at that time.\n\nSince the inception of this grant, the PI has primarily worked with M. Unger (now of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology) on the effort.  The major challenge, which had to be tackled head-on, is that different necessary elements of the analysis must ultimately be determined self-consistently.  This is because the fundamental constraining data are Faraday rotation measures (RM) and synchrotron emission, and these depend not only on the magnetic field but also on the thermal (n_e) and cosmic ray electron (n_cre) distributions &mdash; but the 3D spatial distributions of both n_e and n_cre depend on the GMF, e.g., by affecting their diffusion and cooling as they propagate from their sources.  Thus use of existing models of n_e and n_cre which do not take into account the GMF is erroneous.  Another big challenge is that separating the synchrotron emission component from other foregrounds to the Planck and WMAP data requires understanding the spectrum of the cosmic ray electrons.  While a complete, self-consistent solution of these coupled problems has not yet been achieved, much was accomplished under the grant:  \n\nA new code RUQI was developed to calculate predictions for the constraining observables, for any combination of magnetic field, n_e and n_cre models.  This uncovered a factor-2 bug in Hammurabi, the public code used by Planck and many others for their analyses.  (We informed the developers, so current Planck results use the corrected code.)  RUQI is orders of magnitude faster as well as more accurate than Hammurabi; it will be publicly released when our other projects are all completed.\nA new all-sky map of rotation measures has been developed incorporating newly released RM catalogs and doing a better treatment of 2-pi ambiguities.  This greatly improves the fidelity of the GMF modeling and is valuable to the general astrophysics community.\nBetter thermal electron models have been developed, allowing for a more flexible functional form than previously available and self-consistently fit to the most recent all-sky RM, dispersion measure and emission measure data.  Multiple models incorporating different assumptions about spiral arm structure and n_e fluctuations have been developed to allow better assessment of the systematic uncertainties associated with these components of the analysis. \nBetter 3D models of the cosmic-ray electrons and their energy distribution have been developed, fitting to the latest AMS and Voyager data and taking into account energy-loss due to propagating in the GMF.\nGeneralized functional forms for the coherent part of the GMF were developed, to better describe the spiral arm geometry and impose the constraints due to the intimate relationship between the poloidal and toroidal components of the halo field, and the differential rotation of the Galaxy.\n\n\nNot completed by the end of the grant, but now very close to completion, is the final combined fit to the data incorporating all of the above elements.  An innovative new approach to constraining the coherence length of the random field, allowing for that to vary as a function of position in the Galaxy, has also been developed since the end of the grant.\n\nThese new, very much improved models of the Galactic magnetic field, and of the cosmic ray and thermal electrons will benefit many fields:  searches for cosmological B-modes in the CMB to probe primordial inflation, searches for signatures of the Cosmic Dawn from radio observations of redshifted 21-cm emission, interpreting the gamma-ray excess in the Galactic center in terms of a possible Dark Matter annihilation or decay signature, and the search for sources of Ultrahigh Energy Cosmic Rays (which are deflected in the GMF).  \n\nBroader societal benefits of the project include public lectures by the PI, her participation in workshops for high school women in STEM, giving classes in a NYC girls\u2019 school, sponsoring a summer \"astrophysics collective\" for 5 high school girls, mentoring 3 undergraduate research projects at NYU, training four graduate students at NYU (excluding students not under this grant) and mentoring a Marie Curie Exchange Fellow from the EU.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/19/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Glennys R Farrar"
