Chip-scale optical interconnects, which relies on optics process instead of electrical wires for intra-chip communication, is believed able to overcome all the problems of the existing electrical interconnects and substantially improve the speed of computers. The broad impact of this project to society is obvious given the importance of computers at every aspect of human society. The research component of this project is integrated into multifaceted educational and outreach activities that aim to inspire students (high school, undergraduate, and graduate), underrepresented minorities in particular, to pursue careers in the science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines and aim to enhance the secondary school and university curricula in materials science. In addition to providing research training for students at both undergraduate and graduate levels, the education plan includes mentoring high school students to participate in pre-college scientific competitions and guest lectures in high schools AP chemistry classes.  The proposed research may also provide students with unique opportunities to develop solid expertise that will be valuable for their careers in science and engineering. \r\n\r\nTechnical: This project is to develop electrically pumped nano-lasers with centimeter-scale two-dimensional (2D) MoSe2 monolayers grown on silicon-based substrates.  The 2D materials provide opportunity to break away from the requirement of lattice matching to enable high-quality integration of luminescence materials with silicon for lasing. It can be integrated to substrates with arbitrary lattice mismatch without compromising crystalline quality because the materials may only interact with substrates by weak van der Waals forces, which can substantially relax the requirement of lattice matching.  We will develop techniques that can be used to grow centimeter-scale, high-quality, and uniform MoSe2 monolayers on silicon substrates and will pursue fundamental understanding for the photophysics and lasing dynamics of the synthesized monolayers. By leveraging on the fundamental understanding, we will design a prototype electrically pumped CMOS-compatible 2D MoSe2 lasers with nanoscale footprints.",
