 "awd_abstract_narration": "NSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\nThis Site builds on activities at this institution during the past 5-6 years during which the University of Washington (UW) developed an ecosystem for technology entrepreneurship that provides integrated resources and also uses the business-model canvas as part of the planning around each commercialization opportunity. \r\n\r\nUW will apply I-Corps Site funding to qualified teams for the purpose of initiating and developing specific customer relationships. They will solicit Site teams from three overlapping pipelines of emerging start-ups at the UW: UW Center for Commercialization; the Buerk Center for Entrepreneurship; and the Clean Energy Initiative, with overlapping pipelines of technology start-ups and of student-led start-ups. With a Site award, UW addresses customer development within the I-Corps framework. \r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nUW has been actively participating in state-level and regional entrepreneurial strategies for the past six years. Their involvement in the I-Corps national network expands their coherent effort to execute a national strategy. Also, to help drive the regional innovation economy around Seattle and the Puget Sound, UW has developed its own ecosystem for technology entrepreneurship. An I-Corps Site award will expand participant?s entrepreneurial experience, especially for students, by emphasizing the importance of early and frequent interactions with potential customers. This would directly improve the quality and momentum of the start-ups in UW's pipeline, which translates into healthier company starts in Washington State.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project's primary goal was to provide early-stage academic entrepreneurs with lean startup methodology and customer discovery training, giving them solid bases on which to build their ventures. Over the life of the project, we supported 380 budding teams in the Pacific Northwest region by helping them learn how to apply a rigorous scientific process to customer discovery, build customer relationships and mentor relationships, and awarded 213 of those teams a grant to support further customer development. Ultimately, we have given approximately 80 startups more momentum in securing customers and moving their business or technology forward. Alums of the UW I-Corps Site program have gone on to raise upwards of $450M of dilutive and non-dilutive funding between 2015 and 2023. Approximately 80% of participants were from the University of Washington. The remaining 20% were from 18 other institutions in the Pacific Northwest, many of which did not have an I-Corps Site grant of their own. It saw participation from community colleges, four-year degree-granting institutions of various sizes, and specialized research institutes from Washington State, Montana, Oregon, Idaho and Alaska. This project also attracted several teams from beyond the Pacific Northwest who had an interest in the specialized industry content and networking offered as part of this project. Finally, this project was also used as a testbed to better understand and build constructs to overcome barriers to historically marginalized student participation in innovation and entrepreneurship, confirming notably the power of representative spaces, financial support for participants, as well as the power of peer mentorship and wraparound support in fostering participation and success. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Magali D Eaton"
