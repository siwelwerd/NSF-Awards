 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Delaware offers research experiences in multidisciplinary materials research with energy and sustainability applications to diverse and talented cohorts of students, including those from minority serving institutions and primarily undergraduate institutions in the region. The students' research projects have meaningful and positive impacts on society by developing sustainable energy technologies, with topics spanning from energy generated from biomass to the development of next-generation fuel cell membranes. The REU Site aims to enhance U.S. competitiveness through the development of a diverse and engaged workforce by enabling students to: acquire a practical and engaging research experience, develop their interest in pursuing a graduate degree education, understand the graduate school experience and admissions process, and develop long-term professional and social connections with fellow participants, graduate students, and faculty. \r\n\r\nThe REU Site offers opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in comprehensive research experiences on cutting-edge topics, using state-of-the-art methods, which reinforce and strengthen their classroom knowledge and encourage pursuit of graduate education. During the 10-week experience, students perform materials engineering and science research projects involving photovoltaic devices, catalytic materials, or nanomaterials and nanocomposites. The students collaborate with a faculty mentor in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering or Materials Science and Engineering along with a trained graduate student and post-doc mentors. They also participate in a professional development program that includes training in communications and research methods skills, graduate school information sessions, and workshops on research ethics and ethics of technologies. The students are provided with opportunities to present their research results in a research symposium held at the end of the summer and participate in field trips to nearby research and development facilities (of chemical, materials, and energy companies) to augment laboratory research activities with examples of the translation of science and engineering advances to commercial practice. The program is partnering with 11 colleges, universities and programs as part of comprehensive recruitment plan to ensure a diverse and talented applicant pool for the REU Site.\r\n\r\nThis Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.",

Broadly, the goals of the REU site for the participants were: (1) Learn research skills ? best practices of laboratory and / or computational work, searching and understanding the literature, communicating research, research ethics, and professionalism; (2) Explore research careers ? field trips to experience industrial and national laboratory research environments, including visits to Dow and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST); (3) Learn about graduate programs ? how they are structured, how to apply, what to expect; (4) Have fun, build a new network.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Participation in the REU program positively affected the graduate program applicant pool in the principal disciplines of chemical engineering and materials science. The REU site assessments, conducted by the Center for Research in Education and Social Policy at the University of Delaware, showed that the program positively impacted the resources and interest of students towards attending graduate school and pursuing research careers. Students indicated through surveys that they had the greatest growth in the skill areas of performing research and the least growth in their dispositions (because these areas were already highly rated prior to attending the program). According to the participant responses, REU students developed the following important research skills or experiences: identifying and mitigating research misconduct; keeping a detailed lab notebook; operating scientific instruments; conducting observations in the lab or field; conducting database or literature searches; and identifying limitations of research methods and designs. REU students also gained confidence in their ability to engage in real-world science and interact with scientists and engineers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of the first three cohorts of REU students, two-thirds (20/30) are currently pursuing a PhD or applying to graduate programs. Six pursued positions in industry and government. REU participants co-authored two peer-reviewed publications and are co-authors on several more manuscripts to be submitted.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/07/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Eric&nbsp;M&nbsp;Furst</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460932/1460932_10384884_1581107028225_IMG_0093--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460932/1460932_10384884_1581107028225_IMG_0093--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Delaware REU 2017\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460932/1460932_10384884_1581107028225_IMG_0093--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Delaware REU 2017\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">REU students visiting the vSANS beamline at NIST.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Eric Furst</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eric&nbsp;M&nbsp;Furst</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Delaware REU 2017</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460932/1460932_10384884_1581107316626_IMG_1425--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460932/1460932_10384884_1581107316626_IMG_1425--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2018 REU participants\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460932/1460932_10384884_1581107316626_IMG_1425--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2018 REU participants\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2018 REU participants visit the Dow Collegeville site to learn about research careers in industry and current work in advanced materials manufacturing and characterization.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Thomas Epps</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eric&nbsp;M&nbsp;Furst</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2018 REU participants</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460932/1460932_10384884_1581107828149_UDREUPhoto(CNST)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460932/1460932_10384884_1581107828149_UDREUPhoto(CNST)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"2016 UD REU participants visiting CNST at NIST.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1460932/1460932_10384884_1581107828149_UDREUPhoto(CNST)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"2016 UD REU participants visiting CNST at NIST.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">UD REU students visit the NIST Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Thomas Epps</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Eric&nbsp;M&nbsp;Furst</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">2016 UD REU participants visiting CNST at NIST.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
