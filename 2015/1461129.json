 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this International REU Sites funded by the Chemistry Division and the International Science and Engineering (ISE) Section of the Office of International and Integrative Activities (OIIA) both at the National Science Foundation, Professors Karin Ruhlandt and Michael Sponsler of Syracuse University will oversee the mentored research participation of six American students, recruited nationally each year, for ten weeks at either of two Austrian universities, the Technical University of Graz and Karl Franzens University of Graz. These institutions will fund the research participation of a similar number of Austrian research students at Syracuse University. The research exchange program, begun in 2005 with NSF support, provides the students both research experience and opportunities for intense cultural immersion. The American students will also attend a capstone event at Syracuse University three months after their return to the US. They will be reunited for a reception in their honor and a symposium in which they will describe their scientific accomplishments and cultural insights.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this program include the students' intimate insights into the technical and non-technical aspects of international science provided by their experience and preparing them to successfully operate and serve as leaders in the global arena of science. Benefits of international exposure will also accrue to students and other members of the chemistry departments in both Graz and Syracuse. Participating students will develop a number of lasting and useful international contacts. The research done by the students will also be presented at conferences and published in journals.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis international Research Experience for Undergraduates grant supported 32 undergraduate students in chemistry research at the Technical University of Graz in Graz, Austria over the summers of 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, and another 10 students at Syracuse University in the summer of 2021.  The final year in the U.S. was made necessary by the COVID-19 pandemic, and this change was approved by NSF.  In some summers, 2015, 2016, and 2019, a total of 20 Austrian students from the Technical University of Graz performed research at Syracuse University, participating in the domestic REU program there with the financial support of their home institution.  With the supervision of a faculty mentor and other research group members, each NSF-supported student spent ten weeks participating in all aspects of a research project, including planning and literature background, learning laboratory skills and techniques, designing and running experiments, collecting and interpreting data, drawing conclusions, and communicating the results.  Doing all of this in a different country also provided the students with valuable experience and perspective on the global scientific community, as well as confidence that they have a place in it.  Through interactions with their fellow participants, the students gained experience in the full breadth of chemistry research, including all fields and from basic to fully applied.  Near the end of the summer, the students presented their research to others both orally and in writing, thus gaining valuable communication experience in different formats.  Their experience and perspective helped them to make later informed decisions about education and career choices.  Each student also ended the summer with important contacts whom they might later call on.\n\nWhile the program itself was devoted to research, being in a different country gave student the opportunity to explore, and they did.  They often traveled to different European cities on the weekends, and the hosts in Graz organized one or two trips each summer.  The students reported that Graz came to feel like home to them, and many expressed the desire to return at some point.  A few have indeed returned on their own, either for a visit or even to do more research.\n\nThe intellectual merit of this grant includes the intense learning experience of the students, the progress they made on their research projects, and the dissemination of these results through journal publications, reports, and presentations at conferences and symposia.  The broader impacts of this grant include the education of a diverse group of new young scientists, a good fraction (29%) of whom are members of underrepresented minority groups and over half (64%) of whom are female.  In their reviews, the students enthusiastically extolled the value of their experience gained and expressed great appreciation for the opportunity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/27/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael B Sponsler"
