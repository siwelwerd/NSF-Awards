The presence of needles in neural tissue causes extensive damage and inflammation that lead to scar tissue formation and eventual probe failure. This work proposes the use of electrodes arrays placed on the surface of sub-mm, instrumented spherical particles.  The small, shank free particles thus allow for the healing of surrounding tissue after insertion minimizing scar tissue formation and extending probe life. This new technology has broad applicability in the realization of instrumentation for fundamental brain function studies, brain to machine interfaces and neural prostheses.\r\n\r\nThe proposed work is divided into four separate tasks: (1) the development of new microfabrication technologies for construction of hollow, spherical micro-capsules with peripheral electrodes, (2) the development of ultracompact folded CMOS neurorecording circuits, (3) the development of compact RF biotelemetry circuits and (4) the testing of effectiveness, tissue damage and longevity of particle-based probes on small animals.",
