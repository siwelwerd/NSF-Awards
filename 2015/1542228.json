 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) in Engineering and Computer Science Site at the University of Washington (UW) involves elementary and middle school science and mathematics teachers from King County in south Seattle in intensive six-week summer multidisciplinary and cutting edge research experiences on environmental sustainabile and green advanced vehicle technology, professional development, and academic year collaborations. The RET Site involves a partnership between UW faculty in the College of Engineering (CoE) and the Institute for Systems Biology's Logan Center for Education (ISB LCE) in program development and implementation. Teachers participate in three research projects in of advanced vehicle technology (AVT) that include energy storage system design and integration, hardware and software-in-the-loop simulation and testing, Human-Machine Interfacing (HMI) for infotainment and displays, vehicle connectivity and embedded control systems, powertrain component bench testing, use of vehicle modeling and simulation tools, and improving aerodynamics. The RET participants gain first-hand experience in the use of experimental and Maker space tools, as well as create pedagogically appropriate curriculum enhancements that align with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) Engineering Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCI), Practices, and Concepts.  The program impacts two areas that are of direct interest to the United States and the world: increasing access for K-12 teachers and their students to a deeper understanding of the STEM disciplines, research, and career opportunities; and inspiring teachers and students to pursue engineering careers. \r\n\r\nOver a three-year period this RET Site offers an intensive summer research and academic year program for a total of 30 upper elementary and middle school (grades 4-8) STEM teachers from the south Seattle area.  The targeted school districts are in the Community Center for Educational Results Road Map Project region, which encompasses King County's most concentrated areas of resource challenged student population with a high need of STEM education opportunities.  The RET Site leverages the ongoing multidisciplinary EcoCAR 3 program for the energy efficient design of vehicles.  Key features of the program include: 1) Direct supervision of projects and course material development by UW College of Engineering and Institute for Systems Biology's Logan Center for Education faculty mentors and graduate students; 2)Involvement of RET teachers and their students in timely, cutting-edge research projects in green and sustainable advanced vehicle technology that are translated into engineering curriculum enhancements; 3) Academic year program in which teachers engage with UW CoE students and faculty, industry mentors, and ISB LCE education professionals through monthly teleconferences and quarterly meetings to implement curriculum enhancements in classrooms and disseminate enhancements via local, state, and national networks 4) Recruitment of STEM teachers from high needs school districts in the south Seattle area; and 5) Research and education activities to  strengthen teachers' engineering design and computer science knowledge and provide them with effective pedagogical strategies that will help them translate their research experiences into course modules that will excite their students about engineering and align with NGSS Engineering Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCI), Practices, and Concepts.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe 3-year operation of the RET (2015-2018) successfully met its goal to recruit and train 30 teachers (10 per year).  Teacher participants came from a broad range of 22 schools, in 16 school districts, and impacted 3,925 students.  All 22 participating school campuses successfully set up makerspaces (featuring 3-D printers) on their respective campuses and engaged students in the use of these spaces during science instructional time.  Teacher surveys indicate that these makerspaces create student excitement and draw interest from colleagues and district administration. \n\nThe three cohorts selected the same two projects for their research experience during the Summer Intensive:  Project 1: Vehicle Propulsion (component design, rapid prototyping, engineering design process); and Project 5: Driver Assistance (collision avoidance, adaptive cruise control, supervisory control, microcontroller programming) as their research projects for the Summer Intensive.  Each teacher implemented design challenges in their classrooms drawing on their research experiences; design challenges included, amongst others, gravity propelled cars, lunchbox alarms, water rockets, wildlife corridors, and hail-proof gardens.  The teachers' positive reaction to their RET experience is captured in a video produced for 2017 NSF STEM for All Video Showcase.\n\nTeacher participants were chosen based on schools with high needs as judged by publicly available data, the application, and participant commitment and preparedness. Teachers teams were given priority. Participants were also chosen to balance the cohort with both elementary and middle school participants.\n\nAll cohorts were asked to participate in a Pre (before Summer Intensive, n=26), Mid (after Summer Intensive, n=29), and Post (after Academic Year Collaboration Phase, n=30). The Pre, Mid, and Post surveys all assessed teacher perception of knowledge and implementation of Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) engineering Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCI) and Practices, Connections of NGSS to real world examples, Computer science principles, and Engineering course and career pathways.  Results indicate that the RET has successfully helped over 80% of the teachers to incorporate NGSS Engineering DCIs, NGSS Engineering Practices, and real-world engineering examples into their classroom curriculum.\n\nAfter participating in the RET, including a summer intensive phase and a school year phase, teachers were asked about changes in their teaching practice and the practices of their students as a result of participation.  Over 75% of teachers emphasized gaining proficiency in developing scientific models &amp; scientific explanations; 50-74% emphasized gaining proficiency in argumentation, planning/implementing science investigations, critically evaluating information from multiple sources, developing scientific questions about real-world phenomena, multiple grade-appropriate methods of analyzing data, and writing clear scientific text.  Over 75% of Cohort teachers observed that students more often break complex problems down into smaller parts to solve; 50-74% observed that students more often: revise explanations and scientific models based on additional evidence, clearly write and orally present results of their scientific work, determine what data is needed to answer a scientific question, create reasonable models to represent scientific phenomena, and use data and reasoning, verbally and in writing, to defend or refute scientific claims.\n\nTeacher participants also reported experiencing profound shifts in their knowledge and beliefs in a variety of aspects of engineering design, particularly with respect to the benefit of encouraging unlimited research, prototype iteration, failing early and often, creating specific optimization goals, collaborating effectively, creative decision-making (weighted objective table), interdisciplinary work, viable engineering course and career pathways, and increasing equity to encourage learners of all backgrounds.\n\nThe RET also aimed to broaden participation by underrepresented student populations in the STEM professions.  This was accomplished by direct engagement with these students and the major influencer in their lives, their parents.   An RET Supplement, the UW 4th/5th Grade Engineering-Class-in-Residence was proposed and accepted.  Over two years this program brought together a total of one hundred and ten (110) elementary school students (grades 4-5), two (2) elementary school teachers (grades 4-5), and twenty-five (25) parent chaperones, in an innovative one-week Engineering-Class-in-Residence at the University of Washington Campus during the academic year.  This provided a life changing experience for students from low income schools, who are introduced to engineering, exposed to \"college life,\" and immersed in a supportive environment that encourages them to view both college education and STEM careers as realistic and attainable goals.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian Fabien"
