 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dr. Eugene Smith of the University of Nevada Las Vegas and Dr. Curtis Marean of Arizona State University along with an international team of scientists will apply a new dating method to determine when a suite of uniquely human features first appeared in evolutionary history and thus help to understand when, where and why the human lineage evolved.  South African Middle Stone Age (MSA) sites have figured prominently in this work, revolutionizing knowledge of modern human origins by pushing back and enriching  knowledge of the timing of key features science considers definitive of humans.   Modern dating techniques and their application to archaeological sites provide the basis for determining when key events in early human history occurred.  These techniques use complex models that produce age estimates and not absolute dates.  In the past, different laboratories have used different models that may result in different ages for the same geologic unit.  This has created a dating controversy that reduces confidence in the timing of key events in early human prehistory. There is general agreement that the best way of producing robust age estimates is to use several independent dating techniques.  Recently, the research team identified volcanic ash in a rock shelter occupied by early humans at Pinnacle Point, South Africa, and the best fit of the chemistry of this ash is to the 75,000 year old eruption of the Toba volcano in Indonesia. This discovery provides an independent dating tool that can be used along with traditional dating methods to resolve the dating controversy and tie the record of human origins preserved at Pinnacle Point and other areas of southern Africa to the global record of modern human origins. \r\n\r\nDrs. Smith and Marean and their research team will collect and process samples from four archaeological sites in southern Africa to identify and determine the distribution of ash from the Toba eruption.  This work will, for the first time, tie early human history recorded at each of these sites to a single dating model and remove any debate about the timing of key events in early human development.  Correlation of volcanic ash to source volcanoes will be done using the chemistry of the ash.  The ash is in the form of very small (micron sized) glass grains known as shards.  These grains are analyzed by instruments that focus a small-diameter electron or laser beam on the shard to determine their chemical makeup.  The chemistry is then compared to a database of known chemistry to identify the source and age of the ash.    This project will not only provide a new independent dating tool for archaeological sites, but also help train students and early career scientists in the techniques of archaeology and geology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSeventy four thousand years ago, a volcano in Sumatra named Toba erupted with enormous power &ndash; it was the most powerful eruption in the last 10 million years, far exceeding Krakatoa or Pompeii.  Toba has been carefully studied and we know from multiple high resolution argon-argon dates that its eruption occurred at 74,000 years ago.  Scientists have argued that it may have created a decades-long volcanic winter, and more spectacularly, that it may have caused a near-extinction event in modern humans.  One of our goals was to test the extinction hypothesis by searching for signs of the Toba eruption in archaeological sites in South Africa where our record for early modern humans is rich and important.  A second goal was to use the eruption and its ejected material to help us date archaeological sites in South Africa.  A third goal was to develop these techniques and build the first lab in the United States that could conduct all of these analyses.  We accomplished all of these goals and more.\n\nWhen volcanoes erupt they often have a Plinian phase &ndash; this is the phase where material is erected violently out of the volcano.  As an analogy, think of a beer can shaken hard and then opened &ndash; beer erupts out and up. This is the Plinian phase, and during that event microscopic shards of glass are ejected out &ndash; these are called cryptotephra.  If the power is sufficient, these can be ejected high into the atmosphere and then dispersed.  Generally speaking, the more powerful the volcano the greater distance of dispersion.  Importantly, these shards have a chemical signature that is unique to the volcano, so if we can find them and analyze that geological signature, we can state with confidence the source volcano. \n\nTo accomplish our study, Dr. Gene Smith and his team learned cryptotephra methods from a British team based at Cambridge led by Dr. Christine Lane.  Lane is a pioneer in these methods and generously shared with us her expertise, and we are very grateful for that. Those methods were then transferred to Smith?s laboratory at University of Nevada at Las Vegas, and a laboratory was built from scratch.  Importantly, because Toba is so far from South Africa, Smith?s team needed to develop special approaches for searching and analyzing extra low abundance cryptotephra.  At the same time, Marean and Fisher and their team began taking samples in South Africa at Pinnacle Point and other sites, and these samples were exported to Smith?s lab and studied.\n\nArchaeological sites along the shores of South Africa have provided the best and richest records for early modern human behavior.  They are dated primarily by a technique called optically stimulated luminescence dating (OSL).  While this technique has matured into a workhorse, there is an important debate between competing OSL labs in regards to the dating of some of these important sites.  At the key site of Pinnacle Point 5-6 in South Africa (where Marean directs excavations), an OSL scientist named Dr. Zenobia Jacobs had developed an age model for the site based on OSL dating.  Jacobs and her approaches have been challenged by a French team also working in South Africa.  We searched for and succeeded in finding the Toba cryptotephra in the PP5-6 site, and it was found in sediments that Jacobs had dated with OSL to 74,000 years ago!  Our result validated her result, and has now provided a strong challenge to the French team.  Importantly, we found no evidence for a drop in population after the Toba eruption &ndash; in fact population densities increased.   Our work, three years in the making, was published in Nature, widely considered one of the two most prominent journals in science, in March of 2018.\n\nWe are now searching for the Toba cryptotephra in other sites in Africa.  Importantly, there is now so much demand for our work that we have decided to create another cryptotephra laboratory at Arizona State University, and a new proposal has been submitted to NSF to accomplish that task.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/25/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Curtis W Marean"
