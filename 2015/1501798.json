 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the 2015 meeting, held at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln during April 25-26, 2015, of an annual conference series designed to promote interaction among junior researchers in commutative algebra and related disciplines (including homological algebra, algebraic geometry, K-theory, and coding theory) at Midwestern schools.  The conference series is anchored by the Universities of Kansas (KU), Missouri - Columbia (MU), and Nebraska - Lincoln (NU).  The gathering will provide an opportunity for young algebraists to interact and establish research connections with each other.  This interaction will help to lay a foundation for fruitful research collaborations as the participants advance in the field.\r\n\r\nThe goals of the conference are to foster collaboration among young researchers in commutative algebra from Midwestern institutions, and to expose commutative algebra students and postdocs from Midwestern institutions to the current work being done in their fields at neighboring institutions.  The primary impacts of the conference are its enrichment of the research careers of the participants and the dissemination of recent ideas in commutative algebra research at the graduate and postdoctoral levels. In particular, the interaction and exposure to the work of their peers will benefit students from universities with small commutative algebra research groups, those who will become faculty at small institutions, women, and members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.   In addition, participants will take ideas and collaborations initiated at the conference to the institutions where they eventually establish careers.\r\n\r\nConference web page: http://www.math.unl.edu/~ecanton2/KUMUNUjr/2015/",
