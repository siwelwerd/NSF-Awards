 "awd_abstract_narration": "The scientific work proposed here will carry out the research and development necessary to create a new, unique set of high-latitude electro-dynamic, ionospheric-thermospheric-\u00ad&#8208;magnetospheric cyberbased tools and products that will be available to the entire geosciences community. In combination, the data products from this project will allow the derivation of a first principle electromagnetic solution for the auroral ionosphere. Project will develop a new set of data resources for the geoscience community in the form of a complete electromagnetic solution of the auroral ionosphere and will focus on developing the ?Data Infrastructure for Communities? component of the EarthCube Integrative Activities. The project will thus allow access to not only the desired derived products, but also provide support for other modeling efforts by allowing access to the database of input data and intermediary products. The system will also be designed to be extensible, allowing additional data products and models to be integrated into the system. The system will fully support existing standards that are used in the broader geosciences community such as the Data Access Protocol (DAP).The research undertaken in this proposal will enable transformative research in two otherwise separated fields: magnetosphere-\u00ad&#8208;ionosphere and neutral atmosphere. \r\n\r\nThe MIAC project addresses the complete electromagnetic solution of the auroral ionosphere, through an implementation that matches the goals of the EarthCube program. The intent is to develop a series of interlocking web services that provide access to the underlying MIAC datasets (AMPERE, SuperDARN and SuperMAG), that apply the science algorithms to derive the desired electro-\u00ad dynamic products, and provide data translation and visualization services. This mesh of services will be open to the community and will allow users to access any individual service. The research undertaken in this project will enable transformative research in two otherwise separated fields: magnetosphere-\u00ad&#8208;ionosphere and neutral atmosphere through a) the high-\u00ad&#8208;latitude electro-\u00ad&#8208;dynamics couple to the incoming solar wind and magnetosphere along magnetic field lines; b) the changes in the ionosphere and thermosphere at high latitudes provide changes to the conductivities throughout the polar region, which then effect the dynamics in the magnetosphere; c) the electrodynamic energy and momentum inputs get deposited in the upper atmosphere and launch neutral winds that then couple to ion velocities and transport compositional changes to the mid and low latitudes; d) the winds and composition couple to waves impinging from the lower atmosphere.",
