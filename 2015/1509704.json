 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research goal is to build technical foundations for designing resilient control systems which are capable of maintaining desired performance in the presence of uncertain system faults such as actuator failures, structural damage and sensor failures. The research is aimed at developing new fault detection algorithms and new adaptive and robust control methods and criteria to handle large and multiple system fault uncertainties. It will create new resilient control theory and techniques applicable to performance-critical systems such as aircraft, spacecraft, wind turbines, jet engines and intelligent robots, to enhance their safety under uncertain fault conditions. It will conduct new studies on modeling and control of systems under various fault conditions for which existing control designs are not applicable. For example, aircraft loss-of-control precursor conditions such as airframe damage, component failures, icing and turbulence effects may cause large and variant system uncertainties for which existing feedback controllers are not powerful enough. The research is expected to advance feedback control theory and technology for the need of emerging applications which require control systems to be resilient to faults, that is, have desired capabilities to accommodate uncertain and large system faults.\r\n\r\nThis research studies unique metrics of control system resilience, distinct features of resilient control problems, and key control theory requirements of performance-critical systems. It develops new control theory and design techniques to ensure desired control system resilience for multivariable nonlinear systems under uncertain multi-fault conditions. It solves new control problems such as fault detection for unstable systems, control of systems with uncertain structural characterizations, adaptive and fault-tolerant control of systems with under-actuation or non-minimum phase. These problems have the key feature that the controlled systems have fault-induced parametric, structural and functional uncertainties, difficult for most existing control schemes to deal with (to ensure both system stability and asymptotic tracking). For example, there can be uncertain failure patterns, uncertain under-actuation, uncertain system infinite zero structures, uncertain dynamic variations, caused by uncertain faults. A main goal of this research is to build a new control system design framework with specific control schemes which are capable of dealing with such unsolved system uncertainty problems, needed for resilient control systems technology. Several new feedback control methods will be developed, including: adaptive multi-layer multiple-model design (to ensure both fault handling and performance improvement abilities), adaptive multi-design integration (to deal with multiple faults), adaptive feedback-based fault detection (to have self-stabilization capacity), adaptive structural uncertainty accommodation (to deal large system structural damage), and characteristic parametrization based adaptive approximation control for non-canonical form nonlinear systems (to design an adaptable and stable controller structure). Direct control adaptation techniques will be developed for fast and smooth compensation of large and multiple fault uncertainties. New resilient control designs, for performance-guarantee fault-tolerant control, will be tested on some benchmark application system models. New concepts, theory and techniques for resilient control systems will be used for student training and knowledge dissemination.",
