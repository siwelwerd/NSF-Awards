Currently, only simple forms of alignment have been used and these have been adequate for today's displays.  However, future devices with even greater capabilities will depend on developing more complex surface alignments.  One possibility is to use surfaces patterned at the microscopic level to introduce chirality, or handedness, into the ordering of the liquid crystals.  Chirality - the fact that your right hand is not a mirror image of the left - plays an important role in many areas such as biology and chemistry.  In fact, many pharmaceuticals must be prepared with a specific chirality (either right or left handed) to be effective.   In this project the principal investigator and his team will explore ways of introducing chirality into liquid crystals by patterning the surface they are in contact with.  They will then study these systems to determine what new patterns develop, what are the forces introduced by these new patterns and how they can be used to more effectively separate molecules with different chirality, such as pharmaceuticals.  The students involved  in these studies, from high school to graduate school, will be trained in state-of-the-art techniques and will work with collaborators from around the world.  \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL ABSTRACT\r\nSurfaces play a defining role in myriad systems; this is especially true of liquid crystals.  By mechanically tailoring the surface structure on nanoscopic length scales, the PI manipulates the behavior and symmetry of the adjacent liquid crystal, facilitating new phenomena, applications, and a more profound understanding of fundamental physical and chemical properties.  This project focuses on imposed chirality at the surface, induced chirality in the achiral liquid crystal, and forces associated with chirality.   In recent years the PI has developed powerful techniques both to establish controlled chirality at surfaces using inherently achiral materials and to image liquid crystal orientation on nanoscopic length scales.  He is ratcheting up these techniques and addressing the most seminal issues in which chirality originates at an interface.  The work has several objectives, including:  optimization of mechanically-generated chiral surfaces; understanding the influence of surface chirality on liquid crystal symmetry and anchoring; spatially-controlling enantiomeric segregation at scales as small as 2-3 micrometers; examining forces associated with chiral \"dipoles\"; creating chiral topological defects, including chiral defects, at the 2-3 micrometer scale and using them as traps for chiral nanoparticles; and the Holy Grail: understanding chiral induction, both the strength and penetration depth.  The PI?s team exploits a battery of experimental tools, including - but not limited to - optical microscopy and optical nanotomography (the PI's modification of near field scanning optical microscopy), atomic force microscopy, AFM and electron beam nanolithography, and ellipsometry.  By exploiting the PI's ability to create exquisitely tailored chiral substrates from achiral materials and to image liquid crystal orientation down to x,y,z dimensions of 60 x 60 x 1 nm, this work is transforming our conceptions about - and methodology toward - surface chirality and its effects on anisotropic fluids.  In particular, it is leading to vastly improved methods to create spatially-controlled chirality at surfaces, the quantification and understanding of surface-induced chirality in otherwise achiral molecules, and its manifestation in other physical phenomena.  These issues cut across multiple disciplines, as consequences of chirality appear throughout biology, chemistry, physics, medicine, and pharmacology.  The research is giving rise to a host of novel phenomena, and establishing new scientific paradigms for surface chirality and liquid crystals.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nChirality is the inability of an object to coincide with its mirror image, such as a hand, a screw, or DNA, with an object being classified defined as either \"right-handed\" or \"left-handed\".  A topological defect occurs when the system?s relevant order parameter cannot be defined at a point, line, or surface, such as a crystalline grain boundary.  Both phenomena are pervasive throughout nature, often appear in tandem, and are fundamental to basic questions in science and development of new technologies.  A few examples include chirality in quantum optics, semiconductor diodes, plasmonics, and biomaterials; chirality transfer; skyrmions; interactions of topological defects and their relaxation in materials; and micro-scale defect arrays for photonics.  \n\nINTELLECTUAL MERIT\n\nOwing to their large optical, electrical, and magnetic anisotropies, liquid crystals can serve as a test bed for a multitude of phenomena in condensed matter?.and beyond. The central theme of this work has been the exploitation of liquid crystals to explore seminal issues of chirality and topological defects that can impact the broader scientific and technological enterprise.\n\nOur work on chirality focused on chirality transfer, viz., if a molecule or larger structure were chiral, how is that chirality transferred from one liquid crystalline molecule to the next, and over what distances does this transfer occur?  Liquid crystalline molecules are ideal for these sorts of investigations, as a reorientation of a chemical bond can change the handedness of the molecule.  The extreme optical properties of liquid crystals provide a means of probing this chirality.  During the course of the project we examined chirality of several objects, including periodic mesoporous organosilica and chiral lysine-coated nanocapsules. \n\nLiquid crystals can possess topological defects that mimic other systems, but also may have defects that are unique to liquid crystals.  For example, we discovered a new type of defect that we whimsically call \"soapy streaks\", because their appearance \"washes away\" another type of defect known as \"oily streaks\".  We have developed both an experimental and theoretical picture of the defects' structures, and have probed both the chiral and non-chiral aspects of the defects.  We also developed a means of patterning a grid of surface defects, and developed a deep understanding of how the energy cost of such defects can be relaxed either spontaneously or on application of an electric field.  In fact, we demonstrated how disclination line defects can be manipulated with an electric field to create mutistable patterns of defect lines.  These have both fundamental scientific implications and may even be used for signage.  We also showed how an electric field can force the dimensionality of the defects from 3D to 2D.\n\nIn a off-off experiment, we also examined the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in multi-layered fluiods.  If a high density fluid is accelerated into a low density fluid -- think here vinegar and oil salad dressing -- the inteface becomes unstable.  This has been known for well over 100 years.  But what happens if there are threeimmiscible  fluids with two interfaces?  We examined this system experimentally for the first time, and showed how the instability is related to the height of the middle layer.\n\nBROADER IMPACTS\n\nThe results of the project naturally flow into further scientific inquiry, and also can branch off into development of new technologies.  But the broader impacts go beyond the science.  Many students at the graduate, undergraduate, and high school levels have been associated with the project, and have gone on -- or will go on -- to the US workforce or further education.
