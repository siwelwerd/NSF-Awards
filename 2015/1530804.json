 "awd_abstract_narration": "An interactive scientific and educational workshop will be held at the active Volcan Santiaguito (Guatemala) in January of 2016.  The meeting will bring together researchers, students, and observatory personnel to exchange state-of-the-art quantitative geophysical field techniques and to collect and distribute integrated volcano geophysical data products.  The workshop will entail an initial (pre-workshop) deployment, ongoing field study during the workshop, lectures and presentations, and data analysis and open exchange.  It is hoped that this workshop will be the first in a series of innovative workshops where a group of scientists target and study a select open-vent volcanic system.\r\n\r\nVolcan Santiaguito is the ideal locale for the inaugural workshop owing to its diverse and continuing low level of activity (lava effusion, explosions, regular rockfall, and small pyroclastic density currents).  The volcanic activity is amenable to a range of geophysical data collection, including seismic, infrasonic, geodetic, optical, thermal, and ground-based UV and microwave sensing.  The scientific program will focus on volcano geophysics acquisition, processing, and analysis techniques through hands-on demonstration and focused discussion.  Novel scientific insights are expected from integration of diverse data.",

The nearby and taller Santa Maria volcano offers safe vantage points for deploying in-situ and line-of-sight instrumentation.  It is an important volcano laboratory because it represents a style of volcanic activity, explosive dome volcanism, that occurs commonly worldwide including occasionally in the United States.  Santiaguito is also an especially hazardous volcano, which threatens a large populace.  Efforts to better understand eruption dynamics at Santiaguito can help to mitigate hazards to the local populations. \n\nIn January 2016, volcano scientists, monitoring agency specialists, and students gathered in the nearby city of Quetzaltenango to share research expertise and conduct fieldwork in the first of a series of scientific and educational workshops on volcanoes.
