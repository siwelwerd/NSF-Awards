 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program grant will pioneer a new approach for understanding the effects of mechanical force on the dynamics of specific proteins in living cells. Disease is generally understood and treated through biochemical means; when we get sick, we typically get a pill. However, in addition to biochemical signals, cells are subject to a wide variety of mechanical cues. Inside living tissues, cells exist in a complex mechanical environment that is both a source of applied forces and a means of mechanical support. Alterations in the mechanical environment surrounding cells are potent regulators of many fundamental processes, including how cells grow, migrate, and develop into different tissue types. Understanding how cells sense, interpret, and respond to mechanical cues is currently limited by the inability to study the interplay between mechanical forces and biochemical signaling pathways at the molecular level in living cells. A greater understanding of this relationship will aid endeavors to develop therapies for diseases like cancer and atherosclerosis, where the mechanical environment is altered, as well as efforts to engineer replacement tissues for regenerative medicine.\r\n\r\nAn incomplete understanding of the processes cells use to detect mechanical cues, referred to as mechanotransduction, is preventing advancements in diverse fields, ranging from fundamental studies of the collective movements of cells during morphogenesis to applied research geared toward improving tissue engineering approaches by incorporating relevant mechanical stimuli. The sub-cellular structures that mechanically link the force-generating cytoskeleton to the extracellular environment, termed focal adhesions, are known to be innately sensitive to mechanical force and critically important in mechanotransduction. A key molecular process dictating these force-activated dynamics is the mechanical loading of vinculin, an adaptor protein found in focal adhesions. This research will create and utilize state of the art molecular tools and experimental approaches capable of elucidating the interdependence and dynamics of the molecular-scale mechanical and biochemical processes mediating mechanotransduction in living cells and tissues. Novel tools include genetically-encoded molecular tension sensors with rationally-designed biophysical properties and defined biochemical functions. Additionally, a simple, but novel, experimental procedure for directly measuring force-activated protein dynamics will be developed. These will be combined to test the hypothesis that distinct forms of mechanical stimulation are detected and integrated by the cell through alterations in the force-activated dynamics of vinculin.",

The sub-cellular structures that mechanically link the force-generating cytoskeleton to the extracellular environment, termed focal adhesions, are known to be innately sensitive to mechanical force and critically important in mechanotransduction. A key, but poorly understood, molecular process dictating these interactions is the effect of force on protein dynamics. For instance, applied forces could cause key linkages to dissociate more quickly, limiting physical coupling between cells and the ECM. Alternatively, linkages could be stabilized in response to applied forces, increasing physical coupling. In this NSF CAREER Award entitled \"Force-activated Protein Dynamics in Mechanobiology\", we created an experimental technique enabling measurements of the interplay between force and biochemical regulation in determining protein dynamics in living cells. This involved an innovative combination of approaches from protein engineering, polymer physics, molecular biology, advanced microscopy, automated image analysis, and biomaterials research. First, we created a new set of engineered proteins that can be rationally tuned to report the forces experienced by specific proteins through changing the color of emitted light. Secondly, we developed a technique for the direct measurement of force-activated protein dynamics by combining these force-sensitive engineered proteins with a standard technique for measuring protein dynamics, Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP). This revealed that a particularly relevant mechanical linker protein, vinculin, is subject to force-induced stabilization in living cells. Furthermore, through selectively altering the engineered proteins to inhibit known functions of vinculin, we determined the interactions that mediate this force-induced stabilization. We also showed that the force-induced stabilization of vinculin is required for cells to migrate through confined spaces, like those experienced by cells in tissue. Additionally, as the field of mechanobiology is not commonly taught in undergraduate or graduate curricula, we developed a set of educational simulations that can be run from a standard graphical user interface to enable students to see the effects of force-activated dynamics in several contexts, ranging from single molecules to within focal adhesion-like structures. We hope these simulations will become a basis for efforts in integrative education, where key principles from mechanobiology can be used to teach biology, chemistry, and physics in a more cohesive manner. Overall, we developed novel molecular tools, experimental formalisms, and educational simulations that will enable the enhanced study and understanding of force-activated protein dynamics by ourselves and others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/17/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Brenton&nbsp;D&nbsp;Hoffman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
