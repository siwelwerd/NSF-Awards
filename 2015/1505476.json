 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nElectrochemical devices related to clean energy such as lithium batteries often rely on polymer membranes to conduct ions between the electrodes.  Understanding the factors that limit ion transport will enable the rational design of better membranes that will ultimately lead to more efficient devices.  This award specifically examines lithium ion transport through a class of polymers known as block copolymers.  These molecules self-assemble to give bicontinuous conducting and non-conducting domains.  The domains have specific geometries or morphologies such as hexagonally packed conducting cylinders in a non-conducting matrix or alternating conducting and non-conducting layers.  The addition of salt has an effect on the morphologies; a given copolymer may exhibit one morphology at a given salt concentration and another at a higher salt concentration.  One objective is to establish the effect of salt on morphology. Sample processing conditions can create defects in the morphology. The morphology and the defects will dictate ionic conductivity, and therefore characterizing the morphology and the defects is an important first step in making better membranes.  This work is a step toward building a sustainable clean-energy platform in the US.  In addition to the proposed scientific work, one of the investigators will develop courses aimed at helping talented low-income, first-generation-college students develop into scientists and engineers in collaboration with the Berkeley Center for STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math).   The other investigator is involved in broad science-and-technology outreach to high school students in Brooklyn, New York.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:\r\n\r\nThis research focuses on mixtures of polystyrene-polyethyleneoxide (PS-PEO) block copolymers, synthesized by anionic polymerization, and bis-trifluoromethylsulfonimide, a salt that is often used in batteries containing polymer electrolytes.  Electron microscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering and depolarized light scattering will be used to determine the nature of the order-disorder and order-order phase transitions in these materials.  The arrangement of the salt ions in the PEO microphases and the width of windows where ordered and disordered phases coexist are of particular interest.  In-situ conductivity measurements will be made on samples using ac impedance spectroscopy while structure is determined by either X-ray or light scattering studies.  Measurements will be made over a wide range of block copolymer compositions, salt concentration, temperature, and annealing conditions.  The data generated by the project will test recent theories on phase behavior of block copolymer/salt mixtures.  The planned work is of considerable intellectual merit as the data generated by the project will provide fundamental insight into the factors that underpin the coupling between structure, thermodynamics, and transport in an emerging class of nanostructured materials for electrochemical devices.  The graduate students working on this project will receive scientific training related to sustainable energy use. The multidisciplinary nature of the proposed research, which includes polymer synthesis, characterization, and electrochemical measurements, will provide the students with a rich learning environment.  It is coupled with STEM outreach at Berkeley, CA and Brooklyn, NY.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur daily lives have become more and more dependent on electronic devices, such as cell phone and laptops, that are powered by lithium batteries.  The long life and safety of such batteries depend on the material, called the electrolyte, used to separate the electrodes and to conduct the charge inside the battery.  In this project, we have studied a promising plastic electrolyte material: a mixture of a polystyrene-polyethylene oxide block copolymer (BCP) with a lithium salt. We have characterized this material using several optical methods, relying mainly on depolarized light scattering (DPLS) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), which are sensitive to the micrometer-scale grain structure and the nanometer-scale microphase structure of the material, respectively.  With our collaborators at the University of California Berkeley we prepared samples with a wide variety of compositions of this material and mapped out its phase diagram, which describes how the physical state of the material changes with changes in its composition.\n\nDuring the course of this project, we developed an improved method for performing the light scattering measurements that relies on illuminating the sample not only with linearly polarized light, but also with circularly polarized light.  By doing so, we are able to obtain more precise values for the average grain size and shape of the grains that comprise the sample. The grain structure of a sample affects its optical, electrical, adhesive, and elastic properties, so controlling and characterizing its grain structure is important for developing materials with the desired properties.\n\nWhen a block copolymer material is heated, it can undergo a phase transition from an ordered state to a disordered one, known as the order-disorder transition (ODT).  We studied one composition of the material in which the temperature of this transition was above the decomposition temperature of the sample, and therefore the sample could not be disordered.  Analysis of its ordered structure revealed an unusually wide distribution of grain sizes, ranging from sub-micrometer grains that could only be detected by SAXS, and extremely large grains (tens of micrometers) that were only detectible by DPLS or by polarized optical microscopy (POM).  This type of grain size distribution was unlike any we have ever observed, and is therefore a warning that one must be careful when characterizing the grain structure of a BCP sample with an inaccessible ODT.\n\nThe polyethylene oxide block of this material crystallizes when cooled below 40 degrees Celsius and melts when heated above 50 degrees Celsius.  Using a combination of SAXS and DPLS, we showed that when a sample consists of large grains, crystallization and subsequent melting does not alter the grain structure or the microphase structure, a behavior that has been called \"confined crystallization\".  However, when a sample consists of small grains, crystallization and subsequent melting disrupts the grain structure while maintaining the microphase structure. Such behavior has never before been observed in a BCP sample, and was only detectible by DPLS.  We have called this newly discovered phenomenon \"unconfined crystallization\".\n\nDuring the course of this project, one PhD graduate student received multidisciplinary training and mentored three undergraduate students, one postdoctoral fellow mentored both graduate and undergraduate students, and later obtained a full-time teaching job, one senior scientist contributed to the theoretical aspects of the work, and three undergraduate students gained experience working as part of a team in a research laboratory.  A female undergraduate student later became a PhD student in the materials science program at another university.\n\nThe PI of the project is a Directing Officer of the Brooklyn Subsection of the American Chemical Society, and is responsible for organizing public lectures \"Brooklyn Frontiers in Science\", held at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering.  These lectures are attracting nearly a hundred local Brooklyn high school students.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Bruce Garetz"
