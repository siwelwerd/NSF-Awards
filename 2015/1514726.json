 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the last decade there has been a proliferation of out-of-school environments that foster building, making, tinkering, and design activities, creating an unprecedented opportunity to engage a wide range of participants in mathematics that is both purposeful and powerful. To date, this opportunity has been almost universally unexploited. The conference, which will take place at and in collaboration with the New York Hall of Science, will gather fifty researchers and practitioners from informal mathematics education and the burgeoning \"making and tinkering\" movement for two days to collaboratively generate approaches to integrating mathematics in making and design environments and programs. The project, which includes pre- and post-conference activities, will produce a sampler of Math in Making activities, a guidebook, a white paper for research and practice, a retrospective online discussion, and further dissemination of project deliverables.  It is funded by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants.\r\n \r\nThrough the conference and pre- and post-conference activities, the project team will: \r\n- Initiate and sustain conversations between researchers and practitioners; \r\n- Establish collaborations that lead to changes in the way math is framed and highlighted in making and design environments; \r\n- Create resources to help people in the making/design community highlight the math in their environments; and \r\n- Frame a research agenda to guide studies of mathematical reasoning and attitudes towards math in making and design environments.\r\nThe work includes an extensive evaluation process of the conference and of pre- and post-conference activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\n \n\nNegative attitudes about mathematics and the poor performance of U.S. adults and students on measures of mathematical reasoning are well-documented problems that limit many people?s identities and career aspirations. At the same time, the last decade has seen a proliferation of out-of-school environments that foster making and tinkering activities. Enthusiastic participants in these activities are often engaging in mathematical reasoning without realizing it&mdash;and thus do not consider themselves competent mathematical thinkers. Is there a way we can leverage the popularity of making and tinkering to change people?s conceptions of mathematics and their identities with respect to math?  TERC and the Institute for Learning Innovation delved into this question by convening over 50 researchers and practitioners from out-of-school math and making settings at a workshop at the New York Hall of Science in May 2016.  This workshop was the central event of the Math in the Making project.\n\n \n\nThe workshop and subsequent discussions yielded several insights that will influence ongoing efforts to highlight the math in making and tinkering experiences; here is a list of the most important ones.\n\n \n\nBroaden your idea of what counts as mathematics.  There are challenges to identifying math in making environments.  This is at least partially due to the limited view of \"what counts\" as mathematics that is built on school math.  Math is much more than calculating with numbers; it includes thinking about space, functional relationships, and data, among other things.\n\n\n \n\nExplore the tension between authentic making and explicit math.  There is a perceived tension between the importance of highlighting math in making experiences and concerns about compromising essential qualities of making, such as creativity and self-direction.  But mathematical reasoning can also enhance and extend creativity; we need more examples of this kind of synergy to guide future development.\n\n\n \n\nHonor the math and making knowledge and experience that exists in all communities.  Making is not a new activity, even though official \"maker spaces\" are a relatively recent phenomenon.  Historically many communities have engaged in making activities out of necessity or as expressions of cultural identity.  We need to be more inclusive about who is considered a maker and the knowledge people can contribute.\n\n\n \n\nBuild opportunities for the math and making communities to collaborate.  When math and making communities first meet, as they did at the Math in the Making workshop, they may find their preconceived notions are challenged.  They often discover deeply shared values and become energized about finding collaborative solutions to what seem at first to be intractable problems.  We need more chances for this valuable cross-fertilization.\n\n\n \n\nDevelop concrete tools and resources.  Educators need specific examples of integrated math and making experiences.  Case studies, facilitation strategies, and a research agenda will all be necessary as we advance the field?s understanding of how to highlight and enhance mathematics in a variety of making experiences.\n\n\n \n\n \n\nMore information about the Math in the Making project, including videos of the workshop and an annotated list of making activities with authentically integrated math can be found on the Math in the Making website, mathinthemaking.terc.edu.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/26/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andee Rubin"
