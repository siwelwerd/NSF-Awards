 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides funding to explore a novel automated optical method for precisely measuring three-dimensional (3D) structures at micrometer accuracy for shiny objects (e.g., metal parts) and simultaneously process 3D contents in real time for in-situ applications (e.g. sensing, monitoring, and inspection). The objective of the research is to test the hypothesis that better accuracy, higher speed, and more flexibility can be achieved with the binary defocusing technique for 3D optical metrology and for 3D information processing. The approach is 1) to theoretically and experimentally investigate binary defocusing technique for overcoming the limitations of existing 3D optical metrology methods; 2) to explore an automated 3D optical metrology framework for measuring shiny object surfaces, and 3) to further investigate novel methods to process 3D video contents in real time for in-situ applications. \r\n\r\nIf successful, this project will result in two major research outcomes: 1) a novel instrumentation for automatically measuring objects difficult to be measured (e.g., shiny objects), and 2) a novel computational framework for 3D video data processing. This proposed technique will transform many fields by providing quantitative measure of physical objects including monitoring, sensing, and control for advanced manufacturing (e.g., additive manufacturing) and in-situ inspection; and will also introduce new paradigms to scientific areas including medicine, computer science, as well as other engineering disciplines. Knowledge gained from this research will also have many benefits to the society. For example, the high-speed 3D sensing techniques will drastically strengthen the competitiveness of the manufacturing industry by providing a novel tool for in-situ inspection and sensing. The 3D camera/sensor manufacturing is a multi-billion dollar industry, and thus commercializing 3D camera/sensor could have great economic benefits to the United States.",

Yet, the state-of-the-art 3D optical metrology techniques are typically good at measuring static or quasi-static diffuse objects. This project developed a novel automated optical method for precisely measuring 3D micron structures of partially specular objects (e.g., metal parts), and simultaneously deliver the 3D contents across network that could be valuable for intelligent machining and inspection. This research has proved the hypothesis is that the binary defocusing technique can simultaneously achieve better accuracy, higher speed, and more flexibility for 3D optical metrology. Specifically, this project has led the following research outcomes:</p>\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developed a system that achieved 2um depth resolution and 13 um spatial resolution.</p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developed a novel method that allowed the use of saturated images for partially specular object measurement automatically.</p>\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Developed a novel framework that simultaneously achieved 3D video acquisition, compression, delivery and decompression in real time through standard wired networks, and even through wireless networks with slightly loss of data quality.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The developed technology could transform many fields by providing quantitative measure of physical objects including monitoring, sensing, and control for intelligent machining and inspection.

The research results have been extensively disseminated including publishing17 journal articles, 1 book, 3 book chapters and many conference papers, as well as delivering invited talks at conference and department seminars and in general public. This project provided training opportunities for five Ph.D. students including one female, and three undergraduate students. We have also developed live 3D video system that was demonstrated even to four-year old kids, K-12 students and their parent, undergraduate students, and the general public. Furthermore, the high-speed 3D shape measurement technology will lead to major breakthroughs in fields important to public health and safety and could also enhance the current law enforcement. For instance, capturing crime scenes in 3D could help the current law enforcement to more accurately document the evidence for crime justices; and such technology provide surgeons with more intuitive situational awareness during robotic surgeries. In addition, commercializing 3D cameras could bring great economic benefits to the United States. Consumer electronics companies might be interested in incorporating 3D imaging sensor into their mobile devices (e.g., iPhone, iPad) for better communication, collaboration and networking. The PI is currently discussing with industrial partners to start a company to make such 3D imaging sensors commercially available.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/31/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Song&nbsp;Zhang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523048/1523048_10232359_1501528635681_Figure4_3dvideo--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523048/1523048_10232359_1501528635681_Figure4_3dvideo--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"3D video\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523048/1523048_10232359_1501528635681_Figure4_3dvideo--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"3D video\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Real-time 3D recorded video of human facial expressions with different quality of compression.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">This work is still under review.</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Song&nbsp;Zhang</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">3D video</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523048/1523048_10232359_1501528473679_Figure2_microstructure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523048/1523048_10232359_1501528473679_Figure2_microstructure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Micro structure measurement\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1523048/1523048_10232359_1501528473679_Figure2_microstructure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Micro structure measurement\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The proposed binary defocusing technique achieved 2 um depth resolution.
