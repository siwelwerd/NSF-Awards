The 2015 Wind Energy Research Workshop, hosted by the University of Massachusetts at Lowell (UNL), will be held on the UNL campus in mid-October of 2015.  Approximately 175 workshop participants, consisting of faculty and students, researchers from national laboratories, representatives from industry, and government officials from state and federal agencies, will create a diverse audience with the collective wealth of knowledge to identify relevant research opportunities need to drive the continued commercial development of wind energy in the United States. The two-day workshop will include keynote lectures, invited presentations, posters, exhibits, field trips, and panels.   \r\n\r\nThe 2015 Wind Energy Research Workshop presenters, discussion leaders, and participants will engage in four activities: 1) Identify research gaps that currently exist in the wind industry, 2) determine future research directions that will provide immediate and long-term benefits to the Nation?s ability to harness wind energy, 3) exchange information via several panel sessions with distinguished and knowledgeable speakers, and 4) educate the wind-energy community about the relevant issues that need to be addressed to reduce the cost of wind energy.  Breakout sessions will include the following topics: wind turbine manufacturing, structural health monitoring & diagnostics, composite materials, wind resource characterization & sensing, computational modeling, and energy storage, smart grid & transmission. The workshop will disseminate material and knowledge by publishing a report containing all publicly released presentations, and will highlight the outcomes in each focus area. A website will be created to post the presentation slides along with videos taken of the panel sessions.",
