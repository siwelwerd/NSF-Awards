 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a collaborative research project involving SUNY Stony Brook and Union College, an undergraduate institution. With the massive availability of data, the need to understand and be comfortable with data has gained increasing importance. There is now a great demand for individuals that have the skills to extract meaning from data. Academic programs in data science been created in many institutions, but going back to school to formally study this topic is not possible for a large segment of the population. In addition, not everyone really needs to become a formal data scientist to be competitive in this increasingly data-centric society and workplace where it can be of great benefit to become more data literate. Visualizations, such as the bar charts, line plots, maps, etc. that most people are familiar with, are helpful in explaining data. However, today's data sets often combine many different kinds of information and are, therefore, too complex to be represented with these basic visualizations. The goal of this project is to develop a visualization system that can represent data in such a way that a user can make sense of complex data without extensive training. This will involve advances in visualization techniques as well as novel approaches to presenting visualizations in an engaging way. The ANTE (Appeal, Narrate, Transform, Engage) system developed in this project has good potential to help increase the ability of citizens to become more knowledgeable participants in an increasingly data-centric society. The project provides research training for graduate students at SUNY Stony Brook and undergraduate students at Union College. The visualization tools and games will make an excellent environment for teaching both data and visual literacy, at all education levels. \r\n \r\nThe ANTE framework seeks to achieve its goal by developing novel solutions that address these four complementing elements: Appeal, Narrate, Transform, Engage. ANTE will appeal to the user's existing visual literacy by defining new powerful techniques that can faithfully transform complex high-dimensional data into simpler representations. One such representation is a novel 2D contextual data map that unlike other maps of this kind can maintain all relationships in the data matrix -- data to data, data to attribute, and attribute to attribute. Another is an interactive 3D shaded display that replaces the complex scatterplot matrices that are in standard use for high-D visualization. ANTE will use natural language to narrate the visualizations it produces. ANTE will also use animations to show how different representations of the data set can be transformed into each other. The project will investigate the use of such animations for teaching users to interpret more advanced visualizations. Finally, ANTE entices user engagement into data by offering (1) support for story authoring by ways of visual causality analysis; (2) capabilities for designing compelling infographics by fusing data with contextual images retrieved with web-scale image databases; (3) a narrative interface that uses learning from analogy to teach users more complex visualizations from familiar ones; and (4) a framework that employs techniques gleaned from gamification to incentivize engagement in user evaluation studies for all of our proposed techniques. Further information, research paper and developed artifacts, such as web interfaces to the visualization systems, data, video links, etc. are available at the project web site (http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~mueller/ANTE/).",

High-dimensional data are data with many attributes. For example, a college has a set of attributes like 'academic score', 'tuition', 'faculty', 'safety', 'athletics', 'nightlife', and many others that evaluate different aspects of a school. Conversely, a financial instrument has attributes like 'price/book', 'asset turnover', 'payout ratio', 'sector'&nbsp; etc. that allow investors to assess the properties of a potential investment.</p>\n<p>A principal challenge is the large number of attributes these everyday datasets can have. We devised a technology called 'Taxonomizer' by which users can construct fully labeled hierarchies, called taxonomies, from the original set of attributes. In such a taxonomy the original attributes are at the leaf nodes while the inner nodes are attributes of broader meaning called ''hypernyms' such as 'city' being a hypernym for 'location', 'nightlife', and 'dining'. With such a taxonomy in place users can control the number of attributes shown at any given moment. For example they may first examine the data visualizations for a diverse set of inner attributes to gain an overview, and then drill down the taxonomy for one of these to gain a more detailed understanding, &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A significant challenge in this research was that finding hypernyms in the general case has been an unsolved problem in machine learning so far. At the same time, humans struggle devising detailed taxonomies manually. Our Taxonomizer addresses this shortcoming; it is a visual analytics tool that strikes a middle ground, enrolling human common sense into the taxonomy generation. It augments a visual design interface with several machine learning tools to allow humans to construct effective attribute taxonomies with ease. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>A second tool our research has produced is 'ICE: An Interactive Configuration Explorer for High Dimensional Parameter Spaces'. There are many applications where users seek to explore the impact of the settings of several categorical variables with respect to one dependent numerical variable. For example, a computer systems analyst might want to study how the type of file system or storage device affects system performance and/or energy consumption. Or a firm might want to examine the hourly pay to its employees based on parameters like gender, race, marriage status, US residency, hiring source, etc. ICE allows analysts to learn how the dependent numerical variable is affected by the parameter settings given multiple optimization objectives. It offers an intuitive visual interface by which users can interactively filter the variables to optimize for certain goals such as achieving a system with maximum performance, low variance, etc.</p>\n<p>A third tool we devised is 'ColorMapND: A Data-Driven Approach and Tool for Mapping Multivariate Data to Color'. One example use of our tool is the creation of multivariate choropleth maps. A choropleth map uses differences in coloring within predefined areas to indicate the average values of a property or quantity in those areas. For example, it may visualize the average income for each US state along a specific color scale on a map of the US. Problems arise when users wish to study several attributes simultaneously, such as income, education, unemployment, jobs, etc. It requires them to study several maps side by side, making it difficult to spot interactions that may exist among certain attributes.</p>\n<p>The ColorMapND tool we devised overcomes this problem. It determines a proper and consistent color map from first embedding the multivariate data samples into an interactive multivariate color mapping display and then fusing this display with a convex color space. Using this layout, the color of a multivariate data sample can then be obtained by first mapping it into the proper map display location and then colorizing it with the color at that location. We have used this tool for many practical applications such as studying the mixing effects of environmental pollution in the geospatial domain and the interaction of chemical components of battery material on a substrate. The fusion of several multispectral images into a single colorized image enables users to see interesting and even hidden patters in terrain data. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A fourth methodology our research has produced addresses the causal interactions that often exist in multivariate data.
