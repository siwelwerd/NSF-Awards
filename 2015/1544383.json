 "awd_abstract_narration": "Several highly ambitious, large-scale, billion-pound research projects that aim to understand the human brain are currently under way. In Europe, The Human Brain Project is focused on accelerating brain research by integrating data available from a multitude of disparate research projects through the development of a multi-scale, multi-level model of the human brain - the 100 billion neurons modelling and simulation challenge. In the US, The Brain Initiative aims to reconstruct the full record of neural activity across complete neural circuits - the 100 billion neurons recording challenge. These are clearly huge, but worthy challenges that can benefit from an understanding of the principles of neural computation of much smaller yet sufficiently complex brains. The fruit fly brain has become one of the most popular model organisms to study neural computation and for relating brain structure to function. Many of the genes and proteins expressed in the mammalian brain are also conserved in the genome of the fruit fly. Remarkably, the fruit fly is capable of a host of complex nonreactive behaviors that are governed by a brain containing only ~100,000 neurons. The relationship between the fly's brain and its behaviors can be experimentally probed using a powerful toolkit of genetic techniques for manipulation of the fly's neural circuitry. Novel experimental methods for precise recordings of the fly's neuronal responses to stimuli and for mapping neurons and synapses in Drosophila nervous system have provided access to an immense amount of valuable data regarding the fly's neural connectivity map and its processing of sensory stimuli. These features coupled with the growing ethical and economic pressures to reduce the use of mammals in research, explain the growing interest in Drosophila-based brain models, not only to understand sensing, perception and neural computation, but also to gain mechanistic insights that may inform our efforts to address neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, in humans. \r\n\r\nThis project aims to design, implement and experimentally evaluate a potentially transformative open-source fly brain simulation platform capable of simulating ~135,000 neurons that make up the adult Drosophila brain. This computational infrastructure will be based on the recently established Graphic Processor Units (GPU)-enabled Neurokernel software platform. The modular simulation platform will integrate all knowledge about the Drosophila brain as a set of interconnected simulation modules which describe the operation of about 41 Local Processing Units (LPUs), six hubs and their interconnections, partly elucidated by detailed EM imaging studies. The simulation platform will be used to develop and validate a first draft model that incorporates the most advanced biophysical and/or functional models of the neurons and the latest published synaptic connections maps. The main focus will be on developing detailed models of the early visual system (retina, lamina, medulla) and of the early olfactory system (OSNs, antennal lobe, mushroom body, lateral horn). These models will integrate complete models of the visual and olfactory systems. The brain simulation platform will enable for the first time the isolated and integrated emulation of fly brain model neural circuits and their connectivity patterns (e.g., sensory and locomotion systems) and other parts of the fly's nervous system on clusters of GPUs. Using the Neurokernel simulation platform it will be possible to generate data sufficiently fast to enable researchers to compare and tune the input-output characteristics of virtual neurons on-line, while the experiment is running.",
