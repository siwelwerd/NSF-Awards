 "awd_abstract_narration": "Currently, synthetic bone substitutes are poorly designed materials that do not effectively induce new bone formation. Use of these products increases risk of delayed bone healing. Bone matrix proteins (BMPs) stimulate new bone formation, but are expensive and are known to cause adverse effects in patients, as documented recently by the FDA. The team has developed a cost-effective, organic biomaterial for enhanced bone mineralization and orthopedic regeneration. Through the use of an innovative, materials design approach employing the aforementioned bone proteins, this project aims at commercializing a new class of hybrid organic matrices that can significantly enhance the growth of new bone tissue.  The development of the bone substitute seeks to shift paradigms in orthopedic regenerative medicine. The success of this work will usher in a new class of bioengineered matrices that safely induce new bone formation and prevent occurrence of non-unions. An increased efficacy in bone grafting procedures will directly translate to lowered hospitals costs and better patient outcomes.\r\n\r\nNon-collagenous proteins (NCPs) osteocalcin (OC) and osteopontin (OPN) are building blocks of bone, and are released by cells into the extracellular environment during the mineralization process, where they are incorporated into the matrix due to their affinity for bone mineral. OC and OPN are considered powerful regulators of bone matrix quality, strongly influencing mechanical integrity of bone. NCPs function as link proteins connecting the collagen and mineral phases of bone matrix together, and as regulators of bone mineral properties.  The self-healing potential of NCPs due, to their interactions with both, the mineral and collagen phases in bone matrix, makes them ideal candidates to explore in the field of orthopedic regeneration. By providing the body with these building blocks of bone, the team seeks to achieve enhanced mineralization and accelerated bone regeneration.  The team is fabricating and characterizing collagen-based matrices containing NCPs that now need to be characterized and tested for efficacy through in vitro and in vivo studies.  Preliminary conversations with clinicians and angel investors, have led the team to believe that a successful test of efficacy will be a significant milestone in the commercialization of its innovation.",
