 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a workshop to facilitate the development of long-term, sustainable collaboration between US and Japan in the area of advanced structural and infrastructure materials. The workshop, entitled 'The US-Japan Materials Genome (MG) Workshop,' will promote the aims of the US Materials Genome Initiative, an initiative announced by President Obama in 2011, which aims to double the speed of discovery and deployment of new materials, at a fraction of the cost. The initiative has already had a wide impact on society and on the materials research community, spurring new collaborations and innovations resulting from integrated use of experimental and computational materials research approaches, and open access to materials data. This workshop will further these aims by establishing collaborations with materials researchers in Japan, to jointly address some of the key issues facing researchers who wish to manage, maintain, and share large amounts of materials data. Anticipated outcomes include the creation and implementation of a long term, sustainable, bilateral collaborative program, and a joint platform for materials informatics and databases.\r\n\r\nStructural materials play a central role in national physical infrastructure development, and both the US and Japan have substantial efforts in developing structural materials for applications in maintaining, and improving their large-scale physical infrastructure. In addition, both nations have efforts to discover, design, and deploy advanced structural materials for dynamic applications such as the automotive, aerospace, and power generation industries. These are major undertakings that require a concerted, coordinated effort in all aspects, ranging from fundamental materials science research, to the acquisition, curation, and maintenance of high-quality data, and, ultimately, to manufacturing products that are energy efficient, environmentally sustainable, and durable. The goals of this and subsequent workshops is to bring together a diverse group of researchers from the US and Japan to discuss ways to use predictive theory and modeling, combined with machine learning, data mining, and rapid-acquisition of experimental data to produce highly efficient and low-cost manufactured products, and to accelerate materials design, discovery, and deployment through the open sharing of materials data.",

As stated by Dr. John P. Holdren (Director, OSTP), the four goals and challenges of the US-MGI include: \"Leading a culture shift in materials-science research to encourage and facilitate an integrated team approach; integrating experiment, computation, and theory and equipping the materials community with advanced tools and techniques; making digital data accessible; and creating a world-class materials-science and engineering workforce that is trained for careers in academia or industry.\"  NIST has worked closely with its US Government Partners (including NSF, DOE, NASA and DOD) to advance the goals of the US-MGI, with new funding specifically dedicated towards this end.  In the meantime, Japanese science agencies (principally, JST and MEXT) have also been responding to the demands for a paradigm shift in materials research and development, enabling new materials with high performance to be designed rapidly, and produced at much lower cost.  In much the same spirit as the US-MGI, several new Japanese initiatives have been launched through comprehensive integration among theory, experiment, computation and data-driven approaches.  These include: the National Innovation Hub, Elements Strategy Initiative, Structural Materials for Innovation, as well as Materials Innovation Platform for many other related programs by utilization of cyber and real space infrastructure.  Common to these US and Japanese initiatives is the concept of spanning the entire materials development cycle from fundamental materials science research to acquiring, curating, maintaining high-quality data, and ultimately manufacturing products that are energy efficient, environmentally sustainable and durable.  Current examples of programs underway include discovery, design, and deployment of advanced structural materials for large scale infrastructure development and a broad range of industrial applications including aerospace, power generation and transportation. \n\nFollowing the launching of these new programs, \"The First US-Japan Materials Genome Workshop\" was designed to identify potential joint research opportunities that would address the goals of the materials genome paradigm and provide mutual benefits for both nations. To this end, the workshop brought together a diverse group of researchers from the US and Japan for information exchange and the development of bi-lateral projects in the years to come.    The principal organizers were from NIST, NIMS, and Northwestern University, and the workshop was jointly funded by NIST, NSF, MEXT, and JST.  The two day workshop was hosted by NIMS in Tsukuba, Japan on June 23-24, 2015.   \n\nOutcome and Broader Impact\n\nThe lectures and the discussion groups covered the following topics: Materials design by calculation, simulation, and modeling; Materials synthesis and data-base; Materials characterization and data-mining; Research infrastructure for advanced materials development. \n\nIt is clear that while the focus of each discussion group was different, there were cross-cutting needs each group had.  For example, the theorists needed reliable experimental data to check their models.  The experimentalists, on the other hand, needed credible models to design and process new materials with desirable properties for product development.  At the same time materials informatics researchers needed accurate and reliable data-bases to develop the materials genome paradigm. To take up these challenges and questions, each discussion group has identified ways to collaborate through personnel visits and exchanges, and the use of complementary facilities in each country.  It is clearly critical that the experimentalists and the theorists work together to help meet the needs of each group. In the extreme, a tight coupling between experiment and theory represents a paradigm shift in the conduct of materials research, and is required for successful collaborations between materials genome approaches in the two countries. Good examples of collaboration have already started: 1. Brinson (NIST-funded CHiMaD participant) and colleagues at Northwestern are developing a nanocomposite data resource (Nanomine) consisting of statistical learning and property predictive tools, and it is to be digitally connected with the PolyInfo database at NIMS. 2. A joint effort led by NIST, NIMS, and U. of Maryland in high throughput characterization of transparent conducting oxides films.  In the spirit of the materials genome paradigm, these and future collaborative efforts will seek to provide critical data input for broader models of materials discovery and design.\n\nThroughout the two days of discussions, there were strong synergistic interactions among the sectors represented.
