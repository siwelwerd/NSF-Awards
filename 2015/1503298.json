 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical\r\n\r\nThe salinity of water in the Arctic Ocean determines much of its buoyancy and thus how stable the various layers of water are. This is important because stability of the stratification of the ocean determines its circulation, heat transport and formation of deep water, which in turn affect the local and regional climate system, as well as ocean/atmosphere/climate interaction in lower latitudes. Thus understanding the basic processes of the circulation, buildup, and release of lower salinity water (called 'freshwater') is of fundamental importance for understanding future states of the Arctic Ocean. This project will study the dynamics and variability of the freshwater components and the overall freshwater inventories, in the region of the ocean north of Greenland, where water and sea ice ultimately take one of two pathways south. The main goal of the study is to understand how buoyancy is redistributed within the Arctic Ocean and how freshwater accumulates and is released. The project is especially interested in the role distinct freshwater components play in this process. For this purpose data collected as part of the Arctic Observing Network will be compared to model simulations and vice versa to test hypotheses concerning the circulation, accumulation and release of freshwater and its components in the Arctic Ocean and to test the performance of an Arctic Ocean model. This project will create data products for researchers and educators interested in the Arctic and its response to climate change. Circulation patterns of the individual freshwater components and other synthesized outputs, along with information and documentation needed to assist educators, will be made publicly available through an online site that is expected to have significant traffic from educators in academia and secondary school levels. This project will provide the core of a PhD dissertation for a graduate student. \r\n\r\nTechnical\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the basic processes of the circulation, buildup, and release of freshwater is of fundamental importance for examining possible future scenarios of the freshwater lens covering the Arctic Ocean, the role of freshwater in internal circulation within the Arctic, and the role of freshwater in deep water formation in the convective regions of the Nordic seas and the North Atlantic. This project will study the dynamics and variability of the freshwater components and the overall freshwater inventories, in the Switchyard (SY) region in the context of an Arctic Ocean-wide analysis of freshwater component sources and pathways. The main goal of the study is to understand how buoyancy is redistributed within the Arctic Ocean and how freshwater accumulates and is released. There will be special emphasis on the role distinct freshwater components play in this process. \r\n\r\nRecent long-term observations conducted in the Switchyard (SY) region as part of the Arctic Observing Network (AON) program, have revealed detailed information on both the total freshwater balance, and the components contributing to it: Pacific Water (PW), Meteoric Water (MW: River Runoff and P-E), and Sea Ice Meltwater (SIMW). The SY observations along a section between Alert and the North Pole show rapid changes in the contributions of individual freshwater components to the total inventory along with gradual changes in the total freshwater content. From backtracking the surface circulation in time based on sea ice drift patterns, the group infers that the rapid changes in the freshwater components are probably due to shifts in the sea ice and surface water source regions and pathways on time scales as short as one year, the frequency of their observations. \r\n\r\nThis project will combine the SY freshwater component data with those from previous (icebreaker) expeditions to characterize the main features of their distributions. In a second step, the team will extend the sea ice tracking method developed by Maslanik and Fowler to include Ekman transport in the surface ocean and will download GCM runs that simulate individual FW components. They will track the observed freshwater components back to their source regions, and forward to their exit points from the Arctic, and will identify mechanisms impacting the freshwater component circulation, especially in the SY region where they have an 8-year time series. The principal intellectual contributions will come from integrating observed freshwater component inventories and pathways with those obtained from model simulations, inferring the dynamics governing the freshwater component distributions and their adjustment as functions of source terms and atmospheric forcing.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes report, SY analysis project\n\nNovember, 2019\n\n \n\nThis project was designed to study the circulation and properties of ocean water and floating sea ice in the Arctic Ocean, with a special emphasis on the area north of northeast Canada and Greenland which we called the ?switchyard region.?  The metaphor is that of a train switching yard, where tracks merge from a wide area and then diverge again to serve other areas.  This Switchyard area is where waters and ice from all over the Arctic Ocean merge, mix, and then flow southward into the North Atlantic Ocean on the west and east sides of Greenland.  \n\nWhat we found in our research is that upper ocean waters in this region are strongly influenced by the large river inputs that flow into the Arctic Ocean, primarily from Russia but also from Canada and Alaska.  This has implications for the ocean water properties that then flow southward into the North Atlantic Ocean.  We also found that the thick ice in the Switchyard region largely originates from central Siberian continental shelves, while nearby thick ice to the southwest (toward Alaska) is fed by a completely different pathway that originates in the Chukchi Sea (northwest of Alaska).  This means that the eventual fate of these two thick ice areas may be different in coming years. \n\nA recent revolution in how we view the transfer of momentum between sea ice and ocean has occurred, thanks to a series of papers on this subject, one of which we published.  The traditional view has been that generally speaking, in most of the Arctic Ocean, the wind blows, which makes the floating sea ice cover move, which in turn makes the underlying ocean move.  However, since the start of this century, ocean currents have accelerated in some areas (e.g., the area north of Alaska known as the ?Beaufort Gyre?) so that this causality has been partially reversed; i.e., there are large areas and long time periods when the ocean is actually responsible for making the sea ice move, not the wind.  \n\nWe published several other studies funded by this project, including (i) a book chapter which reviewed the ocean?s role in Arctic sea ice change, (ii) a study of how sea ice melting influences biological productivity in the Greenland Sea, (iii) a study of snow chemistry in the Switchyard region, and others on ocean and sea ice dynamics.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Steele"
