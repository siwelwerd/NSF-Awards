This project will also contribute to training the next generation of scientists by actively engaging undergraduate students in research at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse (UW-L).\r\n\r\nThe nature of low-lying excitations, K = 0+ bands in deformed nuclei remain enigmatic in the eld. This project focuses on the search for vibrational excitations in deformed nuclei. The UW-L Nuclear Science Group has recently measured the lifetimes of states in 162Dy during the period of the grant, the group will analyze the results and interpret the implications the measurements. The UW-L Nuclear Science Group will also conduct detector work during the academic year in a small local laboratory. The results will be broadly disseminated through publications and conference presentations by the PI and undergraduate researchers.",
