But cybersecurity is also a major public policy issue today - and policy makers need to know about cybersecurity to make informed decisions. However, policy makers who need to learn about cybersecurity generally lack the time to learn it deeply - \"just-in-time\" learning is a much better way to characterize their approach. Under these circumstances, their learning framework deviates from that of traditional students. \r\n\r\nThis project develops cybersecurity education materials specifically targeted toward individuals who may not have subject matter expertise about cybersecurity, nor the time to be able to undertake in-depth, semester(s)-long coursework.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCybersecurity education has usually focused on the needs of individuals who must take action to improve their personal cybersecurity postures -- that is, their own capabilities to resist cybersecurity threats.  But cybersecurity is also a major public policy issue today. Policy makers need to know about cybersecurity to make informed decisions about public policy (e.g., legislation, oversight) as it relates to the nation's cybersecurity posture.   Although some policy makers are themselves specialists in cybersecurity, many others are not.  The proposed project takes advantage of Stanford's unique combination of strengths in cyber policy and security and online education to create and deliver a new set of online educational resources in cybersecurity designed for policy makers who are not specialists in cybersecurity.\n\nIntellectual Merit:   The project will address an entirely underserved audience -- the audience of non-specialist policy makers concerned about cybersecurity.  The educational program will enable users to begin to develop a reliable knowledge base that will help to inform them in their public policy decisions regarding cybersecurity. \n\nBroader impacts:  Improving ability of policy makers to use contemporary sources to weigh decisions about cybersecurity will help promote a robust and sustainable cybersecurity posture for the nation.  In addition, testing and refinement of the online educational materials for the specified target audience will identify effective ways to communicate to this audience. This effort could stimulate further research to clarify best practices for reaching the audience of cybersecurity decision makers.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/05/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John C.
