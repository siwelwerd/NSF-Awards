 "awd_abstract_narration": "The provided support enables about 15 graduate/undergraduate students enrolled in the U.S. institutions to participate in the premiere conference in the multimedia area, ACM Multimedia 2015, to be held 26 - 30 October 2015, Brisbane, Australia (http://www.acmmm.org/2015/). It is very valuable for students to engage in the unique research and education programs provided by this conference. This is the worldwide premier conference and a key world event to display scientific achievements and innovative industrial products in the multimedia field, covering latest technical papers, technical demos, grand challenge competition, open source software competition, doctoral symposium, and an interactive art program stimulating artists and computer scientists to meet and discover together the frontiers of artistic communication. Participation in such event allows students to learn/experience innovative research, develop professional networks, and interact with industry and academia leaders involved in practical applications and technology transfer. The availability of support will be announced to the broad community and students, and underrepresented groups will be particularly encouraged to apply.\r\n \r\nACM Multimedia 2015 calls for full papers presenting novel theoretical and algorithmic solutions addressing problems across the domain of multimedia and related applications. The conference also calls for short papers presenting novel, thought-provoking ideas and promising (preliminary) results in realizing these ideas. The active participation in ACM Multimedia 2015 will be valuable for students to understand the state-of-the-art techniques in multimedia area. The Doctoral Symposium will provide a forum to present Ph.D. students' ongoing work and receive feedback from established researchers.  This will foster establishment of a supportive worldwide community, and build professional networks for PhD students. In addition, the Brave New Idea (BNI) Program focuses on highly innovative ideas and/or paradigm shifts in conventional theory and practice of multimedia computing, communications and applications, and may involve cross-disciplinary efforts. This session is especially useful for students or junior researchers who are exploring new research direction. Multimedia Grand Challenges presents a set of problems and issues from industry leaders, geared to engage the Multimedia research community in solving relevant, interesting and challenging questions about the industry's 3-5 year vision for multimedia.  The ACM Multimedia Open-Source Software Competition is designed to promote the contribution of freely available resources, which advance the field by providing a common set of tools for building and improving multimedia research prototypes. Finally, the large Technical Demonstration session is intended as real, practical, and interactive proof of the presenters' research ideas and scientific or engineering contributions. This session allows students to demonstrate their own novel research prototypes, and also to view and interact first hand with live evidence of innovative solutions and ideas in the field of multimedia.",

ACM Multimedia is the worldwide premier conference and a key world event to display scientific achievements and innovative industrial products in the multimedia field.</p>\n<p>Among a large number of applications from students of institutions all over the U.S., 13 students were selected to receive the travel grant for partially covering the transportation cost, the registration fee or the accommodation cost. Among the grantees, there were 4 female students and 3 U.S. citizens/permanent residents. A variety of research works from the grantees were presented in this conference including 7 full papers, 4 short papers, 2 doctoral symposium papers and 1 technical demo. By participating conversation and discussion about their ideas and questions in research and career with their peers and scholars of various experiences, student grantees developed overall research direction and objectives. Also, in the various programs such as doctoral symposium, brave new idea program, technical demos, and grand challenges, they got chance to be trained to conduct specific research issues, and to stimulate their future research.</p>\n<p>Notably, the doctoral symposium turned out to be a very successful event wtih presence of more than 45 people, including selected students, sponsors, and senior academic and industrial members. The symposium started with a joint lunch with people mixed on different tables, so interaction between students, sponsors and seniors happened naturally. Rather than having each student present her or his work with an oral presentation, the session was designed as an interactive poster session where the students could present and highlight their work. A number of reviewers were asked to act as mentor and to engage in an in-depth technical discussion with &lsquo;their&rsquo; students. More than 30 students receiving travel grants, sponsored by <strong>NSF</strong> and other organizations to present their papers at ACMMM were invited to attend this event. In addition, eight students showcased their doctoral thesis work during the interactive poster session. Sponsors from industry and academia provided feedback on the students&rsquo; work, enjoyed the science and learned from the proposed solutions. We also invited all students who received a travel grant, so that they could learn what it takes to be a future doctoral symposium presenter. This setup worked out really well, and it became a very lively session. The syposium presenters received special recognition, the sponsors were acknowledged and all the travel grantees expressed their interests in participating the future doctoral symposium.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/30/2016<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Qi&nbsp;Tian</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div
