 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many migratory species provide benefits to humans, which are called ecosystem services. An example of an ecosystem service provided by a migratory species is the consumption of insect pests by bats, which minimizes crop damage and agricultural losses. Another example is bird watching and hunting of pintail ducks, which provides people with recreational opportunities. Migratory species spend parts of the year across a geographic range, which often spans political boundaries. Migratory species might provide more benefits to people in certain regions than in others. Additionally, migratory species might receive greater benefits from habitats in particular areas within their range than from others. This could cause a mismatch between the areas where a species provides the benefits and the areas from which it receives support. This mismatch is called a spatial subsidy. Simply put, areas with habitat that provide the greatest benefit to migratory species are subsidizing areas where people receive most of the species' benefits. This can lead to an inequality - between people in areas that subsidize the species versus people in areas that receive the benefits - and to difficulties for wildlife management and habitat protection.  This project will examine the spatial subsidies of an exemplary migratory species: Northern Pintail ducks (Anas acuta). Pintails are an important species for bird watching, sports, and subsistence (food) hunting. Previous studies indicate that breeding habitat in Canada and in the northern continental United States subsidize bird watching and hunting of pintails in California and elsewhere. This suggests that continued pintail hunting and recreational activities are dependent on the conservation of the species' breeding habitats. \r\n\r\nThis research will develop a model to calculate spatial subsidies in the coupled natural-human systems of the migratory species: Northern Pintails.  Researchers will measure how modeled values of spatial subsidies may influence decision-making related to migratory species in coupled systems in North America.  This model will integrate four components that feed into one another: (1) a Habitat Distribution sub-model; (2) a Habitat Dependence sub-model; (3) an Ecosystem Services sub-model, which (a) valuates ecosystem services, (b) assesses spatial subsidies, and (c) provides decision-makers with modeled scenarios of impacts on services and spatial subsidies to identify how they might alter land-use and conservation actions in response, which is modeled in (4), the Drivers of Change sub-model. Two drivers of change are considered: land-use change, and change in the societal demand for their services.  Finally, this project will also survey agency and NGO decision-makers to determine the degree to which they might use spatial subsidies information in resource management decisions, and conduct a policy analysis of how the spatial subsidies concept might support the objectives of international agreements on migratory species.",

Environmental change in any part of these migrating species&rsquo; habitats can have consequences both for migratory populations and the roles they play in coupled systems. If these species typically provide benefits to people during migration, population fluctuations may indirectly affect human well-being by altering availability of these benefits. The idea that environmental change in one location can have consequences for human well-being in distant locations is formally recognized as&nbsp;telecoupling.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The research by our team of natural and social scientists seeks to understand these interactions and to develop innovative solutions to environmental governance challenges. We focus on the telecoupled systems of three iconic, North American migratory species:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Monarch butterflies</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Monarch butterflies migrate up to 3,000 miles from overwintering areas in central Mexico to summer breeding sites in the United States and southern Canada. Monarchs don&rsquo;t pollinate agricultural crops or provide pest-control, but they do have a high perceived worth throughout North America. They carry deep spiritual importance for Indigenous people in central Mexico, and surveys in the US show most citizens support monarch conservation. Unfortunately, intensive agriculture in the US and Canada, disease, and climate change have resulted in monarch population declines of up to 80% in the past 20 years. Some estimates suggest the species&rsquo; magnificent migrations may not last another decade unless drastic steps are taken to reverse the rate of habitat loss. We used the spatial subsidies approach to demonstrate the dependence on habitat in Mexico for the provision of ecosystem services in the US by monarch butterflies (see Appendix 1).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Mexican free-tailed bats</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Mexican free-tailed bats migrate north from central and southern Mexico to the US border region and form huge colonies to raise their young. These bats are insectivores, eating a wide variety of flying insects including cotton bollworm moths, which do significant damage to cotton and soybean crops. For individual farmers in the region, this free removal of vast quantities of these crop pests can represent considerable savings in pesticide costs (see Appendix 2).&nbsp;Calculations of the value in dollars of these services are an important incentive for governments to pass habitat protection measures.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Northern pintail ducks</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike for the other two species, a governance system that recognizes the telecoupled relationships between breeding and wintering pintail habitat already exists for waterfowl. Significant funds are generated for pintail habitat conservation in the US, Mexico, and Canada through the sale of Duck Stamps and taxes on firearms and ammunition in the US.<strong> </strong>Pintails migrate between summer breeding habitat in Alaska and Canada, and winter habitat in California, the southern states of the US, and Mexico. Among ecosystem values that pintails provide are recreational hunting and wildlife viewing by birdwatchers and ecotourists, as well as subsistence hunting and cultural values for Indigenous groups.<strong> </strong>Our research shows that breeding habitat in the Prairie Pothole Region, and in Alaska and northern Canada, provides a net spatial subsidy to hunters and birdwatchers in wintering regions, especially California (see Appendix 3).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Results of our work</strong></p>\n<p>We produced models that estimate the flow and value of ecosystem services from migratory species in telecoupled systems. With the present funding, we expanded from Semmens et al. (2011) and Lopez-Hoffman et al. (2013) in Semmens et al. (2018) to assess gross flows of ecosystem services across space. We used the spatial subsidies approach to demonstrate the dependence on habitat in Mexico for the provision of ecosystem services in the US by monarch butterflies (Semmens et al. 2018), northern pintail ducks (Bagstad et al. 2019), and Mexican free-tailed bats (Lopez-Hoffman et al. 2017).&nbsp; We showed significant willingness-to-pay for conservation of pintails and Mexican free-tailed bats by households in countries across these species&rsquo; North American ranges (Haefele et al. 2019).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A key test of the value of spatial subsidies to real-world environmental governance was to learn how useful it might be to policymakers and managers of migratory species. Our interviews with governmental and non-governmental stakeholders focused primarily on people who work on a wide range of migratory species. Interviewees consistently expressed interest and enthusiasm for the spatial subsidies concept. We also identified some potential limitations. Spatial subsidies quantify ecosystem service flows, which may provide a means to target funding to certain areas, perhaps at the expense of others. There will also be significant political and policy barriers to overcome in shifting investments from one place to another.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A final outcome is that our spatial subsidies work demonstrates that the benefits of migratory species conservation are not distributed equitably. The challenges for sustainable environmental governance of migratory species can, therefore, only be properly defined and resolved once ecosystem service flows have been more fully characterized by in-depth assessments of their equity contexts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/03/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Laura&nbsp;Lopez Hoffman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1518359/1518359_10388131_1635914183332_Appendix-1_monarch-ES-flows--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1518359/1518359_10388131_1635914183332_Appendix-1_monarch-ES-flows--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Appendix-1.
