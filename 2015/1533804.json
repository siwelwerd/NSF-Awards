 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research project will provide a new class of tools for survey practitioners to improve the stability and precision of survey estimates.  Surveys represent a key source of data for government, business, and academics.  The cost of conducting surveys has increased dramatically during the last decade, however, while response rates have declined.  The new methods developed by this project will take advantage of \"soft\" or vague information often available in practice in many different contexts but not directly used or used in only \"ad hoc\" ways.  This information is referred to as \"shape constraints\" in statistics.  The new shape-constrained survey estimation tools will represent an important advance in design-based estimation, which continues to be the primary approach used in large-scale government surveys.  At the same time, this work will be the first application of shape constraints in the survey context.  The new tools will be especially useful for large-scale survey agencies and have the potential to lead to considerably improved efficiency and to result in estimates that satisfy the qualitative properties expected by data users.  The investigators will develop user-friendly software.\r\n\r\nThis research project will develop new survey estimation methods for a variety of different types of shape constraints that can be encountered in practice, together with statistical tools to assess whether the shape constraint holds in the survey population and to estimate the precision of the estimates.  Shape-constrained estimation will be introduced in several important survey methodological areas of practical interest, including in estimation for sub-populations, post-stratification, adjusting for nonresponse and small area estimation.  The research will result in new statistical algorithms for weighted constrained estimation, in statistical testing methods for the validity of the shape constraints for survey data, and in a new class of weight calibration methods that are based on shape constraints.  The project is supported by the Methodology, Measurement, and Statistics Program and a consortium of federal statistical agencies as part of a joint activity to support research on survey and statistical methodology.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Eight papers on population domain estimation and inference with shape and order constraints have been produced to date, and the new methodologies have been made available in the csurvey package on CRAN.   \n\nIntellectual Merit: These papers describe new methods for design-based estimation and inference for population domain means, extending the traditional H\\'ajek estimator to incorporate {\\em a priori} assumptions of ordering and shape.   Wu, Meyer, and Opsomer (2016) formulated the isotonic domain mean estimator, for the simple order restriction, and methods for more general constraints such as partial orderings were proposed in  Oliva-Aviles, Meyer, and Opsomer (2020).  A criterion for checking the monotonicity assumption is given in Oliva-Aviles, Meyer, and Opsomer (2019).  When the assumptions are valid, imposing restrictions on the estimators will ensure that the a priori information is respected, and in addition allows information to be pooled across domains.  This pooling results in estimators with substantially smaller variance as well as a new method for estimation and confidence intervals for domain means in empty or small sample size domains.\n\nXu, Meyer, and Opsomer (2020) proposed a method to further improve the estimation of the covariance matrix for these constrained domain estimators, using a mixture of possible covariance matrices obtained from the inequality constraints.  Xu and Meyer (2022) adapted the one-sided testing methodology to inference with survey data. Liao, Xi, and Meyer (2022) describes the csurvey package and demonstrates its practical utility.    \n\nBroader impacts: The csurvey package available in CRAN implements the new methods with user-friendly functions.  Commands for implementing many useful partial and complete orderings are coded, and the user has the option of specifying any particular set of constraints in matrix form.  The mixture covariance is created using the covariance matrix for the unconstrained domain estimators, which is obtained by calling the survey package of Lumley (2004).  The package is designed to be useful in analyzing the results of large surveys.   Three graduate students were supported from this grant, including members of under-represented groups.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/05/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mary C Meyer"
