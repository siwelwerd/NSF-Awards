 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project at Holyoke Community College in Holyoke, Massachusetts will recruit, retain, and encourage academically talented, financially needy, students to complete their associate's degrees and continue their education.  In order to address regional and national STEM workforce needs, as many as 20 scholars will be exposed to an academic climate meant to inspire them to become engineers, chemists, mathematicians, and physicists.  The scholars will participate in a STEM 101 course, which includes a curriculum is based on Complete College America's model for developing \"meta majors\" to help students choose reasonable academic majors and reduce time to degree completion.  Students will also have the option to attend seminar activities, which will include speakers and field trips to transfer universities and industry partners, college success workshops, and diversity training.  Moreover, continuing scholars will be encouraged to act as ambassadors in college access activities, as well as champions for new scholars.\r\n\r\nResearch shows that STEM majors must be exposed to a robust learning environment.  Thus, the PI team has created a comprehensive plan for academic support services, mentoring, career counseling, and assistance for community college student transfer to four year schools.  The STEM 101 course will offer students a positive first year STEM learning experience that introduces content, experiential learning, and STEM career exploration.   Additionally, the seminar series will help integrate students into the life of the college.  Formative evaluation will be used to address aspects of the project that need improvement, assess student engagement and support, and review academic challenges through a modified version of the Community College Survey of Student Engagement.  Summative evaluation will consist of an analysis of student attitudes and perceptions (surveys and interviews) regarding the active learning community, activities to improve STEM discipline awareness, and academic progress.  Dissemination of the results of evaluation will be submitted to journals such as the Community College Journal, and the Community College Times, and, in so doing, help to expand the knowledge base regarding the circumstances under which scholarship awards of this type are successful.",

Educational activities in the program broadened the students' perspectives about the STEM field through a STEM Seminar, speakers, field trips, and interactions with undergraduates and faculty of other institutions, including opportunities for research. As scholars progressed in the program, they became peer mentors for new students and were encouraged to do undergraduate research as one of their semester projects. All scholars were required to select a semester project of their choice that included mentoring, individual research, or community outreach.</p>\n<p><strong>Outcomes Addressing the Intellectual Merit&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>The grant served 76 distinct students; of these, 60 will have graduated or transferred in STEM.&nbsp; HCC&rsquo;s program built a sense of community and professional development through field trips, speakers, undergraduate conferences,&nbsp; research-lab visits. Scholars were involved in projects as part of their STEM Seminar, including civic engagement or research projects. Students were engaged in the larger STEM community by providing outreach and mentoring to foster kids, high-school students, ABE students, and transition to college students. They were also engaged in HCC&rsquo;s Office for Students with Disabilities and Deaf Studies (OSDDS) STEM project in which they rendered a 3D version of the campus for the visually impaired.&nbsp; More recently, students worked on 3D face coverings during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>\n<p>The STEM Scholar Program retention and graduation data was much higher for STEM Scholars than for other STEM majors. Their fall 2018 to fall 2019 retention rate was 77%, compared to 58% for all STEM students. &nbsp;Three-year NSF S-STEM graduation data for Scholars in the fall 2015 and 2016 cohorts was 92% and 64% respectively, while only approximately 20% of their STEM counterparts graduated within the same three-year periods.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through the provision of scholarships and participation in the program, participant diversity increased. Demographics show increased participation in STEM by women and minorities contributing to the goal of diversifying the STEM pool. Our average demographics for the grant period include 42% women and 43% ethnic minority, clearly exceeding the HCC S- STEM eligible program demographics (32% women and 26% ethnic minority).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong></p>\n<p>1)<em>&nbsp;Diversification of the pool of qualified and educated STEM students</em>&nbsp;from underrepresented groups as mentioned under Intellectual Merit</p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;<em>Advancing the knowledge&nbsp;</em>about successful educational practices in STEM: The Scholars&rsquo; achievements (persistence, graduation and transfer rates) were much higher than those of non-Scholar STEM students.
