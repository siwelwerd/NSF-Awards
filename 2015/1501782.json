 "awd_abstract_narration": "Very different types of organisms can interact in ways that allow them to survive together when they would be unable to survive alone. These interactions can have major impacts on entire ecosystems. This project will test whether termites, bacteria, and a fungus depend on each other in a tropical rainforest. Scientists hypothesize that wood-feeding termites disperse the reproductive structures of a wood-decaying fungus so it can colonize new substrates, that the fungus houses bacteria beneficial to termites, and that the bacteria receive shelter inside the fungus. Because this three-way interaction is built on wood-feeding organisms, results of the study will augment knowledge of how decomposition, or nutrient recycling, occurs in tropical ecosystems. Additionally, this project underscores how much remains to be learned about species interactions, especially in biodiverse ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThis study will investigate a potential tri-kingdom mutualism in the Guiana Shield. Field observations have led to the hypothesis that a wood-decay fungus, Guyanagaster necrorhiza, uses wood-feeding termites as its dispersal agent. Benefits to the termites for consuming G. necrorhiza remain elusive. Recently, it was discovered G. necrorhiza fruiting bodies harbor a community of Enterobacteriaceae, which are frequently identified as important nitrogen-fixing mutualists. This project will test the hypothesis that G. necrorhiza recruits these bacteria from its local environment as part of its dispersal strategy. State-of-the-art genetic sequencing technology will be used to characterize the bacterial communities in G. necrorhiza and substrates of the local environment to determine if and from where G. necrorhiza is recruiting bacteria. If G. necorhiza is recruiting specific bacteria, it is hypothesized that these bacteria fix nitrogen, making the fruiting bodies a rich source of nitrogen for termites. A series of chemical tests will be performed to determine if G. necrorhiza fruiting bodies are nitrogen-enriched, and if this enrichment is due to nitrogen-fixing bacteria that they harbor. If both hypotheses are supported, the conclusion will be that nitrogen-starved organisms, such as wood-feeding termites, feed on G. necrorhiza to supplement their diet and that they subsequently disperse the spores. By using wood-feeding termites as dispersal agents, G. necrorhiza accomplishes spore dispersal targeted to its desired substrate, wood.",

Field observations led to the hypothesis that the fungus, <em>Guyanagaster necrorhizus</em>, utilizes wood-feeding termites as its dispersal agent because it is unable to actively disperse its own spores. Yet what, if any, benefit the termites derive from feeding on <em>G. necrorhizus </em>fruiting structures, hereinafter referred to as basidiomes, remains unknown. Previously, we discovered that <em>G. necrorhizus</em> basidiomes harbor a community of bacteria. The overarching goal of this project was to determine whether these bacteria play a role in the adaptive fitness of <em>G. necrorhizus</em> and if so, what their role are in this potential tri-kingdom mutualism.</p>\n<p>During a field study conducted in a long-term research site in the western Pakaraima Mountains of Guyana, we collected 117 <em>G. necrorhizus</em> basidiomes, of which 49 were further used to characterize the bacterial community. These 49 basidiomes were spatially separated and covers the entire maturation span of this fungus (see Fig. 1, which shows examples of this fungus at all maturation phases). Using next-generation sequencing technologies, we determined that over 99% of the bacteria harbored in <em>G. necrorhizus</em> basidiomes belong to the family Enterobacteriaceae. Bacteria in the Enterobacteriaceae are often found in the soil and play an important role in nitrogen fixation, or taking inert nitrogen gas from the atmosphere and enzymatically breaking it down to make it biologically accessible to other organisms. Using a chemical analysis amenable for the field, we were able to determine that the bacteria in <em>G. necrorhizus</em> basidiomes are fixing nitrogen, but surprisingly, basidiomes at the most mature stage had significantly higher rates of nitrogen fixation. The mature basidiomes had a significantly greater amount of nitrogen than immature and maturing basidiomes. The mature stage is the only stage during which termites have been found to be consuming the spores of <em>G. necrorhizus</em>, suggesting that the higher nitrogen content at this stage is important for the termite dispersal agents that have a nitrogen-deficient diet.

Using dried <em>G. necrorhizus</em> specimens at different maturity stages, we were able to extract all of the proteins and identify them using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. One protein, copper-zinc superoxide dismutase, was found to be more abundant in mature <em>G. necrorhizus</em> tissue compared to immature tissue. This protein removes toxic byproducts generated during the nitrogen fixing process in order to keep the nitrogenase enzyme active. Therefore, <em>G. necrorhizus </em>basidiomes have evolved mechanisms to promote this mutualism with nitrogen-fixing bacteria by ensuring that the environment in which the bacteria are housed is amenable to nitrogen fixation.</p>\n<p>Outside of the obligate mutualism between termite farmers and their fungal crop in Africa, this is the first example of a specific fungal-termite mycophagy mutualism. The termites consume the <em>G. necrorhizus</em> basidiomes, and subsequently disperse spores. While termites often consume fungal mycelium associated with decaying wood because of its superior nutritional content, there are no other examples of termites targeting and consuming a specific fungal basidiome, making this mutualism the first known of its kind. By housing nitrogen-fixing bacterial endosymbionts, <em>G. necrorhizus</em> basidiomes are transformed into a nitrogen-rich substrate for their termite dispersal agents. Wood-feeding termites, like those that disperse <em>G. necrorhizus</em>, have a nitrogen-deficient diet, and are constantly scavenging for nitrogen-enriched substrates. Additionally, when compared to other examples of fungal cultivation by insects, each mutualist possesses similar characteristics: the fungi can degrade plant material, the bacteria fix nitrogen for the insect host (which generally have a diet deficient in nitrogen) and the insect disperses the fungus to a suitable substrate. From the work done during this award on the bacterial community in <em>G. necrorhizus</em>, we have shown that these bacteria play the same role as the bacteria in other fungal cultivation by insect systems. Given that <em>G. necrorhizus</em> contains the genes necessary for plant decomposition and that termites are the dispersal agent for this fungus, this system could represent another example of fungal cultivation by insects. Further understanding of this mutualism could yield valuable insights into the evolution of fungal cultivation by insects.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/28/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mary&nbsp;C&nbsp;Aime</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501782/1501782_10359695_1503942255386_Fig1_maturities--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501782/1501782_10359695_1503942255386_Fig1_maturities--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Maturation stages of G. necrorhizus\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1501782/1501782_10359695_1503942255386_Fig1_maturities--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Maturation stages of G. necrorhizus\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A) immature; B-D) maturing; E) fully mature; G) post-mature</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rachel Koch</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mary&nbsp;C&nbsp;Aime</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Maturation stages of G. necrorhizus</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
