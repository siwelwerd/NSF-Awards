 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key challenge in biology is to understand how cells communicate and respond to one another. This is particularly important in developing embryos where cell communication is responsible for creating the patterns which are the  template  for  the  formation  of  functioning  organs.  In this project which is a collaboration between researchers at the California Institute of Technology (US) and the Francis Crick Institute (UK), investigators will use a novel quantitative approach to examine signaling in the Sonic Hedgehog pathway (a signaling pathway very important in development) at the single cell level that leads to neural patterning in a model tissue culture system. The results will elucidate the mechanism that controls the precision of cell fate decision and tissue patterning   in  the  developing   spinal  cord.  These   broader impacts of these principles   are  likely   to  be  relevant   for understanding other signaling pathways involved in diverse developmental processes. This project will also provide a unique opportunity for training graduate students at the interface of biology and computation.\r\n\r\nDuring embryonic development and in response to injury, tissues must establish, or re-establish, precise  spatial  arrangements  of  specific  cell  types.  A  common  strategy  of  tissue  patterning involves morphogens; locally produced, secreted molecules that diffuse to form concentration gradients. These gradients provide the tissue with positional information that is used to regulate spatially specific genes controlling cell fate decisions. Moreover, morphogens also regulate the downstream   target   genes   that   can   affect   the   morphogen   movement,   intracellular   signal transduction and the elaboration of target gene expression. This provides a means for morphogens to generate  gradients  and positional  information  with context-specific  shapes and dynamics  to instruct tissue pattern formation. A key  limitation  in understanding the architecture of pathways that control morphogen expression has  been  the  lack  of direct  readout  and  control  in embryonic tissues. To address this deficiency, this research project will combine novel quantitative single- cell and tissue engineering approaches in well-defined  cellular model systems. The aim of this project is to understand the design principles that produce the dynamics and gene responses of the Hedgehog (SHH) pathway, which are involved in diverse developmental processes, in particular patterning  the neural system. The following fundamental  questions about morphogen-mediated tissue patterning will be addressed: (1) How are the dynamics of morphogen gradients generated and controlled? (2) How do the genes in individual cells interpret the quantitative, dynamic information encoded by morphogens into discrete cell fates? (3) How do fluctuations, or \"noise\", limit the precision of patterning, and how do cells overcome these limitations?  A broader impact of this project will be predictive, quantitative models connecting morphogen dynamics to cell fate decision-making,  which  provides  insights  into numerous  Shh-dependent  processes  in embryos and organisms, and also enables researchers to control and repurpose Shh signaling in order to engineer patterning in manufactured tissues. This project will also provide a unique opportunity for training graduate students at the interface of biology and computation.\r\n\r\nThis collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.",
