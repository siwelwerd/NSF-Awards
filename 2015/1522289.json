 "awd_abstract_narration": "The frontiers of science are explored today by elaborate computer-based simulations of real-world phenomena.  An essential tool in this endeavor is the finite element method, which has been used over an incredible range of temporal and spatial scales to deepen our understanding of physical behavior. Modern methods rely on a wide variety of finite element \"types,\" each with its own set of challenges and potential benefits.  Many of these element types have been classified by the recently developed and widely distributed Periodic Table of Finite Elements.  While the table characterizes the most well-known finite elements, some of the included types have never been implemented in practice, due in part to a missing piece of mathematical theory.  Further, the mesh element geometries presented in the table do not include a number of key shapes that are used throughout national laboratories and academia, implying that a need exists for a broader characterization of finite element types.  This project will address these mathematical gaps in knowledge, thereby promoting best practices in finite elements for computation in a wide range of contexts.\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with collaborators and student researchers, the PI will carry various tasks aimed at enhancing the usefulness and scope of the framework defined by the Periodic Table of Finite Elements. These tasks include the construction of canonical sets of local basis functions for the serendipity family of finite elements, the description of finite element families for key geometries employed in practice but not appearing in the table, and proofs that certain finite element families have minimal dimension in a mathematically precise sense. Proof techniques and basis constructions will involve the use of generalized barycentric functions, Whitney differential form spaces, and gradient bounds for error estimation.  The research activities will be accompanied by an outreach program through the Math Teachers' Circle Network and the American Institute of Mathematics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany scientific and industrial application contexts rely on an class of algorithms called \"finite element methods\" to carry out simulations of physical phenomena.  Selection of the appropriate type of finite element method is essential to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the simulation.  The \"Periodic Table of the Finite Elements\" is an organization of finite element methods in a specific layout according to key mathematical structures discovered over the past few decades.  In this project, I expanded those mathematical structures in three key ways.  First, I provided lists of basis functions for the \"serendipity\" methods in the table; these lists serve as a key ingredient for the successful implementation of this newest class of finite element methods.  Second, I explained how the structures of the table could be expanded to include not only methods employing not only meshes of triangles/tetrahedra or squares/cubes, but also general polygons in 2D and square-based pyramids in 3D.  Third, I discovered an entirely new class of methods with the same mathematical structures as those in the table but with provably reduced computational effort.  This new class, called \"trimmed serendipity elements,\" reduces interface degrees of freedom (a way of measuring the number of variables involved in the problem) by 25% in a typical 2D Darcy flow model and 33% in a 3D setting, compared to the traditional tensor product methods.  \n\nThe projects and publications of this work were carried out with the help of undergraduate and graduate student researchers at the University of Arizona, as well as in collaboration with faculty and industry researchers both domestic and foreign.  I presented key findings from these projects at national and international conferences over the course of the award.  In addition, I prepared and presented professional development activities for K-12 math teachers in Southern Arizona, based on inspiration from the research carried out in this grant.  These activities are posted publicly on the Math Teachers' Circle Network website, which is maintained by the American Institute of Mathematics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/01/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew K Gillette"
