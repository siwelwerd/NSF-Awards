 "awd_abstract_narration": "Natural history collections are important resources that document biodiversity and provide baseline information necessary for assessing changes in the abundance and distribution of species over time. These collections are irreplaceable, as it is usually difficult to replicate past collecting events, and thus represent legacy resources that transcend generations. This project will incorporate a taxonomically and geographically diverse collection of fishes, previously housed at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), into the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Marine Vertebrate Collection (MVC) at the University of California San Diego. Specimens will be curated to preserve their integrity for future generations of scientists and educators. Additionally, they will be databased to increase their accessibility to researchers. This award also supports the expansion of the MVC's outreach activities to disadvantaged youth in San Diego. These activities will introduce future leaders to potential career opportunities as they explore the diversity and ecological importance of fishes through a collaborative project with the Ocean Discovery Institute.\r\n\r\nThe UCLA Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology recently transferred its fish collection to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Marine Vertebrate Collection (MVC). The MVC is the logical repository for this orphaned collection because it retains these resources within the University of California, the institution that funded the infrastructure to build both collections, and it significantly improves the MVC's holdings of eastern Pacific fishes. The UCLA collection includes a variety of marine fishes dating to the 1940s and 1950s representing extensive collections of coastal fishes from California, the tropical eastern Pacific and its oceanic islands. This material adds significant components to the MVC including nearly 100 species new to the MVC and specimens of nearly 500 poorly represented species. This award facilitates the support of a dedicated staff member to enter UCLA specimen data into the MVC cataloging system and database, supervise a UCSD undergraduate student working with the UCLA collection, and participate in expanded outreach activities with the Ocean Discovery Institute. The Ocean Discovery Institute has an unparalleled record of public education in the San Diego area, as well as the resources to assess and continue the impact of these efforts well beyond the duration of this award.",

The Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) maintains one of the largest fish collections in the western US. The Marine Vertebrate Collection (MVC) is state-funded and is able to accession and curate vulnerable collections to maintain their integrity and availability to the scientific community. Via institutional support and National Science Foundation funding we were able to acquire, re-curate, digitize and integrate this important at-risk ichthyological collection into the MVC. The UCLA collection contains around 9,000 lots of fishes (a lot being samples of the same species collected at the same place and time) collected between 1886-2011. The majority of specimens are coastal fishes from California, outer Baja California, the Gulf of California, and throughout the Tropical Eastern Pacific including remote oceanic islands such as the Gal&aacute;pagos and Revillagigedos. The UCLA Collection complements MVC holdings as many of the early UCLA field expeditions focused on coastal and estuarine fishes whereas the MVC historically focused on oceanic and reef fishes in the same regions. The early UCLA field expeditions were also some of the first to use SCUBA for collecting fishes in the Pacific, so collectors observed and collected many species never before seen. Beyond the eastern Pacific, the UCLA collection contains selected material from around the globe. Due to the ecological interests of its curators and collectors, there are substantial metadata associated with field collections including detailed site descriptions, and photographs and illustrations of fishes. The MVC staff, assisted by nine UCSD students (2 graduate and 7 undergraduate), moved and cataloged this material into the MVC. Collection information (e.g., species identity, date and place of collection) was entered into the MVC database and all associated paper records (field and data sheets) were imaged and archived. When possible, collection localities were matched to specific latitude and longitude coordinates to increase discoverability by researchers. Physically, we replaced old and sometimes rusted metal lids and dried and crumbling rubber gaskets with modern and more robust seals. We also exchanged old preserving alcohol in the jars as needed. Upon final count, the UCLA material encompasses over 190,000 specimens of 1,438 species in 719 genera and 219 families from 2,865 collecting localities in 34 countries. Because the data associated with these specimens were not digital, much of this material was previously unknown or unused by researchers. All data are now digitally available via the MVC's website, and the data aggregates, iDigBio, VertNet and GBIF. Dozens of researchers have already examined UCLA specimens and we have included UCLA material in over fifteen research loans. Since the UCLA Collection has extensive representation of coastal fishes from southern California, some of the material has been used to develop grade-school teaching modules with the Ocean Discovery Institute in San Diego to teach students of the vital roles fishes play in nearshore ecosystems of this region.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/04/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Philip&nbsp;A&nbsp;Hastings</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
