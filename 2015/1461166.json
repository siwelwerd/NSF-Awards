 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Socially Relevant Computing REU Site at UNC Charlotte engages a diverse group of undergraduate students in an intensive 9-week summer research experience. REU students conduct research as part of a collaborative research community, working with faculty, graduate students, and peers. Each project has a socially relevant theme, providing undergraduate students with the opportunity to apply and extend their computing knowledge and deepen their understanding of the societal and global impact of computing research. The goals of the program are to increase interest in attending graduate school, enhance preparation for careers in research and innovation, and broaden participation of underrepresented groups in the field of computing.\r\n\r\nThe REU students will be involved in research that leads to the creation of new technologies that support humans in socially relevant tasks, requiring advances in the areas of pervasive computing, computer vision, and human computer interaction. Projects include: creating robust and scalable methods to analyze large sets of medical images to support clinical decision-making and diagnosis, developing new algorithms and systems that support large scale scientific data collection in crowdsensing and citizen science projects, and creating novel interfaces and systems for analyzing user interactions while preserving privacy in intelligent spaces. More information about the Socially Relevant Computing REU Site can be found at the program website: www.reu.uncc.edu.",
