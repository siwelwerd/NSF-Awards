The workshop addresses and describes the measurement of techniques and technology development needed to advance high priority science and provide a survey of techniques for the situ measurement and remote sensing of space plasmas. This award supports the UCAR Visiting Scientist Programs (VSP) to provide planning and logistical support, including registration, creation and publication of agendas and schedules, and on-site support while the workshop is in session. \r\nThe workshop will be organized with four areas of measurement techniques: particles, fields, photons, and ground-based. Additionally, a broad survey of the current technologies will be provided to serve as reference material and as a basis from which advanced and innovative ideas can be discussed. Instrumentation and techniques to observe the solar environment from its interior to its outer atmosphere, the heliosphere out to the interstellar regions, geospace and planetary magnetospheres and atmospheres are included.",
