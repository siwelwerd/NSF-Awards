 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal funds an early-career workshop in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). The target audience includes late-stage graduate students; postdoctoral fellows; and assistant professors early in their academic careers. The workshop is multidisciplinary, and is designed to focus on foundational CPS ideas applicable across multiple domains such as energy, transportation, and healthcare. The workshop hopes to identify new research directions through brainstorming discussions, plenary talks, and poster sessions. The community of early-career researchers has typically not been addressed by previous CPS workshops or PI meetings; engaging these individuals will foster new partnerships and collaborations, contribute to the growth of new and creative ideas that are foundational to CPS across multiple application domains, and will contribute to the nurturing of early-career PIs and prospective PIs in CPS - thereby positively impacting the CPS innovation ecosystem.  \r\n\r\nThe 2015 early-career workshop has a focus on the special topic of cyber-physical systems and smart cities.  The participants will work together to develop new project ideas, present these ideas to their peers, and also participate in an activity on the last day at an event that includes panelists from industry (including venture capitalists), academia, and government.",
