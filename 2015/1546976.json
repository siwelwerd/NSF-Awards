More recently, it has been appreciated that cells not only respond to these cues from the matrix, but also remodel the matrix and hence influence the subsequent cues. This dynamic reciprocity gives rise to emergent properties of the cell/matrix system, and both components co-evolve with time. This is particularly prevalent in embryogenesis, development and tumor growth. The precise role of mechanics in determining this reciprocity remains elusive. World experts in the field attending the workshop will develop a roadmap and white paper for members of the community and the National Science Foundation to help guide future research to maximize the effectiveness of investigations in the new and potentially highly important research field.",

The details of the workshop, including session themes, participants, lecture titles, abstracts, and the lectures are posted at http://publish.illinois.edu/saif/.  The following summarizes the discussions and presentations during the workshop.\n\nStatements of Consensus\n\nForce and mechanics play a ubiquitous role in biology.  Cell behavior is often a function of extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions.  During these interactions, mechanotransduction processes translate mechanical information into a biochemical response. Mechanobiologists can and have made great strides in mimicking in vivo conditions in vitro, allowing for analysis of responses to mechanical stimuli on multiple length scales.  Cell-ECM mechanotransduction has been shown to occur in the cell membrane, focal adhesions, cytoskeleton, and nucleus.  Cells not only respond to ECM cues, but also remodel the matrix dynamically and hence influence subsequent matrix properties, resulting in a cell-matrix system that co-evolves over time.  The interaction between cell and matrix is of particular importance in dynamic processes like embryogenesis, development, stem cell differentiation, and tumor growth. The participants outlined the following grand challenges, opportunities and needs for the field.\n\nGrand challenges and opportunities: critical questions in the field of cell-matrix mechanobiology \n\n1)  Full characterization of the chemical, physical, and cellular microenvironment of cell niches\n\n2)  Better understanding of the protein pathways that underlie mechanosensitive responses\n\n3)  Application of advances in mechanobiology to unique cell-matrix microenvironments\n\n4)  Development and standardization of the models and tools pertaining to cell-ECM interactions\n\n5)  Integration of advances in mechanobiology into the education system at multiple levels\n\nMajor needs: essential experimental, theoretical, and computational platforms and tools \n\n1)  Methods to accurately measure local cell and matrix mechanical properties in situ\n\n2)  High throughput, biomimetic 3D culture systems compatible with improved microscopy techniques to monitor responses of cells and tissues to mechanical perturbations\n\n3)  Robust in silico systems utilizing proteomics data and mechanical simulation to predict force-induced conformational changes of proteins\n\nSocietal impacts: Potentials for health care and the development of new biohybrid technologies\n\nBeyond the value of basic biology research, mechanobiology holds vast potential in clinical health care and the development of new biohybrid technologies, as ECM mechanics have been implicated in diseases as diverse as cancer, Alzheimer?s and Parkinson?s disease, stroke, and CNS injuries.  To bridge the gap from the lab to the clinic, strong collaboration between mechanobiologists and clinicians will be necessary, resulting in the productive exchange of ideas in both directions.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: T.
