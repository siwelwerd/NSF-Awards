The PI will create and teach an annual science and engineering ethics course during which students will spend a week in a fenceline community learning from residents and other expert-activists about local environmental hazards and the technologies that produce them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe project will create bridges between engineering professional communities and the public through exchange of expertise. The community collaborations she proposes will simultaneously broaden pathways for non-engineer citizens to actively and substantively participate in engineering projects and broaden the education of engineers to understand the community contexts and environmental justice implications of design decisions.",
