 "awd_abstract_narration": "Since 1978, the Oceanic Flux Program (OFP) has continuously measured particle movement, known as particle flux, from surface waters to the deep Sargasso Sea, revealing important information about changing ocean chemistry. It is the longest-running particle flux time series and is unique in its focus on the deep ocean. This award will continue funding this fundamental oceanographic time-series, lengthening the record of data and allowing for a better understanding of how the observed flux patterns relate to the interplay between climate and ocean functioning. Continued support of the time series will provide training and educational opportunities for young scientists from high school students through postdoctoral researchers, and results will tie into other time-series efforts in the Bermuda region. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding of ocean variability over interannual and decadal time-scales is of widespread interest and increasing relevance given the concerns over anthropogenic perturbations of global climate and ocean chemistry due to increases in greenhouse gases. Ocean ecosystems are now well-recognized to be affected by global and regional climate patterns such as ENSO and the North Atlantic Oscillation, and an imperative exists to model the ocean?s response to future climate scenarios. This requires a fundamental understanding of how the ocean and its biota naturally respond to climate and environmental forcing variables, and how these responses, in turn, affect ocean biogeochemical cycles. The OFP time-series has produced a unique unsurpassed record of temporal variability in the \"biological pump\", a term loosely applied to material transfer from the surface to the deep ocean. The record has documented interannual and longer variations in deep fluxes and shorter term fluctuations driven by the interactions between mesoscale physical variability, meteorological forcing and ecosystem responses. The OFP sample archives are an unparalleled resource for study of the biogeochemical consequences of changing ocean chemistry.",

Results from detailed studies of the organic composition of suspended as well as sinking particles, together with upper ocean physical and biological data collected by the OFP and Bermuda Atlantic Time Series, provided the first direct evidence that hurricanes- by increasing nutrient upwelling to induce transient phytoplankton bloom/flux events- may increase the delivery of fresh, organic material to the deep ocean, a finding that has far-ranging implications for deep ecosystem functioning and elemental cycling.</p>\n<p>In addition to grant funded research activities, the OFP contributed sample material and cruise opportunities to collaborating scientists in support of independently funded research and to graduate students in support of PhD and MS thesis research. The grant also funded undergraduate REUs and university interns who conducted summer research projects with the OFP. The OFP grants have also long provided meaningful employment to talented high school students who work as part-time lab assistants, providing them training in science skills that are essential for college success.
