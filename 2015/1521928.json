 "awd_abstract_narration": "The vision of CSBR is preservation of biological collections in the U.S. that will lead to new discoveries through research and better understanding and appreciation of biodiversity through improved education and outreach, resulting in improved environmental and economic policies. This workshop seeks to engage students, women and individual from groups under-represented in STEM. The activities proposed will broaden participation by targeting curators and managers at MSIs in Georgia and adjacent states.\r\n\r\nThis award will support participant costs and supplies for a workshop for collections managers and curators with the goal consolidating efforts of the Georgia Herbarium Alliance Consortium. The workshop would provide participants with hands-on training in best practices in workflows that are critical to collections security, preservation and digitization. In addition to targeting herbaria within Georgia, the workshop seeks to enhance practices in neighboring states and use expertise from iDigBio personnel in training activities. These activities strengthen the infrastructure for biodiversity research, goals of the Collections in Support of Biological Research (CSBR) and the Advancing Digitization of Biodiversity Collections (ADBC) programs. The CSBR program supports collection security and preservation while the ADBC program increase visibility and access to data and images for millions of biological specimens through digitization. These data are made available to the research community, government agencies, students, educators, and the general public. Improving the ability of natural history collections managers and curators in Georgia and surrounding states will strengthen this resource and include the best practices learned as part of the normal workflow in their facilities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n Intellectual Merit.  During the past decade, much progress has been made in imaging and databasing natural history collections and making these data accessible.  One type of natural history collection is a herbarium, comprising pressed, dried, and labelled plant specimens.  Digitization projects expose data of well-established herbaria, as well as those of quiescent and/or little-known collections.  Funding for these efforts has also successfully emphasized the value of collections to university administrators.  However, proper preparation of the plant specimens themselves&mdash;from field collection to the mounted specimen in a folder&mdash;is rapidly becoming a lost art as newly assigned curators are increasingly trained in laboratory-based programs rather than in traditional field work and collections management.\n\n\n\nThe University of Georgia Herbarium (GA) is the largest herbarium in the state of Georgia with over 278,000 accessioned sheets of vascular plants; the geographic focus of the collection is on Georgia and the southeastern United States.  A completed, collaborative, NSF Collections in the Service of Biological Research grant with Valdosta State University facilitated the consolidation of the Georgia Herbarium Alliance, a consortium of the nine herbaria in the state.  Representatives of all herbaria in Georgia were together for the first time at a meeting in March 2014 at Georgia Southern University Herbarium.  Discussions highlighted a great need for practicums on field and herbarium protocols, including hands-on work with specimen digitization leading to the submission of this workshop grant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe primary workshop, held 19-21 May 2016 at the GA Herbarium, was attended by 26 curators, collections managers, and a few students from 17 institutions in seven Southeastern states.  The schedule was designed with a variety of activities (presentations, demonstrations, hands-on tasks), interspersed with time allotted for discussion and feedback.  Two additional meetings were organized for 2017 with participant costs covered by the balance of funds from the primary 2016 workshop, via no-cost extension for an additional year: (1) The Fifth Georgia Herbarium Alliance Meeting at Valdosta State University, 25 February 2017, allowed 18 participants, representing nine herbaria in Georgia. to provide updates on their collections activities and share expertise in herbarium methodology and protocols; (2) The Georgia Species List Meeting at University of Georgia, 20-23 July 2017 was attended by 6 representatives from the three largest herbaria in Georgia: Georgia Southern University (25, 000 specimens), University of Georgia (278,000 specimens), and Valdosta State University (65,000 specimens).  Since digitization of specimens from the state of Georgia among the three herbaria is almost complete, the curators met to set up protocols for producing a vouchered, synonymized species list for the state.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe workshop and meetings demonstrated the great need of curators (from various backgrounds) to review and/or learn basic specimen preparation and management skills.  The primary workshop ensured the continued development of the Herbarium Alliance both within Georgia and as part of a regional network.  Besides filling a need for hands-on training in herbarium best practices, the workshop: (1) allowed integration of the Herbarium Alliance Consortium with current digitization goals; (2) enhanced herbarium programs in nearby states; and (3) provided a valuable state- and region-based model for this type of workshop.  Participants also especially appreciated the presentations assigned to each herbarium curator to give updates on their herbarium and time allotted for discussion and networking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBroader Impacts.  Although targeted to collections curators, the workshop and meetings enhanced the promotion of learning by exposing seven undergraduate students and three graduate students to one-on-one training with specimen preparation and data processing under the direct guidance of professional scientists.  These activities reached students at an impressionable age through hands-on experiences with plants.  The proposed workshop also targeted underrepresented undergraduate groups (4 African American female students participated)&mdash;thereby continuing current successful efforts at the University of Georgia Herbarium.  These activities endorsed participation of women and all ethnic groups by providing assistance and training to curators of fledgling herbaria that serve these groups.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results of this grant were disseminated to the herbarium collections community via a herbarium-themed symposium organized for the Association of Southeastern Biologists annual meeting, 30 March 2017 in Montgomery, AL, and two articles in a national newsletter.
