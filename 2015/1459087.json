 "awd_abstract_narration": "In the Gulf of Maine region, rapid warming of the ocean surface in recent years has raised concern in the research and resource management communities, fishing industry and the general public about effects on the coastal marine ecosystem. This interdisciplinary, collaborative project will improve understanding of the physical and biological processes controlling the abundance of a planktonic animal that is particularly important in the food web of the northeast coastal ocean. About the size of a grain of rice, the marine copepod Calanus finmarchicus is the primary prey for herring and other forage fish, as well as for the endangered northern right whale. This study will examine whether transport of C. finmarchicus into the Gulf of Maine from cold Canadian waters, in combination with growth and reproduction in the relatively cold Maine Coastal Current, is sufficient to supply the region with the numbers needed to attract and nourish the fish, seabirds and mammals that rely on its energy rich life stages, despite recent ocean warming. The research team will develop a computer model that links extensive understanding of the species' life history with ocean currents and temperature. Results from the model will be tested against field collections at two locations. This study will also contribute to the new Integrated Sentinel Monitoring Network, a joint effort planned by federal and state agencies with academic research participation to monitor future ecosystem change on the northeastern coastal shelf. It will train a graduate student and postdoctoral scientist in interdisciplinary research and also provide support for an early-career investigator.\r\n\r\nThe project will take a process modeling approach that takes into account regional and mesoscale interaction between life history and bathymetry and circulation to improve understanding of planktonic species distribution shifts. It will combine two decades of research on Calanus finmarchicus life history, including diapause, with a high resolution regional circulation model into an innovative application of a three dimensional, physical-biological model. The modeling approach represents an advancement of climate forecasts of species ranges by coupling a Lagrangian perspective with local processes to better resolve complex range boundaries. It will use Lagrangian parameters such as finite-scale or finite-time Lyapunov exponents, translating particle trajectories into scalar fields that represent the structure of the advective regime. The model will be informed by and tested with measurements of vital rates and demographic data collected on a research vessel at two time series stations. It will be used in backward-in-time and forward-in-time modes to test hypotheses about sources and destinations of C. finmarchicus in the Gulf of Maine, effects of match/mismatch in phenologies, and exploration effects of climate forced scenarios on advective pathways.",

We focus on the northeast U.S. coastal waters in the Gulf of Maine, located at the southern margin of the subarctic North Atlantic Ocean. This cold-water ecosystem is characterized by herring, cod, and seasonally migrating fish, mammals, and seabirds, including bluefin tuna, large whales, and Atlantic puffins. Over the past decade, the Gulf of Maine has experienced extreme warming at all depths, and the effects on the cold-water ecosystem is of widespread concern.</p>\n<p>We have identified a planktonic copepod, <em>Calanus finmarchicus</em>, as a key foundation species. <em>C. finmarchicus</em> is remarkably abundant throughout its subarctic North Atlantic range and especially in the Gulf of Maine. The life history of <em>C. finmarchicus</em> is adapted to the subarctic seasonal cycle of primary production. These copepods start reproduction in late winter and early spring as phytoplankton production is increasing. Developing <em>C. finmarchicus</em> accumulate lipids produced by phytoplankton. By its last pre-adult life stage, it has stored a large quantity of high-energy fats that enable it to overwinter at depth starting in late summer. Herring, right whales, and other planktivores are tuned to the <em>C. finmarchicus</em> life cycle and eat large quantities of the lipid-rich stages to fuel their energy and reproductive needs. In a sense, <em>C. finmarchicus</em> serves as a battery, storing for many months the light energy captured by phytoplankton in the spring.</p>\n<p>Recent warming has placed the habitat for <em>C. finmarchicus</em> in the Gulf of Maine at risk, including its ability to overwinter. Previous modeling of <em>C. finmarchicus</em> habitat suggested that the species will disappear from the Gulf of Maine over the next several decades. However, following recent extreme warming, <em>C. finmarchicus</em> surprisingly has persisted in high numbers in the Gulf of Maine. Our research in this project explores the mechanisms by which this copepod species persists and how warming and associated changes in currents may be influencing abundance. First, we continued a program of sampling of <em>C. finmarchicus</em> at two fixed stations in order to document changes in abundance and timing of life cycle events. Second, we coupled sophisticated circulation models with the <em>C. finmarchicus</em> life cycle to test a mechanism that includes transport by currents in addition to local production as key factors in maintaining abundance.

Earlier phytoplankton production has yielded higher abundances of juvenile <em>C. finmarchicus</em> and smaller copepod species in spring in the western Gulf of Maine. Later in the year, however, late-stage <em>C. finmarchicus</em> abundance has declined by approximately 30% in the western Gulf of Maine and even more dramatically, by an order of magnitude, in the eastern Gulf of Maine. We have identified two largely distinct oceanographic pathways that together explain the recent observations. Older <em>C. finmarchicus </em>stages originating from outside the Gulf are entrained in the food-rich Maine Coastal Current, which transports this growing and reproducing population to the western Gulf of Maine, where it is able to overwinter in Wilkinson Basin. Overwintering individuals emerge in winter and exploit the early phytoplankton production to produce a large spring cohort. We have termed this pathway the Coastal Amplification and Transport (CAST) hypothesis, and it explains how high abundances persisted despite warming. The second pathway affects the eastern Gulf of Maine. Since about 2010, the transport pathway has shifted from cold Nova Scotia Current supply to warmer North Atlantic Temperate Water, which is associated with poor <em>C. finmarchicus</em> habitat. This shift in external supply aligns with observed changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation resulting from warming in the Arctic.</p>\n<p>Our research highlights that coastal ecosystem change involves currents and planktonic production in addition to warming. Effects in the Gulf of Maine depend on different oceanographic pathways that may support either persistence or decline. These effects have important implications.

Our project has contributed to the development of physical-biological modeling as a tool that can help track oceanographic pathways of change. These models have practical applications, for example in the prediction of foraging distribution of the North Atlantic right whale to inform management decisions. Effective predictions based such oceanographic mechanisms can help mitigate the social and economic impacts of management decisions on the fishing industry and other services provided by coastal ecosystems.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/29/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;Runge</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1459087/1459087_10352428_1561814424603_CV_1_forpublication--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1459087/1459087_10352428_1561814424603_CV_1_forpublication--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Calanus finmarchicus\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1459087/1459087_10352428_1561814424603_CV_1_forpublication--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Calanus finmarchicus\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Late preadult stage of the planktonic copepod, Calanus finmarchicus, with oil sac, a primary source of energy in subarctic North Atlantic ecosystems, including the Gulf of Maine.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">C.
