 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will build a learning community for STEM students at Raritan Valley Community College through faculty mentoring, career development activities, cohort building and access to key student services.  Approximately 34 scholars will participate in the learning community, which is designed to improve students' educational experiences and connection to peers, faculty and the college, all with the objective of increasing STEM retention, degree achievement and successful transfer to four-year institutions.  Partnerships among multiple stakeholders (high schools, 4-year institutions, community organizations, and local employers) will support a well-rounded plan for recruitment, retention, and then placement in the workforce or colleges and universities that grant bachelor's degrees. This project is expected to have an impact on the number of STEM graduates prepared to help national, regional, and local companies compete and innovate in the global economy.  \r\n\r\nThe project will investigate the influence of i) improved academic and social integration and ii) improvement in economic circumstances on educational outcomes for academically talented STEM students with demonstrated financial need. In addition to expanding efforts to nurture a STEM learning community (see activities above), the quality and rigor of assessment and evaluation activities will be enhanced in order to test whether efforts to help students assimilate and financial assistance can explain their retention and commitment  to complete STEM majors.  Formative evaluation will address scholars' satisfaction with the project and its contribution towards their satisfaction with the institution, their educational progression, and their career development.  Summative evaluation will consist of an analysis of the alignment of retention and enrollment with the project objectives.  In addition an analysis will be done on the long-term effects of the project on student placement in college or in the workforce and persistence in STEM fields. Dissemination of the results of evaluation will be done through conferences and workshops focused on higher education and pedagogy. Potential conferences include the Faculty of the Future conference held annually at Bucks County Community College and Best Practices Conference in New York City sponsored by the Institute of International Education.",

Smaller, purely merit-based scholarships were also awarded using a different funding source; the total number of STEM Galileo scholarships offered each year varied between 60 and 115 depending on funding availability. The larger, NSF-funded, $2,000 per year scholarships covered a large percentage of tuition costs for most of these full-time students. Students were required to be enrolled in at least 12 credits, maintain a GPA of at least 3.0, meet with a STEM faculty advisor, and participate in at least two Galileo Scholars events each semester to maintain their scholarship eligibility. Galileo events included an annual orientation session, periodic peer mentoring sessions, a scholarship reception, and periodic professional development workshops offered by RVCC?s Career and Transfer Services, and Advising &amp; Counseling staff on topics including applying to transfer to four-year institutions, resume writing, interviewing, professional networking, finding a summer internship, improving time management skills, managing test anxiety, developing stress management techniques, and more. Each student was matched with a faculty advisor in a STEM field related to their major, and they met at twice per semester to review progress in current courses, create academic plans, discuss transfer institution selection, explore potential career paths, and more.</p>\n<p>The program had four specific objectives. The first was to improve recruitment and success of academically talented, financially needy RVCC students in STEM programs. Over the course of the four-year program, recruitment efforts were successful in attracting financially-needy students (40% of participants were Pell-eligible), female students (initially only 20-30% of Galileo recipients but that increased to 47-48% in the last two years of the grant), and students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups (30% of Galileo recipients, which is similar to the overall proportion of STEM students who are from URM groups at RVCC). Overall the Galileo Scholars program had much higher average three-year degree completion (&gt;60%) than their non-Galileo counterparts (25%). Transfer rates for Galileo Scholars were also very high (80-85%). While there was variability over the course of the four years, in general degree completion and transfer rates were similar for female and male scholars; for scholars from underrepresented minority (URM) groups and scholars not from these groups; for scholars with and without financial need (scholarships for students without financial need were funded by private donations), and for full-time and part-time scholars (scholarships for part-time scholars were funded by private donations).

Scholars had opportunities to build relationships with student services staff, STEM faculty mentors, and STEM peers. They also explored potential career paths in various STEM disciplines and heard about internship and co-op experiences of scholarship alumni.
