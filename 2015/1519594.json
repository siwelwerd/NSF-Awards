 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will examine variation across localities in the effectiveness of development aid projects designed to improve provision of basic needs for people.  The investigators will consider the impact of the efforts of national governments and international organizations, which have distributed more than $6 trillion in non-military development aid around the world since 1950, including more than $2 trillion since 2000.  This exploratory research project will provide policymakers, donors, practitioners, and scholar with new tools that can be used to evaluate and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of aid.  The methods, data, and resources emerging from this project will target evaluation in a manner that previously has been difficult to undertake.  Project findings and products will enable analysts to more effectively assess the extent to which a particular project has succeeded or failed as well as to more precisely identify local factors that enabled or hindered the program's success.  Project findings also will give donors improved information regarding how to target and administer aid programs more effectively in order to achieve their desired goals.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will collect and analyze local (subnational) data on the effectiveness of aid projects as well as pertinent contextual factors.  The project will be facilitated by the increasing availability of geographically coded, local data dealing with development aid projects, development policies, environmental change, violent conflict, political control, and development outcomes, such as measures of human well-being.  The investigators will integrate these data into useable datasets with common units, and they will develop tools that will enable other scientists to integrate other kinds of data.  These tools for creating new datasets will relieve existing bottlenecks in research on the effectiveness of aid.  Using the resulting datasets, the investigators will analyze relationships between intentions and outcomes of aid projects, focusing initially on four outcomes in countries around the world:  cropland coverage as an indication of food security, levels of inter-ethnic violence, vaccine coverage, and infant mortality.  This project is supported through the NSF Interdisciplinary Behavioral and Social Sciences Research (IBSS) competition.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn this project a team of researchers from four universities collected and analyzed data on the effectiveness of foreign aid.  The researchers are from Brigham Young University, University of Maryland, University of Michigan, and University of Texas at Austin.   The focus has been on foreign aid intended to improve agricultural output and productivity.  It has been a major challenge to learn the effectiveness of foreign aid because there are many factors that matter in improving local areas.  The team used data from satellite images of crop coverage in two countries of interest, India and Colombia.   They also used data on foreign aid distributions that are targeted as specific communities.  The team discovered that foreign aid in these countries often went to locations, not solely based on need, but also based on political factors.  In India, communities were more likely to receive foreign aid for agricultural development if local politicians were of the same political party as the state government, controlling for other factors.  Furthermore, aid was effective in improving crop coverage of land.  Thus, in India, politics trumped other factors in gaining finances to improve the lives of people in specific areas.  In Colombia, foreign aid flowed to areas with a lot of violence and conflict, and evidence shows that the aid improved crop coverage.  It is possible that the improved crop coverage in Colombia included illegal crops as well as food crops for local consumption and export.    The satellite images in Colombia are being further analyzed to discern the differences among crops.   The datasets put together by the team will be valuable to answer further questions about the effectiveness of foreign aid, and all data will be made available to the public.   The research has produced two papers so far, and will likely produce more by the team members.  It has produced valuable datasets of use to other researchers.  Finally, numerous students were involved assisting on the project, gaining valuable experience handling large datasets and analyzing the date with sophisticated statistical techniques. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/31/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth W Kollman"
