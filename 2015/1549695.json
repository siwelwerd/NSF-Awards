Although this process has the potential to replace petroleum fuels and provide an environmentally sustainable supply of transportation fuel, present processes do not work well - they cannot take carbon dioxide all the way to chemicals and fuels in a single step, and the catalysts are expensive and not very efficient.  More fundamental research is needed to make solar fuels a viable technology.  The 2016 Gordon Research Conference (GRC) and the Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) on Solar Fuels focus on identifying the progress, challenges and opportunities of interdisciplinary scientific research for the development of new catalysts based on nature-inspired processes to advance scientific understanding and development of better solar fuel processes. The Solar Fuels GRC is an international conference under US leadership, and will be held on February 28 to March 4, 2016 at the Il Ciocco Hotel and Resort, Lucca (Barga), Italy. The 2016 Solar Fuels GRC has an associated GRS on Solar Fuels, which is a gathering dedicated exclusively to contributions from graduate students and post-doctoral research associates. The Solar Fuels GRS immediately precedes the GRC on February 27 & 28, 2016 at the same location.  This award will provide partial support for both the GRC and GRS.  The GRC program will include invited oral presentations by early career researchers who are already showing potential for making new breakthroughs, as well as established researchers, and poster presentations from which some will be selected for short oral presentations.  The award will be used support the registration fees of selected participants for the GRC and the GRS.\r\n\r\nThe Solar Fuels GRC will focus on five fundamental scientific and technological challenges needed to realize solar fuels: 1)  Efficient coupling of light-driven water oxidation catalysis with proton or carbon dioxide reduction;  2) Understanding of charge transport processes between photoactive components and across multiple interfaces of solid state inorganic or molecular integrated assemblies; 3) Carbon dioxide reduction at low overpotential, in particular to more deeply reduced products beyond CO or formate; 4) Novel materials for light capture and photocatalysis; 5) New design principles for biological photosystems with applications to artificial photosynthesis and integration artificial photosynthetic components with microbial catalysis.  The Solar Fuels GRS will focus on artificial photosystems. Given the interdisciplinary nature of these challenges, the participants include chemists, physicists, materials and computational scientists, biophysicists, chemical engineers, and bioengineers.   Furthermore, the fundamental experimental and theoretical topics underlying solar fuels - charge transfer, catalysis, materials discovery, nanoscience, molecular and biological dynamics, interface engineering, and others - discussed at the meeting go beyond just the chemical and materials sciences.  The participants will share their recent results and ongoing effort in their specific area of work, and at the same time expose themselves to the challenges and progress in areas beyond their immediate expertise or field of specialization. The latter is a critical educational aspect for graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and early career scientists in particular who will meet and brainstorm with established scientists and leading members of this community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA central theme of the 2016 Renewable Energy Solar Fuels GRC was the recent progress and scientific challenges of integrating the light absorbers and catalysts into subsystems and complete solar fuel assemblies, with the goal of achieving closed photosynthetic cycles in which only water (and CO2) are consumed.  Successful integration requires the detailed understanding of elementary energy, charge transfer and catalytic processes at every stage of the assembly to guide improvement of photon-to-fuel conversion efficiency.  Advances in our knowledge, of mechanisms by which charges created by light absorption drive catalytic transformations, of charge-transfer processes across multiple interfaces and how they can be controlled, and of mitigating the high activation barriers of multi step catalytic reactions, are all critical for overcoming efficiency bottlenecks of the complex system  Novel physico-chemical methods of measuring these phenomena play a critical role for accelerating progress, as do rapid improvements in performance with abundant material resources that are readily and economically processed into components. Scale up of solar fuel generators encounters its own unique challenges that are receiving increased attention, while breakthroughs of molecular and solid light capture materials continue to expand the pool of components to choose from.  Efforts by the research community on catalysis for carbon dioxide reduction are gaining momentum because of the need for renewable liquid transportation fuels, a formidable challenge that should benefit from lessons gleaned from microbial systems for hydrocarbon conversion.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/13/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gary W Brudvig"
