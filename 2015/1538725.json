 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integration of nanoparticles into polymers leads to enhancement in thermal, mechanical and shape changing properties of composite materials. Functionalizing nanoparticle surfaces with polymers that are chemically identical to matrix polymer are commonly employed in conventional polymer composites simply to control particle dispersion. However, maintaining dispersion and mechanical properties during high temperature processing and applications holds a critical importance in manufacturing and performance of polymeric products. This grant focuses on understanding the role of particle-polymer interactions on dispersion, mechanical properties and processing. Towards this goal, the PIs will focus on a material system design with on-demand control on reversible mechanical response. Reversibly stiffening composites can be used in various applications from soft robotics, flexible electronics to injectable implants where mechanical integrity should be maintained when heated. This collaborative work offers a fundamental research plan integrating the expertise of the PIs on experimental and molecular dynamics simulations on polymer nanocomposites to study the underlying mechanisms. In addition, the project offers to educate graduate and undergraduate students on nanomaterials design and processing. To broaden the knowledge of nanoscience and nanomaterials in high school education, the PIs aim to organize a workshop for teachers in New Jersey and New York area.\r\n\r\nThe team aims to explore the phenomenon of reversible stiffening in polymer nanocomposites. It is hypothesized that particles coated with a high glass transition temperature (Tg) polymer and dispersed in a low-Tg polymer exhibit liquid-to-solid transition upon heating. Experimental work is designed to show the universality of this behavior in various miscible blends with different glass-transition temperature differences. The phenomenon will be employed on magnetic nanoparticles to demonstrate that the mechanical behavior can be regulated with local heating of particles. Moreover, additional experiments to relate the local viscosity and particle relaxations in asymmetric blends on interphases are planned in order to capture the physics and mechanical response in the experimental system design. Simulations will run in parallel and will be used to guide the material design and more importantly will identify the atomistic scale physics that leads to stiffening at high temperatures. Processing studies will be conducted to understand the stability of interphase layers, and composite structure (morphology) and properties after processing. The processing results are very relevant for the material design such as for biomedical implants where materials will experience frequent and controlled dynamic loadings during their intended use for in vivo bone formation.",

Blends that have good miscibility and compatibility with nanoparticles and differences in their glass-transition temperatures (T<sub>g</sub>&rsquo;s) are chosen carefully to study reinforcement behavior of particularly low T<sub>g</sub> matrix polymers. We measured the viscoelastic response of nanocomposites below and above T<sub>g</sub> of the polymer that is adsorbed on particles and also has asymmetric composition relative to the matrix polymer of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(methyl acrylate) (PMA). Low glass-transition temperature composites consisting of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) coated silica nanoparticles in PEO and PMA matrices; and of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) silica nanoparticles in PMA matrix are examined using rheology and X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy. We<em> found that mixing and entanglements between the two miscible polymers in the interphase layer is a factor governing the collective particle relaxations and the hyper-diffusive mode of adsorbed particles, which in turn contribute to the unusual reinforcement measured in the short adsorbed chains </em>(<strong>Fig. 1</strong>)<em>.</em></p>\n<p class=\"RSCB02ArticleText\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A general finding from these different systems is that good mixing of polymer blends in interfaces resulted in reinforcement of nanocomposites. In a semi-crystalline (PEO) matrix, miscibility of short chains was more feasible with the amorphous chains and the highest reinforcement was obtained. The faster particle relaxations in the reinforced composite led us to conclude that adsorbed chain mobility is an important parameter in the reinforcement mechanism. In an amorphous (PMA) system, dynamic coupling, that was dictated by entanglements and packing of chains in the interphase layer, was enhanced with the short matrix chains. Particle relaxations slowed down with the longer adsorbed chains, which in fact revealed the role of adsorbed chain length in the reinforcement mechanism. In summary, chemical heterogeneities at interphases control the reinforcement in low T<sub>g</sub> polymer composites. Our results underpin the polymer bridging effect through the interfacial layers which is shown to be more effective with the short matrix and long adsorbed chains.</p>\n<p>We collaborated with our colleagues on simulations of viscoelastic properties of polymer-grafted particles where brush conformations differ as collapsed and stretched. We demonstrate that glassy chains tethered onto nanoparticles dispersed within a soft (liquid&ndash;like) polymer matrix can significantly tune the overall viscoelastic and dynamic properties of the nanocomposite system. Using molecular dynamics, a composite system containing nanoparticles grafted with high&ndash;T<sub>g</sub> polymer chains in a low&ndash;T<sub>g</sub> matrix polymer is simulated. We consider two main conformational states for the high&ndash;T<sub>g</sub> brushes: collapsed (onto the nanoparticle, and therefore, phase&ndash;separated from the matrix) and stretched. We found that in the case of stretched chains, the composite has significantly higher storage modulus than the system with collapsed brushes. Detailed analysis showed that the stretched conformational state of grafted chains reduced matrix chain mobility significantly. Finally, by simulating structures with a range of grafted chain conformations bounded by fully collapsed and fully stretched states, we demonstrated that grafted chain conformation could be used to control the viscoelastic response of the whole nanocomposite system. Chain conformation close to the particle surfaces then substantiates the intermixing of chains. Thus, <em>this work led to better understanding on how chemical heterogeneity and chain architectures can be used to control the viscosity and viscoelastic moduli in polymer nanocomposites of bare particles.</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In another work, the role of chain rigidity in this interfacially controlled reinforcement in PEO composites is investigated. We showed that particles adsorbed with less rigid polymers improved the mechanical properties of composites (<strong>Fig. 2</strong>). The storage modulus of PMMA with the lower segmental rigidity is higher than the P2VP-adsorbed samples at low frequencies. <strong>Fig. 3</strong> shows that particles adsorbed with P2VP show a softening response, whereas PC with its lowest rigidity is more reinforced than interfaces with PMMA at 20 and 40 wt% loadings. These results emphasize that rheology results are sensitive to the molecular rigidity and dynamic heterogeneities of interfacial layers around nanoparticles.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The stability of adsorbed chains determines both the mechanical performance (<strong>Fig. 4</strong>) and the life-time of nanocomposites. We examined the stability of interfacial layers with large-amplitude oscillatory shear (LAOS) experiments. Our particles adsorbed with PMMA presented an overshoot in storage modulus in strain sweep tests. This behavior is attributed to the energy dissipation due to arrangement of chains in interfacial layers which was not observed with the PC or P2VP interfacial layers. <strong>Fig. 5</strong> shows the strain sweep behavior of composites with different rigidity of adsorbed chains. It was shown that PMMA chains can be deformed and arranged themselves into a denser entangled state through strain-softening mechanism with e<sub>3</sub>&lt;0. PC and P2VP chains on the other hand present linear elastic behavior with e<sub>3</sub>=0. We completed the LAOS analysis on the PMA and PEO composites and also with the bare particles and now in the process of writing the next manuscript.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"RSCB02ArticleText\">&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/17/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Pinar&nbsp;Akcora</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538725/1538725_10392249_1539801145178_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538725/1538725_10392249_1539801145178_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538725/1538725_10392249_1539801145178_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Effect of adsorbed PVAc chain lengths (15 kDa, 50 kDa, 100 kDa) on nanoparticle dynamics: (A) autocorrelation function at q=0.01 \u00c5-1, (B) relaxations times as a function of scattering vector, q.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Pinar Akcora</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pinar&nbsp;Akcora</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538725/1538725_10392249_1539801194333_Fig2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538725/1538725_10392249_1539801194333_Fig2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538725/1538725_10392249_1539801194333_Fig2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Frequency sweeps of 100 kg/mol PEO homopolymer and composites with bare, PC, PMMA and P2VP adsorbed particles for 20 wt% (top), 40 wt% (bottom) loadings at 180 \u00b0C.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Pinar Akcora</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pinar&nbsp;Akcora</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538725/1538725_10392249_1539801284010_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538725/1538725_10392249_1539801284010_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538725/1538725_10392249_1539801284010_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Temperature sweeps of 100 kg/mol PEO homopolymer and composites with PC, PMMA and P2VP adsorbed particles at 20 wt% (on the left) and 40 wt% (on the right) loadings, at a frequency of 5 rad/s in linear viscoelastic regime.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Pinar Akcora</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pinar&nbsp;Akcora</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538725/1538725_10392249_1539801530849_Fig4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538725/1538725_10392249_1539801530849_Fig4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538725/1538725_10392249_1539801530849_Fig4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Normalized elastic moduli of PEO (on the left) and PMA (on the right) composites at deformed state with respect to their initial states versus frequency with PC, PMMA and P2VP adsorbed particles at 20 wt% loading.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Pinar Akcora</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Pinar&nbsp;Akcora</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Fig. 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538725/1538725_10392249_1539801692064_Fig5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538725/1538725_10392249_1539801692064_Fig5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Fig. 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1538725/1538725_10392249_1539801692064_Fig5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Fig. 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Strain sweeps of PMA composites with PMMA, PC and P2VP adsorbed particles at 30 wt% loading, measured at 180oC.
