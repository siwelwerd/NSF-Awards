The results of this study should serve to clarify the ontological commitments of the physical theories involved, and to advance understanding of the fundamental nature of the physical world. It will have far-reaching consequences for metaphysics (developing the notion of grounding in new contexts), philosophy of physics (drawing philosophical conclusions from recent work in quantum gravity), and philosophy of science (by exploring the relations between different levels of science). It will also introduce new and useful concepts that will serve to foster mutually beneficial communication between physicists and philosophers, who are substantially and increasingly engaged in collaborative efforts.\r\n\r\nThe broader significance of this project relates to the investigator's multidisciplinary approach and her efforts to address the glaring under-representation of women in the fields of philosophy of science and the conceptual foundations of physics, which is a serious problem. The results of this study will be disseminated in a variety of multidisciplinary journals and conferences that engage the attention of philosophers, physicists, and historians of science. The research undertaken will enrich classes taught by the investigator and enhance her mentoring of students, in particular women students. She will use her influence to affect the gender balance of conferences she attends, and cultivate supportive relationships with junior women faculty in her area of expertise.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nProject Outcomes Report \n\nScholars Award: The Structure of Spacetime: A New Approach to the Structure of Space-Time Controversy\n\n             There is a longstanding debate among physicists and philosophers over whether space, or spacetime, exists; whether spacetime is something distinct from material bodies.  The two main positions on the debate go by the names substantivalism and relationalism.  The substantivalist says that spacetime exists.  The relationalist denies this.  According to the relationalist, there are material bodies related to one another spatiotemporally, but there is no further thing, no spacetime ?container,? in which these bodies are located.  \n\n This debate traces back at least to the likes of Leibniz and Newton, and there is still no consensus on an answer, nor even on how to understand the two main positions on the issue.  Recently, many physicists and philosophers have concluded this is not a substantive or interesting debate?that even if it was once relevant to physics, it is no longer.  It is removed from the concerns of ordinary physics, having become an esoteric concern of philosophy. \n\n            The project located a new and substantive conception of this dispute, a conception that is close to the traditional one, while being updated to take into account more recent developments in physics and philosophy.  The project showed that framing the debate in this way allows for a clear statement of the main opposing views, as well a clear point of disagreement between them?one that is moreover relevant to physics.  Framing the debate in this way also turns out to reveal an argument for the existence of spacetime, given current physics, while allowing that future physics (a quantum theory of gravity, say) may indicate otherwise.  In this way the debate is, and will continue to remain, relevant to physics.  It is not merely verbal or metaphysical.\n\n Along the way, the project established some general principles that guide our theorizing about spatiotemporal structure in physics.  It happens that these principles can be extended to cover more general theorizing about physics, for different physical theories and a more general notion of structure.  The project argues that these principles guide our theorizing about structure in physics more generally, with implications for how to compare different theories respect to their structure, both mathematical structure in the formalism and physical structure in the world.   \n\n The project resulted in a forty-page journal article, several chapters of a book, a related article in a book collection, and a handful of presentations.  The published journal article is ?A New Approach to the Substantival-Relational Debate,? in Oxford Studies in Metaphysics vol. 11, pp. 3-43, in 2018.  In this paper the novel conception of the dispute, and the two main positions on it, are outlined; an argument for substantivalism (on this conception) is given, as well as a challenge for relationalism.  The chapters are in Physics, Structure, and Reality (see in particular chapters 2, 3, and 5), published by Oxford University Press in 2021.  A discussion applying these ideas to classical mechanics appeared in the Routledge Companion to Philosophy of Physics (eds. Eleanor Knox and Alastair Wilson) in 2021. \n\n Presentations on the project were given at various venues and to a variety of audiences.  The ones most directly related to the project include, in 2014, the keynote address of a graduate student conference at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign and a presentation at the Philosophy of Science Association Biennial Meeting; in 2015, at the Chapel Hill Colloquium in Philosophy at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, two presentations in Israel at audiences in History and Philosophy of Science, and at a Physics as Metaphysics lecture series at Brown University; and in 2017, at a conference on The Foundation of Reality: Fundamentality, Space, and Time, at Oxford University and a colloquium in the philosophy department at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.  More presentations were given on the material extending these ideas to general notions of structure and theorizing about theories other than spacetime ones, as well as the topic of theoretical equivalence. \n\n There are a few broader impacts of the project.  First, by providing a fresh perspective, the project revived an old dispute that many people think has stagnated.  Second, it helped generate interdisciplinary discussion, among a variety of researchers who study physics, including philosophers of physics, theoretical physicists, and historians of physics and mathematics.  Third, the project resulted in a new seminar on the philosophy of spacetime introduced at the PI?s home institution, and further enriched a segment of an introductory course on a variety of issues in the philosophy of physics.  Finally, the project enhanced and supported the PI?s mentoring of women students, helping to attract students to work with the PI both at the PI?s home institution and at biennial a workshop for graduate student women in philosophy co-founded and -organized by the PI. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jill North"
