 "awd_abstract_narration": "The need for failure-resistant circuit and system design is becoming critical as mobile devices continue to be constructed with enhanced computing and video processing capabilities using heterogeneous intellectual property blocks such as CPU, memory, sensors, and graphics/image processing units. Furthermore, ever-increasing miniaturization of integrated fabrication processes (e.g., 40 nanometer CMOS or below) is creating challenging problems including higher rates of failure at the device level, reliability degradation, and severe process/voltage/temperature variation, resulting in unpredictable behaviors and temporary or permanent failure of circuits and systems. This project proposes a failure-resistant and variation-tolerant interconnect system that will enhance the reliability of the system at the circuit level. The project will also enhance the self-healing capability of mobile platforms by developing adaptive and automatic fault detection techniques as well as by developing  reconfigurable data access capabilities. \r\n\r\nMethodologies for developing failure-resistant computing and communication systems are critical for future semiconductor fabrication processes. An innovative failure-resistant and self-healing system could have significant impact on the industry and enhance national competitiveness. The microelectronic industry needs engineers trained in both analog/mixed-signal and radio frequency/microwave integrated circuit and system design. This project will thus contribute to the training of a competitive workforce.",
