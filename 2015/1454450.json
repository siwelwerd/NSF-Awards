 "awd_abstract_narration": "1454450 - Maroo\r\n\r\nAbility to remove heat in large amounts and in a very short time (i.e., high heat fluxes) is critical for developing next-generation heat exchangers, high-speed computing, and renewable energy technologies.  The proposed study is to take advantage that a thin liquid film at the nanoscale has the potential to achieve the ultra-high heat removal rate with proper liquid supply.  Both experiments and molecular level simulations will be used to gain fundamental understanding of such heat removal processes.  The integrated educational initiatives of this project will expose students, including those from underrepresented groups in engineering disciplines, to multidisciplinary research and nanotechnology.  Outreach includes providing yearly research opportunity to a minority undergraduate student in collaboration with ULSAMP (Upstate Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation), and yearly workshops on nanotechnology to middle-school students in Syracuse City School District as part of ULSAMP outreach to underrepresented and diverse student groups.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the proposed research is to investigate the fundamental physics associated with nanoscale meniscus evaporation coupled with passive liquid flow for achieving high heat flux removal using a synergistic research methodology of molecular simulations with pool boiling and evaporation experiments.  Passive liquid flow can be generated in a nanoscale meniscus due to the strong capillary and surface-generated disjoining forces which can lower the meniscus liquid pressure to absolute negative values.  The research plan focuses on (1) performing molecular dynamics simulations of water nano-meniscus evaporation to elucidate its behavior and characteristics, (2) pool boiling experiments of water coupled with nanoscale evaporation to enhance the critical heat flux, and (3) experiments on nanoscale meniscus evaporation to achieve high heat flux removal with passive flow of water.  The intellectual merits include implementation and validation of a novel \"solid-to-liquid heat transfer model\" in molecular dynamics to simulate evaporation of water from a heated surface, and fabrication of well-defined novel geometries to achieve nanoscale meniscus evaporation.  The education plan includes development and implementation of a three-week module on \"Nano-science and Nano-engineering\" for first-year undergraduate students in Engineering 101.  The module will be based on Model Development Sequences to promote and develop the need for physical and visual understanding of mathematical models and engineering concepts while using fundamental building blocks of atoms and molecules.  To assess how novice students use simulation module to explore physical phenomena, assignments with a data-generating mechanism will also be designed to collect real-time performance data.",
