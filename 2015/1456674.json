 "awd_abstract_narration": "Taxonomy, the science of finding, describing and naming organisms, is vital to biological research and conservation of life's diversity. The on-going effort to survey, inventory, and preserve the ocean's biological diversity is threatened by a shortage of taxonomic expertise. Although focused on Caribbean biodiversity, the overarching goal of this project is to promote conservation of marine biodiversity around the world. This project will make it easier to correctly identify and document marine biodiversity, to detect invasive species, and to protect rare and endangered species by training new taxonomists, by developing Internet-based resources to support taxonomic research, and by making taxonomic methods easily accessible to non-specialists.  This project will create new taxonomic descriptions and revisions of currently undescribed species from the Caribbean, which will be immediately useful to any researcher, manager, or conservation practitioner working in the region, and will contribute to the species inventory of the Caribbean. Open-access videos and how-to guides will allow specialists to convey enthusiasm for these organisms to the public, to managers, and to policy makers, and provide a way for students and the general public to learn more about taxonomy. \r\n\r\nThis project has three parts with complementary aims. Part A will document the biodiversity of 6 groups of marine organisms with high, but poorly known, diversity in the Southern Caribbean (sponges, hydroids, sea anemones, sea squirts, ribbon worms, and seaweeds). This work will emphasize the integration of traditional morphological and molecular characters with non-traditional characters such as larval morphology, live coloration, and characters derived from confocal and electron microscopy. Established experts will work closely with experts-in-training, with a focus on species from the Caribbean coast of Panama that are known to be in particular need of taxonomic revision. Part B will provide training workshops for graduate students and junior researchers interested in developing taxonomic expertise in one of 6 focal groups; enabling them to (1) identify species in the field, (2) efficiently collect and preserve material for subsequent taxonomic work, (3) use existing keys or monographs to identify material to species, and (4) develop personal connections with a global network of other students and specialists. Part C will make the basic skills and vocabulary involved in the taxonomy of all 6 groups globally accessible to both expert and non-specialist workers in biodiversity and conservation. This part will develop a standard package of internet-based tools for each group, including a set of how-to videos and illustrated definitions of technical terms, with translations into several languages. This toolkit will be designed to facilitate rapid biodiversity documentation and to increase the precision of preliminary field identifications.",

There is a particular need for experts specializing in marine biodiversity, where it is estimated that 30-60% or even 90% of eukaryotic species remain to be described or discovered. This project, based in Bocas del Toro, Panama, aimed to increase accessibility of specialist knowledge on 6 under-studied groups of marine invertebrates. We organized a series of 2-week taxonomy training workshops for graduate students and young professionals seeking to develop expertise in the 6 focal groups: sponges, sea anemones, hydroids, ribbon worms, sea squirts and tropical seaweeds. Each course included lectures, field trips, laboratory exercises, and independent projects. Lectures focused the systematic and taxonomic organization of the group, definitions and coding of important taxonomic characters, and the overall biology, life histories and natural history of the group. Field trips focused on different collection methods, documentation of in situ features, locality and habitat information, and methods for rapid assessment of biodiversity. Laboratory exercises focus on the methods used for identification and taxonomic descriptions, putting the character scoring information learned from the lectures into practice. Students also participated in class projects. Overall, we trained 81 students from 25 countries.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We shared the biodiversity knowledge generated during these courses as well pro-tips on how to study organisms in these 6 groups. We published a peer-reviewed article that documents the diversity of hydroids of Bocas del Toro, Panama, and includes an identification guide to the species collected during the course. Another peer-reviewed article focused on a revision of Panamanian sea squirts in the genus&nbsp;<em>Pyura</em>, including a description of 4 new species. An assessment of the diversity of ribbon worms of the region, showing an increase from 18 to almost 200 species now documented for the region is being prepared for publication. In addition to biodiversity documentation, we produced a series of how-to videos for each focal group, available on YouTube. These include how to collect, preserve, dissect and examine organisms in each group. We made illustrated glossaries of anatomical terms for each group with a translation tool to provide the equivalent term and definition in other languages.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bio-diversity data collected during the project is available through a web portal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/30/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rachel&nbsp;Collin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1456674/1456674_10354591_1585605239158_planktontow--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1456674/1456674_10354591_1585605239158_planktontow--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Plankton Sample\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1456674/1456674_10354591_1585605239158_planktontow--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Plankton Sample\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Carolina Sheridan a participant in the hydrozoan class looks at a plankton sample</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Maycol Madrid</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Rachel&nbsp;Collin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Plankton Sample</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1456674/1456674_10354591_1585605356207_biodiversitydata--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1456674/1456674_10354591_1585605356207_biodiversitydata--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Taking data\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1456674/1456674_10354591_1585605356207_biodiversitydata--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Taking data\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sponges, sea squirts and hydroids are abundant on mangrove roots.
