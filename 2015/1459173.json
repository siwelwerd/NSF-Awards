 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantification and understanding of ocean mixing remains one of the most challenging problems in physical oceanography and ocean climate. The accurate representation (parameterization) and distribution of mixing in ocean circulation models is critical to correctly reproduce a wide range of processes from precipitation in the western equatorial Pacific to the strength of the meridional overturning cell and biogeochemical cycles. Near-inertial waves are one of three major sources of deep-ocean mixing. Little is known about their energy pathways beyond their wind generation and that only 15-25% of the wind-forced near-inertial wave energy radiates equatorward as low mode waves. These waves contain half the kinetic energy and most of the vertical shear in the ocean. About a terawatt of inertial wind power is injected by a few dozen mid-latitude fall and winter storms. While numerical and observational evidence points to the bulk of the inertial wind power being lost in the near-field of storm forcing, dissipating and mixing immediately below the surface layer, there has been little observational work to investigate this major piece of the inertial energy budget in detail. As well as determining the fate of wind-forced near-inertial waves, the proposed work will quantify the climatologically-important depth dependence of turbulent mixing in the pycnocline. The project investigators will consult with numerical modelers to how to improve parameterizations for internal-wave-driven turbulent mixing based on their observational findings. A graduate student will be trained in data analysis and interpretation and the project scientists will continue their local public outreach efforts.\r\n\r\nAn innovative observational strategy is proposed to determine the zero-order near-field fate of inertial wind power and the vertical distribution of upper-ocean mixing following storms. An array of twelve profiling floats with electro-magnetic current meters and temperature microstructure sensors will be deployed in the western North Pacific near the inertial wind power gain maximum for a fall-winter season. Using bi-directional Iridium communications, dynamic sampling will focus on storm responses. The instruments will repeatedly profile every three hours between ~ 3 m of the surface and 500-m depth, collecting roughly five thousand profiles of temperature, salinity, horizontal velocity and turbulent temperature-variance dissipation rate. These measurements will provide about fifty independent depth-time series of the surface mixed-layer and upper pycnocline storm responses following five to ten fall and winter storms for a random variety of ocean eddy states. Harmonic fits will separate near-inertial, sub-inertial and higher-frequency signals. The measurements will quantify where and how near-inertial shear contributes to turbulence mixing, as well as estimate radiative losses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFall and winter storms in the western North Pacific are a global hotspot for near-inertial wave forcing.  These internal gravity waves then radiate equatorward and downward into the stratified ocean interior to mix deeper waters and drive the meridional overturning circulation.  But only a small fraction of the energy appears to radiate equatorward.  Little is known about the near-field fate of the bulk of this input.  Measurements were made during two fall-winter seasons in the Kuroshio-Oyashio Confluence east of Japan using autonomous floats that measure temperature, salinity, velocity and turbulent microstructure depth profiles to follow the fate of near-inertial wave energy from generation by storms to dissipation in the surface layer and upper ocean with a focus on the role of eddies in rapidly siphoning this energy downward.   \n\n \n\nMost of storm-forced near-inertial energy is lost to dissipation in the surface layer, leaving only a small fraction to propagate downward and equatorward as internal waves.  In the upper ocean, near-inertial wave shear modulates turbulent dissipation and mixing, especially in anticyclonic eddies where near-inertial waves can be trapped and amplified.  Inside (outside) anticyclones, a finescale parameterization overestimates (underestimates) turbulence.\n\n \n\nAt the perimeter of an anticyclonic eddy, floats measured near-inertial wave packets propagating downward and inward toward the eddy center, consistent with wave/mean flow interaction theory predictions.  Ray-tracing simulations reveal a shallow near-inertial wave shadow zone on the perimeter of the anticyclonic eddy where shear and turbulence are observed to be weak while both are amplified at greater depths below the shadow zone.  Near-inertial wave packets reflect/refract inward due to large gradients in velocity and vorticity at the eddy rim.  Superposition of near-inertial wave and eddy shears, as well as wave amplification, lead to inertially-modulated patches of enhanced turbulence.\n\n \n\nThis measurement program suggests that the bulk of near-inertial wave energy input by winds is lost to dissipation in the surface layer and only a small fraction is available for radiation and mixing in the stratified ocean interior.  The surface eddy field strongly modulates where this mixing will occur. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ren-Chieh Lien"
