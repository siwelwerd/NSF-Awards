 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed research will investigate the physiological responses of fish species to altered salinity. Salinization of freshwater ecosystems has been identified as an important global threat to ecosystem goods and services. Yet very little is known about how increased salinity will impact freshwater communities and ecosystems. The proposed research will contribute a mechanistic understanding on how salinity alters suites of physiological and behavioral traits and how these changes in turn shape geographic distributions and fish community structure. The proposed research also includes an educational outreach component focused on middle school students. Live fish will be used in classrooms to teach students biological concepts through inquiry-based approaches. Assessments of a pilot program have shown improved student understanding of biological concepts and increased test scores.\r\n\r\nAll species in nature show a limited geographical distribution. Indeed, one of the most fundamental goals of ecological and physiological research is to explain why some organisms occur in some environments and not others. Geographic range limits also pose a fundamental evolutionary question; why don't populations evolve over time to occupy a wider range of environments. Such simple questions remain largely unanswered for most organisms, limiting our ability to predict how organisms respond to environmental variation.  The challenge persists in part because the causes of geographic range limits requires an understanding of how multiple abiotic and biotic factors covary in the environment, and how suites of different traits respond and adapt to these challenges. In the research proposed here, the distributional limits of closely related tropical fish species in the genus Poecilia are investigated. When these fish occur together they segregate along a salinity gradient, but when they occur alone they span a broad range of salinities, suggesting salinity tolerance and competitive interactions jointly shape distributional limits and community structure. The proposed research focuses on how osmoregulation, behavioral aggression, hormones, metabolic scope, and locomotor performance interact with each other. These traits are typically studied separately, however, their joint study reveals new hypotheses on how shared mechanisms can influence multiple traits in ways that lead to geographic range limits. The proposed research will use lab and field experiments to first test 1) how elevated energetic costs of salinity stress, interspecific competition, and predation pressure may make some environments too expensive to persist in, and 2) how hormonal changes associated with osmoregulation may compromise competitive ability and food acquisition. Second, the proposed research will explore the role of gene flow, additive genetic variation, and negative genetic correlations as evolutionary constraints on osmoregulation and competitive ability using a combination of lab breeding experiments, genomic approaches, and artificial selection experiments. Collectively, the proposed research not only offers an opportunity to test the eco-physiological and evolutionary causes of geographic range limits, but also provides an integrative framework that can be applied more broadly.",

Yet, the mechanisms that allow or prevent an organism from occupying a given environment remain poorly understood.&nbsp;This project investigated the mechanisms that determine the distributional limits of two closely related tropical fish species along a salinity gradient. Across all rivers on the island of Trinidad,&nbsp;<em>Poecilia reticulata</em>&nbsp;is only found in freshwater. In lowland rivers where freshwater transitions to brackish water&nbsp;<em>Poecilia picta</em>&nbsp;is largely restricted to brackish water, although coexists with&nbsp;<em>P. reticulata</em>&nbsp;in a narrow band of freshwater. At first glance the replacement of&nbsp;<em>P. reticulata</em>&nbsp;by&nbsp;<em>P. picta</em>&nbsp;appears to simply reflect differences in their salinity tolerance, but both species are known to be tolerant of wide range of salinities suggesting a more complex relationship with salinity. Indeed, a major outcome of this project is the recognition that salinity tolerance is integrated with other physiological functions, resulting in complex trade-offs which underly distribution patterns in nature. Using a combination of field and laboratory experiments, we found that both species perform best in freshwater, but&nbsp;<em>P. picta</em>&nbsp;is more tolerant of brackish water. In turn,&nbsp;<em>P. reticulata</em>&nbsp;is competitively dominant to&nbsp;<em>P. picta</em>&nbsp;in freshwater and appears to prevent&nbsp;<em>P. picta</em>&nbsp;from expanding its distribution into freshwater. Breeding experiments comparing distinct family lines of&nbsp;<em>P. reticulata</em>&nbsp;revealed a genetically based trade-off between the ability of to compete against&nbsp;<em>P. picta</em>&nbsp;in freshwater versus the ability to tolerate brackish water, suggesting the evolution of increased salinity tolerance would come at the expense of being a good competitor in freshwater. These results were confirmed in field and lab transplant experiments showing that when&nbsp;<em>P. reticulata</em>&nbsp;are experimentally transferred to brackish water with&nbsp;<em>P. picta</em>, they lose their advantage over&nbsp;<em>P. picta</em>&nbsp;and experience a loss in&nbsp;body mass and have reduced survival.&nbsp;Why this trade-off exists appears related in part to how the hormones that control the maintenance of internal salt balance impact other traits. Moving from freshwater to brackish water is known to cause a temporary increase in hormones such as cortisol, which in turn causes increased expression of genes involved in maintaining internal salt balance. However, these same hormones are also known to impact other biological pathways that reduce aggression and compromise immune responses. Indeed, by experimentally moving&nbsp;<em>P. reticulata</em>&nbsp;into brackish water in the lab we found changes in the expression of genes in that brain that were associated with increased salinity tolerance and reduced aggressive behavior in the presence of&nbsp;<em>P. picta</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Experimental exposure of&nbsp;<em>P. reticulata&nbsp;</em>to brackish water in the field also increased their parasite load and reduced their swimming performance. These results are consistent with the more general perspective on how elevated stress hormones are thought to influence traits other than salinity tolerance.&nbsp;&nbsp;We suggest such trade-offs are likely to be common because hormones frequently target multiple biological pathways (see Figure 1). It has been suggested that physiological acclimation can overcome the challenges imposed by elevated salinity levels. However, we found no evidence that developing in brackish water was able to overcome the negative consequences of salinity, and in some cases made things worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;More generally, we found the results of this project are consistent with a broader pattern observed in nature. A meta-analysis of published papers shows that when closely related species replace each other along an environmental gradient, one species is dominant and competitively excludes the subordinate species from the region of the gradient where both perform best. However, subordinate species have broader environmental tolerance and are able to occupy the less preferred region of the gradient. Thus, trade-offs between competitive ability and environmental tolerance appear a general pattern that we refer to as the ?competitive exclusion-tolerance rule?. We argue future studies should quantify how organismal performance along environmental gradients changes in the presence and absence species interactions (see Figure 2). This project also resulted in the development and implementation of an educational kit that uses&nbsp;<em>P. reticulata</em>&nbsp;to teach students the principles of evolution by natural selection. The kit uses live guppies in the classroom and students learn biological concepts through inquiry-based approaches. Assessment of this program found students perform better on exams and gain a deeper appreciation of biological concepts compared to traditional approaches (see Figure 3).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/25/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Cameron&nbsp;K&nbsp;Ghalambor</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1457383/1457383_10388216_1687716338652_Outcome_Figure_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1457383/1457383_10388216_1687716338652_Outcome_Figure_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.
