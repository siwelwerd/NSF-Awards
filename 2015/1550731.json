 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ants are one of the most abundant insects on Earth. Ants churn the soil, scavenge the dead, suppress (and sometimes propagate) pests, and are themselves some of our most pernicious pests. Ants are ectotherms (i.e., cold-blooded), which means that the health and activity of an ant colony depends in part on the weather. Climate, in turn, is weather observed over time, and abundance evidence shows that climate is changing. This research addresses a key task in ecology by exploring how changing climate across the U.S. will impact the health and activity of ants and, by extension, how shifts in ant species may impact the many species that ants influence. The research tackles a widespread problem: that to document ecological change one must first have detailed historical records of the way ecosystems once were. Such records are rare. This research fills that knowledge gap by revisiting 34 ant communities from across the United States that were first sampled approximately 20 years ago. At the time, those ant studies represented the best global snapshot of the abundance and diversity of this important insect group. This second, high-resolution snapshot will generate an unprecedented 34, 20-year trajectories of ant communities.  When matched to the latest climate trends and ecological theory, the work will paint one of the first pictures of how ecological communities are changing nation-wide. These data will allow ecologists to refine the predictions of how animals respond to climate change, and will jump-start such efforts by the nascent National Ecological Observatory Network.  \r\n\r\nThis research resamples 34 ant transects of 30 m2 plots from across North America that were originally sampled in 1994-95. The sites include or are matched to those of the nascent NEON network. The resulting 20-year trajectories of ant abundance and diversity will be used to tests three theories: Thermal Adaptation (the dominant model of thermal ecology which posits that thermal tolerance tracks climate means and variability); Biogeochemical Competence (a new hypothesis that links biogeochemistry to tissue concentrations of phosphorus (P), with P-rich tissue enhancing thermal tolerance); and Species Energy Theory (a dominant model of macroecology that builds mechanistic links between climate, abundance, and diversity). It tests these hypotheses at the population scale (i.e., do populations of species vary predictably in their thermal tolerance and dynamics?), across species (how does the mean species performance vary?), and summed across whole communities (what is the net change in the activity and abundance of ants in an ecosystem?). These samples will be calibrated with NEON by-catch of ground beetle pitfall traps to couple historical with future community trajectories.",

Ants are among the most common insects on the planet, found everywhere but the polar ice caps. Ants touch nearly every strand of the ecological web: ants aerate and enrich the soil, scavenge dead animals and plants, and disperse seed that they later plant. Our research explored how, over 20 years, ant communities in the US&mdash;from desert scrub, to mountain tundra, from high prairie to northwest rain forests&mdash;have been changing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To do this, we took advantage of an NSF-supported project funding our original survey of 49 sites in the mid-90&rsquo;s, where we carefully counted the number of colonies and species using long, 330-meter lines of 1x1 meter plots. Each plot was scoured, looking for evidence of ants and ant colonies. We removed all the leaf litter and sticks, inspecting them for ants and the tiny colonies that may live within and between them. We searched the soil for nest entrances and ants wandering over the surface. We excavated. We, in short, got them all. In wide open sandy deserts around Calexico California, this resurvey would take three days. In tropical rainforest, it could take three weeks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our resurveys in 2016 and 2017 used the same methods and involved long road trips in trucks full of equipment, myself, our post doc Dr. Michael Weiser, two graduate students (two, now professors) Karl Roeder, Rebecca Prather, and Jelena Bujan, and two undergraduates (one in grad school, one in med school) Josh Kouri and Katherine Micek. We were also informed by twenty years of research that suggests ants vary considerably in their preferred temperatures, but that ants were on average high temperature specialists.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What had happened to the ant communities from the 1990&rsquo;s, as mean temperatures had already increased an average of 1&deg;C, from 0&deg; to 2.5&deg;C across our 34 sites?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our first paper&mdash;led by Dr. Michael Kaspari: \"Species energy and Thermal Performance Theory predict 20-yr changes in ant community abundance and richness\" in the journal <em>Ecology</em>&mdash;tested the hypothesis that ant communities will initially benefit from small increases in temperature but will suffer when temperature increases grew too large. We found the number of colonies in an ant community had increased at temperatures up to +1.5&deg;C then dramatically decreased through +2.5&deg;C. Ant communities supported a few more species per site, probably because warm temperatures enhanced the ability of ants to move there from adjacent communities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dr. Jelena Bujan's paper&mdash;\"Seasonal plasticity of thermal tolerance in ants.\" in the journal <em>Ecology</em>&mdash;asked a different question: how do the 26 ant species from the warm grasslands of southern Oklahoma adjust their thermal tolerances as the seasons change? Rather than there be one temperature tolerance per species, she found that the most common ant species (included the imported fire ant) adjusted their ability to forage in hot temperatures by just how hot it actually was. December ants shut down at temperatures up to 7&deg;C lower than those after the heat of summer. Dr. Bujan showed another adaptation of ants: their ability to adjust to changing temperatures, which may also help them survive modest temperature changes to their ecosystem.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dr. Bujan's second paper&mdash;\"Thermal diversity of North American ant communities: Cold tolerance but not heat tolerance tracks ecosystem temperature\" in <em>Global Ecology and Biogeography</em>&mdash;asked a similar question, but with ants from across North America. There has been some speculation among ecologists that the insects from, say, a cold prairie in North Dakota may generally be less heat tolerant than those from a hot grassland in the panhandle of Florida. Jelena found little support for that idea. Instead, every ant community we studied, a total of 132 ant species, had their share of cool, medium, and hot temperature specialists. This was yet another indication that ant communities may have within them a robust toolkit of thermal tactics that allow them to survive a changing environment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>That conclusion was supported by our final paper, still in peer review, by Dr. Karl Roeder \"Thermal traits predict the winners and losers of climate change: an example from North American ant communities\". Karl used the same dataset as Jelena above to ask, &ldquo;Are these thermal abilities of different ant species, grouped into genera, predictive of &ldquo;winners&rdquo; and &ldquo;losers&rdquo;? That is, are our data on thermal tolerances predictive of ant community change as the Earth heats up? Karl found that 2/3rds of ant genera in North America increased their abundance over a 20-year period. Those that declined, as predicted, were those most susceptible to increasing temperatures.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In short, Earth&rsquo;s incremental heating over the past 20 years has favored this dominant insect group; but further increases will likely harm even the ants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/21/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;E&nbsp;Kaspari</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1550731/1550731_10383052_1600718318304_NEONants(horizontal)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1550731/1550731_10383052_1600718318304_NEONants(horizontal)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Composite of all the sites studied on this project\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1550731/1550731_10383052_1600718318304_NEONants(horizontal)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Composite of all the sites studied on this project\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">We re-visited 34 ecosystems, 20 years after we first sampled their ant communities.
