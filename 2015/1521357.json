SiC and GaN device concepts for high power switches and demonstration of high power switching capability with superior properties, as well as new processing and materials possibilities will be major areas on which the Workshop will focus. It is one of the few workshop format meetings where the latest results can be debated and discussed in a relatively open format. WOCSEMMAD has played a key role in identifying new directions for research. The workshop will be held February 16-19, 2015 at Wild Dunes, Isle of Palms, South Carolina and the project will support student participation. WOCSEMMAD's broader impact will be on the design and development of novel new devices and materials. Along with these new materials and devices, new industries and jobs will be created with lasting impact on science and economy.",
