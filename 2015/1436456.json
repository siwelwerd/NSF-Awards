 "awd_abstract_narration": "This dissertation examines whether host country immigration policies shape the discourses and organizational alliances of worldwide advocacy groups. The project analyses the case of specific diaspora in Western Europe and the United States.  Drawing on internet documents, website hyperlinks and social media affiliations, it uses cross-national comparison to examine:  (1) the effects of host country immigration policies on the discourses and network structure of diaspora advocacy organizations; (2) the social media affiliations with these discourses among the host country diaspora population; and (3) the ethnic identities and participation of diaspora activists in these host countries.  \r\n\r\nThis study analyzes over four thousand active websites associated with diasporic advocacy in two dozen countries.  Comparative analysis examines how host country immigration policies shape the prevalence of these different discourses (e.g. ethnic autonomy and separatism), the affiliation rates among the host country population and the network structure of hyperlinks among websites that indicate alliances and divides among these advocacy groups. Finally, we examine whether these organizational patterns are linked to rates of violence by and against diaspora in these countries. This research has implications for theoretical development and use by stakeholders relative to similar cases.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major objective of this project is to examine the organization of the transnational Kurdish advocacy movement as represented by the network structure of websites.   A secondary goal is to develop online network data collection techniques to more fully map the universe of Kurdish websites and their links.   The Kurdish advocacy movement is a prime candidate for this type of study since there is a global widely-dispersed diaspora community that is highly active in using the internet to publicize its views.  Over half of all self-identified Kurds world-wide reside outside of traditionally defined Kurdish areas in Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey.   These websites present a wide variety of goals from cultural preservation and language loyalty to political objectives including founding a new Kurdish state.   Our leading methodological hypothesis is that traditional webscraping methods have significantly underestimated the number of Kurdish advocacy websites and groups and misrepresented the interorganizational structure of the networks created by these sites.   Our major substantive hypothesis is that the content of Kurdish nationalist discourses is shaped by the ethnic relations and immigration/assimilation regimes in the receiving countries where Kurdish advocates reside.  \n\n \n\nThis study produced evidence that the number of Kurdish websites is well over ten-fold the number estimated by previous studies that used only outbound and reciprocated website links and is far more integrated than previously thought.  We use Query Driven Sampling (QDS), which is adapted to the \"Internet II\" system that came into place post-2006.  It records both in- and out-bound/colinks that tie organizations together symbolically through their website links.  Contemporary link data collection methods rely solely on outbound and reciprocated links, which greatly underestimate the number of links and fail to identify many organizations that are in fact maintaining websites advocating on behalf of different visions of Kurdish nationality. QDS also makes it possible to examine the structure of interorganizational networks which are far more complex and integrated than found in previous studies using conventional internet crawler programs.\n\n \n\nOur study produced evidence of the following specific findings:\n\n1)      There is an important temporal aspect in internet network development.  Since it takes time for organizations to become known to each other, current methods are biased towards collecting data on more established organizations and less likely to identify new leaders and groups.\n\n2)      New QDS search tools allowed us to develop a more accurate picture of the number of Kurdish advocacy organizations, creating a roughly ten-fold increase over the current \"snowball and scrap\" methodologies.  The structure of these networks also differed, finding considerably more integration and different nodes of centrality.\n\n3)      Analysis and subsequent interviews with Kurdish activists confirmed that newer organizations have a different view of the \"Kurdish problem\" and are more focused on cultural preservation and more moderate in their political objectives.  This is often missed in existing methods of data collection, which focus on older groups and their networks.\n\n4)      By combining content analysis of the discourse of Kurdish websites with network analysis, we can identify clusters of organizations that share the same basic discourse and webpage interlinks.  Because we can identify the national location of these Kurdish websites (44% of which are located in the U.S.), we can assess the extent to which the discourses of these advocacy organizations are shaped by the immigration/assimilation regime in place in the receiving country of the organization. \n\n5)      There are four general discourses that are rooted in the assimilation/immigration regimes in the receiving countries.  Kurdish groups in the US and UK focus on the politicization of the movement, emphasizing fundraising and networking of a largely cultural preservation agenda through official channels to gain political alliances. In Germany, assimilationist policies have produced an integrationist advocacy of Kurdishness as a \"hyphenated-German\" and German language is commonly used.  Multicultural immigration regimes (e.g. Sweden) produce an insular and militant Kurdish identity, including demands for political autonomy and a new state.

Last are the Assimilationist regimes, such as France, which produce a smaller more centralized network of organizations. These groups are the most limited in their claims, confining their advocacy to preserving culture and language.\n\n6)      These receiving country assimilation/immigration regimes are also related to violence perpetrated by Kurds and against them. While Germany has the most violence, most of the targets in Germany are actually Turkish, whereas the Kurds in France are more likely to target native groups.\n\n7)      Through qualitative interviews in Britain, I found that Kurdish activists have a coherent media strategy that informs the content of their website and its linkages to other Kurdish websites.  These media strategies are seen as adapted to the assimilation/immigration policies of the receiving country, which is also associated with the age of the organization, its religiosity and general agenda.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/12/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J.
