 "awd_abstract_narration": "The objective of this research is to develop new neurodynamic programming (NDP) learning algorithm for controlling neuron-level activity (spiking) and synaptic-level plasticity in CMOS/memristor devices, such that the subsequent system-level response achieves desired sensorimotor behavioral goals.  The approach is to uses a radically new training paradigm that induces functional plasticity by controlling the neural activity of selected input neurons via programming voltages, rather than by directly manipulating the synaptic weights, as do virtually all existing training algorithms.\r\n\r\nIntellectual merit\r\nThis research aims to develop a model of the closures required to translate synaptic-level plasticity into functional-level plasticity that results into high-level behavioral goals and problem solving abilities.  The same critical challenge has been identified in neuroscience research aimed at reverse engineering the brain, and in the regulation of deep-brain stimulation (DBS).  Due to this knowledge gap, even when a measure of adequate or desired behavior is available, it may not be easily utilized to stimulate a neural network at the cell level in order to produce the appropriate macroscopic behavior.\r\n\r\nBroader impact\r\nThe learning model developed in this research will be used toward the development of nanoscale neuromorphic systems that mimic neuro-biological architectures in the nervous system.  Thanks to their abilities to recreate the synaptic plasticity, device density, scalability, and fault-tolerance of biological neuronal networks, these neuromorphic systems can enable a wide range of technological advancements, such as intelligent robots with highly-sophisticated sensorimotor skills, and neuroprosthetic devices capable of adapting to changing conditions and environments.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research project has developed new software and hardware with sensorimotor control and learning abilities analogous to those exhibited by biological brains, thus rendering modern autonomous robots and vehicles significantly more flexible and efficient.  We have developed novel paradigms and algorithms for spike-based adaptive critic controllers that are realizable in CMOS/memristor or other neuromorphic hardware exhibiting the same type of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) observed in biological neuronal networks.  Neuromorphic chips were trained and used to represent the control law (actor), and the behavioral goals (critic) of insect-like robots.  Instead of modifying the synaptic weights, our training algorithms adapt actor and critic spiking neural networks to learn implicit models of the closures required to translate cell-level neuronal activity (spiking) and plasticity (STDP) into adequate system-level learning and control.  The approach has been demonstrated on insect-like walking and flying robots that are capable of autonomously performing sensing and control tasks simultaneously, such as, walking, flying, and navigating in an unknown environment populated with obstacles and targets. \nThis project has made substantial contributions to the future implementation of neuromorphic computers, which seek to emulate biological brains so as to adaptively interact with uncertain and changing environments.  With the algorithms developed in this research, insect-like robots? brains have shown to exhibit the same type of synaptic plasticity, device density, scalability, and fault-tolerance observed in biological neuronal networks.  A fundamental challenge that this project has overcome is controlling the neuron-level activity and plasticity such that the subsequent system-level response achieves desired behavioral goals.  Recent studies have shown that, in biological sensorimotor systems, the neuron-level activity is modulated by dopaminergic (DA) neuronal activity in the basal ganglia that resembles that observed in the critic network, and that depends on internal representations of system-level behavioral goals.  Previous adaptive critic designs were not applicable to CMOS/memristor training, because they relied on the direct manipulation of synaptic weights, which is unsupported in biology or in memristor hardware.  Furthermore, existing designs require knowledge of the neural network input/output mapping, which for spiking CMOS/memristor models is not available in closed-form, and can only be obtained by numerical integration from a set of nonlinear differential equations.
