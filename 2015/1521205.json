 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project is to improve plant productivity by using a new epigenetic plant breeding technology to improve crop yields. This new technology optimizes epigenetic information in a plant to stimulate plant growth and vigor in a manner similar to hybrid plant vigor. This proposal seeks to combine this new method with traditional hybrids to increase plant yields. It is likely that insights into the epigenetic mechanisms involved in plants improved by this method will advance the understanding of the long-standing mystery of how heterosis increases yields in hybrid plants. Commercially, higher yielding crops are more profitable to farmers and seed producers, thereby increasing profitability throughout the rural agricultural economies. More importantly, these crops are better for the environment as they require less land, water, fuel, and fertilizer than traditional crops for equivalent yields. \r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to test the hypothesis that the proposed epigenetic technology can increase yields in hybrid corn. The project's goal is to measure yields in field tests with the appropriate epigenetically improved hybrids to test this hypothesis. The project's objectives are to develop two sets of epigenetically modified corn plants to be crossed to heterotic parent plants for hybrid testing. One population will utilize a naturally occurring mutant in the Msh1 gene. The second population will be developed with RNAi silencing methods. Both populations will be screened for optimal phenotypic and molecular responses. Selected individual plants will be advanced for crossing in a winter nursery to produce hybrid seed. This epigenetically improved hybrid seed will be field tested for increased yields relative to control hybrid plants. The anticipated result is that higher yields will be observed, thereby demonstrating the breakthrough potential of this new technology.",

Increased yields help farm profitability and the environment by growing more without requiring more resources. Our technology approach is first to suppress Msh1, a gene that controls DNA methylation in plants.This was the main activity of the project and excellent results were achieved, allowing us to proceed to field testing faster than planned. Typically, MSH1 suppression is for a limited number of generations to create useful epigenetics after which MSH1 function is restored in the plant which retains the useful epigenetic modifications. Suppression of MSH1 causes loss-of-function phenotypes including white or yellow striping on some plants. These temporary phenotypes indicate MSH1 suppression is occurring in the plant. As shown in Figure 1, corn plants suppressed for MSH1 function displayed this striped phenotype demonstrating corn has a biological response to MSH1-suppression similar to that observed in other plant species including sorghum, a species closely related to corn that has been previously demonstrated to have higher yields when our technology was used in sorghum. The second part of the proposal was to perform field tests to test for increased yields in corn hybrids derived from an epigenetically enhanced parent. Field tests in 2016 did not show an increased yield relative to controls. We conclude that we demonstrated that corn has typical MSH1 loss-of-function phenotypes observed in other plant species. This is an important advance for implementing our epigenetic technology in corn. However, we also conclude that one generation of exposure to MSH1 loss-of-function was not sufficient for establishment of useful epigenetic modifications and that more generations of MSH1 suppression are required and are being tested. &nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/02/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;E&nbsp;Fromm</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1521205/1521205_10372077_1483369699980_Striped_Corn--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1521205/1521205_10372077_1483369699980_Striped_Corn--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Msh1 suppressed corn\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1521205/1521205_10372077_1483369699980_Striped_Corn--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Msh1 suppressed corn\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Msh1 suppression in corn leads to the expected variagation in corn leaves.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Epicrop</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Michael&nbsp;E&nbsp;Fromm</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Msh1 suppressed corn</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
