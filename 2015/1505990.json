 "awd_abstract_narration": "Embedded deep in the ice cap at the South Pole, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory (ICNO) is the world's largest and most sensitive high energy neutrino telescope. It is a 1 billion-ton detector using the Antarctic ice as a detection medium for high energy atmospheric and astrophysical neutrinos. Most of the neutrinos observed by IceCube exhibit energies in the range expected for atmospheric neutrinos originating from decays of particles produced in extensive air showers by cosmic rays coming from nearby sectors of the Milky Way Galaxy. These may be used to measure the fundamental properties of neutrinos. At higher energies, astrophysical neutrinos are key probes of the high-energy universe. Because of their unique properties, neutrinos escape even dense regions, are not deflected by galactic or extra-galactic magnetic fields and traverse the photon-filled universe unhindered. Thus, neutrinos provide direct information about the dynamics and interiors of the powerful cosmic objects that may be the origins of high energy cosmic rays: supernovae, black holes, pulsars, active galactic nuclei and other extreme extragalactic phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe science of IceCube is broad and interdisciplinary. As a consequence, there are several opportunities for collaboration with other experiments. Of special interest at Delaware is the connection with solar and heliospheric physics. The counting rates in IceTop are highly sensitive to changes in solar activity as it affects the flux of cosmic rays arriving at Earth. The relevant data from IceTop sensors are posted online in near real time in the context of other, complementary measures of solar activity. Delaware participates in the IceCube Master Class program for high school students, and hosts local students for research experience.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this award is to study the high-energy cosmic-ray events detected by IceCube including IceTop. IceTop is the surface component of IceCube, with a pair of ice-filled tanks near the top of each down-hole cable. Each tank is instrumented with two digital optical modules (DOMs) integrated into the overall IceCube data acquisition system. This award also contributes to the main mission of IceCube, which is to study high-energy neutrinos of astrophysical origin. A key aspect for astrophysical neutrinos is to understand the background due to neutrinos produced at Earth by interactions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere. The astrophysical neutrinos are produced by interactions of cosmic rays in distant, energetic astrophysical sources. Both in neutrino astronomy and in cosmic-ray physics, the goal is to understand the origin and acceleration mechanisms of high-energy particles in Nature.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCosmic-ray physics is the study of elementary particles in Nature.  Protons and nuclei are accelerated to high energy in distant astrophysical sources such as supernova remnants and active galaxies.  As in experiments at accelerators, when these particles interact with gas or in dense radiation fields, secondary particles including muons, neutrinos and gamma-rays are produced.\n\nIceCube is a cubic kilometer array of optical modules deep in the glacier at the South Pole designed to detect high-energy neutrinos from distant astrophysical sources.  The main background in the search for astrophysical neutrinos is the flux of muons and neutrinos produced by interactions of cosmic rays in the Earth?s atmosphere.  In 2013 IceCube announced the discovery of astrophysical neutrinos as an excess at high energy above the atmospheric backgrounds, which fall rapidly with increasing energy.  At the time no particular source was identified.  In 2018 a coincidence in direction and time was discovered between a high-energy neutrino reported by IceCube and a gamma-ray flare of the active galaxy TXS 0506+056.  The paper jointly by the IceCube, Fermi-LAT and other collaborations marks one aspect of the beginning of multi-messenger astronomy?the other being the discovery of gravitational waves.  The ?messengers? are photons, neutrinos, gravitational waves and cosmic-rays themselves (although, because cosmic rays have electoral charge, their directions are scrambled by propagation in magnetic fields).\n\nIceTop is the surface component of IceCube.  It is a square kilometer array of 162 ice-filled tanks above the deep array.  Each tank contains two optical modules identical to those in the deep ice and fully integrated into the data acquisition system of IceCube.  IceTop observes cascades of secondary particles from interactions of primary cosmic rays in the atmosphere.  From the timing and energy deposition of the signals in IceTop the directions and energy of the primary particles are reconstructed.  This grant has supported ?Cosmic-ray physics with IceCube.?  One goal is to improve measurements of the energy spectrum of the primary cosmic radiation.  Previously published results from IceTop cover the energy range from 2 to 1000 PeV with high resolution.  (One PeV is equivalent to a million times the rest mass energy of a single proton.)   During this grant period, by using a new trigger and filter for low energy events, the spectrum was extended to lower energy, providing overlap with a measurement at still lower energy by HAWC, which in turn connects with direct measurement from detectors in space (see attached plot #1).  Another analysis produced a new upper limit on PeV photons from the Milky Way Galaxy.  For this analysis, machine learning techniques were developed to distinguish cascades generated by photons from cascades generated by cosmic-ray protons and nuclei. \n\nIceTop as a veto for astrophysical neutrinos in IceCube:  Two approaches are used in IceCube to distinguish astrophysical neutrino candidates from atmospheric background.  One is to require the event to be from the horizon or below and to have very high energy, thus using the Earth as a filter to exclude atmospheric muons.  The other is to require the event to start inside the deep array of IceCube.  In both cases, the ice is the target volume in which the invisible, neutral neutrinos interact and reveal their presence.  The starting event sample has the merit of including events coming from above, and it excludes atmospheric neutrinos to the extent that they would be vetoed by an accompanying muon produced in the same cosmic-ray event.  Using IceTop as a veto can in principle increase the target volume for the starting event sample to include events that start in the ice between IceTop and the deep array of IceCube.  The attached plot #2 shows that the IceTop veto can add to the astrophysical neutrino sample at energies somewhat below 1 PeV.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/27/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Thomas K Gaisser"
