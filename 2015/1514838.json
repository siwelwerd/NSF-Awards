 "awd_abstract_narration": "The most massive stars are of vital interest to understanding how stars are formed, and how they affect their host galaxy throughout their life, especially in their inevitable explosive end.  We normally expect high-mass stars to form in clusters with lower-mass stars.  However, about 25% of high-mass stars are found not in clusters but in apparent isolation (known as \"field\" stars).  This project will quantify the properties of massive field stars and determine the relative contributions to the field of stars that were ejected from clusters vs those formed in isolation. These findings will set critical observational constraints on theories of star formation, which are broadly relevant to understanding our environment within our host galaxy, including planet formation.  The project will exploit new instrumentation on the 6.5-m Magellan telescope.  The project will involve both undergraduate and graduate students. They will incorporate their data sets into simple activities that can be utilized in undergraduate introductory astronomy courses. The PI is involved in several curricular innovation and outreach activities, including partnerships with the UM Special Collections Library, the historic UM Detroit Observatory, and UM Museum of Natural History. These promote broader science education among undergraduates and the public, and build synergistic ties on campus.\r\n\r\nThe team will carry out a spectroscopic monitoring survey of the field OB star population in the Small Magellanic Cloud using the Michigan/Magellan Fiber System (M2FS), a multi-object, echelle spectrometer.  Their goals are to (1) Identify field star binaries and obtain the distributions of orbital parameters, including period, mass ratio, and eccentricity. 2) Accurately determine the radial velocity distribution and constrain models of runaway ejection mechanisms. Constrain the relative contribution to the field of runaways vs stars that formed in situ. (3) Determine whether field stars that formed in situ are indeed slow rotators. (4) Identify any trends in Oe/Be star properties with binarity and v sin i while also providing high-quality monitoring of the Balmer emission.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Project has revolutionized our understanding of the enigmatic population of field massive stars found outside of clusters.  By observing the stellar motions, we find that the vast majority are ejected from birth clusters as runaway stars.  Most are due to gravitationally unstable configurations, while the rest are due to supernova explosions in close binary star pairs.  Our results indicate that stellar binarity is highly prevalent and plays a fundamental role in massive star evolution.  In fact, at least half of the supernova-ejected runaways may originate as runaway binary stars, in which a supernova explosion re-accelerates its companion.  This is supported by the unexpectedly high speeds of such stars.  We also solve the decades-long mystery of massive stars with circumstellar disks:  they are all fast rotators, and are spun up by previous mass transfer from a binary companion. \n\nWe do find that a small fraction, only a few percent, of the field massive stars are not runaways, but rather formed in relative isolation in the field.  This is a major result that places important constraints on theories for massive star formation.\n\nOur detailed analysis of the stellar spectra allowed us to test a recently introduced method for measuring stellar luminosities and masses based only on the spectra.  We find that the method breaks down for the fast rotators, and we also confirm that it similarly fails for the most luminous stars.  What the two groups have in common is that these stars are likely inflated relative to normal stars.  Thus their abnormal mass-radius relation explains why the method does not work for such objects.\n\nOur study is based on measuring stellar velocities the Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of the Milky Way visible to the naked eye in the southern hemisphere.  We also stumbled on an important serendipitous discovery that the eastern section of this small galaxy is moving away from the rest of the system.  It turns out that this is consistent with predictions that the Small Magellanic Cloud and its sister galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, collided about 150 million years ago.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/26/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sally Oey"
