 "awd_abstract_narration": "1512816 Cheng, Li-Jing \r\n\r\n\r\nThis research will develop a novel sensor device which will be able to measure molecules that are found in saliva when a person is under psychological stress.  The study if successful will enable measurement of stress markers in ambulatory setting.  Because the biosensor will be equipped with wireless connectivity, one can monitor stress experienced by the individual remotely. \r\n\r\n\r\nReal-time, detection of the stress salivary biomarkers enables assessment of stress levels in individuals. The salivary biomarkers are typically analyzed by fluorescence immunoassay and enzyme kinetic method which cannot be done in situ. The proposed stress biosensor built in a wearable configuration, will significantly benefit those regularly involved in stress-intensive activities, such as soldiers, pilots, and emergency care professionals. With the sensing function, stress and fatigue could be detected early in order to avoid impairment it may cause. Intellectual Merit: The proposed sensor consists of a composite of biopolymer impregnated with antibodies against saliva biomarkers, and nanoparticle electronics that measures changes in tunneling current upon analyte binding. This approach enables sensitive, specific and reversible detection of neutrally charged cortisol and D-amylase without addition of chemical reporters or redox reagents for signal transduction. Such capability overcomes the limits encountered in charge-based transistor/nanowire biosensors or electrochemical biosensing techniques. A passive RFID system will be integrated into the sensor for wireless monitoring of salivary biomarkers. The study will provide insights into the science of functional materials, nanoscale electron transport, mass transport in confined geometries and device integration. Broader impacts: The goal of the proposed education and outreach effort is to foster the development of a diverse science and engineering workforce with a deep understanding of functional materials, nanotechnology, and devices for biosensing and signal transduction. To achieve this goal, the education and outreach objectives are:  to develop new lab class for teaching biosensor and medical devices that allow students to conduct experiments involving, surface chemistry, molecular detection and mass transport in microfluidics, and to recruit and retain women and minorities in science and engineering careers by engaging minority undergraduate and high school students in summer research projects and through participation in our SESEY summer camp, which offers research experience in engineering fields for high school girls and minority students, and ASE program, which provides an eight-week summer apprenticeship to high school students in our research labs. A hierarchical mentorship structure is proposed in which students at each level will have the opportunity to serve as mentors for younger students.",
