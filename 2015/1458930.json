 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Research Infrastructure for Science and Engineering (HBCU-RISE) activity within the Centers of Research Excellence in Science and Technology (CREST) program supports the development of research capability at HBCUs that offer doctoral degrees in science and engineering disciplines. HBCU-RISE projects have a direct connection to the long-term plans of the host department(s) and the institutional mission, and plans for expanding institutional research capacity as well as increasing the production of doctoral students in science and engineering.  With support from the National Science Foundation, Morgan State University will implement comprehensive strategies designed to transform teaching and learning in an effort to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in electrical engineering. The project, designed to address vulnerabilities in cyber security, will impact a large population of minority students and provide opportunities for collaboration and career development for faculty. This project has the potential to contribute significantly to the pool of minority electrical engineers trained in technology that is vital to the nation's cyber infrastructure.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed research project is to enhance the security of cyber-physical systems while enhancing the research capability of the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Morgan State University by: 1) providing Internet of Things (IoT) device security at the physical layer and countermeasures to prevent attacks and ensure secure data exchange between IoT devices; 2) developing Electrical and Computer Engineering faculty research expertise and increase competitiveness regarding security of IoT devices; 3) enriching the educational and research experience of students; and 4) increasing the production of underrepresented minority students with doctoral degrees in electrical engineering. This project will equip engineering students with innovative techniques vital for tackling challenges in national cyberinfrastructure, develop the institution's research and educational capacity and productivity, and contribute to the institutional transformation. The project is aligned with the institution's strategic goal of enhancing its status as a Doctoral Research University.",

As users of the internet, we need to have a high degree of trust that the internet, its applications, and the devices linked to the internet are secure enough to perform the myriad of activities we want to do online in relation to the risk tolerance associated with those activities. The Internet of Things (IoT) is no different in this respect, and security in IoT is fundamentally linked to the ability of users to trust in their environment. If people don?t believe their connected devices and their information are reasonably secure from misuse or harm, the resulting erosion of trust causes a reluctance to use the internet. This has global consequences to electronic commerce, technical innovation, and practically every other aspect of online activities.&nbsp; As we increasingly connect devices, new opportunities to exploit potential security vulnerabilities grow. Poorly secured IoT devices could serve as entry points for cyber attack by allowing malicious individuals to re-program a device or cause a malfunction. Poorly designed devices can expose user data for theft by leaving data streams exposed. Failing or malfunctioning devices also can create security vulnerabilities. Competitive cost and technical constraints on IoT devices challenge manufacturers to adequately design security features into these devices, potentially creating security and long-term maintainability vulnerabilities greater than their traditional computer counterparts. Further, many IoT devices are primed to become ?Zombie? devices that have outlived their manufacturer security patching and support, yet still require network connectivity to function. The ZomBx<span class=\"s1\">TM </span>security trusted platform module (TPM) architecture framework addresses these security concerns by establishing a distributed rootof- trust across an entire heterogeneous networking environment comprised network and IoT devices (e.g. cameras, routers, switches, network appliances, computers, servers, computers, etc.). Some features of the ZomBx<span class=\"s1\">TM </span>framework include the following: secure boot which allows the system to boot into a defined and trusted configuration; strong memory isolation; that is, memory that cannot be accessed by other processes including operating systems and debuggers; sealed storage to house cryptographic keys and secrets; secure I/O to thwart attacks such as key-stoke logging and screen scraping; perform integrity measurements by computing hashes of executable code, configuration data, and other system state information; remote attestation which allows a trusted device to present reliable evidence to remote parties about the software it is running; built in tamper resistance; public key cryptographic operations and random number generation; real-time traffic monitoring and control; and adaptive network access control.
