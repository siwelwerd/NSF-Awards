The 2015 BMES Annual Meeting will be held in Tampa, Florida, October 7-11, 2015, and it will feature 19 parallel technical Program Tracks focused on the overall theme of \"Innovation at the Interface.\"  The BMES Annual Meeting serves as a primary vehicle for scientific sharing and dissemination of the latest advances in biomedical engineering, as well as a facilitator of important cross-fertilizations between the life sciences and engineering technologies, which foster a multi-disciplinary approach in the practice of Biomedical Engineering.\r\n\r\nThe BMES-NSF Special Session in particular builds on the success of a similar session held for the first time during the 2013 BMES Annual Meeting in Seattle, WA and for a second time during the 2014 BMES Annual Meeting in San Antonio, TX.  Both of these previous sessions increased awareness of NSF-funded research in the area of Biomedical Engineering and allowed investigators to gain a better understanding of NSF funding opportunities and of how to prepare successful grant applications.  The session also allowed for effective and in-depth interactions among attendees, NSF awardees and NSF program officers who attended the session.  The objectives of the session planned for the 2015 Annual BMES Meeting are to 1) showcase NSF funded research and researchers; 2) foster collaboration and idea sharing through a networking reception; and 3) familiarize participants with NSF and NSF funding mechanisms and provide insight into strategies for preparing competitive grant proposals.  The session will take place on Friday, October 9, 2015.  It is expected that this session will recur on an annual basis to contribute to a comprehensive approach by BMES in partnership with NSF in ensuring development of a diverse, well educated, and technically competent biomedical engineering workforce.",
