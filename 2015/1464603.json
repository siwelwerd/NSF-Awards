 "awd_abstract_narration": "Clemson University and Georgia Institute of Technology collaboratively propose to form a new Industry University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) for \"Real-Time Intelligence for Smart Electric Grid Operations (RISE). Scalable real-time intelligence to dynamically plan and operate our national electricity infrastructure, end-to-end, with more renewable energy sources effectively in terms of cost, reliability, resiliency, and sustainability is a challenge today. The RISE Center will develop new technologies to benefit society for many years to come. Clemson University and Georgia Institute of Technology will involve initiatives that will broaden representation of underrepresented groups in this field. This award will support a planning meeting for the proposed center. \r\n\r\nThe primary objectives of the proposed center are the following: to develop new algorithms, architectures and methodologies to realize a new operating system of systems paradigm in collaboration with RISE industry members, academe, and government, and to educate and innovate the new generation of engineers, professionals and educators who understand the interdisciplinary (system of systems) nature of the new electric energy industry, where a talent shortage is projected. The RISE concept brings about the integration of power systems, communication and information systems, computational systems, cyber systems, market designs and policy to address the challenge mentioned above. A unique real-time control center test-bed will be developed for the RISE team and industry members to pilot and perform investigations of new applications for smart electric grid operations. The RISE faculty expertise and several centers and laboratories at Clemson University and Georgia Institute of Technology strategically position the two institutions to develop leading-edge industry relevant research to provide the foundation for intelligent smart electric grid operations.",
