 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines how vegetation, particularly changes in agriculture, influence soil moisture and extreme temperatures in croplands. A preliminary study indicates that in the US Midwest, where crop production has increased significantly, there was an accompanying decline in the hottest temperatures at the height of the growing season. This suggests that increased potential for evaporation from plant leaves has led to cooling and improved conditions for agriculture.  With this in mind, this research examines if: 1) transitions to higher productivity crops increase the potential for water use, 2) historical cooling of the hottest growing season temperatures is indeed caused by agricultural changes in water use, and 3) current models adequately represent the relationship between soil moisture, temperature, and water use?  The first 2 questions will be addressed using soil water sensors, towers that measure atmospheric water flux, and satellite estimates of temperature and evaporation.  To see if the relationships between soil moisture, crop water use, and temperature identified in the Midwest can be generalized, global weather station data as well as crop area, productivity, and irrigation datasets from agricultural census reports will be analyzed. Question 3 will be addressed using models that relate temperature and evaporation and that include how this relationship changes with crop development.  Development of the relationships between crops, water use, and temperature will additionally help in reconstructing changes in water availability over the last century.  All told, this work will improve understanding of the availability and use of soil moisture in agricultural regions, as well as the relationships between soil moisture, extreme temperatures, and agriculture.\r\n \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this research is to explore whether changes to managed vegetation have significantly altered the hydrologic coupling between agricultural land surfaces and lower atmospheric boundary layers.  A preliminary analysis indicated large-scale changes in the distribution of temperature related to changes in agricultural intensity.  Specifically, the highest summer temperatures in US Midwest agricultural areas show significant cooling during the growing season that is proportional to increases in regional agricultural biomass production.  It is hypothesized that increased agricultural intensity causes increased potential evapotranspiration and, thereby, amelioration of the hottest growing season temperatures.  To test the hydrologic mechanisms that would underlie such connections between crop growth, evapotranspiration, and temperature, it is proposed to evaluate relationships between seasonal and historical crop development, water use, and evapotranspiration using in-situ soil moisture measurements, eddy flux measurements, and satellite observations.  New datasets on global crop areas, yield, and phenology will also be used to assess the generality of the diagnosed relationships between agricultural intensification, evapotranspiration, and temperature extremes.  Further, evapotranspiration models will be evaluated for accuracy in cropland environments, as will the ability to generalize inferences of cropland evapotranspiration and soil moisture using the coarse input data available in earlier periods.  This work will also permit testing several sub-hypotheses: (i) that higher yielding crops generally have higher evapotranspiration, (ii) that lack of summer warming in the Midwest is a result of crop intensification, and (iii) that drought reverts intensely cultivated ecosystems back toward historical temperature conditions. These lines of investigation have broad relevance for understanding changes in soil moisture and temperature extremes resulting from transitions toward more intensive agricultural management.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOver the course of the 20th century, US maize yields have improved by more than a factor of five. Whereas this trend is often attributed exclusively to technological improvements, we also identified contributions from improved temperatures during the growing season. More than one-quarter of the increase in crop yield since 1981 is estimated to result from trends toward overall warmer conditions, but with cooling of the hottest growing-season temperatures, and from adjustments in crop timing toward earlier planting and longer maturation varieties.  This result was published in PNAS in 2018.        \n\nThe fact that the warmest temperatures during the Midwestern growing season are cooling came as a surprise to us and was the initial focus of our work.    After examining numerous possibilities, we found that the strongest relationship was between indicators of trends toward greater potential for evapotranspiration coinciding with cooling of the hottest temperatures.  Although irrigation has a similar magnitude effect, its regional footprint is limited in the Midwest.  These results were published in Nature Climate Change in 2016.\n\nBuilding on our findings that increases in cropland productivity, or intensification, also influences climate through increasing evapotranspiration in the US Midwest, we explored the generalizability and importance of such relationships globally across seven regions containing a major temperate or subtropical cropping area.  We compared trends in summer high-temperature extremes against trends in cropland area, area equipped for irrigation, precipitation, and summer cropping intensity. Trends in temperature extremes were estimated using quantile regression of weather station observations, and land-use data were from agricultural inventories and remote sensing. Intensification is the best predictor of trends in extreme temperatures among the factors that are considered and is generally associated with trends that are 0.2&deg;&ndash;0.4&deg;C decade&minus;1 cooler than in adjacent regions. Neither cropland area nor precipitation trends are systematically associated with extreme temperature trends across regions, although high temperatures are suppressed over those portions of central North America and East Asia experiencing growth in irrigation. Both the temperature trends associated with intensification and increased irrigation can be understood as a consequence of increased latent cooling.  These results were published in the Journal of Climate in 2018.\n\nOur results demonstrate that the weather experienced by crops is not entirely external but also depends on agricultural practices.  The benefit of wide-spread increases in evapotranspiration has not previously been considered in evaluating yield trends, but our results suggest that it is critical to understand how regional climate is influenced by cropping practices themselves when evaluating the causes of past yield trends and their sustainability going forward.   The role of availability of soil moisture and changes in rainfall patterns should be further explored in the context of regional alteration of weather by agricultural practices.   These results appear to hold globally, suggesting that the climate change has had a more substantial influence on global yield trends than previously recognized, apparently toward improving yield, but that a reversal of such trends would then have larger implications than previously recognized for global food production.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/20/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter Huybers"
