 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project marries computational advances in \"single site\" catalysis with the demands of automotive catalysis to provide theory-driven aid to experimental design of low-temperature active and thermally stable next-generation automotive catalysts. This is an ambitious undertaking given the complex reaction environment of automotive catalysts and the broad range of conditions that they experience over their useful life. The proposed research will aid the implementation of high-efficiency low-temperature combustion systems by enabling the design of catalysts capable of meeting strict emission standards in a low-temperature exhaust environment, while also minimizing reliance on expensive noble metals. Development of automotive catalysts has historically relied on trial-and-error catalyst screening, with little theoretical underpinning. This proposal has the potential to develop a theory-aided approach to catalyst design, thereby opening up the design space while reducing the experimental burden. \r\n\r\nThe proposal lays groundwork for a comprehensive, predictive, and experimentally validated model of single site catalysis for low-temperature automotive emission oxidation of carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. It builds on recent advances in catalysis that speak to the ability to synthesize single site catalysts and demonstrate their advantages over supported metal clusters or particles in a number of reactions. The extension of these advances to automotive catalysis is not straight-forward, however. Automotive catalysis is more complicated than most catalytic applications because of the complex and dynamic changes in exhaust gas environment and broad operating temperature ranges under which the catalysts must function over a long life. The proposal will build on experimental progress in the synthesis of single site palladium-containing catalysts, as well as previous work demonstrating the effectiveness of lanthana for stabilizing noble metal particles. The dual thrust to predict single site catalyst properties needed for both low-temperature conversion efficiency and durability at high temperatures represents an ambitious extension of computational efforts over previous work.  The resulting methods and understanding should be generalizable to other systems. The investigator has also included in the proposal plans to integrate computational catalysis into an educational program for high school students aimed at illustrating the importance of fundamental chemistry for advances in alternative energy fields. Those programs will be conducted in collaboration with educational institutions and existing programs that aim to provide opportunities for minorities.",
