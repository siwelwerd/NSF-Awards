 "awd_abstract_narration": "This research deals with the interactions between number theory and\r\nrepresentation theory.  Number theory is the study of the properties\r\nof the whole numbers, and is the oldest branch of mathematics.\r\nRepresentation theory is the systematic study of symmetry, through the\r\ndevelopment of simple mathematical objects that encode the fundamental\r\nirreducible pieces of symmetry.  A principal aim of the proposal is to\r\nexplore relationships between these two subjects in the spirit of the\r\n\"Langlands philosophy,\" which predicts deep connections between number\r\ntheory and representation theory.  Today the questions and phenomena\r\naddressed by these subjects serve as driving forces in much of\r\ncontemporary mathematics research.  Moreover, the individual areas\r\nthemselves have contributed many applications in such diverse areas as\r\ncoding and data transmission, chemistry, physics, and theoretical\r\ncomputer science.\r\n\r\nThe problems that will be investigated in this project focus on\r\narithmetic groups and multiple Dirichlet series, objects that are\r\nintimately related to automorphic forms.  The first part addresses\r\ntopics related to cohomology of arithmetic groups and allied areas,\r\nsuch as the geometry of locally symmetric spaces and the conjectures\r\nlinking cohomology to arithmetic geometry and Galois representations.\r\nA central goal of this part is the computational investigation of\r\ntorsion in the cohomology of various arithmetic groups and its\r\nrelation to arithmetic.  The second part studies multiple Dirichlet\r\nseries attached to Weyl groups.  These are infinite series in several\r\ncomplex variables that satisfy a group of functional equations\r\nintermixing all the variables.  The topics in this part emphasize\r\nconnections between these series and combinatorics, representation\r\ntheory, automorphic forms, and mathematical physics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNumber theory is one of the oldest branches of mathematics.  The main objects of study are not just numbers and their properties, but also generalizations of numbers to more sophisticated systems (algebraic number fields and function fields) and structures built from them (Galois representations).  Moreover today it is believed (and in many cases proved) that there are deep and surprising connections between number theory and other parts of mathematics, including analysis, geometry, and topology.  This web of conjectures is known as the Langlands program, and it drives much of modern research.  As an example, the celebrated \"Fermat's Last Theorem\" --- well-known to many mathematical enthusiasts --- appears at first glance to be a rather arcane problem about finding solutions of a somewhat random equation in whole numbers.  Today, thanks to the ground-breaking work of Wiles building on the contributions of many others, we know that this result is intimately connected to deep geometric and analytic phenomena, and serves as a dramatic confirmation of some aspects of the Langlands program.  \n\nThis project focused on two distinct research areas in contemporary number theory: (1) the computational investigation of the cohomology of arithmetic groups, and (2) investigation of multiple Dirichlet series.  An additional component (3) addressed the investigation of matrix models, which play an important role in physics, combinatorics, and geometry.  \n\nIn area (1), the principal investigator (PI) developed algorithms and computer code to perform large scale computations that explored connections between geometry and number theory.  The principal outcomes included the following.  First the PI continued long-running projects with his collaborators Avner Ash, Mark McConnell, and Dan Yasaki on computational investigation of the cohomology of arithmetic groups in a variety of settings.  These include subgroups of SL_4(Z) and GL_r over certain number fields for r=2,3.  In joint work with Mathieu Dutour Sikiric, the PI developed a new algorithm to compute Hecke operators on cohomology for subgroups of Sp_4(Z).  The PI also developed algorithms in the function field case generalizing, in particular to compute Hecke operators for GL_r over the rational function field.  \n\nIn area (2), The PI investigated multiple Dirichlet series by studying the combinatorial and geometric meaning of their local factors.  The principal outcomes included the following.  In joint work with Friedlander-Gaudet and Mario Defranco, he investigated connections between local factors and crystal graphs.  With Chinta-Puskas he investigated connections between metaplectic Whittaker functions and the Demazure character formula With Defranco he investigated connections between the Casselmann-Shalika formula and algebraic geometry.  \n\nIn area (3), the PI investigated generalizations of matrix models.  Matrix models originally arose in physics as probability distributions on spaces of matrices with additional symmetries, and were used to model the nuclei of heavy atoms.  Such models have various applications today in mathematics, and in particular are related to enumeration of topological surfaces equipped with cell decompositions (\"orientable maps\").  The PI introduced new \"exotic\" models based on other algebraic structures and developed the so-called Feynman rules for their computation.  In joint work with Mario Defranco, the PI introduced a generalization of the classical Gaussian unitary ensemble called the hypergraph matrix model, which is related to enumeration of maps with ramification along their edges.  \n\nThe PI's results were disseminated through lectures at scientific meetings, publications in journals, and publications on online preprint servers.  In addition to the scientific results, the PI developed human resources during the project.  He supervised three postdocs, all of whom continue to work in academia as researchers and teachers.  He supervised the undergraduate research of three students, all of whom have gone on to excellent PhD programs in mathematics. Some questions arising in the PIs work were developed into research problems for high-school students through the PROMYS program at BU. The students working on these problems have gone onto to careers in the sciences, including some who have gone to graduate school in mathematics. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/06/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Paul E Gunnells"
