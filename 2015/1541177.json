 "awd_abstract_narration": "After a disruptive extreme event, such as an earthquake or severe storm, the socio-economic recovery of the affected region depends on the recovery of its infrastructure systems. Lifelines, such as power and water distribution systems, transportation networks, communication systems, and critical buildings have a primary role in disaster response, management, and long-term recovery. The failure to rapidly restore the services required for personal, social, and commercial activities leads to continued socio-economic losses and progressive depopulation. This collaborative project brings together scholars in Civil Engineering, Systems Engineering, Computer Science, Economics, Urban Planning, and Policy Making. Its purpose is to establish and demonstrate a comprehensive framework that combines models of individual infrastructure systems with models of their interdependencies for the assessment of interdependent infrastructure system resilience for extreme events under uncertainty. The \"PRAISys\" platform (Probabilistic Resilience Assessment of Interdependent Systems) will emphasize a probabilistic approach that permeates all aspects of the models, including the interdependencies. Some types of uncertainties that were not considered before (e.g., the possibility of using contingency plans that provide services without functioning infrastructure) will be classified; while mathematical and computational tools will be devised to capture their characteristics. PRAISys will enable better management and design of next generation infrastructure, more resilient to extreme events and to component failures under normal conditions. This will reduce the likelihood of extreme events becoming catastrophic in terms of casualties and injuries, long-lasting socio-economic losses, and environmental impact. The results of the research will be disseminated to the public in various forms: through series of seminars for professionals and administrators; by participating in Lehigh University's STAR academy program for disadvantaged middle and high school students; through scientific publications and presentation; and by curriculum development.\r\n\r\nThe development, calibration, and validation of PRAISys will enable research on stochastic interdependencies among infrastructure systems in the wake of an extreme event. This requires advancements in several disciplines. For instance, a new hybrid reliability model, which combines graph theory for network analysis and classic system reliability to model the probabilistic dependencies among infrastructures will be studied. The new concept of \"uncertain dependencies,\" which are rigorously modeled and include \"contingency plans\" will be introduced. Advancements in stochastic network optimization will be sought, to predict the optimal strategies and to inform the disaster management. Social network data will be used as an additional source of information on the recovery of a region, in real time, mining public posts. A comprehensive decision framework will combine the results of the simulation platform with expert opinions and surveys to identify the importance of various aspects of recovery. Finally, new techniques for the collection of large sets of data from utility companies, local government and other authorities will be studied.",

The project emphasized three aspects: (1) the quantification and propagation throughout the calculation of the large uncertainties that affect disasters, damage, decision, and recovery; (2) the role of dependencies, interdependencies and other types of relationships that make our critical infrastructure systems every day more interconnected and that can be both a resource and a weakness during the disaster recovery; and, (3) accurate modeling of the post-disaster decision making and recovery phase, which abundant evidence has shown to have impacts on our communities as important as the immediate consequences of the disaster. The scientific finding and methodological advancements to model these complex processes have been disseminated in scientific publications and collected in the PRAISys Computational Platform. For a given disaster scenario, the platform can predict (in a probabilistic sense) the damage, recovery, and resilience of interconnected infrastructure systems in a region. The platform can be used by decision makers in utility companies and local governments to identify critical&nbsp; components of their systems. It can also be used to simulate the impact of various retrofit actions, policy changes, resource allocations, population expansions, etc. The ability to predict the impact of all these changes pre-event allows decision makers to make informed and effective decisions, and allocate limited resources in the best possible way. While most of the studied concepts are general, in its current version the PRAISys Platform considers two types of natural hazards (earthquakes and hurricanes) and three infrastructure systems (transportation, power, communication), as well as the socio-economic background, which is treated as a fourth system. The PRAISys Platform has been tested with decision makers and it can be downloaded from the project website (www.praisys.org).&nbsp;<br />This interdisciplinary project involved 8 PIs (50% from underrepresented minority, URM, groups), 23 undergraduate students (39% URM), 11 master students (45% URM), 15 doctoral students&nbsp; (40% URM), as well as 2 postdocs (50% URM). These scholars spanned three universities, six departments, and multiple colleges, research centers, and institutes. One of the most relevant outcomes of the project was the creation of such a diverse community of scholars, all genuinely collaborating to address this multifaceted problem from different perspectives and make all the results converge into the PRAISys Computational Platform.As part of the activities of the project, the culture of accounting for disaster resilience, its large uncertainties, the importance of disaster response and long-term recovery, and the crucial role of interdependencies has been promoted to a broad set of audiences. Special educational sessions have been developed and offered to middle and high school students, modules have been incorporated in college-level courses, and a brand new course on this topic has been developed and offered at Lehigh.
