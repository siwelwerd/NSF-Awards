The conference is the tenth installment in a series of triennial conferences started in 1994. Locations alternate between North and South Americas. The project will support participation of junior American researchers who will be exposed to their international peers and to the stimulating atmosphere of the conference. Educational program of the Conference is integrated with research activities. It includes a series of mini-courses, half of which will be taught by the US women mathematicians. The Conference will further foster international collaboration between mathematicians of the Americas. The conference and related mini-courses cover a wide array of subjects from some of the most important applications of differential equations as well as some of the latest mathematical analysis techniques for their study. The type of questions to be discussed is instrumental for many applications, ranging from mathematical and statistical physics, fluid dynamics to engineering macro and micromechanics, mathematical finance, collective dynamics in social sciences, as well as biological and climate sciences.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the intellectual focus of the conference is to bring together a group of experts in different aspects of continuum and statistical models for gas dynamics and associated free boundary problems, as well as well as the associated dynamics, and stochastic noise effects, among others. Some of the leading world experts in applied partial differential equations, dynamical systems, financial mathematics, analysis and geometric analysis will serve as plenary speakers or mini-course lecturers. \r\n\r\nConference web site http://mate.dm.uba.ar/~xamericas/",

On Wednesday 18 a poster session with 29 posters took place. \n\nWe are attaching the book of abstracts as well as the final program. \n\nThere were 179 participants at the conference. This one being the largest conference in the Americas Series up to now. Approximately 150 of them participated with either a course, a lecture or a poster. \n\nWe are attaching the final list of participants sorted by country. \n\nMost of the School professor, plenary and invited speakers agreed to having their slides posted at the conference web site http://mate.dm.uba.ar/~xamericas. In this way we will be able to reach even more people that, altough interested in the conference subjects, were not able to participate. \n\nThe Organization received funds from CDC-IMU, ICTP, NSF and ANPCYT (Argentina) that were solely used to cover some travel and living expenses of young participants that attended both the School and the Conference, as well as the expenses of some of the School professors. \n\nLiving expenses ..."
