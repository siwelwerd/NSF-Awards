 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project focuses on increasing the understanding of how human-produced emissions combine with biogenic emissions from forests to influence the formation of small particles in the atmosphere.  A mobile laboratory will be deployed to two different types of forests (urban and remote) in order to compare and contrast the impact of long-range and short-range transport of nitrogen species to forests. The results will lead to improved control strategies that minimize the health, visibility and climate effects of anthropogenic emissions.\r\n\r\nThe primary objectives of the science campaign are to: (1) Characterize the ambient aerosol, radiation, and trace gases at two forest sites, both above and below the canopy, and along a north-south transect in the central United States; (2) Quantify the level of oxidation found in SOA using atomic ratios (such as the oxygen to carbon ratio, O:C) and determine the impact the presence of particulate organic nitrate (PON) has on the observed oxidation state of the submicron particulate matter (PM); (3) Investigate how in-canopy gradients and through-canopy transport impact submicron PM, PON, and oxidants; (4) Determine the impact nitrogen oxides (NOx) have on volatile organic carbon (VOC) oxidation and SOA formation in all locations; (5) Compare and contrast the chemistry of remote, on-road, and urban forested areas; (6) Identify the factors contributing to SOA using positive matrix factorization (PMF) to identify important components of SOA under different levels of anthropogenic influence both above and below canopy; and (7) Investigate the fate of NOx in all locations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn the summer of 2016, a collaborative project between the University of Houston and Rice University deployed a mobile air quality laboratory to examine the interaction of anthropogenic pollution and biogenic VOC emissions.  Two field sites were chosen, the PROPHET tower during July at the University of Michigan Biological Station in Pellston, MI, a relatively clean forest, and the W.G. Jones State Forest in August and September north of Houston, TX, a state research forest heavily impacted by the Houston urban plume and Ship Channel industrial emissions.  As part of this effort UH measured inorganic trace gases below the canopy in addition to meteorological parameters and photolysis rates above and below the canopy.  Through the exchange of staff and equipment UH partnered with Baylor University to measure anthropogenic and biogenic VOCs below canopy.  Rice University focused on measurements of NO3 and aerosol size and composition.\n\n In Michigan, an array of three jNO2 sensors were deployed at six different locations under varying canopy types, while jNO2 and actinic flux measurements were made near trace gas and aerosol sample inlet locations above and below canopy.  Below canopy diel average profiles of isoprene vary between below detection limit overnight to ~4.5 ppbv in the afternoons.  On July 23, an event occurred resulting in isoprene measurements in excess of 20 ppbv in the early evening.  Below canopy diel average profiles of O3 ranged from 17 ppbv in the mornings to 31 ppbv in the afternoons.  Afternoon maximums greater than 60 ppbv were observed occasionally.  On one occasion a plume over 65 ppbv was observed near sunrise that was associated with a southerly wind.  Below canopy diel profiles of NOX  showed ~1 ppbv shortly after sunrise to 0.3 ppbv in the afternoons, with occasional peaks over 2 ppbv.\n\n Measurements in Jones Forest were characterized by persistently cloudy and rainy conditions.  While the Michigan site was in a heavily forested area, the measurement site at Jones Forest is in a clearing at the base of a radio tower.  This open area provided an excellent opportunity to collocate all of the actinic flux and jNO2 sensors.  After the intercomparison the array of three jNO2 sensors were deployed in several locations of varying canopy thickness in the surrounding forest.  Average diel profiles of O3 and NOX showed larger variability relative to the UMBS location.  O3 ranged from 7 ppbv in the early mornings to ~33 ppbv in the afternoons, however O3 was often titrated to zero during the overnight periods with maximum values approaching 70 ppbv in the mid-afternoon.  NOX profiles rarely approached the instrument detection limit, ranging between 1.6 ppbv in the afternoon to 12-13 ppbv during the morning rush hour.  Peaks of NOX during the morning rush hour occasionally exceeded 60 ppbv.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/10/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James Flynn"
