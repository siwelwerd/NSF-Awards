 "awd_abstract_narration": "This action funds an NSF Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in Biology for FY 2016, Research Using Biological Collections. The fellowship supports a research and training plan for the Fellow to take transformative approaches to grand challenges in biology that employ biological collections in highly innovative ways.  The title of the research plan for this fellowship to Matthew Nielsen is \"Evolution of seasonal color plasticity in response to climate change in orange sulphur butterflies.\" The host institution for this fellowship is the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Joel Kingsolver.  \r\n\r\nThe goal of this research is to investigate how climate change affects adaptive phenotypic plasticity, the ability of an organism to change its traits to better fit its environment. Adaptive plasticity relies on the ability of an organism to use cues to predict the future environment. Climate change can disrupt this relationship so that formerly functional cues no longer reliably predict the environment an organism will experience. The Fellow is investigating this in the orange sulphur butterfly (Colias eurytheme), which as a caterpillar uses seasonal changes in photoperiod to determine whether to produce a warm or cool season form as an adult. Because climate change alters temperatures, but not photoperiod, it has likely disrupted the ability for this butterfly (as well as other organisms) to predict the environment it will experience; however, evolutionary change could 'correct' this mismatch by altering the photoperiods when the two morphs are produced. The Fellow is examining this evolutionary process by examining changes in the time of year when each form is found across the last 60 years using specimens from natural history collections across different parts of the US, including the Smithsonian, the California Academy of Sciences, the Field Museum, the Milwaukee Public Museum, the McGuire Collection at University of Florida-Gainesville, and Yale's Peabody Museum. The Fellow's research promotes understanding of how phenotypic plasticity evolves when the relationship between a cue and the environment it predicts changes. Further, it provides an important insight into the limitations of thermoregulatory plasticity in responding to climate change and whether evolution can overcome those limitations. \r\n\r\nThe Fellow is receiving advanced training in a variety of topics, including hands-on work with collections, spatially explicit statistics, and biophysical modeling. This project is allowing the Fellow to establish lasting collaborations with other biologists using collections. The Fellow is training undergraduates in topics such as experimental design, collection use, and data analysis, and involving the broader public through a citizen science component using online tools to help collect observations and survey the contemporary timing of the orange sulphur?s seasonal morphs. To further connect to the public, the Fellow is sharing his research resultsat multiple local science festivals, focusing on how it fits into the broader picture of climate change.",

This can lead to mismatches where animals make the wrong response to their new climate unless evolution changes how they respond to daylength. I have tested for this change in orange sulphur butterflies (Colias eurytheme), which change color seasonally to help them stay warmer in spring and fall, but cooler in summer (see images). They use daylength, not temperature to determine their color, and thus should be subject to this mismatch. Testing whether evolution has corrected for this mismatch in orange sulphurs will help us better understand how other animals and plants using daylength as a seasonal cue will deal with environmental change.</p>\n<p><br />In this research, I have photographed thousands of orange sulphur specimens from museums across the US, focusing on California where most of the historical work on this species was done. In addition to addressing my main hypothesis, this database will be valuable in the future for testing other hypotheses about color patterns and the range of this species. I also raised orange sulphurs under different daylengths in the lab to directly test the influence of daylength and temperature. Overall, I have found that the response to daylength remains strong, but has changed relatively little from the 1960s to 1990s. Unfortunately, reduced museum collection over the last two decades made testing for recent changes very difficult. Future research focusing on improved sampling of contemporary butterflies may reveal more recent color pattern changes that this study missed due to the near absence of recent specimens in museums. What change has occurred may be limited to specific times of year (particularly early spring and fall), and it appears that summer abundance may be declining in some areas.</p>\n<p><br />These results demonstrate the importance of maintaining natural history collections and continuing to contribute to them, even for common species like the orange sulphur. Warmer temperatures appear to have caused little change in the seasonal response of orange sulphurs, at least through the late 20th century. Alongside reduction in availability of host plants (most notably alfalfa), this may contribute to considerable reductions in their overall abundance in southern parts of the their range.</p>\n<p><br />As part of this process, I have trained multiple undergraduate students in scientific image analysis and working with live insects.
