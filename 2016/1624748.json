 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Center for Advanced Non-Ferrous Structural Alloys (CANFSA) at Iowa State University (ISU) consists of students, post-docs and faculty who work with their CANFSA counterparts at the Colorado School of Mines (Mines) to engage scientists and engineers from both industry and government laboratories to discover fundamental understandings of the physical and mechanical metallurgy of non-ferrous alloys (i.e., alloying and processing effects on microstructure, properties and performance). The motivation for CANFSA is to address the national decline in the training of students in this area that is critical to U.S. dominance in high performance materials, structures and advanced manufacturing. Today, there are only a few universities remaining who train students in these core science and engineering areas that are so critical to our industries, especially as National investments are made in new advanced materials and manufacturing strategies. In fact, these declines have greatly reduced&#8232; the synergies that existed previously between faculty, students, and the relevant industries, and this, in turn, has significantly weakened the technical dominance of US industries that rely heavily&#8232; on these materials. CANFSA was organized to counter this trend by conducting fundamental scientific studies on these advanced materials and their manufacturing, thereby filling this workforce development gap and simultaneously contributing to U.S. global industrial competitiveness.\r\n\r\nThe objective of CANFSA is to conduct basic and applied physical metallurgy &#8232;research of direct relevance to the industries that develop, manufacture and use advanced &#8232;non-ferrous structural alloys, and to train students in these important subjects. This is accomplished by engaging students in topics of importance to industry and government labs, and to have both faculty members and external mentors guide the students' fundamental research. The specific details of the projects that are conducted within the Center vary as topics are selected that have the most direct relevance for the partners from industry and the national laboratories. To date, the Center has conducted leading research in the areas of:  thermal and mechanical processing of non-ferrous alloys (e.g., 3rd Generation Al-Li alloys, texture anisotropy of Ti-6Al-4V); ultrafine grained alloys and their mechanical behavior (e.g., Ti and Mg); aging of high-strength beta-Ti alloys; processing of microeutectic Al alloys; microstructural evolution (e.g., Ni-Ti-Hf intermetallics, Ni-based superalloys, high entropy alloys); multi-layer coatings; lube-free die casting; and the role of trace elements and small microstructural variations on mechanical properties. To conduct these varied research projects and accomplish the goals of the Center, faculty members with complementary &#8232;expertise in the areas of theory, modeling, processing and characterization are working together with members from industry and government laboratories. Iowa State University has a variety of processing, characterization, and computational tools available on which to conduct the Center?s research. This includes state-of-the-art electron microscopy and atom probe capabilities in a newly established Sensitive Instrumentation Facility and elsewhere across ISU's campus. In addition, researchers have access to a variety of advanced processing equipment and computational tools that span across a wide range of methods, including: atomistic simulation techniques; discrete dislocation dynamics; phase field simulation; cellular automata; finite element methods and FFT-based simulation approaches. Computations can be made ranging from fundamental physical processes to macroscale fluid and heat transfer. This expertise at ISU is complementary to that at CSM, and collectively, CANFSA is able to offer a suite of unique capabilities to its membership.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Center for Advanced Non-Ferrous Structural Alloys (CANFSA) has conducted research to solve problems related to physical metallurgy of advanced metallic alloys, including specifically titanium based alloys, nickel-based superalloys, aluminum alloys, magnesium alloys, high entropy alloys, and other existing and emerging advanced materials.  During the conduction of research, the problems identified and addressed are common problems that industrial partners face.  Consequently, consortium members often act as technical mentors for student researchers and postdoctoral fellows who are conducting the research.  Consequently, students are trained in not only the fundamentals and basic science skills required to address technically challenging problems, but also trained in industrially relevant skills associated with project management and communication to larger audiences.\n\nThe Center has two sites, the lead site (Colorado School of Mines) and the second site (Iowa State University).  During Phase II, faculty from both sites have collaborated on not only member-directed research, but have also collaborated on other projects, further leveraging the investment made by NSF and the member companies.  The students have made use of faculty and research facilities at both institutions, and regularly (at least twice a year) engage in technical meetings where the research on both directly funded and leveraged projects are presented.  The facilities that are used by the students include state-of-the-art electron microscopy facilities, world-class materials processing facilities, and testing facilities that rival capabilities found in national laboratories.  When facilities aren?t available through the universities, many CANFSA students have leveraged facilities available at the members facilities, or other National Laboratory facilities.  In short, the Center has, as proposed, applied the model of I/UCRC to meet the needs faced by industry and the Nation regarding maintaining and advancing the state of the art relative to advanced, non-ferrous structural alloys, specifically focusing on fundamental research and workforce development.\n\nRegarding intellectual merit and broader impact, while the portfolio of the center is rather expansive, a few examples of both intellectual merit and broader impact are provided.  Intellectual merit: During Phase II, significant advancements were made with respect to materials processing and materials characterization.  Regarding processing, students developed techniques to induce and hold thermal gradients across samples.  This effort required the integration of computational modeling and simulation with materials processing systems, and has led to new insights on foundational data gaps.  Regarding characterization, a new type of acoustic microscope was identified and built, and other existing techniques provided new insights into the effects of texture on properties in linear friction welded titanium. Broader impact: Students from both CSM and ISU have taken jobs with member companies following graduation, providing a direct example of workforce development, and a direct benefit to the member companies.  The new science that has been discovered in the Center has catalyzed new research activities in both the universities and member companies.  Member companies also report economic benefits from their membership in the Center, including not only new product development, but also in expenditure avoidance.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter C Collins"
