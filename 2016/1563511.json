 "awd_abstract_narration": "A new conceptualization for planning and delivering Architecture-Engineering-Construction (AEC) projects is needed because today's approaches all too often fail: projects are late, over budget, and accident prone. This unduly burdens public and private facility owners, other stakeholders, and society at large. Failure stems from the inadequacy of the planning methods being used, especially those that focus disproportionately on maximizing resource utilization while ignoring network effects and the systemic impacts of variability. This research counterposes a method based on Takt time. Takt refers to the beat with which work progresses; it is being used successfully in repetitive manufacturing (e.g., Lean Production). The use of Takt time in AEC project production is novel. The method has been piloted and is promising, but must be formally studied. This award supports fundamental research that involves designing, analyzing, and testing principles, methods, and computational optimization tools for Takt time planning (TTP). The objective of this method is to optimize project delivery speed within total cost limits, and to provide a mechanism for continuous improvement. Investigation of the potential uses of the TTP method to improve project delivery performance will advance the theory of project production. Use of the new planning model, once formulated, understood, and documented, will increase the reliability with which projects get delivered, to the benefit of all stakeholders. Students underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics will be engaged in conducting this research. Research findings will be integrated into engineering curricula and disseminated to industry to promote the use of more systemic methods for planning and delivering facilities.\r\n\r\nExisting planning models focus on maximizing resource utilization (point speed) and buffer for uncertainty using time (schedule buffers), which comes at the expense of throughput. This research flips the paradigm used in existing planning methods to one that focuses on overall project delivery performance and buffers with capacity. Planning using capacity means judiciously under-loading production resources, such as labor and equipment, to less than 100% utilization, so that they will have stand-by capacity to readily mitigate negative impacts of variation, thereby avoiding system-wide repercussions. Accordingly, a novel method for project planning will be designed and developed, based on the concept of Takt time. Computer algorithms will be created to automate the determination of zones and corresponding Takt times, suited to characteristics of various phases of project delivery. Their optimality and robustness will be established using Building Information Modeling (BIM) and discrete-event simulation. In parallel with the virtual study of TTP, the method will be deployed on actual projects so as to reveal socio-technical system characteristics that must be addressed for its successful deployment. Learning from actual projects will in turn inform further refinement of algorithms.",

Knowledge and insights gained from the literature was combined with direct observation of construction planning practices and action research involving industry collaborators. This was followed by formulating a new planning method for so-called takt planning, developing mathematical models, and verifying, validating, and testing them. Key outcomes of this NSF-supported research are listed next.</p>\n<p>The PI and her team invented and developed the Work Density Method for takt planning (Fig. 1). This new method is based on the concept \"work density\" that describes how much time a (construction) trade worker or crew will require to do their work in a certain work area, based on production system parameters (throttles) such as trade scope, means and methods, worker capabilities, and crew size (Figs. 2 and 3). Work density is a metric that concerns all trades. It is an expression pertaining to workload and characterizes at what speed a trade's work is expected to progress through space. It is akin to cycle time (a term commonly used in manufacturing) but the novelty is that work density augments that concept by explicit referencing where work takes place with space modeled in two dimensions; in contrast, assembly-line systems in manufacturing are one-dimensional in nature and are therefore easier to model and balance. The Work Density Method provides a means to throttle project delivery speed and to establish the process stability that is needed to allow for continuous improvement. Development of the Work Density Method is a significant advance in the theory of project production. The method is applicable to project planning in the Architecture Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry but also in other industries.</p>\n<p>One part of the Work Density Method is the workload leveling and zoning problem. To the best of our knowledge, this was a problem not yet presented nor addressed in the optimization literature. Using mathematical modeling, the team formulated that problem, developed the WoLZo algorithm to solve it, and then implemented it in a computer program to run example data sets (Fig. 4). The team also developed a user interface (ViWoLZo) to allow for visual management, either to manually perform workload leveling and zoning or to adjust the algorithm results as needed to meet additional project requirements (Fig. 5). Separately, the PI and collaborators also developed Genetic Algorithms (GAWoLZo) in order to study the efficiency frontier of this problem in light of multi-objective tradeoffs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Takt planning makes use of capacity buffers as a means to achieve plan reliability. By developing discrete-event simulation models and gauging performance using novel metrics (e.g., availability of standby capacity) deeper understanding was gained of the value of using capacity buffers in planning in lieu of the more common time- and inventory buffers. This work shed additional new light on objectives to meet while developing project production plans.</p>\n<p>As for broader impacts of this research, student researchers were directly involved in first-hand data collection on live construction projects and modeling. They contributed to scrutinizing the new way of thinking about project production planning and value of the Work Density Method. These students are now continuing their PhD studies on the topic of takt planning or transferring this new knowledge to practice as they enter the industry as professionals.</p>\n<p>To expedite dissemination of research findings to industry, the research team hosted several workshops to educate and train professionals in the use and value of takt planning with the Work Density Method. In turn, workshop participants offered valuable feedback on the research which helped to sharpen its theoretical basis.</p>\n<p>The concept of work density and the use of takt planning are particularly relevant in the near- and longer-term future of the AEC industry because a transition is taking place towards more automated fabrication off-site and use of robots on-site. The location of production, the parties involved (in part driven by shortages of skilled workers), product- and process complexity, and time demands are rapidly changing.&nbsp;The availability of formal means to describe and rebalance workloads in project production systems off-site and on-site, including those developed in this research, will enhance the speed and reliability of delivery of those systems. We envision that in the short- to medium-term future, the paradigm shift supported by the fundamental theoretical understanding of takt planning and methods such as the Work Density Method will have a significant social and economic impact on education and practice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/08/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Iris&nbsp;D&nbsp;Tommelein</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1563511/1563511_10439133_1636311793889_Tommelein2021-11-07FlowchartStepsWorkDensityMethodWDMv3.01057M--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1563511/1563511_10439133_1636311793889_Tommelein2021-11-07FlowchartStepsWorkDensityMethodWDMv3.01057M--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1563511/1563511_10439133_1636311793889_Tommelein2021-11-07FlowchartStepsWorkDensityMethodWDMv3.01057M--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1 - Process for takt planning with workload leveling and zoning v 3.0</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Iris D.
