The behavioral responses of cells to three-dimensional (3D) micromechanical environments are of special interest in recent years because the environments of cells in vivo are 3D in nature. 3D micromechanical environments are much more challenging to design, fabricate, characterize, and apply for fruitful cell studies and applications compared with the corresponding two-dimensional (2D) ones. The curvature of a 3D substrate on which a cell will be growing is one of the major geometrical parameters of this substrate, and therefore, creating curvature-defined 3D cell culture substrates is crucial for 3D cell mechanobiology and bioengineering. This team has invented a first-ever unique and powerful class of 3D curvature-defined cell culture substrates - micro glass ball embedded gels.
