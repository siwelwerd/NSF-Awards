The University of Rochester and Syracuse University will each host one conference (Rochester: NAN 2016; Syracuse: NAN 2017). Each conference will primarily feature talks by senior post-docs and finishing graduate students who are about to enter the job market. A magnet lectures by a leading researcher, the \"Excelsior Lecture\" (named after the motto of the state of New York) will serve as a catalyst for each conference. The Excelsior Lecturers are Jill Pipher (NAN 2017) and Svitlana Mayboroda (NAN 2017).",
