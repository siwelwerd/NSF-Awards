 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded from the Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Sites program in the SBE Directorate. As such, it has both scientific and societal benefits, and it integrates research and education. This REU site is a joint effort between Syracuse University, SUNY Oswego, and SUNY Upstate Medical University and constitutes a well-structured program for a cohort of 8 students each year. The objective is to train veterans and non-veterans to conduct trauma-related research with veteran participants. The site offers an online 2-week orientation as well as research mentoring and coursework during a 4-week summer institute by highly qualified and productive faculty members that have a track record of involving undergraduates in their research. In addition to these faculty mentors, several consultants from various military and non-military backgrounds provide a novel combination of perspectives to address multidisciplinary research questions as part of a speaker series. The program draws on resources including seminar rooms, laboratories, and housing through Syracuse University, SUNY Upstate Medical Center, and SUNY Oswego. With respect to impact on program participants, we expect to increase students' ability to conduct trauma research and increase their chances of admission into graduate school. With respect to scientific merit, multiple projects involve students and address important research questions.\r\n\r\nCurrent interests include research designed to gain a better understanding of the chemical, clinical, cognitive, and family factors associated with various trauma outcomes. Being able to better predict the development of PTSD following trauma can support efforts at prevention and treatment of PTSD. Moreover, our society would benefit from a better understanding of PTSD since the lifetime prevalence of PTSD among adult Americans is relatively high, estimated at 6.8%. This REU site broadens the participation of under-represented groups by recruiting veterans (particularly minorities and women, when possible) as participants. The PIs also provide an opportunity for veterans to re-integrate to an undergraduate research culture in a safe environment with appropriate supports. Moreover, this veteran participation in the design and implementation of trauma-related research with fellow veterans constitutes a novel application of \"participatory research\". Beyond the direct benefit to veteran participants, non-veteran participants can learn to appreciate the value of veteran participation in trauma-related research, particularly when that research involves a veteran population.",
