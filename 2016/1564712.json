 "awd_abstract_narration": "This NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project will increase the number of students, who major in STEM disciplines at Albany State University and go on to successfully pursue STEM post-graduate education or research careers.  During the project, 18 scholars will (a) develop and follow a four-year academic and professional plan that will include freshman learning community courses, workshops, service learning, and field trips or visitations under the guidance of a Student Success Coach, (b) participate in at least one undergraduate research experience, and (c) attend and present an undergraduate research project at an on-campus or regional conference. After graduation these talented scholars are expected to join the STEM workforce or go on to graduate school in STEM, enabling the US to compete and innovate in a global economy. \r\n\r\nThe theory of action for this project is that psychosocial factors such as STEM identity and self-efficacy are particularly critical to retaining STEM students.  Thus, the project elements are designed to help students to develop these factors through a strong cohort anchored around a freshman learning community, targeted and intrusive advising, mentoring by faculty and peers, and participation in undergraduate research and internships.  Evaluation will address the project's success in achieving its retention, course pass rate, and graduation objectives.   Data analysis of student academic performance and participation in program activities will be used to study the effects of interventions like the learning community and intrusive advising on self-efficacy and science identity for students at a Historically Black University.  The research results will be disseminated at the University System of GA Teaching and Learning Conference and the Understanding Interventions that Broaden Participation in STEM Careers conference.  Manuscripts will be submitted to the Journal of Higher Education and the Journal of College Science Teaching.",

These included sessions on success strategies, navigating institutional barriers, opportunities for integration into the university community, STEM careers, summer internships, and graduate school selection and application.
