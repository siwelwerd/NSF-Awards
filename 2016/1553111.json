 "awd_abstract_narration": "There is a well-established pattern of biodiversity on Earth, with highest biodiversity found in the tropics and a decrease in biodiversity with increasing latitude towards the poles.  Ecologists have suggested that the reason for this pattern is that higher levels of food resources for life are found in the tropics.  This project will perform a direct test of that hypothesis by making measurements of biodiversity and food resource levels in streams across a broad latitudinal gradient. In each of eight study regions, fishes and invertebrates will be intensively sampled. The data will be used by the researcher to develop mathematical models of the relationships between the average size of individuals and the abundance of those individuals within a community as a means of testing the idea about biodiversity and resources. This project will also focus on engaging underrepresented minorities in freshwater research. In each of four years, a group of three minority undergraduates will be trained to conduct stream surveys, to analyze original data, and to present results at the annual meeting of the Society for Freshwater Science, for a total of 12 undergraduates mentored throughout the project. One Ph.D. student identified as an underrepresented minority student also will be trained to compete for leadership-level positions in environmental research or management.\r\n\r\nAn empirical test of species-energy theory within stream ecosystems will be conducted in three steps. In Step-1, size-spectra (scaling relationships between average individual body mass and population abundance) will be quantified in each of the eight study regions and used to model the distribution of abundance among primary, secondary, and tertiary consumers. Nitrogen stable isotope samples and published feeding behaviors will also be used to assess whether trophic position is a consistent function of body size. Systematic, among-site comparisons of size-spectra models will then test whether the scaling of abundance with individual body mass and trophic position is constant among tropical and temperate streams. In Step-2, species-abundance distributions will be compiled for each study stream then compared among streams to assess whether species richness increases more rapidly, relative to a constant number of individuals, in tropical streams. In Step-3, supplementary fish and invertebrate data from National Ecological Observatory Network streams will be used to test for seasonal or inter-annual differences in the size-spectra and species-abundance distribution models.",

Using a combination of original field data and stream samples from the National Ecological Observatory Network, this project modeled the size spectrum, an inverse scaling relationship between body size and abundance, for fishes and invertebrates in streams throughout the conterminous United States. Strong central tendencies in the size spectra model parameters were confirmed, suggesting that similar processes regulate size structure and abundance across diverse lotic ecosystems. Two novel discoveries were also made. First, consistently shallow size spectra slopes suggest that densities of the largest individuals, relative to densities of small individuals, are ~1 order of magnitude higher than predicted by ecological theory. Second, tests of curvature or secondary structure in the size spectrum suggest the exceptional abundance of large individuals may be due to pervasive intraguild predation. To encourage further exploration and testing, standard methods and software to perform size spectra analysis were developed and published.</p>\n<p><em>Macroscale links between human and environmental health</em>. Epidemiology and toxicology research have confirmed the health effects of specific perturbations and pollutants, but a broad understanding of direct and indirect connections between human health and the environment is only now being developed. The project-funded PhD student (Felisha Walls) led an effort to build a novel framework for identifying links between human health and a mixed suite of socioeconomic and environmental variables. Random forest models indicated that socioeconomic variables, including smoking, food insecurity, and level of physical activity, are the strongest individual predictors of human mortality, but air temperature and precipitation also have significant influences. Path analysis was then used to identify direct and indirect links between environmental, socioeconomic and health variables, leading to three key inferences: (i) geology and climate set boundary conditions for all other variables; (ii) hydrology and land cover have predictable but distinct effects on human and ecosystem health; and (iii) forest cover serves as a key link between environmental variables and the socioeconomic variables that directly influence human health.</p>\n<p><em>High prevalence of positive size versus trophic position relationships for stream vertebrates</em>. Stable isotope data were used to test the hypothesis that trophic position is a predictable function of body size for vertebrates (fishes and amphibians) in temperate streams. Results confirmed that many species exhibit significant, positive size vs. trophic position relationships when individual-level data (a range of small-to-large individuals of each species) are used, rather than species-level averages (one average mass and trophic position estimate per species). Species exhibiting positive size vs. trophic position relationships also comprised the majority of standing stock biomass in each of the study streams, reinforcing the central role of positive size vs. trophic position relationships in predator-prey, food web, and ecosystem research.</p>\n<p><em>Broader Impacts: Making the freshwater sciences more diverse and inclusive.</em> This project included a focused effort to increase diversity in the freshwater sciences. Six undergraduate students, each of whom was an underrepresented minority, were mentored through a 3-week fieldwork excursion, followed by a year-long research project and conference presentation. In summer 2017, three students traveled with the PI and an underrepresented graduate assistant from northern Virginia to central Alabama, collecting stream fish and macroinvertebrate samples along the way. Through the following academic year, each student assisted in processing the field samples and used some of the data to conduct an original research project. Results were presented at the 2018 Annual Meeting of the Society for Freshwater Science in Detroit. In summer 2018, the process was repeated with three new students, sampling a series of west coast streams between North Cascades National Park and Lake Tahoe. Independent projects were presented at the 2019 Society for Freshwater Science meeting in Salt Lake City. Of the six undergraduate participants, three have completed a MS degree in environmental science, one entered a PhD program, one works for a river conservation organization, and one is now working in forensic science. Training and mentoring of underrepresented minorities also included two graduate students: one MS student (currently employed by the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality) and one PhD student (currently interviewing for post-doctoral positions). A video recap of the student training process is available at https://vimeo.com/787781369. Notably, the mentoring process developed in this CAREER project evolved into a much larger effort to recruit, train, and retain underrepresented minorities in freshwater science: the NSF-funded EMERGE program (DEB-2032146; www.sfsemerge.org).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/13/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Daniel&nbsp;J&nbsp;Mcgarvey</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1553111/1553111_10422365_1673623427964_McGarvey_CAREER_Image6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1553111/1553111_10422365_1673623427964_McGarvey_CAREER_Image6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Diversity emerging in freshwater science\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1553111/1553111_10422365_1673623427964_McGarvey_CAREER_Image6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Diversity emerging in freshwater science\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Summer 2018 team collecting benthic invertebrate samples on Lookout Creek, OR.
