The researcher will use both archival and ethnographic research methods in carrying out the analysis.\r\n\r\nThe results of this research will be of interest not only to scientists interested in the relatively recent history of HIV/AIDS, but also political scientists, sociologists, organizational theory experts, and a wide-range of health policy experts. The results of the study will have substantial potential to impact science policy by providing insights for improving the design of future research infrastructure investments.",
