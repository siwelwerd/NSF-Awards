 "awd_abstract_narration": "The stars in the outermost regions of galaxies preserve a fossil record of the birth of stars and dynamics of that galaxy over its lifetime. These stellar halos extend far beyond the crowded inner regions of galaxies, where the majority of the stars reside in disks or dense spheres.  Stellar halos are thought to be made of stars that formed very early on, in the galaxy's newly formed disk, as well as stars that were originally part of smaller, dwarf, galaxies that fell into the large galaxy and were torn apart.  The investigators will study the physical properties of the stars in the Andromeda galaxy's stellar halo, and will determine the relative importance of these two different ways of contributing stars to a galaxy's halo.  Their goal is understanding of how massive galaxies grow.  They will deduce the properties of destroyed \"dwarf\" galaxies and their rate of forming new stars.  This will give insight into the properties of dwarf galaxies that did not survive until the present day. This program will train young astronomers and introduce high school students to astronomical research.\r\n\r\nThe Andromeda galaxy is the nearest large galaxy to our own. It is similar in many ways to our Milky Way galaxy, but shows evidence that it has merged with more small galaxies than the Milky Way.  The investigators, along with students, will use an archive of Keck telescope spectra from previous observations of tens of thousands of stars, and will also perform new spectroscopic observations.  They will use the spectra to measure the abundances of atomic elements and track the properties of the chemical environment in which the stars formed.  The investigators will perform the first large-scale chemical abundance study of Andromeda's stellar halo.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will recruit students to engage in summer research related to this program.  They will focus their recruitment at schools that have a large fraction of students from demographic groups that are under-represented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  Completing a cutting-edge astronomical research project will both introduce these students to working in a STEM field and give them confidence that they can succeed in a STEM career.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is the nearest large, spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.  It is useful for studying galaxy formation because it is near enough to observe individual stars in great detail, yet it is far enough that the entire galaxy occupies a limited region of the sky.  In contrast, a detailed study of the Milky Way requires that we observe stars over the entire sky.\n\nWe observed 256 stars in the dwarf galaxies that orbit Andromeda and an additional 92 stars in the outskirts of Andromeda.  We obtained data with the DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph on the Keck 2 telescope.  We observed the stars for 5 hours each, compared with previously typical observation times of 1 hour.  The long observations led to high-quality spectra from which we measured the compositions of the stars.  Specifically, we developed techniques to measure the amounts of iron and lighter elements, like magnesium, in the atmospheres of the stars.\n\nThe ratio of the light elements (called &alpha; elements) to iron (Fe) reflects the vigor of star formation.  The stars in the different components of Andromeda showed varying ratios of &alpha;/Fe, which implies that the different components were more or less efficient at forming stars.  The stars in the dwarf galaxies have low &alpha;/Fe, which indicates that they formed stars slowly and inefficiently over a long time.  In contrast, the stars in the outskirts of Andromeda itself have high &alpha;/Fe ratios, which indicates that they formed stars quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe differing efficiencies of star formation reflect what we observe in the Milky Way.  Galaxy simulations in the last decade predicted that the dwarf galaxies would be less efficient at forming stars than the galaxies that were dissolved long ago to form the outskirts of the Milky Way and Andromeda.  Our observations of the &alpha;/Fe ratios confirm this prediction.  Although this trend has been known for almost 20 years in the Milky Way, our corroboration of the trend using Andromeda is an important verification of the leading theory of galaxy formation.  Therefore, this study concludes that the Milky Way is not an anomaly, as has been suggested in some studies.  Instead, both of the large galaxies in the Local Group of galaxies formed in the same order: The large, efficient star forming systems dissolved long ago to make up the outskirts of the Milky Way and Andromeda, whereas the smaller, less efficient systems are still intact and orbiting their host galaxies today.\n\nThis project included young researchers at two different phases of their education.  First, we recruited high school students from Pasadena-area high schools.  We targeted high schools that reflect the demographics of the greater Pasadena, California, area.  We recruited primarily from Pasadena High School, whose students are over 80% Hispanic or non-white, and where 60% of the students participate in free or reduced-cost lunch programs.  Second, we recruited students from Caltech's Freshman Summer Research Initiative (FSRI).  This pre-college program welcomes students under-represented for their race, ethnicity, gender identity, or sexual orientation.  The students conduct research over the first summer before their freshman year.  Our research group included five high school students and three FSRI students during this three-year grant.\n\nThese students conducted original research.  More to the point, they were asking questions whose answers were not known by anyone.  Thus, they experienced both the frustrations and triumphs of professional research.  The students reported overwhelmingly positive experiences.  All of them reported a desire to continue studying STEM fields in college.  Past participants in this program have gone to college at top universities, including the University of California, at a rate higher than their peers who did not participate in this program.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/29/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Evan N Kirby"
