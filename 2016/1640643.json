 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI: AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a new highly reliable lead-free nanocomposite solder paste (\"NanoPaste\") to fill the need for the currently exempted electronic sectors such as defense, medical, and aerospace. The NanoPaste is important because it would give these industries access to a more environmentally friendly product that would not depend on leaded components and manufacturing facilities.  These industries are currently exempt from international regulations banning the use of lead-based solders and components because of the lack of proven reliability of current lead-free materials. In addition, access to leaded components and manufacturing facilities is becoming increasingly difficult, making for an uncertain future of reliable supplies of materials.  This technology could also benefit other electronic sectors that require high reliability, such as power electronics and communications. \r\n\r\nA prototype of the new nanocomposite solder paste will be developed under this project that is suitable for commercial evaluation and production testing. The NanoPaste has two unique features: homogeneous elements and compositions, and lower processing temperature during manufacturing. These features provide significant advantages, including reduced thermal stress on the printed circuit board (PCB) and enhanced reliability of solder joints, as compared to the leading competing lead-based solders in these market segments.\r\n\r\nThe following tasks will be performed in this project in order to develop a homogeneous NanoPaste to translate to commercial application: (1) scale-up synthesis and formulation, (2) prototyping multi-component test vehicles with NanoPaste through board design, stencil printing, and solder reflow, and (3) full commercial characterization by performing industry-standard electrical and mechanical tests (shear and pull tests) and reliability tests (thermal cycling, corrosion, vibration and drop tests). In addition, personnel involved in this project, including undergraduates, graduates, and post-docs, will receive innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology translation experiences through experimentation and analysis, industrial site visits, custom interviews, and business development.\r\n\r\nThe project engages AIM Solder, Benchmark Electronics, and other New England Lead-free Electronics Consortium associated members (such as Raytheon, Philips Healthcare, Teradyne and EMC) to augment research capability, provide test environment, and guide commercialization aspects in this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial realization.",

The structural and thermal properties of the nanosolders and NanoPaste, and some significant issues with nanosolders such as surface oxidation, have been probed and investigated by using several techniques including SEM, TEM, XRD, DSC, and TGA. It was observed that surface oxidation played a significant role in the melting of nanoparticles, and homogeneous mixing between nanosolders and micro-sized solder powders, together with flux chemistry, ensured successful solder paste printing and solder reflow. Addition of solder nanoparticles in the NanoPaste helped increase the mechanical strength of the solder joints formed between the NanoPaste and Cu substrate and suppressed the intermetallic compound formation and growth along the solder joint interface. Thermal aging and thermal cycling measurements help understand the reliability of the solder joints formed by these NanoPastes. Through this project, one patent has been officially granted in June 2020, and three journal papers have been generated, with one paper published in <em>Thermochimica Acta</em> and two papers submitted for external review; in addition, one more journal paper is currently being prepared.
