 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) of the National Science Foundation (NSF) supports a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Kansas (KU) for summers 2016-2018.  Professor David R. Benson directs the ten week program, and Professor Joseph A. Heppert is the co-director.  Ten students, recruited from primarily undergraduate institutions across the nation, select and participate in individual research projects led by faculty members in the Department of Chemistry at KU. The interdisciplinary research experience is complemented by a career enhancement program that includes professional development activities, a three session short course on green chemistry organized in cooperation with the KU Center for Environmentally Beneficial Catalysis, and panel discussions and field trips that expose the participants to the variety of career options available to chemists.  The program serves the broader chemical sciences community by mentoring and training students with otherwise limited opportunities for research experience, and by encouraging participation of women and members of traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences, including students with disabilities.\r\n  \r\nProjects available to REU participants span the full range of research areas represented in the department.  Examples include examination of electronic structure contributions to reactivity in biomimetic manganese complexes, investigations of structure and electronic properties of azulene-based materials, studies of neurotransmitter release dynamics in neurological disease, synthesis and characterization of soluble polymers with tunable properties, and ultra-fast laser studies of reaction dynamics of photochromic molecular switches.  Participants benefit from the highly collaborative environment provided by the large KU chemical community, close interactions with faculty and graduate student (or postdoctoral) mentors, state-of-the-art facilities, and opportunities to communicate and disseminate their accomplishments in written and oral forms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThis NSF-REU award provided direct support for 30 undergraduate students to engage in cutting edge, interdisciplinary research at the University of Kansas (KU) during the summers of 2016, 2017 and 2019.  An additional 2 students were supported by a no-cost extension in Summer 2021.  The program was suspended in summer 2018 to accommodate a move into a new research and teaching building, and again in summer 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  All 32 participants supported by this award were from Primarily Undergraduate Institutions, in keeping with our goal of providing students with their first major research experience.   The full cohort of undergraduates taking part in the KU Chemistry REU program each summer ranged from 18 to 21 participants and featured students from PUIs supported by a subsequent NSF-REU grant (in 2021), individual KU faculty research grants, KU undergraduate researchers (including 5 Beckman Scholars) and, except for summer 2021, at least one international student supported by other means.\n\nA key component of the KU Chemistry REU experience is a Career Enhancement Program (CEP) that combines career options discussion panels, graduate school application/admission informational sessions, and educational activities centered on the topic of sustainability in chemistry made possible through partnerships with the KU Center for Environmentally Beneficial Catalysis (CEBC) and the KU Center of BioModular Multi-Scale Systems (CBM2).  Career options discussions included sessions with former REU students who are currently in the KU Chemistry graduate program, PhD chemists working in various capacities in academia (including professors at PUIs, laboratory directors and demonstration specialists), and PhD chemists employed in industry.  Career options discussions were also featured in field trips in summers 2016, 2017 and 2019 to visit the Kansas City District Laboratory of the US Food and Drug Administration, the Kansas Bureau of Investigations facilities in Topeka, KS, and Green Dot Bioplastics in Ottawa, KS.  In summer 2021 the students were treated to a tour of the Ralph N. Adams Nanofabrication Facility located on the KU main campus, in full protective gear.\n\nStrengthening scientific communication skills is a major objective of our program.  All participants gave short presentations at the start of the third week in which they outlined the background of their projects and their research goals.   In week 10 they gave longer talks addressing research accomplishments and presented posters at a multidisciplinary undergraduate research symposium.  We also encouraged participants to give research presentations at regional or national scientific conferences, and 20 of the 32 students supported by this grant will have done so in poster form (12 at American Chemical Society national meetings, 8 at ACS regional meetings, 3 at Pittcon Conferences).  One student also gave both oral and poster presentations at SACNAS meetings.  In addition, 10 publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals feature undergraduate co-authors supported by this grant, and we anticipate several more. \n\nResults of anonymous online surveys indicated that the students made substantial gains in many key areas, such as thinking and working like a scientist, and developing useful research skills.  The survey data further revealed that our program greatly increased the likelihood of attending graduate school. Of the 32 students supported by this grant, 18 are currently pursuing a PhD in a STEM field and the two from summer 2021 plan to pursue PhD studies as well. \n\nFinally, long-term tracking of our participants was improved during this grant period through workshops featuring LinkedIn, which also had the benefit of expanding participant professional networks.  Information about the 32 students supported by this award, and previous NSF-REU awards, can be found on the KU Chemistry REU web site (https://chemreu.ku.edu/alumni).    \n\n Broader Impact \n\nThe chemistry REU participants benefit not only from the various prescribed program activities, but also through interactions with a dynamic and diverse cohort of students in our program and other STEM summer research programs at KU.  These have included several joint activities with students in the KU Chemical and Petroleum Engineering REU Program.  Of the 32 REU participants supported by the current grant, 50% have been women and 31% have been from underrepresented minority groups (4 African American; 4 Hispanic; 2 American Indian).  Three of the women in our 2019 NSF-funded REU cohort represented firsts for our program: a military veteran; the mother of a toddler; and a student who had just completed her freshman year in college.  We also accommodated a student with an ADA-recognized disability who is now pursuing graduate studies at an R1 institution.  Diversity of our cohorts has been further enhanced through participation of international students funded by other means, including students from Ireland participating in an annual exchange program between KU and Dublin City University.  The diverse array of scientists in summer research at KU exposes the Chemistry REU participants to many different perspectives on science and scientific research, which will further prepare them for success in the STEM workforce.  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/31/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David R Benson"
