 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division, Dr. Rebecca A. Butcher of the University of Florida is investigating the chemical signals used by different species of nematodes (roundworms) to control their development.  Nematodes are very diverse (over 25,000 characterized species) and can be parasitic, causing widespread disease in plants and animals (including humans). Despite the huge impact of nematodes, surprisingly little is known about chemical signaling in members of this important class of organisms. Investigations into the chemical structures and biosynthesis of the chemical signals used by nematodes should enable the development of new chemical tools and strategies to interfere with their life cycles and survival and thus provide new treatment options. This award also promotes the development a discovery-based laboratory course for undergraduates in the isolation of natural products from microorganisms that live inside plants. In this course, students isolate endophytes from plants, generate extracts from these endophytes, and screen the extracts for anti-nematode activities.  \r\n\r\nThis award aims to characterize the chemical structures of key small-molecule signals that nematodes use to control their development.  The small-molecule signals from representative nematode species can be identified using comparative metabolomics between wild-type worms and biosynthetic mutants.  The relevant compounds are then be purified using mass-guided fractionation, and their structures characterized using NMR spectroscopy. Comparison of the chemical structures and biosynthetic gene sequences from different nematode species enables the roles of specific enzymatic domains to be mapped across nematode evolution.  To study the activities of specific enzymatic domains, this study uses a multidisciplinary approach incorporating tools from biochemistry, organic chemistry, structural biology, analytical chemistry, and nematode genetics.  The results of this award are expected to shed light on how nematodes control their life cycles and the development of novel methods to reduce the survival of parasitic nematodes.  The educational portion of this project increases retention of undergraduate students in science fields by developing a discovery-based (rather than cookbook style) laboratory course in natural product identification. The proposed course extends the research opportunities for undergraduate and high school students and may lead to the discovery of novel bacterial/fungal metabolites with anti-nematode activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit.  Nematodes are very diverse (over 25,000 characterized species) and can be either free-living, such as the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, or parasitic, causing widespread disease in plants and animals (including humans).  Despite the huge impact of nematodes on agriculture and human health, surprisingly little is known about chemical signaling in members of this important animal phylum.  C. elegans produces a complex mixture of ascaroside pheromones in order to communicate with other nematodes and to coordinate its development and behavior.  Acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX) enzymes, which participate in beta-oxidation cycles that shorten the side chains of the ascarosides, regulate the mixture of pheromones produced. Using CRISPR-Cas9, we have generated worm strains containing specific mutations in different acox genes, and we have analyzed ascaroside production in these strains.  We have shown that specific ACOX enzymes act as gatekeepers for the production of specific pheromones, and thus control the chemical message that is produced by nematodes.  Using X-ray crystallography and molecular modeling, we have provided a molecular basis for the substrate specificities of the ACOX enzymes and have uncovered why some of these enzymes have a very broad substrate range while others are quite specific.  We have shown that the ACOX enzymes are regulated by ATP levels, thereby coupling pheromone production to the metabolic state of the worm. \n\nIn addition, we have investigated the biosynthesis of nemamides, a family of hybrid polyketide-nonribosomal peptides that C. elegans uses to promote its survival during starvation.  We have shown that a polyketide synthase (PKS) and nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) biosynthesize these natural products in the canal-associated neurons of the worm.  Using CRISPR-Cas9, we have generated a large number of worm strains containing mutations in specific enzymatic domains in either the PKS or the NRPS.  We have analyzed the biosynthetic intermediates that accumulate in these strains and have thereby implicated specific enzymatic domains in precise steps in the biosynthesis of the nemamides.  Our work has shown how a complex family of natural products is biosynthesized in an animal system and has provided insights into how nematodes respond to adverse conditions.    \n\nThis research resulted in 10 peer-reviewed publications and one book chapter, with additional publications in preparation. \n\nBroader Impacts.  During this award, I developed a new biochemistry and molecular biology laboratory course, as the previous one had not been updated since the early 1990s and used outdated and unreliable purification and characterization methods.  In the new course, the students clone and express an enzyme involved in antibiotic resistance, a beta-lactamase, using an updated purification and characterization scheme.  Simultaneously, the students isolate Streptomyces strains from soil samples that I collected from Florida state parks and generate extracts from these bacteria.  At the end of the course, the students screen for antibiotics and for beta-lactamase inhibitors from extracts from their Streptomyces strains.  Thus, the reworked course enables the students to learn about something interesting and relevant &ndash; antibiotic discovery and resistance &ndash; and incorporates a novel discovery portion where the students are given the opportunity to discover potential antibiotics.  This curriculum has now been adopted by all of the faculty teaching this course, and thus, it has reached over 350 undergraduates.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/12/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rebecca A Butcher"
