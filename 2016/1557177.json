 "awd_abstract_narration": "A substantial portion of the Earth's wildlands have been degraded by past land use, species extinctions and invasion by non-native species. Degraded ecosystems often do not provide the same important services to humans as intact systems - including such services as erosion prevention, flood control, and support for wildlife. This research addresses tropical forest ecosystems that have been degraded by past forest clearing and the loss of native fruit-dispersing birds and asks why these forests are not returning to native species dominance despite the cessation of the original disturbances that caused their degradation.  It evaluates the interacting roles of widespread invasive pasture grasses, high levels of soil nitrogen, and loss of important native species (birds, a previously dominant native tree, and soil microorganisms) in stalling forest recovery. The work also addresses why the common restoration method of mass replanting of a single native tree species does not lead to recovery of native tropical forest. This research will provide badly needed information on growth requirements for endemic Hawaiian forest species and will help direct restoration actions to insure better success in recreating diverse native forests, which may result in cost savings for future restoration projects. This project will also train local students who will become the future stewards of these ecosystems.\r\n\r\nInsight into the theory of alternative stable states, which has come to dominate discussions of ecosystem degradation and restoration, will be gained with this research. A key assumption of this theory is that current conditions create feedbacks or priority effects that stall change, thus hindering recovery of ecosystems that exist in a degraded state. Most research on this topic focuses on the role of particular individual feedbacks in slowing ecosystem change. Using degraded montane tropical forests in Hawaii as a study system, this research addresses the role of multiple feedbacks, including cross-trophic level ones, in interfering with, or conversely allowing, community development away from a seemingly non-transient degraded state. An interdisciplinary team will address the importance and interactions of avian seed dispersal, overstory tree composition, understory grass competition with dispersing seedlings, and plant-soil and mycorrhizal feedbacks in maintaining persistent degraded conditions. The research tests specific interactions between birds, plants, nitrogen availability and mycorrhizae using manipulative field experiments, greenhouse feedback studies and ecological modeling. Together the team will work to determine what combinations of management actions are needed to accelerate ecosystem change in the direction desired by land managers.",

Recovery after the cessation of grazing can be very slow for a variety of reasons, even after substantial management effort. In Hawai&#699;i, high elevation forests are an important refuge for native birds that are disappearing from lowland areas due to introduced diseases such as avian malaria and extensive habitat loss from agriculture, urban development, and invasive species. Our NSF research evaluated ecological forces that are inhibiting the recovery of high elevation forests on Hawai&#699;i Island after the removal of livestock and feral ungulates. To accelerate the process of recovery from pasture to forest in the 1980s and 90s, managers planted extensive stands of a single native nitrogen-fixing tree <em>Acacia koa</em> (commonly referred to as koa). This species was not the dominant in the pre-disturbance forest but was fast growing. Yet the action of planting extensive koa plantations did not lead to forest succession. Instead, it appeared to create a novel condition of a koa canopy with an extensive lush understory of African grasses (Photo 1). This NSF-funded research evaluated the relationships between the koa plantation style tree stands, the non-native understory they appear to promote, and soil nitrogen cycling, seed-dispersing forest birds and understory microsite conditions.&nbsp; The goal was to delineate factors important for the natural regeneration of native woody plants that would be in an intact/undisturbed forest and identify what combination of factors would set succession in motion most rapidly. It also involved evaluating some different approaches to the restoration of forest understory and soils so as to inform future pasture/forest management. The overall goals were to evaluate the combination of actions needed to promote natural recovery processes, and to understand mechanistically, why those actions were needed.</p>\n<p>A combination of observation and experimental studies demonstrated that seed dispersal of native woody plants by birds into these plantation stands was generally not occurring and that natural seed rain was far below levels needed to promote development of a diverse forest ecosystem. Additionally, substrates and microsites needed for recruitment of woody seedlings (Photo 2), such as beds of mosses and bryophytes, are absent in the plantation stands due to the extensive occurrence of non-native African grasses that appear to benefit from the N-fixing canopy of the koa plantation trees as shown through experimentation. These grasses must be reduced to see recruitment of desired native woody species (Photo 3), but experiments demonstrated that a 100% reduction of grasses would likely lead to invasion by another dense growing non-native species, Florida raspberry (<em>Rubus argutus</em>). Instead, reduction of grasses by ~50% was sufficient to promote native woody plant recruitment if supplemental seeding of native woody plants occurs. This is because natural seed rain, both from birds bringing seeds in as well as seeds falling from adult trees and shrubs, is currently very low (Photo 4). Further research demonstrated the density of native woody plants being out-planted into the understory of these sites by volunteers is too low to reduce biomass of invasive grasses. Experiments demonstrated that high density planting in what is referred to by forest ecologists as a nodal arrangement (photo 5) is more effective at reducing grasses and mimicking the way natural recruitment occurs in forest fragments.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is not yet known what density of fruiting native woody understory is needed to attract seed dispersing birds and to provide for long-term habitat for native forest birds.</p>\n<p>In addition to the direct results of the research, this project supported native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander&nbsp; and other minoritized students who worked as REUs (Research Experience for Undergraduates) and technicians throughout the life of the award. These students obtained direct research experience, engaged in publication preparation, and learned presentation skills while also being part of a conservation team. In addition, researchers met with land managers in Hawai&#699;i to share their findings and explore how management questions and concerns could shape their own research. The researchers engaged volunteers across a broad spectrum of the public through groups such as Friends of Hakalau, and KupuHawaii providing valuable field exposure to Hawaiian conservation issues, field research and team building. Results from this project have been presented at local, regional, national, and international conferences, which has broadened the scope disseminating conclusions that relate to place-based management lessons learned as well as more general ecological findings.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/05/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Thomas&nbsp;L&nbsp;Dudley</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1557177/1557177_10462461_1690920748988_F2111405-D322-4BA7-B7A9-8F5A08703BBD_1_201_a--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1557177/1557177_10462461_1690920748988_F2111405-D322-4BA7-B7A9-8F5A08703BBD_1_201_a--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Photo 1: Koa-grass state\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1557177/1557177_10462461_1690920748988_F2111405-D322-4BA7-B7A9-8F5A08703BBD_1_201_a--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Photo 1: Koa-grass state\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Photo 1: Scattered plantation Acacia koa trees with an understory of the exotic grass, Cenchrus clandestinum.
