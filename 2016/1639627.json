The workshop is part of a program on Logical Structures in Computation that will take place from August 14 to December 16, 2016. The underlying theme of the workshop is to explore the viewpoints of the fields of logic, analysis of algorithms, and computational complexity on uncertainty in computation. The broader significance and importance of the workshop is that it will enhance communication between the mathematical logic community and the community of algorithms researchers within computing science. The workshop will encourage students to attend, and the organizers will actively recruit scientists from a diversity of backgrounds.",

Probability is the best tool we have for managing uncertainty. This workshop brought together researchers for whom probabilistic reasoning is an essential aspect of their research.\nThis workshop addressed three major themes: (i) logic and probability, (ii) probabilistic databases and statistical relational models, and (iii) machine learning. The first theme is both foundational, as the quote from Laplace suggests, and practical. There is substantial interest in automated tools for verifying probabilistic systems using probabilistic modal logics. The second theme is about the management of uncertainty in relational data and probabilistic inference for queries expressed in first-order logic. The use of logic for representing and reasoning about probabilities has generated a lot interest and has led to new approaches for probabilistic inference. The third theme is represented by a vast community interested in extracting information from data. There is also burgeoning interest in programming languages for building probabilistic models which impinges on all three themes. \nThe workshop on Uncertainty In Computation brought together researchers working in the area of logic in computer science for whom probabilistic reasoning is central to their research.
