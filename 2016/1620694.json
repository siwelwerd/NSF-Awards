The objective of the workshop is to provide a technical forum on advances in the scientific understanding of the effects of small particles on urban, regional, continental, and global scale haze and climate. \r\n\r\nThe conference will take a multipronged approach by encouraging scientific submissions (e.g., related to measurements, modeling, etc.) as well as submissions addressing regulatory and policy issues. Key sessions include one on black and brown carbon, since recent research has shown the importance of these particles for radiative forcing, and sessions related to the synergistic and increasing concerns of the effects of atmospheric nitrogen and carbonaceous material on haze, climate change, and nitrogen deposition on ecosystems. This NSF project supports the registration, travel, and lodging expenses for graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, and junior faculty from universities and research institutes within the U.S.A. who would otherwise be unable to attend.",
