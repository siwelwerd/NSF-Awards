 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"marine methane paradox\" refers to observations of high concentrations of methane in surface waters of the ocean, even though these waters are well-oxygenated and high in sulfate, both features which generally do not favor the production of methane. This project aims to elucidate on the cause of this paradox. Based on preliminary results, the investigator identified the potential for methane production stimulated by microbial cycling of dissolved organic matter. Polysaccharides (carbonates such as starch) are a major component of high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMWDOM) and they can incorporate esters of methylphosphonate, which may be allowing for the production of methane in surface waters.  When these HMWDOM polysaccharides were introduced to seawater samples, the researchers saw production of methane with an anomalous stable carbon isotope ratio comparable to what is seen in the paradoxical surface waters enriched in methane. By making measurements of trace gases, HMWDOM phosphonate, and stable carbon isotope measurements in the western North Atlantic Ocean, the investigator and his collaborators will reassess the preliminary data and the implications of these results for the entire oceanographic cycling of methane. Both educational and outreach efforts have been included.  For the educational component, a postdoc, a graduate student, and summer undergraduate students will be work on the project, whereas for the outreach activities, the proponent plans to develop curricula on basic science and oceanography for high school students, include a high school teacher in the research cruise, and integrate results into an organic geochemistry course, the lectures of which will be publically available online. \r\n\r\nThis project seeks to evaluate the possibility that the \"marine methane paradox\", or the super-saturation of methane in high sulfate, well-oxygenated surface waters, is caused by microbial cycling of dissolved organic matter (DOM). There has been a great deal of preliminary evidence to support this theory. For example, samples from station ALOHA were amended with purified high molecular weight DOM (HMWDOM) polysaccharides, and methane, ethylene, and propylene productions were stimulated. HMWDOM polysaccharides incorporate esters of methylphosphonate (MPn), 2-hydroxyethylphosphonates (2-HEP), and other minor phosphonates, which are likely facilitating the production of methane, ethylene, and propylene. Carbon isotope data supports that this theory is the process behind the marine methane paradox; the d13C value of methane produced from HMWDOM polysaccharide enriched samples agrees well with the anomalous value associated with the super-saturated surface water. Only a small fraction of HMWDOM polysaccharides can easily explain the marine methane paradox, and this process could just as easily fully revise the current understanding of large scale methane cycling between the ocean and atmosphere. The researchers will assess the preliminary evidence and evaluate the microbial DOM cycling theory by making paired trace gas and HMWDOM phosphonate, as well as stable carbon isotope measurements in the western North Atlantic Ocean.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit\n\nMethane is a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to planetary warming.  The concentration of methane in the atmosphere is increasing, but the reasons behind this increase are unclear.  The ocean is a source of atmospheric methane, and this project explored a potentially important pathway of methane formation in the ocean, the degradation of organic phosphorus containing compounds, or phosphonates, into methane.  Our analyses showed that phosphonates were abundant in surface waters across the western North Atlantic Ocean, as were the microbes that degrade phosphonates to methane.  We found that the abundance of genes that code for the degradation of phosphonates to methane were inversely correlated with phosphate concentration, but positively correlated with methane supersaturation.  When phosphate concentrations in the ocean are low, microbes turn on phosphonate degradation in order to acquire phosphorus from phosphonates.  In doing so they produce methane, and this production of methane increases the flux of methane from the ocean to the atmosphere.  One important factor in the strength of the ocean methane source is therefore the concentration of phosphate.  If increasing global temperatures lead to decreased mixing and delivery of nutrients to ocean surface waters, this will likely lead to an increase in marine methane production.\n\n \n\nSeveral other aspects of phosphonate biogeochemistry were explored in this project.  We used marine genomic and metagenomic databases to determine that phosphonate production was widespread among diverse taxa of marine microbes.  We identified a cultured representative of the marine cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus that makes phosphonates, and found that up to half the phosphorus in this strain of Prochlorococus was allocated to phosphonate production.  Phosphonates were part of membrane proteins, and we postulate phosphonates are used to protect the cell from viral infection and/or grazing.  Curiously, we found that microbes that can make phosphonates are incapable of degrading them.  Phosphonate production and phosphonate degradation are catalyzed by very different groups of microbes.  We developed a method to measure the activity of the enzyme that degrades methylphosphonate to methane, and found phosphonate degradation, and moast likely methane formation, occurs throughout the water column.  Finally, we developed a method to measure the carbon isotopic value of methylphosphonate in dissolved organic matter.  Carbon isotopic values of methylphosphonate in dissolved organic matter can now be compared to carbon isotopic values of methane to measure the amount of ocean methane that is generated by phosphonate degradation.\n\n \n\nBroader impacts\n\nThe project contributed to the training of two graduate and five undergraduate students.  The project significantly increased the number of methane measurements in the ocean and uncovered the connection between methane supersaturation and phosphate concentration.  This relationship should prove valuable to future efforts to model atmospheric methane concentrations.  Finally, the project led to the development of two new methods to measure phosphonate degrading enzyme activity and the carbon isotope values of methylphosphonates.  Future deployment of both methods will contribute to our broader understanding of methane formation and microbial biogeochemical cycling in the ocean\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/05/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Daniel J Repeta"
