This workshop, focused on machine learning for healthcare, will be co-located with the annual Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) conference in Montreal, the foremost international meeting for machine learning research.  The workshop will i) help build the community of machine learning researchers focused on solutions to healthcare problems, and ii) foster discussions between machine learning and clinical researchers to leverage machine learning in service of healthcare.  The workshop includes industry and academic participants.  It includes a \"healthcare challenges\" session in which clinical researchers will bring new problems to the statistical machine learning community.\r\n\r\nThis award supports Ph.D student attendance at the workshop, and hence will influence the future workforce in applications of statistical learning to healthcare.  The students will be introduced to key open questions and interact with established machine learning and clinical researchers, thus encouraging their investment into this emerging domain.",
