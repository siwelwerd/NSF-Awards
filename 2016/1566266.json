 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Carl Gottlieb and Dr. Michael McCarthy will isolate and identify oxygen-bearing species that play key roles in chemical reactions which are ubiquitous on Earth, occurring both in the atmosphere and in hydrocarbon combustion. To meet this challenge, new diagnostic tools will be developed to simultaneously analyze mixtures of gases that contain many chemical compounds rapidly. The work will allow chemical models with greater predictive power to be developed for our atmosphere and combustion. The project will also lead to improved analytical gas sampling techniques, which has practical implications to human health.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the characterization of elusive reactive intermediates that are produced in many reactions involving oxygen, ozone, and the OH radical. These studies will establish the existence of the key intermediates by using sensitive high-resolution rotational spectroscopy, and provide insights into their formation and molecular structure. Synergistic collaborations with leading experimental and theoretical groups here and abroad will enhance many of the proposed investigations. Technological innovation is an integral component of the work, and efforts to develop automated, \"library-free\" approaches to identify entirely new chemical compounds will be developed. Activities of potential societal benefit include an extensive education and outreach program with partners that entails an interactive traveling exhibit to three New England venues; the introduction of students to new experiences in science, engineering and mathematics; and a student visitor program. These programs will reach public audiences and underrepresented groups, and serve as an excellent vehicle for teaching, training, and learning.",
