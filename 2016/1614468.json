 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by engaging in hands-on field experience, laboratory/project-based entrepreneurship tasks and mentorship experiences. This ITEST project aims to research the STEM  career interests of late elementary and middle-school students and, based on the results of that research, build an informal education program to involve families and community partners to enhance their science knowledge, attitudes, experiences, and resources. There is an emphasis on underrepresented and low income students and their families.\r\n\r\nThe project will research and test a new model to promote the development of positive attitudes toward STEM and to increase interest in STEM careers. Phase 1 of the project will include exploratory research examining science capital and habitus for a representative sample of youth at three age ranges: 8-9, 9-10 and 11-12 years. The project will measure the access that youth have to adults who engage in STEM careers and STEM leisure activities. In phase II the project will test a model with a control group and a treatment group to enhance science capital and habitus for youth.",

The results showed the program influenced the perception of science as a potential career (science expectancy and science task value). There was additional evidence that the program had a positive impact on the time families spent engaging in STEM activities, knowledge of science and science careers, and opportunities to learn science as a family. Parents reported that the program had a positive influence on the family including siblings. The project outcomes include: 1) a profile of family science habitus and science capital for youth across the US, 2) research that documented the efficacy of a museum program model that develops science capital and family science habitus, 3) new elementary and middle school assessments for science career aspirations within an expectancy value framework, and 4) a new validated assessment that examines parent STEM capital and habitus.</p>\n<!-- @font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1107305727 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:DengXian; \tpanose-1:2 1 6 0 3 1 1 1 1 1; \tmso-font-alt:&#31561;&#32447;; \tmso-font-charset:134; \tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-1610612033 953122042 22 0 262159 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Calibri; \tpanose-1:2 15 5 2 2 2 4 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:swiss; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536859905 -1073732485 9 0 511 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:\"\\\\@DengXian\"; \tpanose-1:2 1 6 0 3 1 1 1 1 1; \tmso-font-charset:134; \tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-1610612033 953122042 22 0 262159 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:DengXian; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:Arial; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi; \tmso-font-kerning:1.0pt; \tmso-ligatures:standardcontextual;}p \t{mso-style-noshow:yes; \tmso-style-priority:99; \tmso-margin-top-alt:auto; \tmargin-right:0in; \tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; \tmargin-left:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Calibri\",sans-serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:DengXian; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Calibri; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:Arial; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} --><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/05/2023<br>\nModified by: Melissa&nbsp;G&nbsp;Jones</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n></div>\n</div>\n",
