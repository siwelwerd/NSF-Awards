The following are typical subjects of SCAPDE meetings: dynamical systems, harmonic analysis, mathematical physics, nonlinear partial differential equations, complex analysis, spectral theory. The conference format provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
