 "awd_abstract_narration": "All living organisms transcribe and translate the information encoded by DNA by well-understood processes known as transcription and translation respectively. The process converts the information stored in DNA into protein functions that are essential catalysts for life supporting reactions. In this process, every three nucleotides in a gene are read as a specific code for the serial incorporation of the natural building blocks protein synthesis. This study aims at refactoring the translational machinery to evolve novel transfer-RNA species that will recognize not a three-, but four-nucleotide code for the specific translational incorporation of unnatural amino acids. The objective is to create proteins that feature novel catalytic functions and chemical properties to aid biochemical and biomedical research. In addition, this research will shed light on fundamental questions about detailed mechanisms of translation. The project will attract, train, and transform today's young talents into tomorrow's leaders in sciences at the interface of chemistry and biology.  The scientific insights and new technologies obtained under the proposed research program will be valuable to a broad biochemistry and synthetic biology research community.\r\n\r\nWhile the triplet codon is the predominant form of the current genetic code, non-canonical reading of a quadruplet codon is a natural process and can be achieved under experimental conditions. Transfer RNA (tRNA) plays important roles in the quadruplet codon decoding process.  The work will use a directed evolution approach to identify tRNA mutants that are able to efficiently decode quadruplet codons in a genomically recoded bacterium. A systematic study of quadruplet codon decoding mechanism will be conducted, which is likely contribute to the understanding on how ribosomes recognize the reading frame.  This research is further strengthen by expanding the cellular genetic code with multiple and mutually orthogonal quadruplet codons. This would allow for the incorporation of t unnatural amino acids with different physical and chemical properties. Applications of this technology could enable unprecedented in vivo study of proteins in living cells, and could enable novel synthetic biology applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAlthough triplet codons are the predominant form of genetic code in nature, programmed frameshift, e.g., +1 frameshift (an apparent quadruplet codon decoding), is a natural process.   Recent developments in genetic code engineering demonstrated that quadruplet codon could also be used to encode non-canonical amino acids (ncAAs) under experimental conditions.  The proposed research project focuses on the mechanistic study, engineering, and application of quadruplet decoding tRNAs that bear extended anticodon loops (8-nucleotide instead of normal 7-nucleotide loop).  This study yielded new information on how mutations in tRNA mediate the switch from triplet to quadruplet reading frame within a universal translational machinery that prefers reading triplet codons.   A mechanistic understanding of quadruplet codon decoding also facilitated the expansion of the cellular genetic code with multiple quadruplet codons.  Genetic code expansion provides a platform to engineer cells with an increased biological diversity and enables novel design/synthesis of biological systems.  \n\nAll components of the translational machinery can affect quadruplet codon decoding.  In this work, we mainly focused on tRNA, ribosome, and mRNA.  Two series of quadruplet codons were examined, including UAGN and AGGN (N = A, G, C, U) codons.  It was found that positions 531and 532 in the 16S rRNA of ribosome are the most important for both UAGN and AGGN codon decoding.  Positions 965, 1196, and 1400 are also influence UAGN decoding (Figure 1). It is apparent that ribosome mutations are tRNA- and/or codon-dependent.  By combining mutagenesis and modeling studies, we discovered that the insertion of U33.5 in the anticodon loop likely causes tRNA distortion and affects anticodon-codon interaction, which leads to quadruplet decoding in the P site of ribosome (Figure 2). \n\nNaturally existing quadruplet codon decoding (+1 frameshift) is a low-frequency event.  In addition to mutations in tRNA, recoding signals that are embedded in the close proximity to the frameshift site on the mRNA are required.  We successfully conducted a systematic analysis of the effect of mRNA sequence context (recoding signal) on quadruplet codon decoding. Consensus mRNA sequence contexts were different for each of the UAGN and AGGN codons (Figure 3 and Figure 4).  Our mutagenesis studies and sequencing data also suggest that nucleotides at positions -3 to -1 and +1 to +3 (quadruplet codon is defined as position 0) are the most important for quadruplet codon decoding.  Our findings from both UAGN and AGGN decoding studies suggest that triplet translocation from ribosome A to P site is most likely.  The mRNA-anticodon realignment subsequently occurs in the P site and mediates alternative framing.  This finding is consistent with our new model on quadruplet codon decoding (Figure 2)\n\nIn addition to understand decoding mechanisms, the identified recoding signals are used for highly efficient quadruplet codon decoding in non-canonical amino acid mutagenesis.  With representative recoding signals, the expression level of mutant proteins containing UAGN and AGGN codons reached 48% and 98% of that of the wild-type protein, respectively.  We have also demonstrated that two mutually orthogonal quadruplet codons could be used to simultaneously encode two different noncanonical amino acids within a single protein in live cells (Figure 5). By developing and employing biorthogonal chemistry, we successfully constructed a sensor for tyrosine phosphorylation through genetic incorporation of two non-canonical amino acids in response to two quadruplet codons.\n\nThe educational component of the project focused on integrating research and education activities, providing research opportunities to students, and increasing underrepresented groups? participation in science.  During the project period, we have provided research trainings for one postdoctoral researcher, five graduate students, twelve undergraduate students, and one high school student. Besides conducting research projects, they were also exposed in depth to a large array of research problems in chemistry and biology that are ongoing in the PI?s lab as well as in other laboratories at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.  A number of women and underrepresented students (13 out of 19) were supported by this grant.  As one outreach effort, the grant participants visited local middle and high schools, conducted science exhibitions in the Nebraska State Museum, and participated in Women in Science conferences.  As another outreach effort, the PI and three other faculty members organized and mentored the first four undergraduate iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) team from the State of Nebraska.  These teams conducted their research in the PI?s lab during summers.  The iGEM students also discussed their research projects with local biotechnology companies and conducted science exhibitions.  One iGEM team won the team volunteer of the year award from the Nebraska State Museum. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/20/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jiantao Guo"
