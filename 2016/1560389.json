 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the University of Central Oklahoma (UCO), located in Edmond, Oklahoma, will support the training of eight students for eight weeks during the summers of 2016-2019. This award is supported by both the Division of Biological Infrastructure within the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Office of International Science and Engineering. Research will be in the Republic of Turkey at Middle East Technical University (Ankara) and Uluda\u00f0 University (Bursa). Students will be selected based upon criteria that includes an essay as to why participation in the project will be important to the student's career. The program focuses on the honey bee as a model organism to study pollination dynamics in variable environments, behavioral ecology and comparative psychology, and behavioral and physiological responses to stress. The program begins with a mini-course at UCO that includes Responsible Conduct in Research training. An excursion through northwestern Turkey will acclimate students to research methodology and the customs of the region before groups travel to the campuses at Ankara and Bursa. The program concludes at UCO with group presentations and reflection. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 32 students, primarily from schools or backgrounds with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program. Students will not only engage directly in team-based, cutting-edge research but will also have the opportunity to present their results at a national scientific conference. The program's international setting, including experiences throughout the Republic of Turkey, provides an opportunity to learn from a geographic region of great historical significance to human civilization; students will develop enduring professional relationships with faculty and students at the host institutions. Research findings will address global issues, including the causes and effects of Colony Collapse Disorder. \r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths and be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available by visiting http://www.uco.edu/cms/reu/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. John Barthell at jbarthell@uco.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Charles Abramson at charles.abramson@okstate.edu).",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Our work examines plant-pollinator relationships in a part of the world (Eurasia) where many agricultural crops and pollinators (such as the honey bee) now found in the USA are native. We study the relationship of foraging bees at their host plants in natural settings as well as under experimental conditions that use artificial flowers near apiaries. We recruited at least six students each year to conduct research in international settings in the Republic of Turkey and an island ecosystem (Lesvos, Greece) with a rich historical tradition for the biological sciences. Participating scientists represent a wide range of scientific backgrounds (behavior, ecology, molecular genetics, physiology, and taxonomy) and thus create an integrative biological approach to addressing the diverse hypotheses of the project while also exposing students to multiple disciplines. We recruit students from across the USA and from diverse backgrounds to ensure opportunities for scientific careers among as many qualified and promising undergraduate students as possible.</p>\n<p>Bees are numerous and diverse in Mediterranean climates and show a remarkable tolerance to high temperatures associated with such environments. Our research locale is therefore ideal for studying a number of bee species with tolerance to heat that is required by their dependency on host plants that flower and present nectar or pollen during extremely hot times of the day. Our work has revealed differences in foraging times of three species of carpenter bees (<em>Xylocopa</em>&nbsp;spp.), for example, that inhabit Lesvos as well as among sweat bees that depend upon either a few or many host plant species to provision their nests. These foraging patterns are reflected in circadian-based rhythms measured for these species (as well as sweat bees and honey bees) within environmental chambers; the molecular differences of the circadian clocks of these generalist and specialist species is being elucidated now. We have also demonstrated that each carpenter bee species has a different critical (lethal) maximum temperature that it can withstand that may, in part, determine its foraging patterns. Lowland and montane populations of these species also show differences in heat tolerance. This suggests that heat tolerance and circadian rhythms vary among individuals within populations and can be influenced by changing temperatures or even changes in land use.</p>\n<p>Because honey bee populations are easy to concentrate among man made hives in apiaries, we are easily able to study individual behaviors of honey bees at artificial \"flower patches\" positioned near hives. We use simulated (plastic) flowers to vary rewards and obstacles to honey bees in these patches. For example, moveable caps that can be positioned over artificial flower wells (containing sugar solution) create obstacles to honey bees that discover them while foraging. Preliminary results demonstrate that honey bees are able to learn to move these caps and remember to do so again when they encounter the same condition upon returning to the patch. Bees may experience the same learning challenges when encountering plants with a new floral anatomy. In circumstances that adversely influence the handling time of a bee in retrieving food, we hypothesize that environmental stressors (including temperature) may exacerbate difficulties in learning such complex behaviors.</p>\n<p>At least 30 publications and twice as many presentations pertaining to our REU studies have been produced by the senior personnel and/or student participants during this funding period. In addition to undergraduates, our collaborations have involved at least four graduate students during the same time period. Broader Impacts of the research itself include a consideration of the role of changing environmental (abiotic) factors over time in wildlife management and conservation practices; the apicultural industry also benefits from our understanding what underlies honey bee foraging activities. Diminishing pollinator populations at the global level suggest that a more synthetic view of this decline may be required in order to fully explain and respond to it. Human populations in the future will likely encounter changes at the global scale and an important goal in bringing together students of diverse backgrounds in international settings is to anticipate this needed expertise in the next generation of scientists.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/07/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Charlotte&nbsp;Simmons</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560389/1560389_10410656_1596775676385_Xylocopaolivieri--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560389/1560389_10410656_1596775676385_Xylocopaolivieri--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Xylocopa olivieri\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560389/1560389_10410656_1596775676385_Xylocopaolivieri--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Xylocopa olivieri\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Crepuscular carpenter bee species collected in a field setting.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Victor Gonzalez</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Charlotte&nbsp;Simmons</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Xylocopa olivieri</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560389/1560389_10410656_1596804528026_BeesinTubeRack--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560389/1560389_10410656_1596804528026_BeesinTubeRack--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Bees in Tube Rack\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560389/1560389_10410656_1596804528026_BeesinTubeRack--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Bees in Tube Rack\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Carpenter bees in tubes waiting for environmental chamber.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Victor Gonzalez</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Charlotte&nbsp;Simmons</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Bees in Tube Rack</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560389/1560389_10410656_1596804743731_FrameatMalemi--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560389/1560389_10410656_1596804743731_FrameatMalemi--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Honey Bee Hive Frame at Apiary\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1560389/1560389_10410656_1596804743731_FrameatMalemi--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Honey Bee Hive Frame at Apiary\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Honey bee queen and workers on hive frame in Greek apiary.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">John F.
