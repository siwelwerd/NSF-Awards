 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brain, Joseph\r\n1530767\r\n\r\nNanotechnology has expanded dramatically during the past decades. While maximizing benefits, there is also a need to minimize risks of nanotechnology. One of the current major research areas in nanotechnology is to optimize novel properties of nanomaterials to improve quality of life.  The PIs will study examples of public and workplace exposures to nanoparticles specifically those containing either silver (Ag) or cerium (Ce). Both are inexpensive and produced in large quantities. Silver-containing nanoparticles are used in medical supplies, cosmetics and textiles for their ability to kill microorganisms. Nanoparticles containing cerium oxide are used to polish glass mirrors, computer chips, and ophthalmic lenses. The PIs seek to develop techniques to explain nanoparticle behavior and control human exposures during production, use, and disposal of these products. An important feature of this proposal is that it involves researchers from the United States in an international consortium that includes Germany, Romania, Austria, and Spain. As a result the PIs will better understand how that affects the phospholipids and proteins that bind to particle surfaces and how that influences their ultimate fate and biological effects.\r\n\r\nThe PIs will characterize human exposures to novel nanoparticles. The research project will use models and exposure scenarios to elucidate the mechanisms underlying inhalation of nanoparticles. The project will involve exploration of where inhaled nanoparticles deposit, how fast they migrate from lungs, and to what extent they cross the air-blood barrier and thus have access to other organs. A key issue is particle interactions since mixtures are commonplace. Nanoparticle exposures are is often combined with particles that are larger and with a variety of chemicals and vapors. This project will explore what happens to particles after they deposit deep in the lungs. The PIs will measure how the size, morphology, and surface composition of nanoparticles determine the specific proteins and phospholipids that bind to their surface. In turn, this binding activity will determine the fate of and biologic responses to nanoparticles. The research objective is to integrate these data to better predict risks from nanomaterials for humans or the environment.",

We seek to optimize the positive uses of nanotechnology while minimizing possible harm to humans or the environment. The use of manufactured NMs (MNMs) in common consumer applications is steadily increasing. Two prominent MNMs often used and relevant for potential inhalation exposure are Ag and CeO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;nanoparticles (NPs). They are relatively inexpensive and produced in large quantities.&nbsp;<strong>Ag&nbsp;</strong>NPs are often used in materials like medical supplies, cosmetics, and textiles for its bacterial inhibiting properties.&nbsp;<strong>CeO<sub>2</sub></strong>&nbsp;NPs are used as polishing agents for glass mirrors, television screens, ophthalmic lenses, and silicon wafers. They are often added to lacquers and wood preservative coatings to improve their UV stability. The specific applications for the two NPs emphasized in this project are aerosols intended to improve the performance of textiles, leather, and some surfaces.</p>\n<p>Inhalation is the most relevant route of exposure to MNMs. Aerosolized MNMs rarely enter the body in their pristine form. They are usually part of complex mixtures. When deposited in the lungs, MNMs land on airways and the alveolar lining layer containing phospholipids (PLs) and proteins. This results in the formation of a PL-protein corona that changes surface characteristics before it contacts lung cells. Moreover, the aging processes of airborne MNMs during aerosolization or by their reactions in the atmosphere can also alter MNM characteristics. It is important to understand the interplay of the chemical ingredients and physical parameters of liquid aerosol clouds to assess their risks for humans or the environment.</p>\n<p>The formulation we studied was complex with multiple constituents (Fig. 1). It was essential to evaluate the toxicity of all components in addition to the nanoparticles (Fig. 2). We used a logical progression from [1] simple&nbsp;<em>in vitro&nbsp;</em>assays to [2]&nbsp;<em>ex vivo</em>&nbsp;responses of the entire lung especially Precision Cut Lung Slices (Fig. 3), then we turned to [3] whole animal exposures. As we progress from simple to complex, the throughput decreases but relevance increases.</p>\n<p>Between over-simplified cellular assays, and the complexity and expense of studying intact animals, there is an important gap. To \"mind the gap\" and to fill it, an effective preparation is the PCLS.&nbsp;In the PCLS, the morphological organization of cells, matrix, airways, and vessels is nearly identical to that in the&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;lung. Additional practical advantages of the PCLS include its ease of storage via cryopreservation, suitability for high-resolution microscopy imaging, and inclusion of many species, including human.</p>\n<p>This project demonstrates that PCLS is a powerful technology in toxicology.

In a single slice, we can measure cell viability, mitochondrial metabolism, DNA damage and&nbsp;repair, or apoptosis. From the fluid above each lung slice, dozens of cytokines and proteins can be quantified.&nbsp;&nbsp;The number of animals sacrificed is greatly reduced since 70-80 slices can be obtained from a mouse.

A number of important questions have been asked and answered:</p>\n<p>1. When nanoparticles are present in product formulations, non-nano materials in the mixture have varying but sometimes dominant toxicities.
