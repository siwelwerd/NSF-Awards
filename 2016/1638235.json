The GRC meetings will directly impact all of the attendees by providing an open atmosphere for exchange of ideas on the cutting edge of Solid State Chemistry and it will provide a unique forum to bring together experts, young scientists, and students to disclose unpublished data, to challenge and discuss novel ideas, and to push the frontiers of science and innovation forward. New collaborations can be formed and new ideas generated that would not otherwise occur if not for these important conferences. Speakers are expected to convey cutting edge information to their colleagues with the objective that this disclosure will stimulate expansive discussion among all attendees and progressively advance the field. The inclusive, collegial atmosphere of the meeting, and the emphasis on sharing previously unpublished information, enables the cultivation of innovative approaches to address the most important challenges facing our world. This strategy is a hallmark of GRC and has served the scientific community and facilitated the advancement of science for over eight decades.  The GRS, which is a meeting solely for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, will promote an environment to introduce new graduate students into a conference atmosphere, allow all students and fellows to present their work in a low stress environment, and promote networking among peers. The GRS will also feature a career panel with mentors from academic, national laboratory, and industrial sources to help empower the future of the solid state community with knowledge. The intent of the GRC meeting is to promote the exchange of ideas and the building of partnerships between researchers from the academic world, industry and government laboratories. Many younger scientists are included in the program along with more senior and distinguished scientists, promising to make the presentations and discussions representative of new directions in the field. \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL \r\nThe focus of the Solid State Chemistry GRC will be materials for energy and environment applications, and the conference highlights the challenges that we face in producing enough energy while maintaining our environment. To overcome this important problem, we will need to design new compounds, optimize existing materials and understand the relationship of structure and physical properties and it will require a multidisciplinary approach. This conference will bring together array of established scientists and students to discuss the latest advances and challenges in Solid State Chemistry.  Speakers and poster presenters are explicitly encouraged to emphasize advances, unpublished results, new and risky ideas on a variety of current topics. The organizers strongly encourage active contribution to discussions and participation in poster sessions, which offer an excellent opportunity for presenting new and exciting research. Solid State Chemistry is a multidisciplinary field whose importance continues to increase not only with the discovery of new classes of materials, but also through a deeper understanding of the diverse properties of solids made possible by modern techniques. The importance and scope of the field has grown in response to the continuing challenge to understand, control, and predict the structures and properties of solids and the need to synthesize new materials with enhanced physical properties.",
