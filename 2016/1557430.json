 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the current expansion of oxygen-depleted habitats in oceans around the world, the capacity for organisms to adapt and persist in such conditions will be essential to sustain life. Single-celled organisms called foraminifera present a unique and relevant opportunity in which to study the physiological response of marine life to oxygen-depletion. Additionally, given the ability to modify their metabolism under changing environments and because fossil foraminifera are used extensively for interpretations of historical climate conditions, an improved understanding of their physiological responses will bolster our ability to understand past, and predict future, responses to environmental change in Earth's oceans. This collaborative project also includes education and outreach activities. Along with providing partial financial and full training support to two Postdoctoral Investigators, at least three undergraduate students will gain first-hand oceanographic experience by joining a research cruise. We also plan to recruit an undergraduate student from an underrepresented group to join the project for a summer internship. Lastly, a Science-through-Art collaboration will produce a traveling art exhibition depicting the plight of marine species living in low-oxygen settings. \r\n\r\nThis project will identify how the integrative genetic, metabolic, and physiological response of foraminifera allows their survival under environmentally induced fluctuations in oxygen. The goal is to determine the physiological and metabolic responses of ecophysiologically distinct foraminifera to oxygen availability. In sediments that range from oxic to dysoxic to anoxic to sulfidic, three foraminiferal species will be investigated. Initially, a single-cell genomic analysis will reveal their physiological and metabolic potential. Identifying the metabolic functions encoded within the genome will enable predictions regarding their physiological response to changing molecular oxygen conditions, and allow for comparisons of the metabolic potential between these different ecotypes. Subsequent experimental conditions will specifically test and validate the genome-enabled predictions of the adaptations to changing oxygen concentrations. Integrating the genomic data with physiological and chemical measurements, models will be constructed to represent the metabolic activities of the holobionts under different oxygen regimes and geochemistry. These models will elucidate the metabolic mechanisms that contribute to the adaptation of foraminifera under aerated, dysoxic, anoxic, and euxinic conditions, and the predicted changes in key C, N, O, and S metabolic pathways will be further evaluated using qPCR analyses and physiological assays. Hypotheses will be addressed with these objectives: 1) Determine the physiological and metabolic potential of foraminifera under different oxygen regimes; 2) Identify the metabolic responses of each species incubated under different oxygen regimes, following periodic and extended exposure, and; 3) Define the impact of oxidative stress and ROS production on the health and physiology of the different foraminifera under different oxygen regimes.",

The species have been found in very high abundances in very low-oxygen to no-oxygen waters that naturally occur, bathing sediments of a seafloor basin (depression) off California. Areas where oxygen is severely depleted, or even anoxic (no oxygen), are expanding in many parts of Earth?s oceans due to sluggish circulation resulting from climate change, among other things (e.g., nutrient loading from use of fertilizers). The organisms that thrive in this seafloor basin ?natural laboratory? can be studied to better understand how they tolerate ocean deoxygenation (loss of oxygen), allowing us to gain glimpses into future ecosystem functioning in the face of global change.

Analyses of the foraminifer species that sequesters chloroplasts revealed near-complete expression of a diatom?s plastid genome suggesting the sequestered plastids are functional; this is a conundrum as the host foraminifer lives far deeper than the presumed maximum penetration of sunlight in the ocean, raising questions of chloroplast functionality in a dark habitat. Also, an unusual close metabolic interplay between organelles was identified in one species but not the other, indicating that the group has breadth of metabolic abilities. Our surprising and exciting results indicate a unique adaptable metabolism, providing novel perspectives on eukaryote evolution, microbial metabolism and microbe-host interactions. Further, through a unique integration of functions largely unrecognized among ?typical? eukaryotes, these two benthic foraminifera represent successful species in the face of ongoing oceanic deoxygenation.</p>\n<p>Our main broader impact effort was a Science-Through-Art exhibition, which was a multi-artist, multimedia event entitled ?<em>Adaptations to Extreme</em><em>s</em>? that occurred in early 2019, in Lake George NY, which is located at the edge of the Adirondack Mountains in New York State. Our goal was to expand our outreach to a ?land-locked? region, far from the ocean, demonstrating that marine life is being impacted indirectly by climate change and directly by ocean deoxygenation. Most of the artist participants found foraminifera inspiring both aesthetically and scientifically, as well as climate change and ocean deoxygenation worrisome.

The printmaker, who is also a university assistant professor, had 15 exhibitions (group &amp; solo) and 10 lectures, some tandem with the project?s Principal Investigator, that shared the project, through which hundreds of people were introduced to foraminifera and ocean deoxygenation resulting from climate change.
