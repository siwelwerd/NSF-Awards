 "awd_abstract_narration": "The research objective of this award is to study the structure property relationships of functional\r\ngradients created through the use of nanowires. The use of nanowires to create a functional\r\ngradient is a novel approach that has not been explored, yet could provide significantly improved\r\nperformance while maintaining the composition of each phase. A functional gradient is often\r\ncreated through the blending of ceramic or precursor materials at the interface which is difficult\r\nto control and can lead to inferior properties due to compositional changes resulting from\r\ndiffusion of the two phases. This issue is of principle concern in electroceramics where the\r\nproperties are strongly related to the purity of the ceramic. While the research will seek to\r\nidentify the fundamental properties of strain transfer across a nanowire interface, our efforts will\r\nbe focused by the application of the graded interface to multiferroic materials. The goal will be to\r\nproduce the highest degree of multiferroic coupling while developing a new methodology for\r\ncreating functional gradients that maintain the material's phase and connectivity across the\r\ninterface as well as producing direct measurement of the strain gradient created such that\r\nmodeling tools can be developed for the nanoscale interface.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of this this award will provide a new methodology to create a nanoscale\r\nfunctional gradient across an interface. The efforts will be directly applied to the growing field of\r\nmultiferroic materials and will focus on both basic and applied challenges to the application of\r\nmultiferroic materials and thus offers potential for a wide range of future research efforts\r\napproaching more efficient design of ME devices. The proposed techniques could be applied to a\r\nwide range of application that involve an interface between dissimilar materials including thermal\r\ninterfaces, semiconductors and composites as well as many emerging technologies that provide\r\npositive societal impact. Beyond providing an increased understanding of the mechanics across a\r\nfunctional gradient, the resear",
