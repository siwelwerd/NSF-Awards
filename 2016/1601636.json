 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bronx Community College (BCC), working with industrial, governmental, and academic partners, will develop an Associates of Applied Science degree in Chemical and BioEnergy Technology for Sustainability. This degree program will combine the disciplines of biology, chemistry, and engineering, and educate community college students for careers in the emerging bio-economy and at the interface of green chemistry and fermentation science. The project will leverage ongoing projects at BCC, such as the Center for Sustainable Energy, the Renewable Fuel and Sustainable Product Laboratory and the College Now program. College Now will allow high school students to earn college credits towards careers in this emerging field. Due to BCC's urban location in the City of New York, many of the students who have access to this project will come from traditionally underserved backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to prepare students for careers in emerging STEM fields that address the need for cleaner, renewable energy and chemicals using a biomass feedstock platform. The new degree program will educate community college students in fields associated with biomanufacturing, renewable transportation fuels, and green chemical feedstocks. This program will leverage the principal investigator's current work in Bionic Liquids (NSF I-Corp Award #1443859) and prior ATE awards made to BCC in pharmtech and chemtech (Award #0202386 and #0936994). BCC is a minority-serving institution in the City of New York that educates approximately 11,500 students annually. It is part of the 24 college City University of New York system and has significant interactions with high schools in its service area. This will allow the project to impact a sizable number of students underrepresented in the STEM fields and contribute to the economic development of the region. The program will be a model for crossing disciplinary boundaries to prepare students for STEM careers and developing students' important middle employment skills. Project evaluation will focus on the progress of the developing the program and measuring student performance indicators such enrollment, success, and retention.",

Three new courses and associated lab  experiments were developed after consultation with&nbsp; 14-member scientific advisory  committee to generate and rank a list of 110 technical skills. The committee  comprised members from academia, industry and national labs and convened in  2016, and again in 2018. The first course, Introduction to Chemical Processes, is  an introductory chemical engineering course that teaches analytical chemistry,  problem solving, and laboratory skills related to chemical processes at the industrial  scale. Students develop skills through experiments involving stirred tank reactor, and instrument calibration. Key learning outcomes  include understanding of mass and energy balances for chemical processes using data processing skills, including graphing, error analysis and linear regression. The  second course, Biofuels and Bioproducts is cross listed in the Departments of Chemical Technology and Biological Sciences to teach&nbsp; science of  producing fermentable sugars from lignocellulosic biomass and&nbsp; of  converting sugars into biofuels and bioproducts. Students gain hands-on  experience by using pressure reactors and bioreactors to synthesis, and analyse&nbsp; biologically produced molecules.  A third course, Sustainability, Energy, and the Green Economy served as an  interdisciplinary course for non-STEM majors. The course also introduced concepts of scientific entrepreneurship by  requiring students to present a life-cycle-analysis of a simple consumer product. The  results of a comparative longitudinal study between this, and three other,  introductory science courses were published in the Journal of College Science  Teaching in 2021.

The College Now course served to pilot labs and lectures&nbsp; for Introduction to  Chemical Processes. Specific learning outcomes from the course were captured via  intro- and exit surveys of student participants. Each year, upon course completion,  all college-bound seniors were assessed by the NY Regents Math Exam, and nearly  100% of students placed out of remedial college math, with approximately 65% of  students qualifying for STEM track math.

The specific goals of the workshop included basic programming in  ARC-GIS software. The  workshop trained approximately 15 students and 2 faculty, and the GIS mapping  skills learned were applied to the collection of waste cooking oil (for biodiesel  production) from neighborhoods surrounding BCC. In 2019, a summer workshop  at BCC titled Beyond the Beaker trained approximately 10 students, 3 lab  technicians, and 3 faculty in the use of pressurized and open tank chemical reactors,  and prokaryotic and eukaryotic bioreactors for biomass pretreatment and  fermentation. Students calculated the biochemical yields of various biofuels and  bioproducts using redox principals and presented their results as simple techno economic analyses of the overall biomass to biofuel process.
