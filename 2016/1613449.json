 "awd_abstract_narration": "Protons and neutrons, which make up atomic nuclei, are made up of fundamental particles known as quarks and gluons, whose interactions are described by quantum chromodynamics (QCD).  This theory suggests that many other types of composite particles, known as hadrons, should exist in Nature as unstable resonances.  The properties of excited hadronic resonances as predicted by QCD will be investigated.  Exotic particles, such as glueballs, hybrid mesons, and tetraquarks are of particular interest.  The proposed research lends support to current experiments, such as in the Hall B N* program and the GlueX experiment in Hall D at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab), which are studying such hadronic resonances.  Hadron scattering will also be investigated.  These computations rely heavily on resources provided by the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), which is supported by the NSF.  The proposed research incorporates the participation of a graduate student whose education will be enhanced not only by involvement in scientific projects at the forefront of nuclear theory, but also with high-technology training in the use of state-of-the-art parallel computing resources.  \r\n\r\nThe physics of excited hadrons will be studied using Monte Carlo estimates of path integrals involving quark and gluon fields on a space-time lattice. In addition to conventional mesons and baryons, glueballs and so-called hybrid mesons and baryons in which the valence quarks are bound by an excited gluon field will be investigated. Exotic interpolating operators, including tetraquark operators, will be used to explore the nature of the excited states in quantum chromodynamics.  Pion-pion, kaon-pion, and nucleon-pion scattering phase shifts will be computed and used to determine the decay widths of various resonances, such as the rho meson and the Roper and Lambda(1405) resonances.  A new methodology for dealing with multi-hadron operators, known as the stochastic LapH method, will be used for these calculations. The newly discovered XYZ mesons, whose constituents are believed to consist of a heavy quark and antiquark plus a light quark and antiquark, will be studied using both conventional lattice QCD techniques and using a Born-Oppenheimer treatment.",

This theory suggests that many other types of  composite particles, known as hadrons, should exist in Nature as unstable  resonances. Good progress towards understanding the properties of excited  hadronic resonances as predicted by QCD was achieved.  A study of the so-called  scalar glueball, a hypothesized particle consisting mainly of gluons, was accomplished and was the first study involving the mixing of a glueball operator with mesons and meson-meson operators.  The role of exotic tetraquark operators  involving two quarks and two antiquarks was investigated in two low-lying symmetry sectors.  Several hundred tetraquark operators were utilized, and a handful were found to create additional states never obtained before.  The time-like pion form factor was calculated from first principles.  This is an important quantity  for understanding pion interactions and for leading to future computations of the form factors for other important hadrons, such as the Delta resonance which will  be crucial to accelerated-based neutrino experiments, such as the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The decay width of the K*(872) was calculated, and  first steps towards understanding the K0*(700) resonance were taken.  The energies of gluons and quarks in the presence of a static quark-antiquark pair were studied, and the first observation of QCD string breaking involving several meson pairs was achieved.  This calculation paves the way for future studies of hadrons known as XYZ resonances using a Born-Oppenheimer approach similar to that used in atoms and molecules.  This research lends support to  current experiments, such as in the Hall B N* program and the GlueX experiment  in Hall D at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab), which  are studying such hadronic resonances.\n\nOne of the most reliable means of investigating such systems is using computer  simulations with quark and gluon fields defined on a space-time lattice.  In  the past, such calculations have been done with  unrealistically-large quark  masses due to computational limitations.  Current calculations have reduced  the quark masses to nearly their physical values, causing the need to  incorporate multi-hadron operators into the computations to become crucial.   A new methodology for dealing with multi-hadron operators, known as the  stochastic LapH method, was developed and shown to work well in achieving  reliable estimates of the energies of a variety of hadronic systems.  These  computations relied heavily on resources provided by the Extreme Science and  Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE), which is supported by the NSF.
