 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nMetallic glasses were discovered over one-half of a century ago.  It was immediately clear that these are fascinating novel materials.  They have led to new insights into the reasons for glass formation and the processes by which a liquid turns into a glass upon cooling.  Additionally, sustained research has shown that they have superior properties that make them of potential technological interest.   These include strengths greater than those of steels, high hardness and good corrosion resistance.  However, the first glasses required that the liquid be cooled at rates approaching one million degrees per second, limiting their practical applications.   About 20 years ago new families of metallic glasses (?Bulk Metallic Glasses,? or BMGs) were discovered, which could be formed and processed in ways similar to those used for more common glasses. This caused an intense resurgence of research that now appears to be moving metallic glasses from the laboratory into the market place.   To sustain this fast paced fundamental and technological research, frequent conferences and workshops are needed for scientists and engineers to present new results and exchange ideas.   Because of the intense activity of this field in Asia, almost all of the meetings of the BMG conference series, the central conference for bulk metallic glasses, have taken place there.    The only one held outside of Asia was BMG IV, held in 2005 in the United States.   Travel expenses and limited research funds has limited the participation of US scientists, post-docs and students in these conferences.   The support provided for BMG XI, which is to be held from June 5 ? 9, 2016 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, will enable broader participation of US students and young researchers.   \r\n\r\n\r\n&#8195;\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nMetallic glasses, first discovered in 1960, remained primarily a laboratory curiosity for most of the time between 1960 and 1990.   The extremely high cooling rates required for the liquid to form a glass (105 oC to 106 oC) limited their usefulness.  In spite of this, a few applications did emerge during this time.   Their combination of high electrical resistivity, low susceptibility and low magnetic coercivity, for example, led to their use as core materials for high-quality electrical transformers.  In the 1990s, new families of metallic glasses (?Bulk Metallic Glasses,? or BMGs) were discovered that formed at much lower cooling rates and could be processed under conditions similar to those used for silicate glasses.  This led to an intense research activity, now resulting in the emergence of metallic glasses as potentially very important new technological materials.   Because the research activity is particularly intense in Asia, almost all of the meetings in the BMG conference series (the central conference for bulk metallic glasses) have taken place there.   The last BMG meeting outside of Asia was held in the US in 2005 (BMG IV).   The increasingly limited research funding and significant travel expenses have resulted in small US participation in these conferences, particularly among young US researchers and students.  To maintain a vibrant research activity, it is critical that researchers meet frequently to exchange ideas and present new results.   The lack of significant US participation in this series, particularly among our future scientific leadership, hampers US advancements in this important field.  To address this, BMG XI will be held from June 5 ? 9, 2016 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.   Many outstanding issues of basic and practical importance will be discussed, including glass design, stability and relaxation, structure, dynamics, properties, and applications.  For the first time, panels will discuss establishing testing standards and explore new manufacturing possibilities that take full advantage of the unique properties of metallic glasses.  Two keynote, 10 plenary, 22 invited and 58 contributed oral presentations are scheduled, along with 28 poster presentations.   To encourage greater participation among US graduate student and young faculty, funds will be used to provide travel and/or registration assistance.   By hosting BMG XI in the US, we are increasing the US participation, which will allow US researchers to be exposed to cutting edge ideas and results, and provide new opportunities for interaction and collaborations.",

It was organized by Profs. Kenneth Kelton and Katharine Flores (Washington University in St. Louis) and T. G. Nieh (University of Tennessee/Knoxville).   \n\nMetallic Glasses\n\nMetallic glasses were first discovered in 1960 and at first were considered a laboratory curiosity.  Investigations showed, however, that many of their properties were superior to those of their crystalline counterparts, suggesting that they might have technological importance. While some applications were realized, their broader application was limited because of the very rapid cooling rates needed to produce the glasses.

Metallic glass research is currently very active in Asia, particularly China.  Reflecting this nine of the past ten BMG meetings have been held in Asia.  Only one BMG meeting (in 2005) has been held in the US.  Travel expenses and increasingly limited research funds have prevented significant participation of US scientists and students in these meetings.   This has had a negative effect on US research in metallic glasses, weakening the interactions between US scientists and those researchers in Asia.\n\nBMG XI in St. Louis, Missouri\n\n Holding BMG XI in June, 2017 on the campus of Washington University in St. Louis was meant to address this concern.  It gave scientists and students an opportunity to present their results, learn of key results from international research groups and meet and discuss their work with the leaders in the field of metallic glasses. BMG XI attracted a total of 110 participants from 12 countries, with most of the participants (almost 60%) coming from the US.   This is stark contrast with the much smaller US participation in the previous BMG meetings that were held in Asia.  Almost 30% of the participants (32) were students, with the largest number coming from the US.   This was one of the most important outcomes of this conference series, since limited research funds have particularly prevented significant student participation in this important conference series.    Recognizing the importance of student participation, the majority of the NSF funds were used to provide travel support for students in US universities.  Twenty students received $300 of travel support.  That and the reduced registration costs were important factors in enabling a large student participation.\n\nThe conference covered many important topics in metallic glasses, including glass formation and design, stability and relaxation, structure, dynamics and properties, applications and manufacturing.  There were a total of 75 oral presentations, composed of two keynote speakers, ten plenary speakers, 20 invited speakers and 42 selected presentations.  There were 18 poster presentations, primarily given by graduate students.   Student prizes were given to the top three poster presentations.  New to this conference series were round-table discussions.  These were held during lunch on two days of the conference and focused on \"Glass Design\" and \"Testing Standards,\" which are topics that are essential for movement of metallic glasses into industrial applications.   They were led by representatives from academics, research laboratories, and industry. \n\nImpact of NSF Funds for the Support of BMG XI\n\n The support given by the NSF to BMG XI helped to make it a very successful conference, which had high intellectual merit and a very broad impact.  \n\nIntellectual Merit - Holding BMG XI in St. Louis gave US researchers the opportunity for scientists and students to interact with leaders in the field of metallic glass.\n\nBroader Impact &ndash; Limited travel assistance and a decreased registration fee were provided for graduate students in US institutions to give the opportunity for this group of future research leaders to interact and exchange ideas with leading international experts in the field and open possibilities for future employment. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/09/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kenneth F Kelton"
