 "awd_abstract_narration": "Promising undergraduate students from two- and four-year institutions within the City University of New York (CUNY) system will have the opportunity to work with scientists and engineers while they conduct research in the area of Satellite and Ground-Based Remote Sensing. Remote Sensing is a critically important, unique, and young area of science, and it is relatively unknown to many of the undergraduate students in the CUNY system. The activities combine year-long (Summer/Fall/Spring) research experiences with multidimensional mentoring, academic support systems, and a robust learning community that will produce holistic and engaging stimuli for the scientific and academic growth and development of the student participants.  This REU site will allow the students to transfer learning from sciences and mathematics to technology, computer systems and engineering applications where fundamental principles learned in particular natural sciences and mathematics courses are applied to real-world problems. The targeted student population of this REU site is primarily underrepresented minorities in STEM, and thus these activities have the potential to broaden participation and create a more diverse remote sensing community. The activities will also allow the undergraduate researchers the opportunity to hone their acquired skills and knowledge by presenting to high school students in the New York City Public school system.\r\n\r\nThis REU site has the following primary objectives: 1) To engage a diverse cohort of undergraduates in collaborative, state-of-the-art satellite and ground based remote sensing research, 2) to create and sustain a community and pipeline of scholars in STEM, 3) to enable students with the tools and confidence to succeed in an authentic research environment, and 4) to train students in the ethical and responsible conduct of research.  Students will participate in mini courses in GIS, remote sensing, and MATLAB.  Of particular merit for this REU site is the inclusion of 3 students from community college, who receive additional mentoring and support through a multi-tiered mentoring structure.  REU participants will receive professional development on a host of topics including ethics, communication, applying to graduate school and resume development.",
