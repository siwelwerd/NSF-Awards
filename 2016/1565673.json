 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms of the Chemistry division.  The project investigates the properties of charged organic molecules (organic ions) on metal surfaces.  The fundamental studies performed in the group of Professor B.J Hinch at Rutgers University, are aimed at understanding how ionic molecules can be strongly bound to metal surfaces, and  yet also display high mobilities on the surfaces.  Understanding mechanisms behind the motion of molecules along surfaces is of significance to lubrication processes, as well as to the formation of ordered molecular films that can be employed in molecular electronic devices. International and interdisciplinary collaborations are also underway to develop respectively theoretical understanding and electronic characterization of the interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe program realizes ionically-bound planar aromatic chemisorbates, on electronically significant Cu, Ag and Au surfaces, through exposures of volatile non-aromatic molecular precursors. Thermal stability and hydrogenation processes are studied with temperature programmed desorption. Diffusivities, mutual interaction strengths, correlations of dynamic motion, lateral ordering, are explored with helium atom scattering. DFT calculations performed in collaboration with Prof. Steve Jenkins, (Cambridge, UK.) elucidate the potential energy surfaces of the mobile species and anticipated electronic structure. Valence shell and core level spectra studies are undertaken in collaboration with Prof. Robert Bartynski, (Physics Dept., Rutgers University.) A new ionizer design for time-of-flight He energy analysis is being developed. This technology has applications in all time-resolved mass spectroscopies.  The experiment design, measurements, local and international collaborative projects, and instrumental development present challenging training experiences at all levels of study. Broader outreach programs include involvement of high school students in applications of new instrumentation, and development of future collaborative projects with emerging academic research programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith increasing commercial utilization of molecular electronics, and interest in supported molecular thin films, this project has concentrated on the study of archetypical small hydrocarbon molecules absorbed on relatively inert (copper) metallic crystalline faces.  The studies have been motivated by a need to understand surface diffusion mechanisms and assembly of molecular adsorbate films.\n\nCyclooctatetraene (COT, C8H8) is a cyclic and buckled molecule in the gas phase.  It has been found to adsorb non-dissociatively on copper faces.  Density Functional Calculations (DFT) have suggested that an adsorbed species lies parallel to the surface plane and is no longer buckled.  Molecular planarity is associated with a charged anionic state.  Thermally induced desorption rates well above room temperature are fully consistent with a chemisorbed species and ionic contributions to surface binding.  He atom scattering has displayed diffraction patterns suggesting molecular densities consistent with a predicted planar adsorption geometry.\n\nThe surface to molecular charge transfer with local dipole moment, leads to mutually repulsive adsorbate interactions driving hexagonal packing within dense sub-monolayer COT films.  Even on the 4-fold symmetric Cu(001) substrate, He diffraction exhibits well-ordered rotating coincident quasi-hexagonal COT phases at coverages just below 0.12 monolayer (ML).  These superstructure phases are oriented by the substrate, necessarily form 4 geometrically equivalent domains, and are coincident with the substrate in a high symmetry, say y = [110] direction.  Two lattice vectors b1 and b2 define the Bravais lattice.  The observed overlayer structures are symmetry equivalents to one approximately with b1 = (x1 , 1) and b2 = (x3 , 3), with 0.5 &lt; x3 &lt; 0.7 and x1 ~ 3.  The y direction coordinates are all integral numbers (implying coincidence within the domain.)\n\nThe observed set of structures are not those to minimize mutually repulsive interaction energies in coincident phases.  We have shown that that would occur if the ratio x1/x3 remains constant at 5.  Instead, the observed phases arise from the competition of minimizing intermolecular potential energies and substrate-molecular interaction energies.  The immediate conclusion is that positions withing the coincident molecular overlayer are further adjusted (or modulated) along an x direction by interaction with the substrate.  DFT calculations of the model b1 = (3 , 1) and b2 = (0.5 , 3) superstructure suggest the extent of modulation is extensive, namely all molecules will sit near inequivalent hollow sites.  The apparent locking in of x1 ~ 3 is perhaps related to further modulation/relaxation of the overlayer.  If all molecules are located near hollow sites, and if and only if x1 is integral, then stress can be relieved readily though small y direction relaxations at the edges of all the densest domain wall structures.\n\nAt lower densities the adsorbates move relatively independently and explore extensively the molecule substrate potential.  In collaborative studies with the Dept. of Physics, Cambridge University, UK, group of Dr. John Ellis we have studied the aperiodic diffusive motion of molecular COT on Cu(111).  The experiments measure directly a decay in 3He spin echo atom intensities with increasing time differential of spin polarized scattering components.  This information, measured at different scattering angles, yields scattering angle dependent quasi-elastic line broadening signatures.  For the first time observations have indicated a combination of distinct diffusive motion signatures.  Both jump-like (with Lorentzian line shapes) and ballistic diffusive motion (with Gaussian line shapes) were indicated simultaneously; the former with an activation energy of ~ 40meV, and the latter of a freely moving particle with effective mass of a single COT molecule.  Incidentally, the DFT results predicts neither of these motions.  The DFT does however suggest that COT diffusion be correlated to substrate relaxation effects.  We report that molecular dynamic calculations, utilizing realistic molecular adsorbate interaction forces, have failed to reproduce the molecular motion leading to the observed two component line shape intensities.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/13/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Barbara J Hinch"
