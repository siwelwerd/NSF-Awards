 "awd_abstract_narration": "Plants and insects are groups with large numbers of species that have big impacts on both natural and agricultural systems. One reason these groups are thought to be so diverse is because of their interactions with one another. Evolutionary change in plants can impact evolutionary change in insects, and this is likely one mechanism by which new species are formed, a central question in evolutionary biology research. These reciprocal evolutionary responses might be caused by two different types of interactions between plants and insects. One type of interaction, termed mutualism, is mutually beneficial to both species. For example, insect pollinators move pollen among plants as they gather food, and both the plants and insects benefit from this type of interaction. A second type of interaction is antagonism, where one species benefits at the cost of the other.  Insects use of plants as food is an example of antagonism that has led to the evolution of toxic plant chemicals, many of which are used in medical applications. One major unanswered question is whether the diversity of plants and insects observed in nature is mainly the result of mutualistic or antagonistic interactions. Understanding the relative roles of each is critical for predicting how plant and insects will respond to each other through time and will help guide strategies for increasing pollination services provided by insects and reducing the impact of insect pests. In addition, the research will be used in creating a workshop for middle school students through hands-on experiments examining the importance of plant-insect interactions in natural and agricultural settings. \r\n\r\nThe research will use a textbook example of coevolution and adaptive radiation to test the relative roles of mutualistic and antagonistic coevolution in generating reproductive isolation and speciation. The obligate specialized interaction between yuccas and their yucca moth pollinators has both mutualistic and antagonistic components. Female moths use specialized tentacular mouthparts to collect pollen and actively pollinate yuccas, and then deposit eggs near developing yucca seeds that their larvae eat. The evolution of tentacles has been suggested to be a key innovation in the mutualism and diversification of pollinator moths. Although previous research has highlighted trait divergence in antagonistic traits, there has been no comparative survey of trait divergence in the key mutualistic trait, moth tentacles, or of pollination behavior. Comparative analyses of mutualistic and antagonistic traits will be combined with tests of performance of pollinators on natal vs. non-natal yucca species. Specifically, we will compare the ability of moths to be effective pollinators and herbivores across many yucca species. These analyses will be combined with the examination of mating abilities among host forms of the only generalist moth pollinator species to test if changes in mutualistic or antagonistic traits are instrumental in promoting the formation of reproductive isolation. The project will be the first direct test of how coevolution and the type of species interaction among interacting lineages translates into reproductive isolation and species diversification linking microevolutionary processes with macroevolutionary patterns.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project tested the relative importance of antagonistic interactions in which one species gains a benefit while the other a cost, versus mutualistic interactions in which both species have net benefits from interacting.  Mutualistic interactions have long been assumed to promote specialization and the formation of new species in comparison to antagonistic interactions.  We examined the evolution of traits in a textbook example of a highly specialized pollination mutualism between yucca plants and their pollinator moths that includes over 15 species of moths and 25 species of yuccas.  Most of the moths only use one or two species of yuccas, except for one species that is a generalist and can use up to 8 different species.  Embedded in this interaction is a mutualistic side in which moths pollinate plants will unique mouthparts and an antagonistic side in which female moths lay eggs into the flowers they pollinate and the caterpillars feed on a small portion of the yucca seeds.  Both plants and moths gain a benefit, but the plant loses some seeds.  The plants can prevent over exploitation by the moths by aborting flowers that have many eggs in them, but moths are under selection to produce as many offspring as possible.  Our tests revealed that the rate of change across moth species in egg-laying structures was almost five times faster than the unique mouthparts that the moths use to actively place pollen on the receptive part of the flower. In addition, moths were able to pollinate any yucca species they were tested on, but the caterpillars could only develop in their normal host species.  This was true for the generalist moth species as well even though the yucca species were used by other populations in different parts of its range.  The results provide experimental evidence that antagonistic interactions may be more likely to generate specialization and that plant defenses such as abscission of flowers and changes in plant chemistry may exert strong selection on moths to change over time. As part of this project we also developed an Insect-Plant Interactions module for 7thand 8thgrade students that includes four activities introducing them to insect diversity, how insects feed on plants, the role of plant chemical defenses in our food, and allows them to use real-life data generated by the project to test hypotheses about changes in moth structures. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/26/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David M Althoff"
