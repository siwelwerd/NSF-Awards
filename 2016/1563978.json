 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will inaugurate a CyberCorps\u00ae: Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at the Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico (PUPR), the second largest Hispanic Higher Education Institution in the USA, serving around 5,000 students in the areas of Engineering, Computer Science, Architecture, and Business Administration. Since its inception, the Institution has graduated approximately 6,000 Hispanic engineers and surveyors. The main goals of the proposed project are: 1) Successfully implement an SFS graduate program to increase research and improve education in technology areas relevant to cybersecurity; 2) Engage students in professional activities such as internships, workshops, outreach, and other SFS-sponsored activities. 3) Increase the number of qualified students entering the fields of information assurance and cyber security to protect and defend the cyberspace. Students will be selected from private and public universities from Puerto Rico and the selected scholars will participate in meaningful summer internships.\r\n\r\nThe project intends to provide life-changing cybersecurity education to the selected students and to help them lunch life-long cybersecurity professional careers. The project will continue previous efforts to substantially increase the number of women and minorities prepared for graduate studies and careers in Cybersecurity; and will help to alleviate the nationwide shortage of qualified professionals in these areas. Students will be involved in research projects, teamwork and professional development. Research results and thesis of SFS scholars will be disseminated in Cybersecurity journals and conferences, and will also be available through the PUPR web page.",

This increased the number of qualified students entering the fields of information assurance and cyber security to protect and defend the cyberspace. PUPR is committed to developing outstanding cybersecurity graduates and motivating them for careers in the Federal cybersecurity workforce. This increased research and improved education in related technology areas. We also engaged these students in professional activities such as internships workshop development, outreach, and synergistic interactions through various activities in cybersecurity, including homeland defense related initiatives within the university that enriched their academic experience, such as boot camps, job fairs, symposiums, and other SFS sponsored activities.</p>\n<p><em>Internships</em> were required for each Scholar for their professional development by enhancing the \"softer skills\" required to become a successful employee, such as networking, effective communication, setting priorities and time management. Internships provided our Scholars with the skills to obtain better jobs and helped them to develop job-search skills. PUPR NSF-SFS students were very successful in finding Internships in National Labs and Executive Branches of the US Government. Some of the Scholars that worked in <em>Summer Internships</em> landed full-time jobs with the same Agencies as is the case with students that worked in John Hopkins Lab, Navy, Air Force, among others. Other excellent internship experiences were with: DHS, Norfolk State University, Los Alamos National Labs, NavSea, NSA, Air Force Labs, John Hopkins Labs, Harris Corporation, RUE at Florida International University, State of Iowa (Office of the CIO Security Division (OCIO-ISD), University of New Mexico alongside Los Alamos National Labs, Minnesota IT Department, JPL California, Summer research work at PUPR approved by OPM and NSF. Many PUPR NSF-SFS students already had job offerings before they graduated.</p>\n<p>Every year, students attended the NSF-SFS Annual Job Fair with PI and Co-PI, and other job fairs such as yearly CAE Community, and PUPR Job Fairs. PUPR also has a Career and Internship Office that helped students seek Internships and Jobs, as well as the OPM. NSF-SFS students attended diversity conferences every year; some have job fairs as part of the activities, such as Tapia, SACNAS, WiCyS, Grace Hopper, and CASHI. The Polytechnic University of Puerto Rico <em>SFS placed 79% of SFS graduates at executive branches and 21% in non-executive federal agency</em>; state, local or tribal government organization; National Laboratories; or Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs).</p>\n<p><em>Annual Cybersecurity Conferences</em> were held every year at PUPR supported by the NSF-SFS grant. More than 300 persons attended each year, including cybersecurity professionals, faculty, students, FBI, DHS, NSA, among others. Faculty and NSF Scholars actively participated in the logistics and presentation of topics in cybersecurity. Some recognized feature speakers at the National level were invited.</p>\n<p>Students have been very successful in <em>publishing their research work </em>at refereed conferences during the five-year period of the grant. In year 2021 the NSF Scholars published close to10 papers and presented their work on: IoT, UAV?s, Machine Learning, Cryptography, AI, Genetic Algorithms, among others.</p>\n<p>Other <em>outreach activities</em> included the development of a student organization named CyberCastors that was organized by NSF-SFS students. They met with undergraduate and graduate students interested in the Scholarship and activities related to cybersecurity including participation in CTF?s and cybersecurity workshops. More than 100 students attend the meeting regularly.&nbsp;NSF-SFS students have participated in NCL CTF competitions, Cyberfire, and developed/sponsored their own CTF?s at PUPR. In the NCL. PUPR?s team was in the top 10. In the CTF Cyberfire competition sponsored by Lawrence Livermore National Lab, and the Alamos National Lab, PUPR?s team came in first place, from more than 100 participating teams at the National level. PUPR has also participated in CCDC/CFC competitions in Albuquerque/Oak Ridge/Chicago. The impact this program is having on minorities is astounding.</p>\n<p>As a Hispanic Serving Institution, we are proud to know that are students are landing jobs in the Federal Government that will provide them with excellent careers. They are very enthusiastic at achieving their goals as students, professionals, and as part of the workforce. The outreach activities are complementing their education with life changing experiences by expanding their networking experiences and knowledge capabilities way beyond the curriculum. Outcomes were evaluated periodically using the Program Evaluation Plan that consisted of both internal and external evaluations (with an experienced external evaluator). This assures formative and summative evaluations were consistent with the expected outcomes of the program, and countermeasures were taken if required, in a timely manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;
