One goal will be, as a way to honor the memory of Hidehiko Yamabe, to advance areas of mathematics related to his interests, which touched in a substantial and ground-breaking way on several quite different areas of mathematics, all of which may be roughly described as having significant geometric aspects. At the same time, it will provide a valuable opportunity for graduate students and junior researchers to interact with, and learn from, mathematicians working at the highest international level. Finally, a long-lasting benefit will be the stimulation of innovative developments in mathematics research.\r\n\r\nThis year is the eighth anniversary of the Yamabe program, on the theme of \"Symplectic Geometry and Complex Geometry.\" Eight experts in this area will be invited to speak. It will be a high-level conference on aspects of symplectic geometry, complex geometry, contact structures and the interactions between these and related areas. The purpose of this Symposium is to bring to our participants deeper understanding of some recent discoveries in those areas, and to bring to the fore new issues that have arisen in light of them. The new understanding will encourage participants to gain a wider perspective of the recently found deep connections between symplectic and complex geometry. Potentially, this knowledge will inspire further discoveries in these and related fields.\r\nDetails of the Yamabe Symposium are at http://www.math.umn.edu/yamabe/.",
