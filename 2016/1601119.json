 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Pacific Islands are an exceptional natural laboratory, with highly diverse and unique coral reef and terrestrial ecosystems that are already under elevated levels of stress and degradation due to the effects of changing global environmental conditions, development pressures, and the effects of overfishing and coastal pollution. The future of the Islands and their populations depends on the technical skills and knowledge available to local resource managers, policy makers and stakeholders. This project will provide critical access to accurate and adequate technical information to strengthen the capacity of the local institutions of higher education. Input from local agencies, businesses and stakeholders have identified key technological skills needed by community college graduates to fill positions within the governments, NGO community and private sector.  These students will develop strong STEM-related skills to enter the U.S. Mainland workforce in technology related fields and to successfully pursue 4-year and graduate degrees.\r\n\r\nThis project will enhance marine and environmental science education at the five minority-serving community colleges of the Pacific Islands:  American Samoa Community College, the College of Micronesia - FSM, the College of the Marshall Islands, Northern Marianas College, and Palau Community College.  The project will support relevant curriculum development, the professional development of the college faculty, internships and field experiences for students, and strengthen the scientific infrastructure of the participating institutions. The focus will be on island ecosystems and climate science, and activities will include advanced training for faculty to modernize their courses, expanded use of new tools and technologies, and support for student internships and research experiences.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The NSF-ATE program, \"Partnership for Advanced Marine and Environmental Science Training for Pacific Islanders,\" was centered in the following five institutions of higher education: American Samoa Community College (ASCC), College of the Marshall Islands (CMI), College of Micronesia - Federated States of Micronesia (COM-FSM), Northern Marianas College (NMC), and Palau Community College (PCC). This ATE program commenced in 2016 and although it ended in 2019, the project was awarded an international training and education opportunity in Germany. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the i-ATE funding was carried over until 2022. The ATE program met the specific goal of training under-represented minorities in the sciences and technology fields and enhancing the workforce through their attainment of STEM positions and careers in the Pacific region and elsewhere. At the start of the program, less than 50 students were enrolled in the marine/environmental science courses. After three years of investing in training, providing advanced equipment, and field opportunities for students and faculty, the number of students enrolled increased by 86%.</p>\n<p>Our established partnerships were foundational to the success of this program and encompass all sectors, regionally, nationally, and internationally. The 30 partners provided internships and research experiences for over 150 students, and worked with our faculty to modernize their courses, added additional technical skills relevant to workforce needs, and expanded access to modern technological tools. Many of them, such as NOAA's National Marine Sanctuary in American Samoa, Marshall Islands Conservation Society, Marine &amp; Environmental Research Institute of Pohnpei, Bureau of Environmental Water Quality in Saipan, and Palau International Coral Reef Center, hired students directly upon their graduation. After three years with the ATE program, 75% of PCC students were directly hired by marine/environmental science agencies and organizations upon graduation and, at ASCC, 74% of their student graduates are now enrolled at 4-year institutions in STEM fields. Our data demonstrate that our students are entering the STEM workforce as a direct result of the opportunities afforded by the ATE program. The footlocker workshops provided valuable training, hands-on experiences, and access to advanced technologies. Students and faculty are now equipped with a variety of ocean-water quality sensors, underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs), and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) to supplement their curricula and research programs. The scientific rigor learned in their internships and research experiences have helped the students succeed in their 2-year institutions and prepared them for academic achievement in pursuing their 4-year degrees and/or STEM careers.</p>\n<p>Our students' personal stories of connectedness to their culture, family, and environment are what typically drive them to marine/environmental science careers. Their desire to make an impact has been further supported by the opportunities provided by this ATE program. The support mechanisms within the program have strengthened the students academically and technologically, making them competitive in their career pursuits. We are seeing change across the region where former students are occupying leadership roles in research, management, health, fisheries and policy-oriented positions, environmental programs that were often filled by expats, serving as role models for future cohorts. The ATE program has been foundational in these achievements and helping the region?s leaders and stakeholders in meet the mounting challenges including climate change, natural/cultural resource sustainability and food security.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/30/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robert&nbsp;H&nbsp;Richmond</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1601119/1601119_10429807_1680203470505_NSFATE1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1601119/1601119_10429807_1680203470505_NSFATE1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Field surveys\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1601119/1601119_10429807_1680203470505_NSFATE1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Field surveys\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Robert Richmond, Director of the Kewalo Marine Laboratory at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, is the Principal Investigator of the ATE program.
