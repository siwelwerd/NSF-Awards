 "awd_abstract_narration": "The study of networks is important in numerous scientific domains: neuroscience, microbiology, social science, and economics, to name a few.  A major challenge in these fields is to identify causal influences in the networks.  Experimentation can directly determine causal influences.  However, it can be more costly and less practical than passively recording activity in the network and inferring influences from those observations.  There are numerous methods that can identify correlations from observational data, though identifying causal relationships often requires expert knowledge or strong modeling assumptions.  There is a need for computationally efficient and statistically robust causal inference methods to extract relevant information from network time-series data to facilitate human analysis.\r\n\r\nThis research aims to significantly advance the state of the art in inferring causal influences between time-series.  The research develops new and efficient algorithms to learn and approximate the structure of a recently proposed probabilistic graphical model: the directed information graph.  The algorithms find optimal or near-optimal approximations of the network topology that have user-controlled sparsity levels, such as the number of edges in the graph or the amount of computation performed.  The quality of approximation is measured using Kullback-Leibler divergence.  The work also involves proving correctness of the algorithms and developing variations that find provably-good approximations which are robust to noisy or limited data.  To achieve these goals, the project develops new bounds for directed information.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project developed new mathematical tools to enable scientists and engineers to identify connectivity in networks.  For example, the human brain is a large organ that is made up of many brain cells connected together.  That connectivity, which cells are communicating with which other cells, is believed to be important for how the brain processes information, such as visual or auditory information.  The PI, along with graduate students and collaborators, developed methods to take time series, such as recordings of brain cells, and identify which time-series are directly affecting which other time-series.\n\nOne major component of the research was developing new algorithms to infer connectivity.  The PI and graduate students developed methods for different settings, balancing speed to run the algorithms with accuracy of the results.  A second major component of the research was investigating how to quickly detect dependencies between time series, to improve the speed of the algorithms.  Research for this second component resulted in a better theoretical understanding of how groups of time-series can interact in complex ways.\n\nThe PI collaborated with a neuroscientist and applied methods to a large data set of mouse brain recordings.  The results supported the neuroscientist's research more rigorously than standard statistical methods.  The project supported STEM training of two graduate students.  The PI also used research from this project to help design a graduate course on network science.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/28/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher J Quinn"
