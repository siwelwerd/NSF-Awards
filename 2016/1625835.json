A new electron microscope with the analytical capabilities to be included will foster research and research training in the solid Earth sciences, materials science and archaeology.  A new EMP facility at Syracuse will serve as a regional facility for microchemcial characterization of solid natural and synthetic materials in central New York State, supporting the needs of many faculty and students at over a dozen academic institutions.  This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare given the importance of electron microscopy for advancing understanding of the genesis of Earth materials and in this case in particular, supporting investigator studies of the corrosion of metallic medical implants.  Thus the research supported with this instrument immediately serves the societal interests of an aging U.S. population.   The instrument will also support the training of a next generation scientific workforce with skills in state-of-the-art methods of materials characterization. \r\n\r\nSpecific research applications that require an electron probe for determining the micron-scale distribution of trace element in minerals and synthesized materials will include studies of chemical equilibrium and diffusion and reaction kinetics in rocks and minerals with applications to the development of new geothermobarometers that promise to advance understanding of the pressure and temperature conditions at which mid and deep crustal mineral assemblages in exhumed metamorphic rocks formed, studies of magmatic processes, trace element investigations of detrital mineral phases to elucidate provenance, applied studies of the corrosion behavior of metallic medical implants, geoforensics, and archaeological investigations of artifact provenance.  \r\n\r\n***",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe grant was used to develop a regional electron microprobe user facility at Syracuse University available to academic and industry for in situ chemical analysis of small volumes of materials (http://electron-microprobe.syr.edu/).  We purchased a Cameca SXFive electron microprobe equipped with components to serve a wide range of users and materials so that it will receive widespread usage.  The NSF contribution was matched by contributions from the College of Arts and Sciences, Engineering and the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, the New York State NYSTAR Program, and collaborations with 35 regional academic and industrial partners.  The room renovations were completed in May 2017.  A two-month instrument installation, training and component upgrade was completed mid-August 2017.\n\nThe facility operates as a non-profit recharge center at Syracuse University.  The goal of the facility is to provide advanced materials characterization for a fee to users that is used to offset all operational costs.  Because the instrument can conduct non-destructive analyses on micron-sized spots with minimum detection limits in the ~10 to 30 ppm range for many elements in the periodic table, and perform scanning electron microscope imaging, the instrument has already been widely used by students and researchers from many disciplines.  During the first 15 months since commissioning the instrument, 29 academic researchers, eight industry scientists and 16 undergraduates have extensively used the instrument.  User fees are used for consumables, salary for a full-time technician, and a service contract.\n\nThe instrument has been used to analyze many types of samples from a wide range of researchers including experimental specimens produced in high-pressure and high-temperature experiments, natural geologic specimens, industrial steels, and manufactured glass specimens.  Analyses of geologic specimens are used primarily to learn how pressure and temperature affect the chemical compositions of rocks and minerals formed in the Earth.  Industrial researchers use the instrument to analyze manufactured materials with the goal of making better steels and glasses for products that are used daily by most adults in the USA.  Anyone interested in using the instrument can schedule time through the facility website listed above.  Results obtained from the electron microprobe were published in two journal articles and seven abstracts were presented at national meetings.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/25/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jay B Thomas"
