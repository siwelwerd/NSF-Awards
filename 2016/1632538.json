 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation of 20 graduate and undergraduate students enrolled at universities in the U.S. in the 17th IEEE International Conference on Mobile Data Management (MDM 2016), which will be held June 13-16, 2016 in Porto, Portugal (http://mdmconferences.org/mdm2016/). MDM is a premier conference co-sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society. It encompasses all aspects of mobility. Given the broad scope of mobility, MDM brings together researchers from databases, networking and ubiquitous and pervasive computing, to present and discuss the progress of science in these areas of critical national needs. The conference relies on the experience of senior members of the community, but also aims to generate fresh ideas, foster new collaborations, and expose new people to emerging research opportunities. Attendance at MDM is very beneficial to students. The conference makes for an excellent forum for exchange of ideas and future collaborations. Students also have opportunities to meet distinguished researchers and be inspired and mentored by them to follow careers in mobile data management research. \r\n\r\nA number of student-oriented events are planned: workshops, demos, panels, seminars, PhD forum, and a special industrial forum. The availability of the travel support will be well publicized throughout the U.S. research community. Students from underrepresented groups (women, minorities and disabled students) are especially encouraged to apply. The project has established processes for selecting the awardees that would both benefit from participating in MDM and contribute to the MDM program, especially the student-oriented activities. The MDM Conference Proceedings are published by IEEE.",
