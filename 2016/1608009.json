 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Dr. Kevin Burgess of Texas A & M University to discover small molecules that affect how some proteins bind to each other. Protein-protein interactions are important to many biological processes in cells. Thus having small molecules that can either aid or or hinder protein-protein interactions could lead to potential new drugs to help treat various diseases. The project is creating new small molecules and studying their effect on protein-protein interactions. It also combines chemical synthesis, computer-aided molecular design and data-mining training for graduate and undergraduate students to help them tackle problems in contemporary life science.  \r\n\r\nCyclic peptides are known to mimic key regions involved in protein-protein interactions, i.e. to be Protein-Protein Interface (PPI) mimics.  While cyclic pentapeptides are easy to make they tend to equilibrate between conformers.  Conversely cyclic tetrapeptides from natural amino acids are difficult to make but are more conformationally stable. Thus, easily synthesized cyclic peptides from genetically encoded amino acids linked by main-chain amides can have ring sizes of 9, 12, 15, etc. i.e. 3n atoms, (n = # amino acids) which misses ring sizes between 12 and 15 that combine conformational rigidity with ease of synthesis.  This work is showing that contrary to some earlier reports, cyclic Tetrapeptides from natural amino acids are conformationally rigid and are more synthetically accessible than previously thought. It is also showing that replacement of a genetically encoded residue with some rigid unnatural amino acids can be used to give cyclic tetrapeptides that rest at a useful crossroads between ease of synthesis and conformational rigidity.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAt the onset of this work we proposed to investigate syntheses and applications of cyclic tetrapeptides, and two very similar derivatives with respect to their conformational rigidity and similarities of those conformations with protein-protein interfaces.  We established that the most promising literature synthesis of functionalized cyclic tetrapeptides actually did not give pure products, even after collaborating with the group who originally reported the synthesis.  Instead we designed 13-membered ring derivatives, only one atom larger in the macrocycle, and found these were conveniently prepared and conformationally rigid.  These were screened against protein-protein interfaces using novel bioinformatics procedures developed in house.  Some molecules in this series were screened for binding to an important cell surface receptor, EGFR, and for the Trk receptors A &ndash; C.  This work led to some important leads for binding to Trk receptors, and some modified designed binding EFG.  Various bioinformatics studies were also performed using these cyclized peptides and other chemotypes prepared in our group, leading to the realization that secondary structure mimicry is simply an indicator of good resemblances to peptide conformations in general, including ones that cannot be classified into any one secondary structure type.  Co-workers in this project received a strong training in solution- and solid-phase syntheses, peptide chemistry, determination of conformations by NMR, molecular dynamics simulations, and manipulation of bid data as it relates to bioinformatics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/15/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin Burgess"
