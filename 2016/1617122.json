 "awd_abstract_narration": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used diagnostic tool that provides physicians with a remarkable extension to their natural vision, offering unparalleled high-definition visuals which enable soft tissue pathophysiology diagnosis, lesion delineation, and therapy monitoring without ionizing radiation.  Increasingly, physicians would like to use MRI not only for diagnosis but also for guided procedures like biopsy or tumor ablation, for greater accuracy.  However, the MR bore's geometry compels the physician to stand outside and transmit motions and forces remotely to tools operating on the patient within.  So although MR provides superior imaging, the sense of touch is absent.  To overcome this deficiency and achieve telepresence, physicians require a high-fidelity force-reflecting teleoperation system.  Added challenges are imposed by MR's intense magnetic field; ferromagnetic materials and electronics with current flow must be avoided, and even non-ferrous metals can produce imaging artifacts, which constrains the choice of actuators, transmissions, and sensors.   The PIs' goal in this project is to empower physicians to operate as if they were directly in contact with their patients, by integrating real-time 3D tissue imaging with kinesthetic and force feedback for physical interactions.  Project outcomes have the potential to directly affect a large population, because the high-fidelity force transmission developed here will be applicable to other image-guided interventions such as drug delivery and ultrasound.  The hybrid hydrostatic transmission will be applicable to (and indeed was initially conceived for) interactive human-safe robots; advances made in adapting it to MR-guided interventions will allow maturation of the technology and reductions in size and cost that will help push it into additional fields like medical robotics and bilateral teleoperation.  \r\n\r\nThis research represents a collaboration among experts in robotics, haptics and interventional radiology.  The work will build upon and extend a novel bilateral teleoperator based on hydrostatic and pneumatic elements with rolling diaphragm actuators that provides a unique combination of low inertia, passivity, high stiffness and transparency, and negligible friction and backlash, and which is ideally suited to provide kinesthetic and force feedback between a physician outside the MR bore and tools operating on a patient within, allowing physicians to feel tissue property variations, for example.  Sensitive, dexterous tasks will be realizable with a passive teleoperator if it is sufficiently stiff and light.  MR-guided interventions are a compelling application for the proposed hybrid transmission because of MR's particular constraints, which as noted above rule out many other technologies.   A key question this research addresses is how to scale the promising performance of single-axis prototypes to a complex multi-axis system able to perform MR-guided procedures.   The PIs will combine kinematic and dynamic analyses with user tests for ergonomics to ensure that it supports intuitive motions and provides transparent feedback while fitting inside the MR bore's constrained space.  They will integrate the teleoperated system's motions with MR images via compatible sensors and imaging fiducials to provide visual feedback and prevent accidental intrusion into undesirable regions while the physician focuses on tool tip interactions.  Together, the novel force-reflecting transmission, kinematic mechanism, sensors, and software constitute a cyber-human system with unprecedented capabilities.  This telepresence system will be an ideal platform to expand scientific understanding of the impact that transmission transparency provides for MR-guided interventions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "The use of diagnostic MRI in the US has quadrupled from 1996 to 2010, with over 30 million procedures performed in 2010 alone.  MRI is a safe, high-contrast, and widely available imaging technology, presently used for pre-operative imaging and procedure planning.  However, a requirement for non-magnetic materials and the inability for a clinician to be physically co-located with the patient at the moment images are captured has prevented widespread use of MRI during procedures, such as prostate/liver/breast needle biopsy or guided tumor ablation.  If a technology was available to allow the clinician to remotely perform the procedure, ideally with the preservation of haptic feedback (sense of touch), then the procedure could be completed and live images viewed concurrently, to guide the procedure.  At present, these procedures are performed blind, relying on pre-operative imaging only or performed with lower quality image guidance such as ultrasound; MRI guidance is only used in a research context and requires lengthy (and thus costly) iteration between viewing images outside the scanning room and making physical corrections at the patient.\nTo address this problem we have developed a hydrostatic remote transmission system, based on low-friction rolling diaphragm hydraulic cylinders (Fig. 1).  This provides a direct physical connection with high force-bandwidth between the clinicians fingers and a remote device, e.g. a biopsy needle.  The demonstration system is designed to allow the testing of mock prostate needle biopsy procedures, providing 3 degrees-of-freedom in needle positioning, namely needle insertion and pan/tilt angles for needle steering.  The needle is supported by a small aperture in a needle guide plate that would be pressed against the patients perineum.\nWe collected detailed performance data to validate the applicability of this system against clinical requirements in needle range-of-motion, maximum force, and necessary haptic force resolution.  Synthetic membrane puncture tests in tissue phantoms confirm the needed haptic sensitivity for detecting clinically relevant events (Fig 2.).  As a confidence test, the system was also used to remotely shave the PI with a straight razor, when operated by a professional barber (Fig. 3).  The instrumented system was not designed to be MRI compatible, but the transmission components were individually tested to confirm their safety inside an MRI scanner and near-lack of imaging distortions.  The system was evaluated by physicians at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, to acquire their feedback for the design of a future clinical tool.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/08/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John P Whitney"
