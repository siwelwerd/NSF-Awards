 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide field and laboratory based research opportunities for 2-year college (2YC) students focusing on a variety of geologic problems in the El Paso region.  The 2YC students will be mentored by University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and El Paso Community College (EPCC) faculty and undergraduate students who have had research experiences and will be trained as student mentors.  The summer experience will involve 4 weeks in El Paso followed by 4 weeks at their home institutions with intensive virtual mentoring.  The research projects will focus on how the geology and morphology of the El Paso region influence local soil development, surface and groundwater hydrology, and landscape evolution, as well as evolution of the southern Rio Grande Rift.  The project will use a model for cognitive change related to social interactions to determine which on-site activities were the most successful at increasing collaboration and the knowledge/skills base of the 2YC students.  The model will also assess the quality and degree of interaction between the 2YC participants and their faculty or student mentors. Few REU programs in geosciences specifically target 2YC students to conduct research outside of their community.  Thus this REU will serve as a model for other institutions to involve 2YC students in REU projects and the training materials developed will be helpful to other institutions wishing to recruit and retain 2YC students.",

Nearly all participants (91%) presented posters on their summer research projects at the virtual poster showcase of the American Geophysical Union, 68% presented posters in person at fall national meetings of the Geological Society of America and 18% presented in person posters at fall meetings of the American Geophysical Union. A May 2020 follow-up survey (with a 91% response rate) indicated 14 participants were currently attending a four-year institution to complete a BS degree in the geosciences, 5 had graduated from a four-year institution and one was employed full-time after obtaining a GIS certificate. Four participants had applied or intended to apply for graduate school.&nbsp; Of the 9 student mentors, all have completed or will complete a BS degree in geological sciences by spring 2021.&nbsp; Two are employed full-time and 5 are in graduate school. This program demonstrated that two-year college students who may have only had 2 classes in geological sciences prior to their arrival for the June intensive program were extremely capable of conducting and presenting high quality research. Our use of undergraduate student mentors, many of whom had also started their studies at a two year college, enhanced our ability to support and encourage the two-year participants in their research projects.&nbsp; Based on these positive outcomes we hope other 4 year institutions will be inspired to initiate similar research opportunities for 2 year college students interested in the geosciences.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/10/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Diane&nbsp;I&nbsp;Doser</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559716/1559716_10423520_1606518773328_PESS-results--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559716/1559716_10423520_1606518773328_PESS-results--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"PESS results\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559716/1559716_10423520_1606518773328_PESS-results--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"PESS results\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Average means of 20 Likert-type questions asked each week for each ROCCS cohort.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Diane Doser</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Diane&nbsp;I&nbsp;Doser</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">PESS results</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559716/1559716_10423520_1606518400292_word-cloud--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559716/1559716_10423520_1606518400292_word-cloud--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"word cloud\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1559716/1559716_10423520_1606518400292_word-cloud--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"word cloud\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Word cloud based on responses of 2018 cohort</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Diane Doser</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Diane&nbsp;I&nbsp;Doser</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">word cloud</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
