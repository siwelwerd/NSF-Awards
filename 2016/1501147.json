 "awd_abstract_narration": "Through its project, Engineered for Success: Engineering Technician Training for Rural Arizona, Yavapai College (YC) will implement enhancements to its Applied Pre-engineering Program to increase capacity, improve student learning, and respond to industry's need for highly-skilled engineering technicians. As indicated by the project title, the focus will be on improving opportunities for students in rural Arizona communities.  A new pathway leading to certification as an Integrated Systems Engineering Technician will be incorporated into an existing Applied Pre-engineering Program. The new pathway will help students gain a deeper understanding of complex systems and how they are connected and work together. The introduction of problem-based learning (PBL) pedagogy will help students connect diverse knowledge from multiple courses to solve real-world challenges.  New internship opportunities will give students exposure to the actual work environment. Nine stackable industry-recognized credentials, three certificates and two Associates Degrees will give students options for employment in middle skills jobs or additional postsecondary education.  Outreach events targeting rural high school students will be expanded and a summer Robotics Camp for middle school girls will be instituted with the aim of increasing enrollment of female students in the program. A marketing campaign will improve parents', teachers' and students' access to information about science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) careers and training programs. The improved Applied Pre-engineering Program, which will include an early college program for high school students, will incorporate best practice student support strategies, such as on-site tutoring and expanded access to applied learning using modern equipment.  The actions to be undertaken in this project were determined as a result of a preliminary assessment of the YC Applied Pre-engineering Program that was developed and implemented based upon the STEM Pathways Guide, which was developed by Science Foundation Arizona (SFAz).\r\n\r\nThe overarching goals of the Engineered for Success: Engineering Technician Training for Rural Arizona project are to: 1) produce more qualified engineering technicians to meet workforce demands, and 2) improve engineering technician education.  Strategies for accomplishing these broad goals include, but are not limited to, assuring technician training meets industry needs by engaging an Industry Advisory Council, increasing enrollment and course capacity, raising awareness and interest through targeted outreach efforts, and improving teaching to more strongly demonstrate relevance and practical industry applications.  Attainment of anticipated outcomes will be assessed using institutional data to measure quantitative impacts of the project (e.g. enrollment, degrees/certificates completed, demographic changes, etc.) and surveys to gauge  qualitative impacts (e.g. changes in teaching practices, student attitudes/perceptions).  As a member of Science Foundation Arizona's STEM Pathways Network, YC will seek to demonstrate the applicability of and expand knowledge about the organization's STEM Pathways Model through this project.",

We have brought the discussion back around again, and it looks like there is enough momentum to make that change going forward.  We have already ordered our first robotic welding machines to help in this process. \n\nBy stepping aside and letting industry make the decision on how the program needed to look, we learned a lot about not only how they feel about each other's areas, but how territorial they can be with their areas.
