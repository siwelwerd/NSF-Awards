 "awd_abstract_narration": "Color perception is a primary aspect of visual experience for most people. This research project aims to resolve an apparent contradiction in human color perception. When a human observer is asked to detect a colored target that is barely visible, the visual system sums color signals across space to achieve maximum sensitivity to the weak stimulus. However, when one views a highly-colored scene, the visual system takes the difference between color signals at different locations, leading to color appearance that is highly dependent on contrasts in color. The apparent contradiction between adding and subtracting can be resolved by the hypothesis that color perception adds color signals at threshold, when they are barely visible, but subtracts color signals when color stimuli are well above threshold. This research tests this hypothesis by studying how color perception depends on the pattern of the color in space. Spacing has different effects on color perception if the visual system is adding or subtracting color signals. Better understanding of how the visual system processes color may translate to advances in fields such as lighting design or color graphics. The project involves training of young scientists in methods of studying human vision through measuring behavior and brain activity, as well as science outreach to public school students.\r\n\r\nThe experiments will measure the spatial pattern dependence of suprathreshold color perception in humans and compare suprathreshold results with those at color threshold. Two different techniques for studying suprathreshold color perception are used: hue and saturation scaling, and reaction times. The project also includes measurements of the human cVEP (color-Visual Evoked Potential, an EEG measure of color responses in early visual cortex) and its dependence on spatial stimulus variables at different levels of color contrast. The aim of the cVEP experiments is to determine the cortical mechanisms that are the basis of color perception near threshold and suprathreshold. A computational model will be used to fit the psychophysics and cVEP data.",
