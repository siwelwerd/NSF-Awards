 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate change has altered the distributions of many species around the world, although the extent of its future effects on organisms and human society remains uncertain. This project will use computer modeling to calculate how climate change is likely to affect two plant species. Kuta (Eleocharis sphacelata), a native rush used for M\u00e2ori weaving, and k\u00fbmarahou (Pomaderris kumeraho), an endemic shrub used in M\u00e2ori traditional medicine, are critical to M\u00e2ori culture and the function of New Zealand ecosystems. The project will create maps of where these species are currently located, simulate how the locations of these species will be affected by climate change, and develop management recommendations in collaboration with M\u00e2ori groups and conservation organizations. Project outcomes will also advance understanding of similar cultures and ecosystems across the Pacific, particularly in the researcher's home institution, Hawai'i. The researcher will be collaborating with Dr. Priscilla Wehi, an ecologist and conservation biologist at Landcare Research Dunedin. Dr Wehi's expertise in Maori culture and New Zealand native species will be integral to the success of this project. \r\n\r\nThis project will use species distribution modeling to contribute to conservation of New Zealand's biocultural diversity under conditions of climate change. The researcher will use Environmental Niche Models to estimate the fundamental niche of kuta (Eleocharis sphacelata), a native rush used for M\u00e2ori weaving, and k\u00fbmarahou (Pomaderris kumeraho), an endemic shrub used in M\u00e2ori traditional medicine. These species niches will be used to project the fundamental climatic envelope of these two species using future climate scenarios for New Zealand. Culturally informed management recommendations will then be developed in collaboration with M\u00e2ori groups and conservation organizations. This project will advance biocultural conservation across the Pacific where floras, colonization histories and climate threats experienced by many indigenous peoples are strongly related. The similarities of New Zealand and the researchers home institution, Hawai'i, are particularly strong, providing significant opportunities for future collaboration. The host researcher, Dr. Priscilla Wehi, is an ecologist and conservation biologist at Landcare Research Dunedin. Dr Wehi's expertise in Maori culture and New Zealand native species will be integral to the success of this project. \r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea.",

This project predicts the future of climate change to find new ways to protect people and the environment. 80% of the world&rsquo;s plant and animal species are on the land of indigenous people groups, but we don&rsquo;t know how climate change will affect these people and ecosystems. Therefore, this project studied two New Zealand native plant species that are important to the indigenous M?ori people for weaving and medicine. This project used computer models to make maps that compare where these species are now with where they will be in 70 years. These maps were added to information about M?ori plant use to make plans that protect these plants and people from the danger of climate change. This project is an example for future studies to predict and lower the threat of climate change to natural resources and cultures around the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Results</strong></p>\n<p>Current suitability maps for kuta (<em>Eleocharis</em>&nbsp;<em>sphacelata</em>&nbsp;R.Br.) and k?marahou (<em>Pomaderris</em>&nbsp;<em>kumeraho</em>&nbsp;A.Cunn. ex Fenzl) were generated using species distribution modeling. These species distribution models were projected for 50 and 70 years in the future under conditions of low and high greenhouse gas emissions. Project results show a contrasting pattern: the range of kuta shifts away from where it is most culturally important, and the range of k?marahou expands to include regions where the plant has high cultural use but cannot currently grow. Management recommendations were developed in collaboration with M?ori cultural groups and conservation organizations. Project outcomes were presented within New Zealand and internationally and published.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p>This project&rsquo;s intellectual merit is linked to its interdisciplinary focus. Understanding the interdependence of social and biological sciences allows this project to contribute to the knowledge of both in a way that would not be possible by working in a single discipline. Combining theories and techniques from species distribution modeling with cultural use information answers many novel transdisciplinary questions that have implications for conservation of biological and cultural diversity. This research increases scientific understanding of two understudied plants that have critical roles in New Zealand ecosystems and M?ori cultural retention. This knowledge also benefits understanding of the strongly-related migration patterns, ecosystems, colonization histories, and climate change threats experienced by many indigenous peoples in the Pacific.
