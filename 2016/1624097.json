 "awd_abstract_narration": "The focus of this I-Corps project is to prototype and define the commercialization path for the OneScope, a two-component disposable laryngoscope system that integrates controllable suction to maintain a clear view of the airway.  Twentyfive million intubations occur each year in the US alone. Intubation is the procedure performed to provide lifesaving oxygen to a patient's lungs, accomplished by holding the jaw open with a laryngoscope in the left-hand and toggling between the suction tube to clear obstructing fluids and the breathing tube in the right hand.  This procedure is made more difficult because of the physician must choose between two types of laryngoscopes and often must switch equipment mid-procedure. The OneScope was conceptualized by two Emergency Physicians frustrated by the inadequate intubation equipment available on the market today.  It is anticipated that OneScope will be useful for both direct and video techniques and will wirelessly transmit video to a nearby tablet allowing an indirect view of the vocal cords.\r\n\r\nThe goals of this project are to develop a fully functioning 3D printed prototype of the OneScope and to develop a full understanding of how to commercialize this product.  The prototype will be designed to meet the needs of potential users (physicians and paramedics) as determined by customer discovery interviews.  An industrial engineer will be engaged to translate customer needs to complete designs, with input from a manufacturing partner to ensure good manufacturing and quality standards are met. To develop a full understanding of the commercialization path for this product, lean start-up and customer discovery interview methodologies will be used to explore the business requirements (including sales channels, manufacturing cots and timeline, financing and team development).",
