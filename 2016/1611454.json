 "awd_abstract_narration": "The challenge of pushing the switching speed-limit and integration density of today's logic and modulation devices into the terahertz (one trillion cycles per second) and sub-20 nanometer regime underlies the entire field of information processing, recording and communication. This challenge may be met by a novel paradigm of terahertz quantum nano-electronics based on ultrafast coherent laser pumping in graphene - one atom thick, the honeycomb-shaped carbon material - and single-walled carbon nanotubes\r\nthe rolled-up sheets of graphene monolayers. Researchers will use short pulsed terahertz light, outside the visible spectrum, and an ultrafast camera technique to directly monitor the formation and time evolution of photo-excited states in these carbon nanomaterials. This novel method will allow them to capture and control their novel electromagnetic properties on the femtosecond scale, or to one quadrillionth of a second. The results will open fascinating opportunities to demonstrate their significant potential to advance, e.g., above-gigahertz light modulators, broadband gain mediums from the infrared to terahertz, radiation controlled hot-electron transistors, multi-functional devices responding to ultrabroadband electromagnetic radiations from the terahertz to visible frequency. Our success in this \"ultrafast\" and \"ultrasmall\" challenge will reveal as-yet-undiscovered physical processes for developing new generation optoelectronic device and offer perspectives for sustaining the information revolution and the 21st century's digital economy. Education is an integral and essential component in this proposal. It consists of interconnected, specific plans  for education that span small  college professors/undergraduates, \"A Physics Day\" program for high school teachers and their students; outreach to underrepresented minority students and provision of research/training opportunities to them.\r\n\r\nHow coherent photoexcitations control excitonic bosons in single-walled carbon nanotubes and Dirac fermions in graphene monolayers is among the most fundamental, yet cross-cutting, issues in quantum and optoelectronic technologies. The proposal aims to explore some remarkable laser-driven quantum processes in these carbon nanostructures and demonstrate their significant potential for device applications. The primary goals are: to determine broadband gain spectrum and threshold in strongly photoexcited graphene monolayers; to demonstrate coherently photo-driven, bandgap opening near the Dirac cone using intense terahertz pulses; to investigate extreme mid-infrared and far-infrared nonlinear wave mixing in graphene; to achieve terahertz stimulated emission in single-walled carbon nanotubes using two-photon excited, dark exciton states. The approach for the timely advancement lies in the combination of ultrashort terahertz pulses, specially fabricated, high quality mono- and few-layer graphene and carbon nanotubes, and ultra-broadband probe capability from the terahertz to visible spectral regions. This proposal has identified compelling opportunities to advance one of the most poorly- addressed territories in some most exciting materials today dynamical, non-equilibrium, and nonlinear aspects of carbon nanostructures. The targeting problems are in the boundaries of several frontiers such as quantum optical control of matter, terahertz electrical transport, and ultrafast optoelectronic technology. Although sophisticated theoretical studies have been underway, the experimental schemes for exploring a wide range of the predicted fundamental phenomena, as proposed, have lagged behind. These original results are transformative, opening the possibility for graphene- and carbon nanotube- based above-terahertz speed modulators, saturable absorbers, ultra-broadband gain medium.",

Several fundamental aspects of this challenge have been addressed from the outcomes of this project. We used coherent laser pulses of THz radiation to probe and control graphene - one atom thick, the honeycomb-shaped carbon material - and single-walled carbon nanotubes ? the rolled-up&nbsp;sheets&nbsp;of&nbsp;graphene monolayers. &nbsp;This novel method have enable us to capture and control the novel electromagnetic properties of these materials on the ultrafast timescale, or to one quadrillionth of a second. For the intellectual merit, our results have opened fascinating opportunities to advance ultrafast light modulators using carbon nanotubes and hot-electron graphene devices induced by THz radiations. For the broader of impacts, we have organized vibrant activities for education that span college undergraduates, high school teachers and their students and summer science camp. Some of these aspects are elaborated below with images.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\"><strong>The intellectual merit </strong>(image #1)<strong> </strong></p>\n<p class=\"Default\">First, we <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v496/n7443/full/nature11934.html\" target=\"_blank\">discovered</a> that the relaxation dynamics THz driven graphene monolayers is characterized by hydrodynamics of Dirac fermions, very different from Fermi liquid behaviors in conventional metals. Second, we reported electronic control of Dirac fermion transport by quantum periodic motion. This provides compelling evidence that coherently driven states can protect and enhance the stability of Dirac materials. Imposing vibrational coherence into topological states of matter may become a universal light control principle for reinforcing the protected quantum transport of Dirac fermions.&nbsp; Addressing this cross-cutting issue has far reaching consequences to many scientific and technological disciplines, such as disorder-tolerant quantum information and communications applications and spin-based, lightwave quantum electronics. Third, how the exciton fine structure and spectral linewidth in single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) evolve after ultrafast photoexcitation is critical for both understanding the fundamental optoelectronic properties and the development of nanophotonic functional devices. Yet, studies so far have mostly detected a subset of excitons near the Brillouin-zone center due to symmetry and momentum restrictions of the interband optical probes used, such as photoluminescence and absorption. We have used ultrafast terahertz spectroscopy to probe the excitonic spectral linewidth associated with internal quantum transition across the entire momentum space in resonantly excited semiconducting SWNTs.</p>\n<p class=\"Default\"><strong>The broader of impacts </strong>(image #2-3)<strong> &nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p class=\"Default\">First, we have constructed a new ultrafast optical and THz spectroscopy characterization setup using the newly purchased laser amplifiers through this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;These new ultrafast spectroscopy tools have enabled above discoveries and will be used to support other projects throughout PI?s department and institution in the future. &nbsp;Second, there have been a vibrant outreach activities organized throughout this grant. First, the project supported one minority undergraduate student?s research training in PI?s laboratory which has contributed to his poster presentation in IINSPIRE&nbsp;Summer Research Symposium and allowed him to pursue a financial aid from the Iowa Illinois Nebraska STEM Partnership for Innovation in Research and Education (IINSPIRE)&nbsp;to continue his education (left panel, image #2). In addition, the PI has also hosted students from small undergraduate college and/or from universities with large under-representative student body (right panel, image #2). The three students in the picture are from The University of Texas at El Paso, the second-largest university in the United States to have a majority&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_American\">Mexican American</a>&nbsp;student population (about 80%). Second, the PI hosted a physics club for high school students of grades 8-10 from Waukee, Iowa in the duration of this project period (image #3). This activity is to (1) engage them and improve their understanding of the lasers and optical technology; (2) to attract talented high school students in careers in sciences.
