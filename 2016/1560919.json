The investigators will advance understanding about the complex interplay between people and the natural environment for understanding past and future biogeographical patterns across multiple scales.  Project outcomes will be valuable in identifying the ecological legacies of low-intensity land use and for identifying reference conditions and baseline data for ecological restoration.  The project will provide valuable education and training opportunities for undergraduate students enrolled at a primarily undergraduate institution and will foster professional development of early career science educators.  The investigators will actively collaborate with Native American tribal resource managers and will conduct outreach activities for sharing outcomes with land-resource management communities and the general public.\r\n\r\nEnhancing knowledge about the extent of human influence on fire regimes of past millennia has important implications for the understanding and management of fire-adapted vegetation communities in the U.S. and around the world.  Bark-peeled pine can provide a compelling context of land use to inform interpretations of an extensive and growing fire history and forest age structure.  The investigator will use dendrochronological dating of peel scars on trees in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness to provide the first absolutely dated and spatially precise record of Ojibwe land use in the Great Lakes region.  Parametric and non-parametric tests will be performed to compare fire frequency, fire synchrony, and spatial association of areas of high fire frequency with peel-scar occurrence in order to ascertain the association between human and fire activity.  Collaboration with archaeologists will provide the cultural context for the tree-ring data and will enable a direct examination of the influence people had on the fire regimes and vegetation communities of this wilderness area.  The results of this work will establish a new understanding of the role of people in the pre-European landscape that will help guide future research and management in the Great Lakes Region and throughout temperate forest regions of the world.",

In particular, determining how humans modified historical fire regimes is key to understanding modern patterns in fire activity and the associated implications for fire management and biological conservation. This question is central when considering how best to maintain the character of landscapes protected under the 1964 Federal Wilderness Act, which defines wilderness as ?an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.? If historical patterns of landuse increased fire frequency sufficiently to modify vegetation communities across a modern wilderness area, should managers consider an active role in that system through the use of prescribed fire to maintain biological and landscape diversity?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here, we used tree-ring data to reconstruct over 400 years of fire history in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness of northern Minnesota, one of the first established and most-visited wilderness areas in North America and a landscape that is central to the sense of place shared by many residents of the Upper Great Lakes Region. Our research identified stark differences in fire activity across the BWCAW, with sites associated with historical settlements and travel corridors exhibiting substantially more frequent fires than sites away from these areas of use. Elevated fire frequency related to human activities led to the establishment of open, red pine (<em>Pinus resinosa</em>)-dominated forest stands at more sites than would otherwise have supported this community type. This is significant, in that open red pine communities are central to modern wilderness visitors? idea of wilderness and are of high conservation value as they support a disproportionate number of rare and endangered species in this region. Fire activity declined precipitously in our study area synchronously with the removal of traditional Ojibwe landuse and lifeways from the BWCAW through the 1889 Nelson Act. The cessation of fires, which preceded effective fire suppression in the area by several decades, was quickly followed by a surge in tree establishment that resulted in denser forests that are more susceptible to drought impacts and severe wildfires. Collectively, these results indicate a profound influence of people on fire and forest development at certain locations and during certain periods. Without human augmentation of fire frequency, the future landscape of the BWCAW will likely become more homogenous and lack important components of the wilderness character often sought by visitors to the BWCAW.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The broader impacts of this research extended to undergraduate students, graduate students, and early career scientists, boosted the research activity of a Title III comprehensive university, established numerous relationships among scientists, land managers, and American Indian communities, and was disseminated through 24 public presentations, three publications, and numerous informal conversations among the public, scientific, and management communities. Over 34 undergraduate students have been engaged in the high-impact educational experience of undergraduate research through this project, while ideas from this work informed the teaching of PI Larson that in turn reaches hundreds of students each semester. This project provided a significant boost to the research productivity of UW-Platteville, a primarily undergraduate institution that serves a high proportion of first general college students from modest economic backgrounds while helping early career researchers Larson and Johnson establish their research programs. The findings of this research inspired conversations among wilderness, fire, and cultural resource managers on the Superior National Forest and resulted in a new collaboration with the managers of Quetico Provincial Park and members of the Lac La Croix First Nation that is helping revise the QPP fire management plan to explicitly incorporate human influences and shared decision making with LLCFN elders and community members. Finally, the story emerging from this research powerfully speaks to the long-term relationship between people and the land. Funded by a new grant from the Coalition for Archaeological Synthesis, this story inspired the creation of a team of scientists, managers, First Nation community members, and story tellers to initiate a new collaborative effort that will integrate tree-ring, archaeological, and ethnographic data in the context of traditional stories and ecological knowledge.
