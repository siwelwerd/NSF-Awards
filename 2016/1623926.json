 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\n \r\nTitle: Community Workshop: Scientific Drivers and Future of a Mount Erebus Volcano Observatory (MEVO) \r\n\r\nNon-technical Summary\r\n\r\nThis workshop will support members of the volcano science community familiar with Mt. Erebus on Ross Island, Antarctica, those working on active or ancient volcanic systems, and those that have coordinated and developed volcano observatories at locations other than Mount Erebus.  The goal of the workshop is for the scientific community to articulate a plan and their priorities for scientific infrastructure, facilities support, and scientific observations on Mt.  Erebus.  \r\n\r\nTechnical Description\r\n\r\nMount Erebus is a large volume, persistently active, open-system volcano, with a summit crater 500 m in diameter, rising to 3794 m above sea level. Conditions at the summit and the upper part of the volcano are among the harshest environments on Earth. The volcanic edifice of Erebus is geographically central and forms the backbone of Ross Island and the summit of Erebus is located 40 km from McMurdo Station. The workshop will review: 1) What have has been learned to date from geophysical, geochemical, biological and other observations at Mount Erebus?; 2) What specific and unique scientific questions can be addressed by additional observations at Mount Erebus?; 3) What are the special considerations for any future research efforts, permanent geophysical and other scientific infrastructure, or temporary field deployments on Mount Erebus?; 4) What are the volcanic hazards related to Mount Erebus and what are the risks these pose for McMurdo Station?; 5) What are the measurement requirements to address new or ongoing research objectives related to the Mount Erebus magmatic system?; and 6) Can analysis and measurement techniques along with any autonomous sensor, power, and telemetry systems developed for deployment on Mount Erebus be used to study other remote volcanoes?   The outcome from the workshop will be a report of the workshops priorities to the investigator community and a review and summary of the workshop in the American Geophysical Society publication EOS Transactions.",
