 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will result in a literature review of studies of American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian and STEM education and learning as well as studies that include Indigenous populations as part of a larger underrepresented racial and ethnic minority group.  The ultimate educational significance of this project is to identify practical strategies to address the extreme dearth of Native Americans in STEM education and careers.  The outcomes of this project will set the stage for future programming to foster the participation of American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian in STEM education and careers.\r\n\r\nOne of the goals of this project is to understand how the STEM experiences and retention of American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian populations can be best understood within the broader underrepresented minority discussion. To do this, the investigators will conduct a secondary literature review aiming to identify common themes.  This literature review will lead to a workshop of experts in STEM education and Indigenous populations.  The workshop participants will discuss the current state of research, identifying themes and gaps in the research in order to develop an action plan to guide future research as well as provide best practices for American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Native Hawaiian educational organizations like the American Indian Science and Engineering Society (AISES).",
