 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will conduct a series of field campaigns to observe phenomena producing high-energy radiation in thunderstorms.  These include terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs), long-lived gamma-ray glows observed in many parts of the thunderstorm charge structure, and x-rays associated with the stepping of lightning leaders.  The overall strategy is to locate probing sensors in or near the high-field regions where these emissions are primarily generated. The sensors to be used include two gamma-ray instruments developed at the University of California, Santa Cruz, under previous NSF awards, as well as sensors provided by our collaborators that sense lightning remotely via static and dynamic electric and magnetic fields. \r\n\r\nIntellectual Merit:\r\nAll the phenomena under study were discovered within the last 30 years or so, with research only becoming widespread in the last decade. Some of the many open questions that will be addressed by this project include: whether downward TGFs occur in natural lightning, whether glows (an avalanche of relativistic electrons) contribute significantly to the discharging of thunderstorms, and whether positive lightning leaders emit x-rays and low-energy gamma rays the way negative leaders do. The primary advantage the field measurements have over others are 1) the proximity of the detection sites to the radiation sources to be studied (thundercloud charge centers and lightning leaders); and 2) the high time resolution and throughput capabilities of the detectors.\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts:\r\nThe selected field sites (an urban tower in Canada, a region of very low altitude storms in Japan, and a very high altitude site in Mexico) represent the three situations in which it is at least feasible that downward TGFs might produce high enough radiation fields at the ground to represent a public safety issue (upward TGFs seen from space produce dangerous levels of radioactivity within thunderclouds at 10--15~km altitudes). Thus this program should allay (or justify) any concern about radiation at ground level nearly comprehensively. Significant participation from undergraduate and graduate students, including first-generation and otherwise underserved undergraduates, is part of the program.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goals of this project, titled \"Collaborative Research: Observations of High-energy,\" were to better understand how thunderstorms generate terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) and gamma-ray glows, and how x-rays associated with the stepping of lightning leaders are created. The overall strategy was to locate sensors in or near the high-field regions of thunderstorms where these emissions are primarily generated, to get more numerous detections and a stronger x-ray and gamma-ray signals.  For this project, researchers at UNH helped analyze the energetic particle data collected by colleagues at UCSC, modeling the production and propagation of gamma rays and comparing the models with the data.\n\nAs a result of this project, three peer-reviewed papers were published in the Journal of Geophysical Research.  The first paper reported observations of a Terrestrial gamma-ray flash (TGF) by the ADELE instrument onboard a NOAA WP-3D aircraft inside Hurricane Patricia.  This TGF occurred above the aircraft and was directed upward.  As a result, the aircraft was struck by a gamma-ray beam caused by the downward propagating TGF positrons. This was the first direct evidence of a backward gamma-ray beam produced by TGF positrons. The second paper characterized upward lightning with and without a terrestrial gamma-ray flash detected on the ground in Japan.  This work provides insight into why some lightning produces ground-level TGFs and others do not. The last paper studied reverse positron beams and showed that TGFs are actually bi-directional and upward TGFs observed from space may be simultaneously observable from the ground.\n\nFrom this research, our understandings of TGFs and, in particular, ground-level TGFs are steadily improving.  A new view of TGFs has been emerging that TGFs don\u2019t just make a single beam of gamma-rays.  Instead, they are bidirectional, sending gamma rays both up and down out of the thunderstorms.  This has important implications for how TGFs may be detected and studied.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/04/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joseph R Dwyer"
