 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are non-methane hydrocarbons globally emitted by plants in large quantities (~1150 teragrams of carbon per year: c.f. ~ 140 teragrams of anthropogenic carbon per year) and which are important precursors for photo-chemical smog formation, along with production of secondary organic aerosols. \r\n\r\nThe work seeks in continuance of the Principal Investigator's interest in the potential involvement of isoprenoid epoxide intermediates in the oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds (e.g. a-pinene, b-pinene, limonene, 2-me-3-buten-2-ol, 3-Z-Hexenal) along with assessment of their subsequent gas phase and particle phase reactivity.  Not all of these compounds are readily available, and thus some may need to be synthesized. The central mechanistic activity is then to study the epoxide formation, and their NOx and pressure dependence yields via reactions of BVOCs with OH, O3 and NO3, the common atmospheric oxidants.  \r\n\r\nThe previous RUI grant, and the PI's other support, has made possible the extensive participation of undergraduate students in aspects of atmospheric chemistry research. Over the past 17 years of NSF support through the PI's CAREER and RUI programs, some 46 undergraduate students have been involved in ongoing projects. During this same period, 33 of these students were coauthors on 30 of the 36 papers published by the Oberlin College PI.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis Oberlin College-based research involved investigating potential chemical transformations on secondary organic aerosol (SOA), which are small airborne particles that play a role in air pollution, the energy balance of the atmosphere, and in the nucleation of clouds.  Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods were used to study bulk solutions that were similar to SOA in chemical composition.  In particular, the work showed that a certain class of organic molecules called epoxides are likely not responsible for the presence of chemicals in SOA that are derived from coniferous tree-related substances called monoterpenes.  On the other hand, the lactone class of molecules was shown to be capable of explaining the presence of certain chemicals in SOA derived from deciduous tree-related chemical isoprene.  An important previously identified epoxide related to isoprene, IEPOX, was also shown to undergo only slow isomerization reactions, forming different chemical species than previously thought and also relatively inefficient dimer forming reactions.  These results indicate that models for isoprene-derived SOA are still lacking a detailed chemical mechanism that can rationalize the chemical makeup of SOA.\n\nThese findings were reported in 4 peer reviewed publications (with six undergraduate students as coauthors) in the venues Environmental Science and Technology and the Journal of Physical Chemistry A.  Six undergraduate students were trained as a direct consequence of their work on the project.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/01/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew J Elrod"
