 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project supports hosting a Global Environment for Network innovations (GENI) Regional Workshop (GRW) on May 23, 2016 at Boston University in Boston, Massachusetts. The intent of this GRW is to continue to broaden the GENI user community, introducing new educators and researchers in the northeastern US geographic region to GENI. Four GRWs in total are planned for 2016, one held about every three months (i.e., March (most recent workshop),  May (this workshop), September, and December), scattered geographically across the U.S. \r\n\r\nThe proposed GRW will promote innovations in research (e.g., network science, security, services, and applications) and education (e.g., the development of new coursework assignments and projects using the GENI infrastructure). The workshop will enable participants to engage in a range of activities designed to improve their understanding of and expertise in: \r\n1) Resources available for utilizing GENI in undergraduate and graduate education. \r\n2) Utilizing the GENI infrastructure in experimental research, including state-of-the-art developments in wired, wireless, cloud computing, software defined networking, and network function virtualization. \r\n3) Working through a variety of \"hands on\" tutorials, obtaining network and compute resources at locations around the United States. \r\n\r\nThe workshop serves as a venue for the exchange of ideas, a discussion of challenges of experimentation in research and classroom settings, and a showcase for technology experimentation on GENI.",

The four projects were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>A      Software Defined Networking (SDN) based firewall</strong>.&nbsp; Only known      switches were allowed to connect to their OpenFlow controller and only      traffic from whitelisted networks were allowed into the internal network.</li>\n<li><strong>Covert      channels in GENI</strong>.&nbsp; Information was coded as delays between packets using      a scheme similar to Morse code; each letter of the English alphabet was      coded as a sequence of long and short delays between packets.&nbsp;      Decoding error rates were compared over low-latency GENI rack-local links      and over high-latency links between GENI resources on the east and west      coasts of the US.</li>\n<li><strong>Software      defined radio</strong>.&nbsp; The team programmed a software defined radio at New      York University to receive and decode transponder transmissions from      aircraft flying over Brooklyn, NY.</li>\n<li><strong>Using      SDN to reduce the complexity of iBGP peering</strong>.&nbsp;

All respondents to an online survey said the camp was well organized and met their expectations.&nbsp; Coming into the camp, 80% said they have very little to no knowledge of GENI, but by the end of the week, 80% rated their knowledge of GENI to be high.&nbsp;
