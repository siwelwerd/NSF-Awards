The award \"Support for Junior Investigators at the Orthopaedic Research Society (ORS) Sun Valley Workshop on Musculoskeletal Biology; Sun Valley, Idaho; August 7-10, 2016\" will be organized around problem solving, rather than just presentation and extensive discussion. The meeting will institute a new program to highlight posters presented at the workshop: \"Blue Ribbon Sun Valley Posters.\" Ten posters will be chosen for 3 minute summary presentations by the authors. The intent is to highlight the most significant posters, in many cases young investigator posters, and generate interest in visiting the posters. Two of these sessions are planned.\r\n\r\nThe musculoskeletal system (muscles, tendon, bone) is highly sensitive to mechanical load and many younger investigators from previous Sun Valley meetings have submitted applications to the Biomechanics and Mechanobiology program.  It continues as one of the important training venues for future scientists in the area of mechanobiology of the musculoskeletal system.",
