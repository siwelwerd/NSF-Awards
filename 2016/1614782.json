 "awd_abstract_narration": "Radio astronomers have discovered remarkable magnetic field structures near the center of our Milky Way galaxy.   These structures, called filaments, are much more complicated than simple hot clouds of gas.  These filaments are many light years in length.  The filaments are thought to be visible to radio telescopes because high-energy particles are orbiting along very long magnetic fields.  The investigators will study the detailed physical characteristics of these filamentary structures using the NSF Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescope.  Museum and public events will be developed at both the University of Iowa and the University of California at Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will study non-thermal filamentary structures observed in the radio images of the Galactic Center. This study will exploit the new capabilities of the VLA, an NSF radio telescope in New Mexico, to obtain detailed physical information of these structures, including polarization analysis. The outcomes of this project have important implications in other fields of astronomy, in particular the study of the active galactic nuclei in other galaxies, and the role of magnetic fields in the environments of accreting black holes. \r\n\r\nAt University of Iowa, the investigator will work with an undergraduate to develop a museum exhibit. The investigators will also participate in the museum activities and lecture series. At the University of California at Los Angles, another investigator will participate in public education events, as well as in training undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Galactic Center is a complex source of radio emission consisting of both thermal emission from ionized gas and nonthermal emission from relativistic particles interacting with the strong Galactic Center magnetic field.  The nonthermal emission -- synchrotron emission -- is typically linearly polarized to a detectable degree, so by measuring whether a source of emission is polarized, one can distinguish between thermal and nonthermal emission.   Thermal emission is typically caused by the ionizing ultraviolet light from newly-formed, massive stars, whereas nonthermal emission usually requires a high-energy process to create the relativistic electrons, so to understand the astrophysical basis of a radio source, it is important to measure whether, and by how much, the emission is polarized.  Furthermore, to extract all possible information about the intrinsic geometry and orientation of the components of a radio source, an observer must measure the angle of the electric vector of the emission -- the polarization angle.\n\nMeasuring the polarization of a compact radio source is relatively straightforward, although it can be affected by interstellar plasma that might be in the foreground, through a process called Faraday rotation.  Because Faraday rotation  is frequency-dependent, the amount of Faraday rotation can be determined by observing at many frequencies, so by doing that to account for the Faraday rotation, one can determine the intrinsic polarization angle of the emission before it was rotated in the foreground medium.  Furthermore, if the amount of Faraday rotation varies rapidly with position on the sky, crucial information can be lost if a substantial spatial variation happens on angular scales smaller than the spatial resolution of the telescope being used.   \n\nif the radio source is extended, the treatment of the observation becomes more complex because the telescope itself imposes an instrumental polarization that must be removed, and the telescope has a response to polarized emission that is both frequency-dependent and spatially dependent and that differs slightly between opposite senses of polarization.   Consequently, these complications must be accounted for in order to make a meaningful measurement.   \n\nOur goal was to make reliable polarization measurements of extended emission from sources in the Galactic center region, so we developed the techniques needed, in addition to the standard procedures typically used, to calibrate the polarized emission and correct for instrumental polarization as well as for the foreground Faraday rotation. We measured the total radio emission and the polarized radio emission from a source in the Galactic Center called the Radio Arc, which consists of a bundle of linear filaments, from which the emission is strongly polarized.   Our observations were made with both the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), operated by the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, and the Australia Telescope Compact Array.  We concluded from our analysis that the highly polarized intrinsic synchrotron emission from the Arc is strongly rotated by the magnetized plasma in the foreground medium, and in some areas it is rotated so much and over such a small region that with the finite spatial resolution of the telescopes we used, it appears to have very little or no polarization because the various angles reprsented within the telescope beam cancel each other.   We also used the frequency dependence of the polarization to conclude, via a Bayesian fitting process, that some of the Faraday rotation occurs within the emitting region.  Therefore, the synchrotron-emitting filaments are immersed in a thermal, ionized gas cloud.   \n\nBesides this scientific finding, the value of our work has been the development of the procedures for: 1) making the necessary corrections to be able to reliably measure polarized radio emission with an aperture synthesis radiotelescope over a relatively large area of the sky, and 2) developing the tools to interpret the data in terms of the potentially complex line-of-sight distribution of the polarized synchrotron sources and the Faraday-rotating thermal gas clouds.\n\nIn another use of the VLA to study radio emission from the Galactic center, we produced the deepest and most sensitive total-intensity image yet made of the large central region surrounding the Galactic Black Hole on scales of many light-years.  This was accomplished by developing a new procedure for correcting for subtle phase errors that are not accounted for in the standard reduction procedures for imaging with the VLA.  The resulting images show new astrogeographical features, one of which is a nonthermal radio filament whose location and orientation suggests that it originates from the black hole.   If so, it represents a new phenomenon warranting further study so that we can better understand how an accreting black hole interacts with its magnetized environment.   \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/26/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark R Morris"
