 "awd_abstract_narration": "The compositions of stars in our Milky Way Galaxy hold vital clues to its birth and history of forming stars.  Stars make elements in their interiors. At their deaths, stars return the new elements into the gas of the Galaxy.  The investigators seek to use abundances of stars, derived from their spectra, to understand how the buildup of elements led to the complex Periodic Table of today.  The investigators have three goals. Their first goal is improving the quality of chemical composition analyses. They will obtain basic laboratory data that go into the spectrum analyses. Second, they will significantly augment the number of stars studied in important groups of stars.  Through this they will study members of various Galactic star populations. Thirdly, they will provide service to the research and educational communities. They will make the new lab data, and abundance analysis software freely available to all. They will also work with a group of Texas science educators to link astronomical research with their teaching efforts.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will provide very accurate measurements of iron-group element abundances in many metal-poor stars of the halo of our Galaxy.  They will derive abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and lithium, as well as carbon isotopic ratios in large samples of about 20 open clusters of the Galactic disk.  This work will uniquely take advantage of newly-acquired high resolution spectra covering broad regions of both optical and infrared spectral domains.  They will search for star streams in the Galaxy by mating optical spectra with kinematics to be provided by the Gaia astrometric satellite.  They will also explore this issue with new infrared spectra of warm red giant stars in clusters and in the general field of the Galactic disk.  The investigators will continue to release major updates of lab atomic and molecular spectral line data, and to improve our publicly-available spectrum analysis codes.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will continue their long-standing effort to improve the quality of science education in the state of Texas.  They will work with a highly-motivated group of secondary science educators.  They give talks on the latest astronomical research, and to engage teachers in projects that can be carried back to use in their classrooms.  They will also provide opportunities for teachers to participate in telescope usage, to have workshops at McDonald Observatory, and to attend meetings of the American Astronomical Society.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nStars generate new elements in their extremely hot interiors at all their life stages, from quiet childhoods and adult lives to unsettled old ages and often explosive deaths.  Late in their lifetimes stars eject many of their newly-synthesized elements into nearby gas clouds.  These clouds in turn condense into new stars.  Thus chemical compositions of the stars that we see today are living records of element production in past generations of our Milky Way Galaxy and in the interiors of the stars themselves.\n\nThis grant has been used to support spectroscopic investigations of the atmospheres of stars that may have interesting element abundance mixes, ones that can be decoded into descriptions of the origins and evolutions of the elements almost as far back as the beginning of the Milky Way billions of years ago.  In our work we gather spectroscopic observations at high wavelength resolution, and study the rich assortment of absorption features that give clues to which elements are present and how abundant they are.  This involves an intricate analytical procedure that produces detailed knowledge of the physical states of stellar atmospheres (temperatures, pressures, densities, etc.).  In the end the derived elemental abundance sets can be compared to theoretical predictions to add new understanding about the history of element production over cosmic time.\n\nOur work has been supported by NSF for many years, and here are just a few highlights from work accomplished with the current grant.  First, we have studied the abundances of metallic elements (titanium, chromium, iron, cobalt, nickel, etc.) in stars known have been born nearly at the beginning of the Milky Way, more than 10 billion years ago.  We have found indisputable evidence that these elements have abundance ratios often very different than in our Sun.  This shows that the first element producers in our Galaxy had very unique characteristics.  This provides clear insight on the conditions of the Milky Way near its beginning.\n\nSecond, we have studied members of Galactic star clusters, from small aggregates called open clusters to massive assemblies labeled globular clusters.  We have concentrated our work on clusters that are dust-enshrouded and often too faint to be studied at visual wavelengths.  We instead have collected high-resolution spectra in the infrared, where light is much less affected by dust extinction.  In brief, we have proven that spectra in the infrared yield chemical compositions in good accord with those derived with optical spectra.  With this calibration work completed, we now are pursuing studies of clusters in the heavily dust-obscured regions near to the center of the Milky Way.\n\nThird, we have made a concentrated effort to improve our understanding of the so-called RR Lyrae variable stars.  These luminous stars pulsate with extreme regularity about 2-3 times each day, and they are so bright that they can be seen in galaxies beyond our own Milky Way.  Our approach has been twofold.  First, we have used high-resolution spectra to try to understand the basic properties of RR Lyrae pulsation (even today not perfectly understood).  Second  we are using our spectra to help refine knowledge of the luminosities of RR Lyrae stars in order to improve their use as distance indicators to other galaxies\n\nFinally, with this grant support we have strengthened our long-term effort to help improve basic laboratory spectroscopic information, and have also continued our outreach work with Texas secondary school educators.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/19/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher Sneden"
