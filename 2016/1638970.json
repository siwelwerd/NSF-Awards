 "awd_abstract_narration": "The theory of the \"Big Bang\" provides a well-established cosmological model for the Universe from its earliest known periods through its subsequent large-scale evolution. The model traces the expansion of the Universe, starting from initial conditions of a very high density and temperature state which is almost but not perfectly smooth, and it offers a comprehensive explanation for a broad range of now-known phenomena, including the abundance of light elements, the cosmic microwave background radiation, and the distribution of large scale structures. While the established \"Big Bang\" theory leaves open the question of explaining the initial conditions, current evidence is consistent with the entire observable Universe being spawned in a dramatic, exponential \"inflation\" of a sub-nuclear volume that lasted about one trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second. Following this short inflationary period, the Universe continues to expand, but at a less rapid rate. While the basic \"inflationary paradigm\" is accepted by most scientists, the detailed particle physics mechanism responsible for inflation is still not known. It is believed that this violent space-time expansion would have produced primordial gravitational waves now propagating through the expanding universe, thus forming a cosmic gravitational-wave background (CGB) the amplitude of which measures the energy scale of inflation. The CGB imprints a faint signature in the polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), and detecting this polarization signature is arguably the most important goal in cosmology today.  This award will address one of the oldest questions ever posed by mankind, \"How did the Universe begin?\", and it does so via observations made at one of the most intriguing places on Earth, South Pole Station in Antarctica.\r\n \r\nThe community-driven Astro2010 Decadal Survey described the search for the CGB as \"the most exciting quest of all\", emphasizing that \"mid-term investment is needed for systems aimed at detecting the (B-mode) polarization of the CMB\". In 2005, the NASA/DOE/NSF Task Force on CMB Research identified this topic as the highest priority for the field and established a target sensitivity for the ratio of gravitational waves to density fluctuations of r ~ 0.01. Such measurements promise a definitive test of slow-roll models of inflation, which generally predict a gravitational-wave signal around r~0.01 or above, producing CMB B-modes fluctuations that peak on degree angular scales. The ongoing BICEP series of experiments is dedicated to this science goal. The experiment began operating at South Pole in 2006 and has been relentlessly mapping an 800 square degree region of the sky in a region of low in Galactic foregrounds known as the Southern Hole. This award will support science observations and analysis for the CMB \"Stage 3\" science with the BICEP Array program that will measure the polarized sky in five frequency bands. It is projected to reach an ultimate sensitivity to the amplitude of inflationary gravitational waves of \"sigma r\" < 0.005, extrapolating from achieved performance and after conservatively accounting for the Galactic dust, Galactic synchrotron radiation, and CMB lensing foregrounds. This measurement will offer a definitive test of most slow-roll models of Inflation, and will realize or exceed the goals set by the Task Force in 2005 for sensitivity. The project will continue to provide excellent training for undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows (including those from underrepresented groups) in laboratories that have exceptional track records in this regard. Cosmology and research in Antarctica both capture the public imagination, making this combination a remarkably effective vehicle for stimulating interest in science.",

These telescopes have been studying the afterglow from the Big Bang birth of our Universe in ever greater detail - the so-called Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). (Because of the expansion of the Universe what was once the blinding white light of the Big Bang is now stretched (red-shifted) down to microwave wavelengths.)<br /><br />Studies of the CMB by ground and space based telescopes over the past several decades have taught us an immense amount about the Universe in which we find ourselves. Cosmology has gone from being the realm of speculation to being precision science. We know what the Universe is composed of and it's age, evolution and fate - the co-called Lambda-CDM cosmological model fits the CMB, and other data, with amazing precision. It truly is one of the greatest achievements in all of human science, but deep mysteries remain.One of these is the so-called Horizon Problem - we see the CMB arriving at Earth from all directions with very nearly equal brightness. These rays of light set off 14 billion years ago, traveling towards where the Earth would later form. The CMB glow we see in two opposite directions on the sky comes from regions of space which have not had any ability to communicate over the lifetime of the Universe so far - the light from them has only managed to get to us half way inbetween.<br /><br />There is a radical add-on to the Big Bang model called \"Inflation\" which naturally solves the Horizon Problem (and multiple other problems). In this theory at a very early time the fabric of space itself underwent an ultra-brief burst of ultra-expansion creating our entire observable Universe from a sub-atomic spec, and creating the seeds of all the structure in the Universe today from quantum fluctuations. If this cosmic inflation in fact occurred it will have injected into the fabric of space-time a background of gravitational waves - detection of which has been dubbed the \"smoking gun for inflation\". It turns out that our best chance to detect these gravitational waves is to look for their imprint in the polarization pattern of the CMB, where they will contribute a \"swirliness\".<br /><br />Starting about 20 years ago the BICEP team devised an experimental strategy to search for the gravitational waves from the beginning of time using specialized compact radio telescopes. This strategy has been remarkably successful, and has been repeatedly scaled up to probe more deeply, with the BICEP1, BICEP2, SPUD, BICEP3 and now the BICEP-Array instruments. During the period of this award a key outcome was reached - BICEP became the most sensitive experiment in the world in the quest for inflation, ruling out two entire classes of previously popular inflationary models. This award also enabled the construction and installation of the new BICEP Array telescope platform at the South Pole and the first of the four new telescopes.<br /><br />The BICEP program is continuing under a new award and will probe more deeply, either detecting an inflationary signal, or ruling out further theories. This experimental quest is widely agreed to be amongst the most important in all of contemporary physics - and perhaps in all of science. While BICEP has been, and currently is, way ahead, others are currently gearing up pursue the same basic technique in competition - ensuring that the next years will continue to be as interesting as the last.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 06/11/2024<br>\nModified by: Clement&nbsp;L&nbsp;Pryke</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1638970/1638970_10452614_1718124050684_bk18_r_ns--rgov-214x142.png\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1638970/1638970_10452614_1718124050684_bk18_r_ns--rgov-800width.png\" title=\"Breaking new ground in cosmology\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2024/1638970/1638970_10452614_1718124050684_bk18_r_ns--rgov-66x44.png\" alt=\"Breaking new ground in cosmology\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The world leading result from BICEP published in Physical Review Letters in October 2021.
