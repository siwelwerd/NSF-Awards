 "awd_abstract_narration": "The President's Materials Genome initiative has amply recognized\r\nthe potential of simulation for helping to design new materials \"twice as fast and at a fraction\r\nof the cost.\" In the quest for novel and breakthrough properties, nanoscale science and technology\r\nis particularly promising, because at the nanoscale the quantum properties of matter manifest\r\nthemselves in unexpected ways, leading to non-linear, novel behavior that cannot be predicted\r\nby simple extrapolation from either the molecular or the bulk limits. Furthermore, experiments\r\nare very difficult at these scales, since they require atomic or nearly-atomic resolution,\r\nyet must also account for the emergent properties that involve thousands of atoms. Advanced\r\nsimulations can supplant much of the tedious experimentation, allowing researchers to step through\r\ndifferent options in the experimental design space. More importantly, the atomic-scale design principles\r\nleading to the desired materials or device characteristics can be uncovered through in-depth\r\nanalysis of computational results, leading to accelerated progress and optimal design for\r\na given application. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to investigate fundamental properties of nano and nano-bio structures\r\nwith potential applications in biomolecular sensors and nano-scale electronics for beyond-Moore's-law\r\nera. Specifically, the project will investigate (i) carbon nanotube-based nanocircuits that can monitor\r\nDNA replication and potentially enable high-throughput electrical sequencing of DNA, and (ii)\r\ncarbon-nanoribbon-based devices for nanoscale electronics and spintronics. The proposed simulations are ambitious\r\nand potentially transformative.\r\n\r\nThis proposal aims to apply highly optimized quantum simulation codes to Blue Waters and to\r\nuse them in two projects of high current interest: electrical detection of DNA sequence and\r\nnanoribbon-based electronics for beyond-Moore's-law era. \r\nIn DNA sequencing, the proposed methodology based on electrical readout of the DNA sequence would constitute a major breakthrough\r\nand result in much faster and cheaper sequencing. It would allow for sequencing of a large\r\nfraction of population, enable truly personalized medicine and lead to thorough mapping and\r\nunderstanding of genetic diseases. Additionally, graphene and graphene nanoribbons are major candidates\r\nfor future nanoscale devices for beyond-Moore's-law era. By systematically investigating the\r\ntransport properties of nanoribbon-based electronic devices, the project will allow us to understand\r\ndevice performance at a quantum level and help to design the new generation of transistors.\r\n\r\nAccess to cheap and broadly available DNA sequencing would revolutionize health-care and treatment.\r\nThe computational design and discovery of appropriate nucleotides to enable electrical DNA\r\nsequencing would lead to new technologies and new manufacturing. Furthermore, the beyond\r\nMoore's law era is of great interest to computer and computational scientists, engineers and\r\nthe general public. Finally, the project will have significant educational impact to the project's local institution\r\nby involving undergraduate and graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows,\r\nin leading-edge computational research, with special effort being made to ensure participation\r\nof members of underrepresented groups.",
