 "awd_abstract_narration": "Sea Education Association (SEA) requests funding from the National Science Foundation to update existing oceanographic equipment in its sailing research vessel laboratories in order to continue training undergraduates in the marine sciences, and to further collection of data from under-sampled areas of the oceans for submission to national archives. The SSVs Corwith Cramer and Robert C. Seamans operate in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, respectively, supporting educational programs and oceanographic research. The equipment requested will be used by undergraduate students and collaborating scientists from colleges and research institutions throughout the country. All data generated will be freely shared with the entire oceanographic community via submission to the NSF Research Vessel data archive Rolling Deck to Repository (R2R). Although SEA vessels are not operated through the UNOLS umbrella, the organization has provided numerous examples of quality personnel both to the scientific and technical support communities. Financial support of their efforts is necessary to ensure this pipeline remains productive. This proposal requests fund for the following Oceanographic Instrumentation:\r\n\r\nTwo (2) SBE CTD packages\t$44,747\r\nTwo (2) LED epifluorescence packages\t$31,562\r\nTwo (2) UV/VIS Spectrophotometers\t$11,422\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$87,731\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

Seamans</em>. Recognized by the National Science Board&rsquo;s 2016 Public Service Award as an important contributor to increased public understanding of science and engineering, SEA brings university students to sea on international voyages of exploration and marine science research. We place our shipboard labs and technical equipment in the hands of our students, allowing them to conduct investigations into coastal and open ocean phenomena of their own design; they then analyze, document, and communicate the findings of their projects. New water column sampling instruments (CTD packages) funded by NSF provide a picture of the structure of the ocean from surface to seafloor, describing the temperature, oxygen, and productivity of different zones. We are also able to collect seawater samples from various depths, chosen specific to the research question, and examine the water quality and chemistry using the spectrophotometers &ndash; pH and nutrient concentrations are two areas of focus. SEA students are always curious about marine creatures living around the world, and we tow nets to collect samples for identification; with the new microscopes supported by this grant, each sample is carefully examined and the animals &ndash; large and small &ndash; identified and counted. Beyond SEA academic semester programs, the data collected on our two ships is shared with scientists interested in similar questions or geographic areas at institutions without open ocean access, as well as with the local communities and schools in regions we visit. Each year, approximately 250 students and collaborators sail on SEA vessels and utilize NSF-funded oceanographic equipment; over half are women and a significant number identify as underrepresented minorities. All program participants, regardless of academic major or professional interest, are required to learn about marine science and work in the shipboard laboratory. The technical skills and environmental literacy gained through an SEA experience shape tomorrow&rsquo;s researchers, policy-makers, conservation stewards, and leaders.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/27/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Deborah&nbsp;S&nbsp;Goodwin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1624253/1624253_10421221_1493315365422_SEA1_RobertCSeamans--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1624253/1624253_10421221_1493315365422_SEA1_RobertCSeamans--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Sailing Oceanographic Research Vessel\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1624253/1624253_10421221_1493315365422_SEA1_RobertCSeamans--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Sailing Oceanographic Research Vessel\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">One of Sea Education Association's ships, the SSV Robert C.
