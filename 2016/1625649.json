 "awd_abstract_narration": "Organic chemistry is required for college students majoring in a variety of STEM disciplines. Traditionally, this course has been viewed as a gatekeeper and students have considered the laboratory experience as an isolated and irrelevant use of their time. Reformed teaching methods that increase the relevance of the laboratory and increase student success have proven challenging to deliver, especially when laboratories are taught by graduate teaching assistants. This project, which builds on prior NSF-funded work (DUE Awards #1245160 and #1245176), will develop, implement, and study innovative and easy-to-adopt studio-based organic lab modules. These modules will transform the traditional 3-4 hour organic laboratory into a meaningful learning experience involving trouble-shooting problems and honing lab skills. The project is a collaborative effort between a research university (Rochester Institute of Technology) and a community college (Monroe Community College), which will ensure the materials are appropriate for use in both two-year and four-year settings. In collaboration with regional partners, studies will be conducted to evaluate student learning in other settings, as well as the ease of module adoption, student performance, and retention rates.\r\n\r\nThis project leverages earlier work developing a studio-based organic laboratory curriculum for two-year and four-year colleges, and promoting its broadened development and implementation. Central goals of the project are enhancing students' meaningful learning and engagement with organic chemistry, and developing a model for implementation of reform-based curricula. To determine the impact of this approach, the project will measure student learning and success, and evaluate the ease and fidelity of module adoption at collaborating institutions. Given the diverse population of students across the institutions committed to adopt the materials and the proximity to the National Technical Institute for the Deaf, further studies will identify retention trends for a diverse set of student populations. This will contribute to developing a more diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. The results will be disseminated broadly via a PI-sponsored conference, peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, a website, and a textbook partnership.",
