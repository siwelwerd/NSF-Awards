 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding the structure and evolution of matter at the nanometer and atomic scales is central for discovery and innovation in science and technology, accelerating advances in materials science, condensed matter physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, geology, and medicine. This Science and Technology Center (STC) aims to advance and integrate different imaging modalities using electron, X-ray, optical, and nano-probe microscopy to collectively tackle major scientific challenges. It brings together an interdisciplinary team from University of Colorado at Boulder; Universities of California at Berkeley, Los Angeles, and Irvine; Florida International University; and Fort Lewis College, in partnership with national laboratories, US industries, and international collaborators.\r\nEducation and Diversity: This STC develops, implements, assesses, and disseminates new programs to educate a diverse group of students to be innovative and globally competitive in imaging science and technology. It focuses particularly on two signature efforts: (i) new multidisciplinary graduate certificate and degree programs and (ii) multi-year, cross-institutional undergraduate, master's, and Ph.D. degree programs. The center's education activities are designed to realize the following version of the future: K-12 students will apprehend the exciting opportunities of science and engineering careers. Undergraduate students will appreciate the connections between different areas of science and engineering, as well as the relation between these fields and industry. Ph.D. graduates will acquire expertise with depth and breadth to innovate, lead team research, and create new technologies through entrepreneurship.\r\nKnowledge Transfer: This STC aims to manifest through national and international leadership in cutting-edge imaging science, highly-needed diverse graduates trained in multidisciplinary science, and a plethora of hybrid/adaptive imaging modalities and tabletop systems, enabling new science to emerge in the upcoming decades, as well as technology transfer to industry and emerging startups. Faster, higher-resolution and more sensitive imaging techniques will benefit a wide range of scientific disciplines as well as various industrial sectors, which can directly translate technological advances to improving the economy and the standard of living.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description of the Center Research:\r\nA major goal of this STC is to address key cross-cutting challenges common to all imaging modalities and tackle science grand challenges across different disciplines. When advances in high-speed direct detectors, advanced algorithms, big-data manipulation methods, new light and electron sources (including tabletop coherent X-ray sources), and spectrally/spatially/temporally structured illumination are integrated, they can fundamentally transform imaging science to enable real-time three-dimensional functional imaging. In addition, by combining electron with optical imaging, or coherent X-ray imaging with ultrafast lasers, or coherent infrared spectroscopies with nano-probe imaging, scientists in this center investigate new hybrid and adaptive imaging modalities that far exceed current capabilities. An expected outcome is creation and integration of a new set of powerful and broadly applicable real-time imaging modalities that can image non-crystalline systems and implement dynamic imaging with a large field of view with chemical and magnetic contrast and with atomic/molecular/nanoscale resolution. Each imaging technique will be brought to reach its fundamental limits and integrated in hybrid/adaptive modalities that surpass the sum of the parts.",
