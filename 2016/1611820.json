 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) will be supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) as a distributed, multi-user national facility that will provide the natural hazards research community with access to research infrastructure that will include earthquake and wind engineering experimental facilities, cyberinfrastructure, computational modeling and simulation tools, and research data, as well as education and community outreach activities. NHERI will be comprised of separate awards for a Network Coordination Office (NCO), Cyberinfrastructure, Computational Modeling and Simulation Center, and Experimental Facilities (EFs), including a post-disaster, rapid response research (RAPID) facility. Awards made for NHERI will contribute to NSF's role in the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction Program (NEHRP) and the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program. NHERI continues NSF's emphasis on earthquake engineering research infrastructure previously supported under the George E. Brown, Jr. Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation as part of NEHRP, but now broadens that support to include wind engineering research infrastructure. NHERI has the broad goal of supporting research that will improve the resilience and sustainability of civil infrastructure, such as buildings and other surface and underground structures, levees, and critical lifelines, against the natural hazards of earthquakes and windstorms, in order to reduce loss of life, damage, and economic loss. Information about NHERI resources is available at the DesignSafe-ci.org web portal. \r\n\r\nNHERI EFs will provide access to their experimental resources, user services, and data management infrastructure for NSF-supported research and education awards.  As part of the NHERI EF portfolio, this award will support the NHERI RAPID facility, headquartered at the University of Washington. The scientific goal of the RAPID facility is to support natural hazard researchers to conduct next generation RAPID research through reliable acquisition and community sharing of high-quality, post-disaster data sets that will enable characterization of civil infrastructure performance under natural hazard loads, evaluation of the effectiveness of current and previous design methodologies, calibration of computational models used to predict civil infrastructure component and system response to natural hazards, and development of solutions for resilient communities. In support of this goal, this facility will provide the following resources: (1) a portfolio of state-of-the-art data collection tools (including geomatics technologies; image capture and laser scanning equipment; seismological, wind, and inundation instruments; and unmanned aircraft systems, among others); (2) new software tools to aid in data collection and processing; (3) education, outreach, and training services; (4) advisory services to assist reconnaissance teams with the planning of safe and successful field missions for data collection; and (5) a headquarters that includes a 3D mini Computer Automated Virtual Environment (CAVE) for viewing and preliminary analysis of the various forms of image data collected during field campaigns. As a community resource, the facility will: (1) support acquisition of an unprecedented amount of perishable, post-disaster, high-quality, open data by the natural hazards community; (2) provide learning and training opportunities in post-disaster reconnaissance; (3) promote public engagement with science and technology through a citizen science data collection initiative; and (4) develop new and strengthen existing international research partnerships by establishing collaborations with foreign organizations during global deployments.  This facility will also host students as part of the NCO's Research Experiences for Undergraduates program.",

Based at the University of Washington (UW), the RAPID Facility is a collaboration between UW, Oregon State University, Virginia Tech, and the University of Florida. During the award period, the RAPID Facility provided the natural hazards and disaster research communities with the hardware, software, and support services needed to collect, process, and analyze perishable field data following natural hazards and disaster events. Major activities of the RAPID Facility included (i) acquisition, maintenance, and operation of state-of-the-art data collection instrumentation; (ii) development and support of the mobile application \"RApp\" (RAPID app) to enable interdisciplinary field reconnaissance; (iii) providing advisory services and basic logistics support for research missions; (iv) facilitation of the systematic archiving, processing, and visualization of acquired data in DesignSafe, the NHERI cyberinfrastructure partner; (v) training a broad user base through workshops and other activities; and (vi) public engagement, community outreach, and education. As part of facility development, the RAPID acquired and commissioned over 100 unique field data collection instruments, including laser (lidar) scanners, uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs, or \"drones\"), seismometer and accelerometer arrays, ground investigation equipment, a hydrographic (bathymetry) survey vessel, high-resolution imaging equipment, and water level gauges, among others.</p>\n<p>As a new NHERI Facility, the RAPID progressed through three phases of development and operation, with Year 1 (Phase 1) focused mainly on soliciting community input and developing resource requirements for the facility, Year 2 (Phase 2) dedicated primarily to the acquisition and commissioning of instrumentation and training, and Years 3 to 5 (Phase 3) focused on user services, field operations, and continued training. The RAPID Facility began supporting field deployments in September 2018 and, since then, has deployed equipment and/or staff on more than 70 deployments worldwide in support of over 50 research organizations during the award period. Collectively, these research deployments have generated over 107 terabytes of unique natural hazard and disaster reconnaissance data archived on DesignSafe. RAPID Facility deployments included many significant, high-profile natural hazard extreme events, including Hurricanes Florence, Michael, and Dorian, the 2018 Palu-Donggala earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the 2018 Hokkaido Eastern Iburi earthquake in Japan, the 2018 Anchorage earthquake, the 2019 Ridgecrest earthquake, among other disasters.</p>\n<p>The RAPID Facility has developed a unique training curriculum, which has been used to instruct over 200 natural hazard and disaster researchers on post-event field reconnaissance techniques, instrumentation data acquisition, and data processing. In addition, the facility has hosted numerous in-person training events, including the RAPID 4-Day Intensive Training Workshop, its flagship training event held each summer at its headquarters in Seattle. The RAPID Facility also provided rich and inspiring research experiences for ten undergraduate students through its research experiences for undergraduates (REU) program. The facility has also raised awareness of natural hazards among members of the public through its participation in UW's Discovery Days celebration for engineering, which hosts over 5000 K-12 student visitors annually.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/20/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joseph&nbsp;Wartman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1611820/1611820_10458468_1640047139464_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1611820/1611820_10458468_1640047139464_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1611820/1611820_10458468_1640047139464_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example and and analysis products from the RAPID-supported investigation of the 2018 Camp, California wildfire (Project Leads: Erica Fischer and Sara Hamideh, Oregon State University).
