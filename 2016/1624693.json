 "awd_abstract_narration": "A request is made to fund additional and back-up instrumentation for the R/V Blue Heron, an 86 foot Coastal Vessel owned by the University of Minnesota and operated by the Large Lakes Observatory as part of the University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) research fleet. \r\n\r\nThe Large Lakes Observatory operates the largest university-owned research vessel on the Great Lakes, the R/V Blue Heron. Built in 1985 for fishing on the Grand Banks, the Blue Heron was purchased by the University of Minnesota in 1997, sailed from Portland, Maine, up the St. Lawrence Seaway to Duluth, and converted into a limnological research vessel during the winter of 1997-98. She is outfitted with state-of-the-art research equipment, has berthing for 11 crew and scientists, and can operate 24 hours per day for up to 21 days in between port calls. The Blue Heron is part of the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS), and is available for charter by research scientists on any of the Great Lakes. In 2015, the vessel completed 40 funded days where 6 (15%) were for NSF. In 2016, Blue Heron is currently scheduled for 61 days, 23 of these (38%) will be for NSF.\r\n\r\nOceanographic Instrumentation requested in this proposal includes:\r\n\r\nMeteorological sensors/weather station upgrade\t$7,752\t\r\nPosition and Orientation System upgrade\t$87,363\t\r\npCO2 sensor for underway system\t$28,011\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t$123,126\t\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\nThe principal impact of the present proposal is under Merit Review Criterion 2 of the Proposal Guidelines (NSF 13-589). It provides infrastructure support for scientists to use the vessel and its shared-use instrumentation in support of their NSF-funded oceanographic research projects (which individually undergo separate review by the relevant research program of NSF).  The acquisition,  maintenance and operation of shared-use instrumentation allows NSF-funded researchers from any US university or lab access to working, calibrated instruments for their research, reducing the cost of that research, and expanding the base of potential researchers.",

This equipment will help the scientists that use the vessel by improving and increasing the scientific data that they are able to collect.\n\n \n\nThe upgrades and new equipment were necessary for the following reasons: 1) due to age, our original meteorological system data translator was unable to send the necessary output to our data acquisition system; 2) the ship?s position and orientation system was eighteen years old, which was eight years longer than the manufacturer expected the units to last.  More importantly, the manufacturer was no longer providing updates for our original system; and 3) we added a pCO2 sensor to our underway seawater sampling system, a piece of equipment that we did not have but that is common on other research vessels in the U.S. Academic Fleet.  This sensor will allow researchers to expand their scope of work on the Blue Heron.\n\n \n\nAll of this gear is available to all users of the R/V Blue Heron, including the six National Science Foundation funded projects that are using the vessel in 2019.  Besides the NSF funded projects, we are supporting several other science projects in 2019: two Great Lakes Observing System (NOAA) cruises, a State of Minnesota Department of Natural Resources cruise, and multiple research and educational cruises funded by the University of Minnesota.
