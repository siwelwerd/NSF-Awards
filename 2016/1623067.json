 "awd_abstract_narration": "The world is embracing a new type of engineer - a design thinker who is innovative, flexible, and collaborative. This project aims to transform the offerings of a traditional engineering department with a new curriculum model that emphasizes design and innovation approaches, offering students a variety of pathways to a degree in a program with disciplinary depth and a range of learning experiences. This adaptive kind of engineering professional is in demand by creative industries that are committed to blending science, engineering, arts, and design to address the world's problems. The department's current curriculum is composed mostly of traditional engineering courses that are lecture and exam-heavy, with little opportunity for experiential learning or open-ended design. A combination of approaches will be developed that includes providing multiple paths through the curriculum for students, giving them the freedom to choose a variety of concentrations - from biomedical applications to digital arts - and providing outreach opportunities for K-12 students in underserved and underrepresented populations. These innovations will allow the department to attract a broader pool of students and prepare them for a wide variety of careers. These improvements not only broaden the diversity of students entering the program, they expand students' academic experiences and design and innovation skills. Applying this concept to an entire department curriculum will allow for the creation of a sustainable and scalable participatory curriculum that can be replicated by other programs. This project will also spur new connections with industry leaders, enhancing students' academic experiences while providing regional economic benefits.\r\n\r\nThe vision of this project is to transform Virginia Tech's Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering from a department with narrow curricular paths that attracts and produces a limited range of traditional engineers to one that draws and retains a wider pool of students and prepares them to be holistic professionals for a broader range of careers. To implement this vision the project will create and implement a reproducible process of curriculum transformation that dramatically enhances the emphasis on design and innovation. By combining threshold concepts theory and design-based learning, a department with just two highly determined paths - electrical engineering and computer engineering - becomes one overarching program. The multiple curricular pathways will be anchored in real world problems, forging new connections to K-12 education and to 21st century industries, including start-ups, design consultancies, and non-governmental organizations. This re-design process - broadening the pool of students entering the department while increasing potential career opportunities - is learner-centered, stakeholder-informed, and features assessment and evaluation efforts that can be used to continuously improve education in support of holistic professional development, ensuring it is sustainable and replicable within the time and resource constraints faced by any major engineering department.",

In addition to the in-department major, the new structure includes a secondary focus to provide professional breadth.&nbsp; The student can choose their secondary focus to be in the department or from some other program in the university if they have an interest that goes beyond ECE. This approach then allows the option of customizing the secondary focus with an individualized plan, which is highly popular with students and aids in the formation of their professional identities.&nbsp; This new program structure provides much more flexibility for students than the previous program, which had different sophomore years for the two degrees, and locked students into a prescribed set of departmental courses until their senior year.&nbsp; An outcome of the project is that when a student now introduces themselves at group meetings, they no longer just say, \"I'm an EE major,\" they say for example \"I'm an EE majoring in Robotics &amp; Autonomy with a secondary focus in Green Engineering.\"&nbsp; This transformation has been one of the most exciting and gratifying of the journey through the change process.</p>\n<p>Another key outcome of the project is that the new program structure and the new courses for the first two years of the program were developed using a participatory design process of faculty, advisors, and other stakeholders. Over the course of the project, several different working groups were created to explore various aspects in the design and implementation of the new program. An outgrowth of these working groups was the realization by the faculty that improving student success required better coordination between sections of the same courses and between different courses that cover related material.&nbsp; Since it is critical that the courses in the first two years be tightly coordinated, the department leadership worked with instructors to develop a cross-course coordination process. While this coordination process is still evolving, it constitutes a significant cultural change in the department in the form of pedagogy-based communication between faculty.</p>\n<p>The project has also resulted in a better understanding of the stakeholders of department, including students, faculty, advisors, and alumni.&nbsp; One team member conducted over fifty semi-structured interviews with stakeholders, covering engineering knowledge, identity, image, and diversity, and revealed concerns such as carework, sense of belonging, advising, and student success, particularly non-traditional forms of student success. The <em>Engineering Visibility</em><strong> </strong>podcast was created to foster a sense of community and facilitate communication within the ECE department within some of the less-dominant communities. This limited episode podcast featured several ECE affiliated individuals discussing different topics of interest and concern within the ECE department, such as non-traditional students, inclusion and diversity, gender, going to graduate school, and first-generation students.&nbsp; The project also hosted a workshop called \"Change techniques for leadership and grass roots\" with approximately 30 attendees from Virginia Tech's northern Virginia campuses, other 4-year universities, and Virginia community colleges. The purpose of the workshop was to explore techniques for departmental change initiatives for both leadership and grass roots efforts, from a range of stakeholder perspectives, based upon what we have learned from our RED grant. The workshop covered three main topics: 1) understanding the target audience of students and other stakeholders, 2) making a sustainable change, and 3) exploring the pedagogical approaches of threshold concepts and project-based learning.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/14/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Thomas&nbsp;L&nbsp;Martin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623067/1623067_10439580_1663164014290_new-program-structure--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623067/1623067_10439580_1663164014290_new-program-structure--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"New curricular program structure for Virginia Tech Electrical and Computer Engineering\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623067/1623067_10439580_1663164014290_new-program-structure--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"New curricular program structure for Virginia Tech Electrical and Computer Engineering\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The new curricular program structure that resulted from the Virginia Tech ECE RED grant.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Virginia Tech Dept. of ECE</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Thomas&nbsp;L&nbsp;Martin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">New curricular program structure for Virginia Tech Electrical and Computer Engineering</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623067/1623067_10439580_1663164706511_base-course-ideation--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623067/1623067_10439580_1663164706511_base-course-ideation--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Faculty brainstorming session on new courses\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623067/1623067_10439580_1663164706511_base-course-ideation--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Faculty brainstorming session on new courses\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image shows Virginia Tech ECE faculty at a brainstorming session on courses for the new program structure.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Virginia Tech Dept. of ECE</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Thomas&nbsp;L&nbsp;Martin</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Faculty brainstorming session on new courses</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623067/1623067_10439580_1663165015353_engineering-visibility-podcast--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623067/1623067_10439580_1663165015353_engineering-visibility-podcast--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Engineering Visibility podcast\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1623067/1623067_10439580_1663165015353_engineering-visibility-podcast--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Engineering Visibility podcast\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The Engineering Visibility podcast (https://icat.vt.edu/projects/red/podcast.html) was created to foster a sense of community and facilitate communication within the ECE department within some of the less-dominant communities.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Virginia Tech/Annie Y.
