 "awd_abstract_narration": "Addressing the grand challenges of the 21st century requires engineers who are critical thinkers, problem solvers, and able to understand the societal contexts in which they are working. Educating students in these areas requires a multi-faceted approach that addresses motivation and identity as a means to ensure a diverse workforce. The Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBE) at the University of New Mexico plans to revolutionize undergraduate education by launching FACETS: Formation of Accomplished Chemical Engineers for Transforming Society. FACETS will revolutionize CBE by (1) introducing \"CIRE\" design challenges in the core curriculum that are Community-, Industry-, Research-, and/or Entrepreneurship-based; (2) conducting professional development institutes that will train and mentor faculty and graduate students; workshops will be led by experts from industry and national laboratories, from the learning sciences, from engineering education and multicultural studies, for example the directors of UNM Native American Studies and Chicano/a Studies, and (3) create a digital badging system will help students take ownership of their competencies and develop engineering identities and enable faculty to monitor and assess student outcomes and to engage in research on their teaching. The CIRE design challenges, digital badging system and implementation plan will be transferrable to many intermediate to large institutions through the use of a modular approach. Local industry and community partners will participate in presenting the design challenges and encourage entrepreneurial thinking. The use of community engagement through design challenges will engage students in developing their sociotechnical awareness and attract diverse, native and rural populations into engineering.\r\n\r\nThe field of chemical engineering has evolved over the past century - originating in the petrochemical industries - but now includes electronic materials processing, pharmaceutical production and product design, such as nanoparticles, tissue engineering, nano-medicine, etc. However, the chemical engineering undergraduate core curriculum has not fully reflected this transformation. In order to reposition chemical engineering to educate students prepared for future challenges, the project team will create and study design challenges and digital badges. The project is underlain by a theory of change based on research on engineering education, guided by a broad research question: How can a digital badging system paired with design challenges support students to develop professional identity and an understanding of engineering as an innovative field? The project will result in new understanding of how to engage faculty to support diverse students to be successful in engineering. It will lead to sustained change in the department, including: the ability to prepare diverse engineers ready to solve the challenges of tomorrow; partnerships with industry, national labs and communities; and a model for how to revolutionize undergraduate education.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The University of New Mexico Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering (CBE) sought to support their diverse students - who bring myriad assets from their cultural and everyday lives - to become chemical engineers uniquely capable of empathizing with and addressing human needs and grand challenges. Prior to beginning the FACETS (Formation of Accomplished Chemical Engineers for Transforming Society) project, our department fell short of reflecting our state's demographics, especially in terms of the graduating class. We addressed this need through the following strategies:</p>\n<p>(1) We adapted Kotter's Change model to plan our revolution. Past research suggested Kotter's model might be a poor fit for higher education. We found Kotter's model provided an accessible way to get started. We found Kotter's model to be accessible, but too rigid. Based on this, we created the <em>design-based change model</em> for guiding change process in higher education, which retains the accessibility of Kotter's model while providing guidance on iterative improvement.</p>\n<p>(2) We developed an embedded community of practice (ECoP) to support sustainable faculty learning about pedagogy through a sequence of efforts: (a) We offered professional development workshops given by near-peers - engineering faculty who have already implements pedagogical innovations - paired with open discussion, which helped faculty understand benefits and challenges, and plan adaptations for their own contexts. (b) We developed new assessments that are better aligned to pedagogical innovations: the Design Skills Test evaluates students' problem framing abilities in design; we developed a survey to measure students' understanding of the nature of design; and we supported faculty to develop innovative assessments that promote learning, such as portfolios, projects, and collaborative exams. (c) An embedded learning scientist supported faculty to collaborate on engineering education research, resulting in more than 30 peer-reviewed papers/proceedings. (d) We brought discussions of teaching into faculty meetings and department retreats. While past research has focused on development almost exclusively for change-ready faculty who show up to faculty development workshops, we found change-hesitant faculty also play a key role in departmental change. By forming a department-embedded community of practice, change-hesitant faculty can be met where they are and be supported to change their instruction. Faculty demonstrated increased care to students and each other in nuanced ways, including sportsmanship, courtesy, and civic virtue, known as Organizational Citizenship Behaviors. Instructors who demonstrated civic virtue were able to demand much from students, who in turn rose to meet high expectations.</p>\n<p>(3) To foster student engagement and attract diverse students to engineering, we created and implemented design challenges in core courses. Previously, some believed authentic design challenges could only be completed by students with extensive technical background. We found that even first-year students can design technically and socially minded solutions to difficult problems. In fact, and surprisingly, first-year students who worked on our design challenges showed greater development toward being expert designers than seniors enrolled in a design course as their first design experience. We also identified engineering assets that our diverse students gain from their everyday and cultural experiences, making them, in some ways, more prepared to become innovative and empathetic engineers, compared to their more privileged peers.</p>\n<p>We developed the Educative Design Problem Framework as guidance on what makes an effective design problem; they should (a) be relevant to students' lives or experiences, such as by connecting to their prior everyday or cultural experiences, by connecting to a current or regional event; (b) include social factors that intersect meaningfully with technical aspects; (c) have a <em>low-bar entry</em> in that the problem itself is easy to understand; and (d) have a <em>high-bar ceiling</em> in that students can solve the problem in various ways that can challenge them.</p>\n<p>(4) We developed strategies engineering faculty can use to teach students technical writing and to teach content through writing. While much of the writing instruction in engineering has previously focused on details of grammar and word choice, we found that students developed as writers and learned more content when they (a) received feedback that prompted them to think as writers, (b) received specific, limited feedback, (c) revised their writing, and (d) reflected on writing as a learning process.</p>\n<p>As a result of these changes, we supported students to take ownership of their competencies and develop engineering identities by focusing not on what deficits they may have, but on the assets and unique skills they bring to the program and to the field. We found that our first-generation students are more likely to finish their degrees on time, and that we retained women and Latine students are rates much higher than the national average.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/22/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Vanessa&nbsp;Svihla</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div
