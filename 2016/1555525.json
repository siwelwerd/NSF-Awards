 "awd_abstract_narration": "Biodiversity is being lost from ecosystems worldwide, and when it results in the loss of large-bodied species (megafauna) it can have major consequences for entire food webs, and the structure and function of those ecosystems. This study will examine a past major extinction of megafauna in order to understand the cascading effects on ecosystems. About 13,000 years ago many species of large mammals in the Americas became extinct. This research will examine the consequences of the loss of these large carnivores and herbivores from the food web to the remaining plant and animal communities. The responses seen at this long-ago event will be used to develop general concepts relevant to modern-day changes in plant and animal communities. This project will also make fossil data more easily accessible and interpretable, will improve museum collections, and will inform the public through outreach activities conducted by the Smithsonian Institution. This work will also provide graduate and undergraduate students with research experience that will strengthen the scientific workforce. \r\n\r\nThe consequences of the loss of tens of millions of large-bodied mammals about 13,000 years ago on the structure and functioning of ecosystems in the Americas will be examined in order to address four questions: How did the extinction of large-bodied mammals influence overall community structure and species interactions at the terminal Pleistocene; Did surviving species become more abundant or change their geographic distribution; What changes in morphology, if any, occurred in species that survived the extinction; Did surviving species alter their dietary niche in response to the extinction of megafauna? Patterns of abundance, distribution, diet and morphology in the surviving mammals both before and after the extinction event will be characterized. Using occurrence information from fossil database compilations, morphology and size will be determined by measuring fossil limbs and molars, and diet by using stable isotope analysis. These data will be integrated with reconstructions of vegetative communities using pollen databases and regional and global temperature records. An important ecological baseline for the understanding of contemporary trophic downgrading will be established by characterizing how terrestrial ecosystems were influenced by humans at an important point in human history.",

A major focus of conservation biology is geared towards developing an synoptic understanding of how their loss may impact contemporary ecosystems; a task made difficult by long-time lags inherent in ecological interactions. Employing a deeper time perspective provides insights into the crucial role megafauna play in ecosystem function and the erosion that occurs with their loss.&nbsp;In our project, we&nbsp;used the terminal Pleistocene megafauna extinction as an analogy for understanding ongoing and future biodiversity loss. We built an&nbsp;unparalleled late Quaternary fossil record spanning &gt;20,000 years by&nbsp;processing &gt;43,000 fossil elements from cave sites within the Edward&rsquo;s Plateau of Texas (including &gt;35,053 newly identified and 9,395 newly accessioned fossils). We employed modeling approaches, empirical characterizations of diet through stable isotopes, and 2D/3D imaging to quantify&nbsp;changes in ecological function, community structure/organization, and in surviving mammals immediately before and after the terminal Pleistocene megafauna extinction.&nbsp;Specific findings included: the mammal community in the Edward&rsquo;s Plateau was decimated by the extinction; most previously filled niches remain empty. Felidae showed the strongest ecological response, with the jaguar becoming an apex predator in the Holocene and shifting into the niche previously occupied by extinct sabertooth cats. Puma, previously absent, became common and occupied the dietary niche vacated by jaguar. Lagomorphs were the only herbivores to shift from browse to graze (i.e., towards C4 resources). Body size changes from the Pleistocene to Holocene were species-specific, with some animals (deer, hare) becoming significantly larger, and others smaller (bison, rabbits) or exhibiting no change to either climate shifts or biodiversity loss. Overall, the Holocene body size-isotopic niche was drastically reduced with considerable ecological complexity lost. Moreover, declines in functional diversity were greater than expected given biodiversity loss following both the terminal Pleistocene extinction and further historical ones, implying extinct taxa contributed higher than average ecological function. Functional distances between remaining species increased through time, leading to less functional redundancy in younger communities. Intriguingly, the introduction of exotic species such as Blackbuck, Axis deer<em>,&nbsp;</em>and<em>&nbsp;</em>Oryx in Texas has partially replaced some functional space lost at the terminal Pleistocene. We conclude biodiversity loss led to reorganization of survivors and many &lsquo;missing pieces&rsquo; within the modern community. )ur analysis demonstrates biodiversity loss can change the function of ecosystems, leaving them functionally depauperate and less resilient to future environmental challenges.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts</strong>.
