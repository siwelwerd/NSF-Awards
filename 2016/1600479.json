In particular, SEAM has become the leading conference venue in the U.S. for function-theoretic operator theory. SEAM 2016 will again span a broad swath of analysis, featuring three plenary speakers who will address topics in complex analysis (Stephen Gardiner), harmonic analysis (Alexander Volber), and approximation theory (Doron Lubinsky). A highlight of the meeting will be invited talks by five junior mathematicians: Tom Alberts, Kelly Bickel, Greg Knese, Shahaf Nitzan, and James Pascoe. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",
