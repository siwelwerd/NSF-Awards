 "awd_abstract_narration": "1638753 - Koomson\r\n\r\nThere exists a wide gap between basic principles of brain function and clinical research suitable for multicellular systems biology research because neither the single cell- nor the whole organ/organism-based instruments can provide data on both biological and clinical correlation.  Current research methodologies focus either on molecular or on the whole organ function, and existing methods are either unnatural, such as genetic modifications, or lack the depth to understand the brain as a system made of many million cells of different types. The objective of this exploratory project is to design, develop and implement a new class of \"living cellular devices\", combining 3D cerebral cortical cell cultures integrated in silk scaffolds with nanoscale optical and electronic devices to report data on real-time electrical activity of cells over long periods of time. The planned research is the first to use biometal-electroluminescence as a tool in biological research and to monitor/modulate electric activity of brain cellular systems. The instrument design exploits the unique optical and physical properties of robust biphotonic materials such as silk fibroin, which has shown great promise in realizing 3D optical elements, and fabrication of porous tissue scaffolds for cortical assembly integration.  The new device will have significant broader impacts in various science and engineering areas, ranging from disease pathways, drug development and bioengineering based on correct understanding the biological processes and the intervening factors. \r\n\r\n\r\nOptoelectronic technologies are often applied in biomedicine, especially in imaging and diagnostics. The combination of basic scientific knowledge with clinical knowledge is necessary to advance the field of translational research towards well-targeted discoveries, diagnostics and treatments. The main gap between the basic and clinical research laboratories are the technologies suitable for multicellular systems biology research because neither the single cell- nor the whole organ/organism-based devices can inform on both multicellular systems dynamics and clinical correlates of the biological process. Thus it is first necessary to develop integrated biological devices providing data with both biological and clinical correlation. The objective of this project is to design, develop and implement a new class of optoelectronic devices, combining biologically-relevant 3D cerebral cortical cell cultures homed in silk scaffolds with nanoscale, electroluminescent Zirconium electronics to report data on real-time electrical activity of the cells over long periods of time. The project is the first to use biometal-electroluminescence as a tool in biological research and to monitor/modulate electric activity of brain cellular systems. The research will contribute to neural technologies as a bridge between basic- and clinical-research using a combination of tools and principles from biology, medicine, engineering and material science. The \"living cellular devices\" developed will be the first self-reporting, noninvasive, biologically/clinically relevant and millimeter-size bioelectronic systems to be used in fundamental brain research ex vivo and in vitro. Electroluminescence properties of Zirconium will be investigated and characterized, following with determining the range of interaction between the electric and the light components within the device. The studies will focus on detecting the changes in extracellular electric fields generated by the dynamics of cell resting membrane potential (an intrinsic regulator of several biological processes) ranging from long-range low magnitude to millisecond-speed changes. Current methodologies used in the area focus on conversion of the light into the electric signal while the proposed research will reverse the convention by converting the electric signal into light and this in a noninvasive manner. The proposed instrument design exploits the unique optical and physical properties of robust biphotonic materials such as silk fibroin, which has shown great promise in realizing 3D optical elements, and fabrication of porous tissue scaffolds for cortical assembly integration.  The new optoelectronic device will have significant broader impacts in various science and engineering areas, ranging from drug development and bioengineering based on correct understanding of the biological processes and the intervening factors. The research will demonstrate a unique neuroengineering design that will allow studying brain functions in a cost- and time effective manner while keeping the high biological relevancy compared to the use of the laboratory animals or tools without biological components.",
