It is also a collection that is central to one of the most heavily subscribed graduate and undergraduate organismal biology education programs in the United States. This project will secure and make accessible the RWLC bird, mammal and parasite specimens in modern space-saving cabinetry within a new, centrally located campus collections center. This center will catalyze a campus-wide initiative that connects SUNY-ESF students from underrepresented groups, as \"Collections Ambassadors,\" to research, education, and leadership in environmental biology. A graduate student (Collections Assistant) will be trained in curatorial techniques and will make high-resolution images web-accessible in order to share them with Syracuse inner city high school students and ignite excitement about nature by viewing it up-close.  These collections and natural science educational connections will be important for students' career development. The public will be able to tour and view the collections through large windows onto the collections research space. \r\n\r\nAs our nation's biodiversity declines, societal need for natural history collections increases. However, the foundation for collections accessibility and future expansion is security. Many of RWLC vertebrate specimens date to the 1800s and early 1900s and current cabinetry is not much younger. Under present conditions, specimens are inaccessible due to overcrowding in inadequate and poorly sealing cabinets, pests, and lack of digitization. This project leverages a state award to finish a large climate-controlled space within an existing new building, which will house growing and heavily used collections and facilitate their digitization. The collections move will involve quantitative assessment, stabilization, and integrated pest management of specimens, as well as curation and data management training of Collections Ambassadors (undergraduate interns) and the Collections Assistant. As part of the reorganization, specimens will be re-arranged and digitized. The new drawers of digitized specimens and modern specimen arrangement will be the basis for collections-based research for generations of SUNY-ESF's emerging environmental leaders. Many of the RWLC's specimens are from New York's \"forever wild\" Adirondack Park, beloved by the RWLC's namesake President Theodore Roosevelt. Project results will be made available on the web (www.esf.edu/rwls/) and digitized specimen data will be shared with iDigBio (www.idigbio.org).",

The RWLC is the only entity bearing the Roosevelt name that was approved by United States President Theodore Roosevelt himself during his lifetime. At the RWLC, we are focused on cataloging the biological diversity of the United States, protecting and making accessible specimens to help educate field biologists and providing a research resource for assessing pressing environmental problems and guiding protection of its wilderness resources. The RWLC holds some of our county&rsquo;s most stark reminders of human impacts on the biota: passenger pigeons (<em>Ectopistes migratorius</em>; with data and egg), heath hens (<em>Tympanuchus cupido cupido</em>), and a pair of ivory-billed woodpeckers (<em>Campephilus principalis</em>), as well as research specimens of birds, mammals and plants from the 1800s, pre-dating RWLC&rsquo;s founding. Leading up to our NSF funding, RWLC collections were heavily used and unfortunately deteriorated due to inadequate space and antiquated cabinetry. We embarked upon a major rehousing project focused on our bird and mammal collections, which were most threatened by pest damage and lack of climate control. A major part of this project was investment in the training and career development of graduate and undergraduate Collections Assistants and Collections Interns, who fully participated in every aspect of the project, from specimen triage to beginning a major electronic databasing effort in Specify, thus moving our collections and their data into modern accessibility. Through this project, combined with funding from IMLS and a significant allocation from New York State, we were able to finish the construction of a new state of the art collections facility and equip it with well-sealing compactorized cabinetry to safely house our collections. In this NSF project we completely rehoused all of our birds and mammals, secured their data, and separated teaching from research specimens, so that each group of specimens could be properly cared for. We also organized specimens phylogenetically, and embedded collections cabinetry within a dedicated Roosevelt Wild Life Collections Classroom, where it is now very clear the central role that natural history specimens play in biology education and research. Over the past one hundred years, biology has become increasingly reductionist, and university collections like ours have suffered in the face of this change. Fortunately, biologists are increasingly realizing the value of whole specimens in addressing emerging questions about our changing environment and landscapes. At SUNY-ESF, where we educate the next generation of leaders in conservation biology and wildlife science, we hope to be at the forefront of the movement to reclaim the central role of authentic natural history specimens in biology. Our new RWLCC collections facility is at the heart of our campus, which conveniently connects SUNY-ESF's dedicated and passionate undergraduate and graduate students with our specimens and opportunities to learn museum techniques and thus explore new career paths. We have also worked to make our collections learning and working environment conducive to the exploration and respect of diverse perspectives and backgrounds, and accessible to a variety of people, including those traditionally underserved by scientific collections. Discussions and camaraderie among our collections students lead to inspiration about novel ways to use and promote the importance of collections within our campus community and to the broader public we serve. The success of our NSF project has led to the Roosevelt Wild Life Collections becoming a central force for catalyzing connections to the natural world on our urban campus in Syracuse, NY.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/17/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Rebecca&nbsp;J&nbsp;Rundell</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561706/1561706_10450378_1639785476082_PXL_20211207_192225515britegg--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561706/1561706_10450378_1639785476082_PXL_20211207_192225515britegg--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Brittney Hahn, Egg Collection, RWLC\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561706/1561706_10450378_1639785476082_PXL_20211207_192225515britegg--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Brittney Hahn, Egg Collection, RWLC\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Undergraduate Collections Intern Brittney Hahn (Roosevelt Wild Life Collections at SUNY-ESF, Syracuse, NY) working on the curation of Sudworth and Squires Egg Collections.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rebecca J.
