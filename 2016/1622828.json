 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) project will be to develop an intracellular delivery technology for positively charged peptides for use in cell experiments in basic laboratory science and for delivery of peptide therapeutics for treatment of human disease. Peptides hold many advantages over the small molecule drugs that dominate the current healthcare market in terms of potency, specificity, and biocompatibility, and they are faster and easier to implement than genetic modifications for completion of hypothesis-driven studies. Peptides can inhibit enzymes and alter protein-protein interactions to have profound effects on cellular behavior. Despite these advantages, peptides suffer from poor intracellular uptake and entrapment within intracellular compartments, thereby preventing access to their intracellular target and limiting their potential as research tools and therapeutics. Positively charged cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) will be used to improve peptide uptake by cells.  The proposed polyplex peptide delivery technology is designed to be a user-friendly reagent that further enhances CPP peptide uptake and dramatically improves potency and durability of action by enabling escape from intracellular compartments. The polyplex technology will fill this current gap in the delivery reagent market, bolstering peptide use and accelerating scientific advancement, and also enable peptide therapeutic approaches for intracellular targets.\r\n\r\nThis STTR Phase I project proposes to leverage the properties of an anionic pH-responsive polymer to provide a more cost-effective, easy-to-use peptide delivery reagent that increases peptide uptake and longevity of action without cellular toxicity. The proposed work is focused on achieving the following aims: 1) Optimize a standardized formulation protocol that is effective for a broad range of peptides modified with positively charged cell-penetrating peptides by analyzing the physicochemical properties of a library of peptide-reagent formulations. 2) Verify polyplex-mediated peptide delivery efficiency as assessed by cellular peptide uptake across a broad spectrum of cell types, including both adherent and suspension cells as well as hard-to-transfect primary cell lines. 3) Establish advantages over competing delivery reagents in terms of ease of use, potency, duration of intracellular retention, and activity and biocompatibility. These aims will be achieved through the use of dynamic light scattering analysis, flow cytometric analysis of peptide uptake and retention, microscopy-based analysis of intracellular peptide localization, and in vitro cytotoxicity assays. Successful completion of these studies will establish the commercial viability of the peptide delivery reagent and enable the subsequent development of a prototype reagent kit for field testing.",

The majority of peptide delivery reagents on the market today are positively charged lipids or polymers. These delivery reagents are primarily repackaged materials that were initially developed for delivery of negatively-charged nucleic acids and have limited effectiveness for peptides, especially those with positively-charged CPPs. In addition to an inability to deliver positively-charged cargo, these agents also suffer from toxicity and require prolonged treatment times. As a result, most researchers and pharmaceutical companies have fused peptides with positively charged CPPs. While these CPPs improve peptide internalization,the peptide cargo can remain entrapped in degradative compartments within cells, resulting in truncated efficacy and duration of action. Phase I studies investigated the efficacy of the Cytospear reagent with a library of peptides consisting of a therapeutic peptide fused to five different, widely utilized CPPs. The <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">objectives</span></strong> of this project were to develop an optimized Cytospear formulation and treatment protocol and demonstrate breadth of utility for different CPP-containing peptides across cell types. Metrics for success included peptide delivery efficiency, retention, and biocompatibility in comparison to commercially available reagents. <strong><em>At the end of Phase I, we have defined the key parameters that dictate Cytospear reagent mediated delivery of cell penetrating peptide modified peptides, displayed efficacy with multiple peptides in multiple cell types, and demonstrated clear competitive advantages over commercially available delivery reagents</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:</strong> The primary goal of this work is to provide a more cost-effective, easy-to-use, and efficient peptide delivery reagent that increases peptide uptake and longevity of action without cellular toxicity. A sequential delivery approach (i.e., treatment with the Cytospear reagent alone followed by treatment with the peptide alone) demonstrated efficacy with all peptides resulting in a 5- to 30-fold increase in peptide uptake compared to free peptide. Optimal peptide uptake was dependent on the dose of Cytospear reagent alone and not the ratio of Cytospear reagent to peptide. Furthermore, optimal peptide uptake occurred in the same Cytospear dose range across all peptides tested. Together, these results define the critical parameters needed to develop an optimized delivery reagent kit and user protocol that consistently works for a wide range of CPP modified peptides. Subsequent studies showed that peptide uptake was universally increased 5-30 fold in five different cell types, again in a consistent Cytospear reagent dose range. These data indicate that cell type has little influence on the optimal Cytospear reagent dose and that Cytospear promotes intracellular peptide delivery across a wide range of cell types. The efficacy of the Cytospear delivery reagent was compared to a number of commercially available peptide delivery reagents in terms of peptide uptake, retention, endosomal escape, and ease of use. A brief 30 minute treatment with Cytospear resulted in superior peptide uptake and intracellular peptide retention over a five-day period following treatment removal compared to all competing reagents. Toxicity testing revealed that Cytospear, at an optimized dose of 2.5 &micro;M, had no significant effects on cell viability, whereas several of the competing reagents displayed significant toxicity. We hypothesized that the enhanced peptide uptake and retention mediated by Cytospear is due to the superior ability of the Cytospear reagent to facilitate pH-triggered escape from endolysosomal compartments within cells, thereby preventing peptide degradation. To test this hypothesis, peptide endosomal escape was evaluated by measuring peptide co-localization with an endosomal dye. This study demonstrated that Cytospear significantly decreased peptide entrapment within endosomal vesicles compared to all competing reagents. These results suggest that the enhanced peptide retention afforded by the Cytospear reagent is due to the endosomal escape capability imparted by the pH-responsive Cytospear reagent.
