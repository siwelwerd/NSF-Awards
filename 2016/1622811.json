 "awd_abstract_narration": "Implementation Projects provide support to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the number of students receiving undergraduate degrees in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and enhance the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. The project at the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) seeks to build on previous successful efforts to increase participation of African-American students in STEM disciplines. A STEM Center will be established and focus on the recruitment, retention, and graduation rates of STEM students, as well as provide additional pedagogical training and upgrading of research skills to faculty. The goals of the project are to: provide STEM students with active support designed to highlight learning as an active and ongoing process and with enrichment as a complement to heighten students' academic performance beyond their current level of achievement; and provide faculty with activities that will expand their teaching and research skills so they will be better prepared to impart knowledge and assist in the development of students' skills as they forge successful mentor/mentee relationships and productive collaborations. \r\n\r\nThe following activities and strategies are designed to meet the project's goals: development of a discipline-specific Journal Club; workshops focusing on critical thinking skills to aid students in understanding the principles involved in the theory and practice of reasoned decision-making; STEM career explorations through activities that create opportunities for internships and employment; development of an Individual Development Plan to assist each student in determining educational paths that will eventually lead to her or his long-term career goal; a program for \"Near Completers\" for STEM students returning to the university requiring thirty or fewer credits to graduate; establishment of Academic Advancement Partnerships to create interactions between students and faculty at UDC and faculty and administrators at PhD granting institutions; utilization of the Advance Research Techniques Corp to teach research techniques; creation of a paradigm shift in pedagogy by utilizing the flipped classroom and collaborative learning; empowerment of faculty through mentor training; and support for faculty to conduct individual and collaborative research. The project strategies supporting these objectives are evidence-based and will be monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.",

Our emphasis in the Center includes enhancement of student skills by providing information and active support designed to highlight learning as an effective&nbsp; and ongoing process and enrichment as a complement to heighten one?s academic performance beyond his/her current&nbsp; level of achievement. Additionally, the Center provides support for faculty to expand their teaching and research competencies and to assist in the development of students? skills as they forge successful mentor/mentee relationships and productive collaborations. Our latest funding (National Science Foundation Human Resource Development &nbsp;1622811) encompasses the third cycle of funding for the university, which includes 2016 ? 2022.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit:&nbsp;</strong>The Center was designed specifically, for underrepresented minority (URM) undergraduate STEM students and STEM faculty.&nbsp; However, all university members were welcomed to participate in the enrichment activities of the Center. The concepts introduced either originated in the Center because of our extensive experiences in working with underrepresented STEM students or were accrued from data accumulated and modified from the published literature. The goals of the STEM Center Program were:&nbsp; 1) to provide STEM students with information and active support designed to highlight learning as an active&nbsp; and ongoing process and enrichment as a complement to heighten ones academic performance beyond his/her current&nbsp; level of achievement (Student Enhancement); and 2) to provide faculty with activities that will expand their teaching and research skills so they will be better prepared to impart knowledge and assist in the development of students? skills as they forge successful mentor/mentee relationships and productive collaborations (Faculty Enhancement). The Center built upon the successful activities implemented during the first and second HBCU-UP cycles and introduced new activities that enhance student enrichment and faculty development. To augment student learning and teacher effectiveness, we developed and enhanced the following activities: weekly Journal Club meeting (a faculty-led interdisciplinary forum that provides students with the most up-to-date information in the STEM disciplines), weekly Critical Thinking Skills Workshops, workshops on developing PowerPoint Presentations, introduced the Diversity Career Development Program presented by NIH post-doctoral fellows, established a partnership with the Danial Alexander Payne Community Development Cooperation to present Science Discovery Day to middle school students, required the Course in Responsible Conduct in Research, presented the Math-Science Gift Store to elementary school students, funded student presentations at local, regional, and national meetings, sponsored presentations by STEM Researchers (Local and National), sponsored junior faculty mentoring by senior STEM faculty, and funded faculty research support.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:&nbsp;</strong>The objectives achieved in the third grant cycle sought to reverse the trends that support the dearth of minorities in STEM professions.&nbsp; Additionally, the university has experienced an increase in faculty applying for and receiving extramural funding (full-time STEM faculty have applied for extramural funding with the majority receiving research assistance from the STEM Center). The Center has awarded research support to STEM faculty (27 of 52) through teaching, research, travel, and Mini-Grant support. Of the 27 STEM faculty receiving assistance, all have applied for extramural funding and 75% were successful. Faculty who began as recipients on STEM Center support are currently supporting our STEM Center students through their grant-funded research projects. The data indicated STEM Center students persisted even during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown when students initially did not expect to achieve their expectations or that, if they were completed, only adequately. The Center improved retention, and graduation rates of STEM students by providing them with a rigorous research and mentoring program, and specialized learning activities that translated to increased academic performance and graduation rates among students participating in STEM Center activities. Students and faculty regularly interacted through planned activities, resulting in a more collegial atmosphere. More faculty worked with students in research, mentoring, Journal Club, and special seminars and workshops. Our students presented at seven national meetings and two local meetings. A total of 34 presentations were made by students and the number of presentation awards was 10 during the 2021-2022 academic year. There were 14 students in the 2022 graduating class of STEM Center participants. All students graduated with honors (7 Summa Cum Laude, 4 Magna Cum Laude, 2 Cum Laude and 1 Honors). The evaluation results were positive, and our participants indicated a desire for more activities to be offered by the Center.
