 "awd_abstract_narration": "Earth scientists seek to understand the mechanisms of planetary evolution from a process perspective in order to promote the progress of science.  They model the chemistry of melting of the interiors of planets as a result of heat flow within the body.  They calculate the flows of energy and mass from the interior to the surface. They model the interaction of fluids and rocks, which drives chemical weathering and the formation of ore deposits.  They seek to understand the synthesis and stabilities of organic compounds and their economic and biological roles.  They study the interactions of atmosphere, oceans, biosphere and land as a dynamically coupled evolving chemical system. To achieve this level of understanding of planetary evolution, Earth scientists use software tools that encode two fundamentally different types of models: (1) thermodynamic models of naturally occurring materials, and (2) models of transport that track physical flows of both fluids and solids.  Much of the fundamental science of planetary evolution lies in understanding coupled thermodynamic and transport models. This grant funds development of a software infrastructure that supports this coupled modeling of the chemical evolution of planetary bodies.   It is their aim to establish an essential and active community resource that will engage a large number of researchers, especially early career scientists, in the exercise of model building and customization.  \r\n\r\nThis is a project to create ENKI, a collaborative model configuration and testing portal that will transform research and education in the fields of geochemistry, petrology and geophysics.  ENKI will provide software tools in computational thermodynamics and fluid dynamics.  It will support development and access to thermochemical models of Earth materials, and establish a standard infrastructure of web services and libraries that permit these models to be integrated into fluid dynamical transport codes. This infrastructure will allow scientific questions to be answered by quantitative simulations that are presently difficult to impossible because of the lack of interoperable software frameworks.  ENKI, via the adoption of state-of-the-art model interfacing (OpenMI) and deployment environments (HubZero), will modernize how thermodynamic and fluid dynamic models are used by the Earth science community in five fundamental ways: (1) provenance tracking will enable automatic documentation of model development and execution workflows, (2) new tools will assist users in updating thermochemical models as new data become available, with the ability to merge these data and models into existing repositories and frameworks, (3) automated code generation will eliminate the need for users to manually code web services and library modules, (4) visualization tools and standard test suites will facilitate validation of model outcomes against observational data, (5) collaborative groups will be able to share and archive models and modeling workflows with associated provenance for publication. With these tools we seek to transform the large community of model users, who currently depend on a small group of dedicated and experienced researchers for model development and maintenance, into an empowered ensemble of model developers who take ownership of the process and bring their own expertise, intuition and perspective to shaping the software tools they use in daily research.  ENKI development will be community driven.  Participation of a dedicated and diverse group of early career professionals will guide us in user interface development - insuring portal capabilities are responsive to user needs, and in development of a rich set of documentation, tutorials and examples.  All software associated with this project will be released as open source.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe consistent integration of computational thermodynamics and geodynamics is essential for exploring and understanding a wide range of processes in the Earth  from the production and motion of molten magma in the Earth?s interior to chemical alteration of  crust relevant to applications of geological carbon capture and storage. Nevertheless, considerable challenges remain for coupling thermodynamics and fluid-solid mechanics within computationally tractable, reproducible and insightful models. The goal of  the ENKI project is to provide critically needed new software infrastructure that enables a much broader array of users to develop and explore custom thermodynamic and geodynamic computational models driven by their own scientific needs but in a transparent and reproducible fashion.\n\nThe ENKI project is a multi-institutional collaboration under the leadership of Mark Ghiorso at OFM research and supports a wide range of users and scientific workflows (see  enki-portal.org for details). The principal focus of the Columbia component of this collaboration, however,  has been on the integration of computational thermodynamics with large scale open-system flow models that extends the design principals of our open-source modeling framework TerraFERMA (terraferma.github.io).  In close collaboration with OFM and the University of Michigan,  the ENKI project has developed several software packages (ThermoEngine and ThermoCodegen) that enable the  construction, documentation,  calibration  and exploration of  custom, reproducible thermodynamic models of phases and endmembers, as well as models of kinetic reactions. The key innovation has been to use symbolic python (SymPy) to describe thermodynamic model choices at a high-level then use automatic differentiation and code-generation to build  efficient custom libraries for inclusion in a wide range of workflows.  Current software supports a common API for thermodynamic properties of materials with bindings in C, C++ and python.\n\nIn addition to software development,  the Columbia team has also made contributions to the theory and modeling of open-system disequilibrium transport and has demonstrated its behavior in computationally tractable  coupled fluid/solid models that include consistent thermodynamics and kinetics.  These models have been applied to magma dynamics in the mantle and hydration/carbonation reactions in the crust.  This research forms part of the training and professional development of several graduate students.  By making model choices more transparent and custom models easier to construct and share, this project should significantly expand the utility of computational thermodynamics and geodynamics to the Earth science community.\n\nWhile the driving applications (and critical need) for this software have arisen from the Earth Science community,  the computational infrastructure developed by ENKI is generally applicable to any problem that requires reproducible custom thermodynamic models of materials.  Thus this software should be of immediate use and impact in a wide range of scientific and engineering fields including chemistry, material science and civil and environmental engineering. Our current emphasis on modeling low temperature hydration and carbonation of brittle materials could also have important impacts for evaluating the efficiency and utility of engineered solutions for carbon capture and storage.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/13/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marc Spiegelman"
