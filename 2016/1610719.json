 "awd_abstract_narration": "Power electronics - electronic circuits that process energy - plays a key enabling role in a wide range of energy-efficient and renewable-energy technologies, and is also essential for powering other types of electronic systems.  Smaller, more efficient, and less costly power electronics are critical to continued improvement of all these systems. Magnetic components such as inductors and transformers are typically the largest and usually lossy components in power electronics.  Moreover, limitations in magnetic component design have been a major obstacle to realizing substantial improvements in miniaturization.   To date, advances in power electronics have been enabled by increases in operating frequency, but limitations in magnetics technologies are inhibiting continuation of this trend.  This project will develop design methods for high-frequency magnetics, mitigating these limitations, and will apply them to develop miniaturized, high-efficiency power electronics.  The results will be useful across many different applications in electronic systems, efficient end-use of energy, and renewable energy systems, reducing their cost and improving their energy efficiency.  The project will engage undergraduate and graduate students in the research, strengthening their skills in this important area.  Participation of under-represented groups will be sought, and research participants will be carefully mentored.  An ongoing research collaboration between Dartmouth and MIT will be strengthened and extended to include educational activities, including outreach to K-12 students to promote science and engineering.\r\n\r\nA key route to improvement of power electronics is the development of converters that operate efficiently at substantially higher switching frequencies than are presently used (e.g., in the High-Frequency, or HF, range of 3-30 MHz). Higher switching frequencies result in reduced energy storage requirements of the passive components (including magnetic components), which can be leveraged to reduce size and cost of power electronics, and to improve performance (e.g., higher bandwidth.)  Joint advances in high-frequency power circuits and magnetic component design are needed to realize these benefits.  Advances have been hindered both by a lack of performance data for HF magnetic materials and a poor understanding of how to design power magnetics for HF.  Recent work has revealed that some commercial low-permeability magnetic materials have high performance in this frequency range, enabling substantial miniaturization of power electronics (e.g., factors of 2-10 reduction in overall size) if magnetic component and circuit designs leveraging these materials can be developed.  The proposed research program will develop design methods for power magnetic components at HF frequencies utilizing low-permeability materials, and will further investigate how these components can best be applied to realize high-density, high-efficiency power electronics.  The research will develop design techniques for achieving reduced core and winding losses with low permeability materials; investigate optimized core and winding geometries; create improved models and designs for high-frequency windings, and develop new self-shielding HF magnetic structures.  Moreover, power converter designs that can effectively leverage the capabilities of these HF magnetic components will be investigated and applied to realize miniaturized power electronics operating at HF.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPower electronics is a key technology behind current and future efficient energy technology and high-performance computing.  One of the fundamental advantages of power electronics over older electrical power technologies is the ability to use high switching frequencies.  Simple theory predicts that the physical size, weight and cost of transformers and inductors--essential components of such systems--can be scaled down inversely proportional to the switching frequency, with losses also reduced.  However various high-frequency effects in both magnetic cores and in windings rapidly increase power losses at higher frequencies.  These effects limit the performance of power converters operating at conventional frequencies and limit the potential for increased frequency to yield further improvements.\n\nSpecifically, most power electronics operates in or below the \"medium-frequency\" (MF) range (300 kHz to 3 MHz), where techniques for designing and fabricating high-performance efficient magnetic components are well developed.  This project developed solutions to key challenges that inhibit achieving similar performance in the \"high-frequency\" (HF) range (3 MHz to 30 MHz).  These include design innovations and improved modeling and optimization techniques, a few of which are highlighted below.\n\nOne key innovation is a new geometric configuration for the core and winding of an inductor that greatly reduces losses.  The core configuration shapes the magnetic field in the winding region to spread current evenly over both surfaces of the winding, resulting in more than a factor of five reduction in losses compared to a typical inductor design.  The new design also facilitates a modular manufacturing approach in which a relatively small number of sizes of simple, standardized core pieces can be used to assemble near-optimal inductor cores for a wide range of different applications.  The approach was successfully demonstrated in a 250 W power converter.\n\nOne of the standard techniques for reducing transformer and inductor winding loss in the MF range is the use of litz wire--finely stranded wire constructed in configurations that prevent eddy currents from circulating and balance the current between strands.  In the HF range, previous models indicated that litz wire had little benefit.  However, those models were not accurate for the HF range.  We demonstrated theoretically and in practice that, with careful design, litz wire can provide greater benefits in the HF range than previously expected.  Design details that are unimportant in the MF range become important in the HF range, making the design and modeling more difficult, but opening opportunities for improvements when more options are considered.  In particular, we showed that arranging the strands of a litz wire in a hollow-core configuration is beneficial for many designs in the HF range, further increasing the benefit it can provide beyond that expected based on simplified models.  Applying litz wire optimized according to the new methods in the new inductor configuration provided a further 25% loss reduction.\n\nThe project included mentoring and training of students ranging from a high-school intern through MS and PhD students to post-doctoral trainees, all of whom gained skill and experience with the research process and with specific skills that are in great demand as power electronics designs increasingly are limited by the performance of magnetic components.  Results have been published in international journals and are available in open repositories for the benefit of engineers and researchers worldwide.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/16/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Charles R Sullivan"
