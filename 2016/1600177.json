 "awd_abstract_narration": "Though research has been recognized as a high impact, inquiry-based practice to engage and retain undergraduate students, it is largely underutilized in the first two years of instruction. At two-year colleges in particular, students have even fewer opportunities to participate in authentic research projects.  The Austin Community College (ACC) project includes the development and implementation of: a Summer Undergraduate Research Experience Course (SUREC) and a field activity that engages students in research experience focused on scientific ocean drilling in their first two years of higher education.  The significance of the project is that it will capture the attention of incoming undergraduate students by engaging them in a research-based field activity during the school year and further their research experience through an intense inquiry-based learning in the summer.  This will advance the mission of the National Science Foundation's Improving Undergraduate science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) Education - GEOPATHS program by promoting and supporting students to continue in geosciences at the critical junctures.\r\n\r\nThrough a partnership with the University of Texas at Austin, the SUREC program will be open to students in their second year of study. ACC students will conduct research at a laboratory in the department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering (UT PGE). The research experience will begin with guided scientific ocean drilling investigations supported by class explanation, group meetings and related scientific reading assignments. As students identify research topics, lab equipment and procedures, student teams will research more independently. Students will present their research in-lieu of a final exam and also have opportunities to present their work at a local and/or national conference. SUREC and its evaluation materials will be developed over eight months, followed by two years of implementation and evaluation. The field activity will be open to both ACC science and non-science majors in their first or second year of higher education. Through a partnership with Texas A&M University, students enrolled in introductory geoscience courses will take a field trip to the Gulf Coast Repository, where over 100 kilometers of core from the Pacific Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico, and the Southern Ocean are located. Prior to the activity, students will complete pre-field activities including reading articles from scientific journals and exercises that related to the repository. After the visit, students will integrate findings to produce a term paper. The field activity will include four months for development of exercises and evaluation material, followed by two years of implementation and evaluation. By the end of the project, at least 24 second year students will have participated in the SUREC program and 150 first/second year non-science and science majors will have participated in the field activity.",

Early exposure to research experiences is effective in recruitment, diversity and persistence in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) degree programs, particularly among underrepresented minority students. At two-year colleges, students have fewer opportunities to participate in UREs. Through a partnership with the University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin) and the International Ocean Drilling Program at Texas A&amp;M University (IODP-TAMU), the Austin Community College (ACC) developed and implemented a Summer Undergraduate Research Experience Course (SUREC) and a course-based field activity to engage students in research experience focused on scientific ocean drilling. The significance of the project is that it captured the attention of incoming undergraduate students by engaging them in a course-based field activity during the school year and further their research experience through an intense inquiry-based learning in the summer.</p>\n<p>The course-based field activity was available to both science and non-science majors. Students worked in groups of five to six researching on a topic related to the earth's crust. About 3 weeks following the initial research, students visited the Gulf Coast Repository located at IODP-TAMU to examine sediment cores. Following the visit to the repository students formally presented their findings in the classroom. During the three-year program, 158 ACC students participated in the course-based field activity. Among the field activity participants, 91% agreed it was a good way to learn about the subject matter while 78% agreed that it had a positive effect on their interest in STEM.</p>\n<p>SUREC program was offered to twelve selected ACC undergraduate students each summer for two consecutive years. From the applicant pool, students were evaluated according to a rubric based on a combination of academic performance as determined by transcript evaluation, letters of recommendation, and students' personal essays. The SUREC program began with an orientation that included a warm welcome by the department chair, faculty and staff at the Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering, UT-Austin. Students also received a guided tour of the campus, an introduction to laboratories and facilities, and completed laboratory safety training during the orientation week. Students were also introduced to the one-on-one faculty-student mentoring, a critical component of the program to assist students by tracking their progress in the program and providing guidance on students' future education plans. During the 12-week program, students worked in groups of four and spent 12 hours per week engaging in authentic research. Following an introduction to scientific ocean drilling, research topics were carefully selected to focus on a question of interest to students, allowing for the development of at least one research hypothesis, and be able to investigate a research question within the constraints of the program. SUREC participants received a stipend of $2500 allowing students to take time off from employment obligations so they could focus on their research. Students presented their research findings in a conference-style poster at the department's summer poster symposium and submitted a video recorded poster presentations to the American Geophysical Union (AGU) virtual poster session. Among the SUREC participants, 100% agreed that their research experience has prepared them for a job, 92% agreed that doing research confirmed their interest in their fields of study and 83% transferred to a four-year institution withing two years of the SUREC program.</p>\n<p>For detailed infromation about the projects, please refer to following articles.</p>\n<p><span class=\"authors\">Kusali Gamage, James McCall, Hugh Daigle &amp; Chammi Miller</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"date\">(2021)</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"art_title\">Supporting STEM transfer students through cross-institutional undergraduate research experiences,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class=\"serial_title\">Journal of Geoscience Education,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10899995.2021.2005510\">https://doi.org/10.1080/10899995.2021.2005510</a></p>\n<p><span class=\"hlFld-ContribAuthor\">Scott,&nbsp;<span class=\"NLM_given-names\">L.</span></span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span class=\"hlFld-ContribAuthor\">Gamage,&nbsp;<span class=\"NLM_given-names\">K.</span></span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span class=\"hlFld-ContribAuthor\">Davis,&nbsp;<span class=\"NLM_given-names\">L.</span></span><span>, &amp;&nbsp;</span><span class=\"hlFld-ContribAuthor\">Petranotis,&nbsp;<span class=\"NLM_given-names\">K.</span></span><span>&nbsp;(</span><span class=\"NLM_year\">2020</span><span>).&nbsp;</span><span class=\"NLM_article-title\">Integrating research into introductory geoscience courses</span><span>.&nbsp;</span><em>NAGT: In the Trenches</em><span>,&nbsp;</span><em>10</em><span>(2),&nbsp;</span><span class=\"NLM_fpage\">2</span><span>&ndash;</span><span class=\"NLM_lpage\">3</span><span>.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/05/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kusali&nbsp;Gamage</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600177/1600177_10417758_1641063227559_picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600177/1600177_10417758_1641063227559_picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Field Activity\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600177/1600177_10417758_1641063227559_picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Field Activity\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Students participating in course- based field activity at the Gulf Coast Repository, Texas A&M University.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kusali Gamage</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kusali&nbsp;Gamage</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Field Activity</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600177/1600177_10417758_1641062391530_Picture3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600177/1600177_10417758_1641062391530_Picture3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SUREC poster\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600177/1600177_10417758_1641062391530_Picture3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SUREC poster\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">SUREC student presenting poster at the department\ufffds summer poster symposium.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kusali Gamage</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kusali&nbsp;Gamage</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SUREC poster</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600177/1600177_10417758_1641062269809_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600177/1600177_10417758_1641062269809_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"SUREC lab\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1600177/1600177_10417758_1641062269809_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"SUREC lab\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">SUREC students performing lab experiments</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Austin Community College</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kusali&nbsp;Gamage</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">SUREC lab</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
