 "awd_abstract_narration": "For decades scientists have used classical methods in environmental science to characterize groundwater aquifers contaminated by hydrocarbons.  Those methods, including measurements of the concentrations of organic chemical pollutants, other chemical conditions such as the acidity and oxygen content, and the physiological and genetic traits of microbial populations, have provided a rich characterization of polluted ground waters. However, such data do not take advantage of recent advances in molecular biology that have greatly expanded our ability to characterize the microbial organisms that are often critical to remediation efforts.  In this project, the investigator, who since 1991 has studied a contaminated aquifer, will connect his data on that aquifer to recent data generated by advanced genomic methods in molecular biology.  The molecular data of DNA and RNA sequences, will provide the researcher with an opportunity to explore the limits, frontiers, and pragmatic relationships between geochemical data and molecular characterizations of the microbial organisms and potentially discover how the metabolism of the microbial assemblages determines aquifer geochemistry. \r\n\r\nThe researcher has studied both microbial and geochemical properties of a shallow aquifer near the Hudson River in South Glens Falls, NY, which is contaminated with naphthalene-rich coal-tar waste. This project is designed to gain new insights into the microbial biogeochemistry of the biodegradation of pollutant compounds.  The overarching goal of this OPUS project is to merge previous geochemical and microbial data with recently-created DNA sequencing data, specifically omics information generated by a United States Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute microbial community sequencing project. The researcher will use statistical and other analytical procedures to discern new causal relationships between the dynamic microbiological and geochemical processes at this site. Information about key processes catalyzed in this subsurface site will deepen understanding about the composition and function of microorganisms dwelling in this study site and establish principles that can be transferred to other ecological settings. The project will integrate knowledge from ecosystem science, microbial ecology, taxonomy, and genetic diversity, and nutrient cycling in subsurface, sediment and soil habitats, to address how microbial processes purify water and influence environmental quality.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nUnderstanding microbially mediated geochemical processes is fundamental to ecosystem science.  Traditional approaches to studying microorganisms involved isolating organisms from their environment for thorough metabolic analyses in a laboratory setting.  This approach has provided important insights into microbially driven transformations but does not allow for the study of more complex processes that require interactions between organisms or between an organism and its environment.  Some environmental studies have used in situ experimental manipulations and geochemical analyses of samples from a natural location to explore processes in a more complex, ecosystem context.  These studies proved an overall, gross assessment of geochemical transformations but may not identify the organisms responsible.  \n\nThe ability to determine the content and sequences of DNA, RNA and protein extracted from environmental samples has revolutionized the way in which natural microbial ecosystem processes are studied.  These approaches have allowed unprecedented access to organisms that have resisted laboratory cultivation.  While generating these large data sets have become more commonplace and affordable, the number of bridges connecting microbiological processes at the molecular level and biogeochemical processes at the ecosystem level remain limited. \n\nThe goal of this study was to integrate classic microbiological analyses with large molecular data sets collected from a long-term study site called Site 24.  This site, in South Glen Falls, NY, bears a history of contamination from coal tar waste.  The buried coal tar waste was removed decades ago however the shallow aquifer beneath still harbors organic pollutants that leached from the waste pit.  This site has been the focus of studies by the laboratory of Dr. Eugene Madsen since 1991, where lab members have developed and applied methods to follow microbial processes in situ. These studies have advanced our understanding of microbial degradation of organic pollutants, the complexity of microbial food web interactions, and the impact of microbial processes on geochemical transformations. \n\nDr. Madsen had a unique and unwavering eye toward assessing the value and limitations of advanced techniques applied to ecologically relevant natural systems. His experimental approaches were designed to minimize the error that is inherent in any analytical or molecular method.\n\nThe study found that complex environments often provide unanticipated discoveries and it also revealed unanticipated sources of error described here:\n\n1.      Identifying a pristine site to compare to a contaminated site may be difficult.  In the case of site 24, well 60B was used as a control sampling location, due to its location in the shallow aquifer, upstream of the coal tar pit and hydrocarbon plume.  However, metagenome and protein analyses revealed the presence and expression of genes for hydrocarbon degradation in this location.  It is unclear if these signatures are due to a legacy of contamination of this part of the aquifer or if the well site has been seeded by microorganisms from more heavily contaminated sites nearby.   \n\n2.      The analysis of replicate samples (including the analysis of technical replicates) is ideal but perhaps not practical, depending on the quantity of a specific target or complexity of a sample and practical considerations that may limit sampling depth or the ability analyze large data sets.  Dr. Madsen gravitated toward metaproteomic studies because results provide information on what a population of microorganisms has expressed and hence how that population is reacting to its environment.  In contrast, metagenomic studies provide insight into population and community potential.  For proteomic analyses, limitations arising from technical challenges that limit sampling depth, or identification of divergent protein fragments from novel organisms, might offset the value of studying expression products. \n\n3.     The interpretation of -omics data in reflecting current bioremediation activities may be challenging.  As recognized pollutants undergo attenuation, bioavailability decreases.  In parallel, the ability to detect biological activity associated with remediation as well as the capacity to detect specific contaminants also diminishes.   In site 24, substantial naphthalene levels were only detected in the deep sediments.  However, genes associated with key degradation pathways were detected in locations with no detectable residual contamination.  It is unclear if these functions are still being selected for at the site or if they are being carried in the microbial community as a legacy of higher contamination levels from the past.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/11/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Esther R Angert"
