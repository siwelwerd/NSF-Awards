 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Institute for Astronomy (IfA) at the University of Hawaii will host a summer REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) site in astronomy.  With about 50 faculty members and a share of all the telescopes on Maunakea and Haleakala, the IfA offers undergraduate students a wide range of opportunities. This REU site will provide research experience and professional development training for 5-6 students on O'ahu and a cohort of 3-4 students on either Maui or the Big Island each year; along with the research training, the program will benefit society by enabling scientific collaboration and interaction between native Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian students.\r\n\r\nDistributing students across multiple islands provides the best diversity of research opportunities: (1) IfA-Hilo carries out state-of-the-art instrumentation projects for the optical/infrared telescopes on Maunakea; (2) IfA Maui has a strong solar focus, including developing two first-light instruments for the Daniel K. Inouye Advanced Solar Telescope on Haleakala; and (3) IfA-Manoa has the largest staff and research breadth, with over 40 research faculty in areas ranging from planetary science to cosmology. In addition to a mentored research project, the professional development activities include an intensive short-course a weekly professional development in research skills at the start of the summer (on O'ahu), a weekly professional development lunch series, and visits to the observatories and nearby cultural landmarks on Maunakea (Big Island) or Haleakala (Maui).  IfA is ideally positioned to attract Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders into their first research experience through the REU program.",

We also trained students on developing skills on scientific writing and presentation.
