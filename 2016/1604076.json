 "awd_abstract_narration": "The rate of ice loss at the ocean margins of the great glacial ice sheets is the largest unknown in predictions of future global sea level change. Many physical processes at a range of time and space scales determine this mass loss, but their relative roles in net loss or gain and trends are poorly understood. This project will investigate the physics of glacier-ocean interaction for a specific system, Petermann Gletscher (PG), using data to improve understanding of processes at the marine margin of PG that drains a large fraction of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) into a deep fjord connected to Nares Strait via a floating, up to 1800 feet thick, ice shelf. The ice shelf has undergone significant retreat in the last few years, from 80 km long in 2010 to 50 km today. Observations of warming of the deep water in Nares Strait and Petermann Fjord, and of ice-shelf thinning during the decade preceding retreat, lead to a hypothesis that increased basal melting contributes to loss of the ice shelf. The project is motivated by three aspects of the Petermann Gletscher and Fjord system: (1) its importance as a gateway for GIS mass loss; (2) comparison of ocean dynamics in Petermann Fjord with previously studied southern Greenland systems; and (3) the value of PG as a well-constrained system for studying processes that contribute to mass loss from other northern Greenland and Antarctic ice-shelf systems and their contribution to rising global sea level. The project takes advantage of recent observations of this system, including ongoing satellite-relayed data from sub-ice-shelf moorings.\r\n\r\nThis project would contribute to the development of a diverse STEM workforce through support for the training of two graduate and three undergraduate students, including a student from an under-represented group in STEM fields.  The PI would continue his international collaborations with Swedish, English, and Canadian collaborators that were developed as part of the initial Petermann Gletscher study aboard I/B Oden in 2015.  Outreach to the general public would be facilitated through the PI?s website, blog, occasional media interviews, and embedding national print journalists in the field work.  \r\n\r\nTime series analyses will characterize how sub-glacial waters change along the central melt channel with the tides and seasons. Description of the average state and interpretation of variations will be aided by ocean survey data properties collected in the adjacent ocean by ship between 2003 and 2015. Both time- and frequency-domain statistical analyses will reveal correlation time and space scales. More specifically, Fourier, wavelet, and Hilbert transforms will be used to provide estimates of amplitude and phase at discrete scales. Frequency-domain linear system analyses will reveal input-output relations between multiple time series that represent forcings (e.g., atmospheric temperature and wind stress when sea-ice is mobile or absent, tides) and responses (e.g., depth of surface mixed layer, heat content of the meltwater plume, ice velocity and basal melt rate). Analyses of data from GPS and pressure sensors at each mooring will determine the degree of floatation at each site as the glacier transitions from >365 m to <100 m in thickness. Summer ocean surveys describe the inflowing Atlantic waters that will become diluted by basal melt and by direct injection of freshwater. Thermodynamic constraints on the solid-to-fluid phase transition of glacier ice melted by the ocean result in a characteristic relation of ocean temperatures and salinity (the Gade-line), which is set by the latent heat of melting. A second mixing line arises from ice-shelf surface melting and direct runoff into the fjord. In some fjord systems, this component includes a substantial discharge of subglacial water generated upstream of the grounding line. The proposed temperature-salinity analyses will reveal the importance of this sub-glacial freshwater source along the central melt-channel.",

When a second Manhattan-sized iceberg broke off in 2012, I was not so sure anymore and looked closely at all available data. There was not much, but what little I found suggested that ocean temperatures were steadily increasing. Could it be that warm waters 1000 feet below the surface could melt the glacier at all times of the year? Did this melting from below thin the glacier? Did these changes increase the speed at which it moves ice from land into the ocean? These were the questions that motivated a number of projects that began in earnest in 2015 aboard the Swedish icebreaker I/B Oden. Professional videos of this expeditions are at <a href=\"https://icyseas.org/2019/07/04/petermann-glacier-videos-science/\">https://icyseas.org/2019/07/04/petermann-glacier-videos-science/</a>.</p>\n<p>Scientists and technicians from the British Antarctic Survey drilled three holes through the floating section of Petermann Gletscher to access the ocean and ocean sediments below it. The ocean temperature and salinity profile confirmed both the warming trend observed in the fjord and ocean adjacent to the glacier, but more importantly, we placed ocean sensors below the glacier ice to measure temperature and salinity every hour for as long as the sensors, cables, and satellite data transmission would work. This has never been done around Greenland, so our data would be the first to report in real time on ocean properties below 100 to 300 m thick glacier ice at all times. What we saw when the data started to come in after 2 weeks, a month, and half a year stunned us, because (a) the ocean waters under the glacier changed by a very large amount every two weeks. Nobody has ever seen such regular and large changes in tempertures (and salinity) under a glacier bathed in total darkness at air temperatures of -40 degrees Celsius and Fahrenheit, but then our station went offline after 6 months and did not report any data to us via satellite.</p>\n<p>The first work on the grant was to <a href=\"https://icyseas.org/2016/09/23/oceanography-below-petermann-gletscher-for-400-days/\">visit our station by helicopter in 2016</a> using two fuel caches that we placed the year prior from the Swedish icebreaker. At this point Petermann Gletscher and our projects attracted the attention of journalists of the Washington Post who had read some of the articles at <a href=\"https://IcySeas.org\">IcySeas.org</a> where I post illustrated essays for a general audence [Broader Impacts].

Ocean temperatures increase at all five depths below the 100-m thick floating ice shelf of the glacier. These warmer waters are also saltier which demonstrates their Atlantic origin.</p>\n<p>1b. Surface sensors indicate short, but intense pulses of meltwater passing our ocean array at spring-neap tidal cycles.</p>\n<p>2a. Melt rate data reveal that these pulses occur during reduced tidal amplitudes and follow peaks in glacier melting that exceeded 30 feet per year.</p>\n<p>2b. Statistical analyses indicate that the melt waters originate from a location near where the glacier sits on bed rock and that the melt water then moves seaward towards the ocean.</p>\n<p>3a. Ocean melting below the glacier varies from summer (strong) to winter (weak) rising from a winter mean of 6 feet per year to a maximum of 240 feet per year during the summer.</p>\n<p>3b. The large summer melting is caused by the increased discharge of subglacial runoff into the ocean near the grounding line.</p>\n<p>3c. The larger discharge strengthens ocean currents under the floating glacier that drive ocean heat toward the glacier's ice base.</p>\n<p>The work formed one basis for the dissertation of PhD student Peter Washam [Broader Impact] who published the items <a href=\"https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JPO-D-17-0181.1\">#2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/summer-surface-melt-thins-petermann-gletscher-ice-shelf-by-enhancing-channelized-basal-melt/4F111AFFBE670992E7AAD21359561F1B\">#3</a> in the Journal of Physical Oceanography and Journal of Glaciology, respectively [Interlectual Merit].
