 "awd_abstract_narration": "1619958\r\nOates\r\n\r\nPopulation growth and the concomitant need for more food and energy are stressing the ability of cities, regions, and nations to provide safe, abundant, and affordable water to all. The additional uncertainty in the climate, the rapid depletion of the world's aquifers, urbanization, and the industrialization of developing economies, all indicate that humanity is in the midst of a water crisis. These challenges have far reaching implications for global security, ecosystem health and economic development, as well as the health safety of both the wealthy and the poor. The principal investigators (PIs) propose to bring together a working group of educators, industry partners, and government officials that will participate in a one day planning workshop to develop a larger regional conference for the broader New England water community. The PIs believe the workshops and conferences will catalyze a New England Water Education Ecosystem that will identify, address, and share solutions to improve water supply abundance, access and safety.\r\n\r\nThe challenges of solving problems related to safe, abundant, and affordable water supply are critical to the regional, national, and global security. The workshops will be in the northeast incorporating universities ready to tackle these emerging water problems,  and partners in industry are critical to the implementation and commercialization of new technologies. In 2014, a small group of individuals incorporated the New England Water Innovation Network (NEWIN) with the goals of serving as a common voice for the regional water industry and identifying best practices for brining water technologies to market. Additionally, New England Water Innovation Network recognizes the importance of engaging and energizing the next generation of water professionals. The New England Water Education Ecosystem will provide a venue to bring industry partners together with educational partners. In addition, many aspects of the water issues have significant policy components. The State of Massachusetts recognizes the significance of these challenges and is actively engaged in programs to foster water innovation at the both the basic research and commercialization phases. Cultivating connections between higher education, water industry, and government will speed the development of solutions and help prepare students to face these complex challenges.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCreating a Water Education and Innovative Ecosystem \n\nThe major goal of our workshop  award entitled \"Creating a Water Education and Innovative Ecosystem \", (CBET &ndash; 1600168), was to bring together New England leaders  in  water research, education, innovation and commercialization forum with our local, regional and federal government colleagues.  The working workshop attracted 212 participants from all sectors of the water ecosystem.  Participants heard from national leaders and regional innovators and had an opportunity to network and be part of the solution to help solve one of the planet?s most pressing issues: securing safe and abundant water.\n\nAs a result of the National Science Foundation?s Support we have help to:\n\nIntellecular Merit: Catalyze the New England water education ecosystem by convening a project planning committee of representatives from academia, the water industry and the government to serve as leaders and to discuss needs, explore opportunities for collaboration, and build critical relationships. \n\nConvene the regional water community for a one-day conference to identify, address, and share solutions to improve water supply, access and safety.\n\nDevelop an action plan for moving forward by convening a follow-up workshop with the core leadership team and other stakeholders that builds upon the results of the regional conference.\n\nBroader Impacts: Due to the enthusiasm and motivation of the workshop participants, we were able to add two additional deliverables to support the development of community. These two new deliverables included:\n\n            A case study that could be used for teaching purposes\n\n            A project-based approach for colleges and universities to work with industry.\n\nThroughout the time spend at the workshop we reflected on our obligation as a community of knowing.  We asked ourselves some simple questions such as: \n\nWhat is our obligation if we knew that by 2025, 1 billion more people will be on the planet, requiring 1 trillion cubic meters of water just for agriculture alone;\n\nIf 1 in every four persons is expected within the next 10 years to be living in regions with absolute water scarcity;\n\nIf 4 out of 10 individuals do not even have access to a latrine; 2 in 10 do not have safe drinking water;\n\nIf every year millions of people, mostly children die from diseases associate with inadequate water supply?\n\nWe were reminded of the fragile nexus between food, energy and water and how every city and country, no matter how advanced and developed risks of loss of  their safe and secure environment. \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/14/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karen K Oates"
