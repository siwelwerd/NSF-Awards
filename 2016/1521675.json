 "awd_abstract_narration": "Poverty, saving species, repowering the world with renewable energy, lifting people up to live better lives - there are no easy answers to guiding our planet on the path toward sustainability. Complex problems require sophisticated solutions. They involve intricacy beyond human capabilities, the kind of big-data processing and analysis that only advanced large-scale computing can provide. This NSF Expedition in Computing launches CompSustNet (http://www.compsust.net), a vast research network powered by the nation's recognized university computer science programs, charged with applying the emerging field of computational sustainability to solving the world's seemingly unsolvable resource problems. Put simply, the project will enlist some of the top talents in computing, social science, conservation, physics, materials science, and engineering to unlock sustainable solutions that safeguard our planet's future.\r\n\r\nComputational Sustainability is, at its core, the belief that with sufficiently advanced computational techniques, we can devise sustainable solutions that meet the environmental, societal, and economic needs of today while providing for future generations. In much the same way IBM's supercomputer Watson could defeat any challenger in Jeopardy!, computational sustainability posits that a computer-engineered solution can be applied to world's difficult and challenging problems - from helping farmers and herders in Africa survive severe droughts to developing a smart power grid fueled entirely by renewable energy. CompSustNet is a large national and international multi-institutional research network led by Cornell University and including 11 other US academic institutions: Bowdoin, Caltech, CMU, Georgia Tech, Howard University, Oregon State, Princeton, Stanford, UMass, University of South California, and Vanderbilt University, as well as collaborations with several international universities. But CompSustNet is not just an academic enterprise, as it also includes key governmental and non-governmental organizations that specialize in conservation, poverty mitigation, and renewable energy, such as The Nature Conservancy, The World Wildlife Fund, The International Livestock Research Institute, The Trans-African Hydro-Meteorological Observatory, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\r\n\r\nCompSustNet's core mission is to significantly expand the horizons of computational sustainability and foster the advancement of state-of-the-art computer science to achieve the scale to tackle global problems. Research will focus on cross-cutting computational topics such as optimization, dynamical models, simulation, big data, machine learning, and citizen science, applied to sustainability challenges.  For example, computational sustainability is being put to work to resolve the problem of providing wetlands for shorebirds that migrate from the Arctic through California during a time of drought. As California gets drier, the shorebirds have nowhere to stop, rest, and refuel by eating wetland invertebrates. Scientists are developing new dynamic precision conservation techniques that use complex, big-data models to tackle the problem with NASA satellite imagery, meteorological forecasts, and citizen science in the form of thousands of bird location sightings from the Cornell Lab of Ornithology's eBird checklisting app for birdwatchers. Through partnership with The Nature Conservancy, the program forecasts when and where wetland habitat would be needed for shorebirds, and the Conservancy pays Central Valley rice farmers to flood their fields at opportune times - providing benefits for birds and farmers at a time when extreme drought is making life tough for both. In similar ways, computational sustainability projects will also be hard at work innovating automated monitoring networks to protect endangered elephant population from poachers, promoting the discovery of novel ways to harvest energy from sun light, and designing algorithms to manage the generation and storage of renewable energy in the power grid. \r\n\r\nAdvancements in computational sustainability will lead to novel, low-cost, high-efficiency strategies for saving endangered species, helping indigenous peoples improve their way of life, and scaling renewables up to meet 21st century energy demand. CompSustNet is like the seed, the venture capital, to help the field of computational sustainability achieve what's possible.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit\n\nOur work in energy systems has focused on the modeling of a wide range of energy storage systems.  Our problems spanned co-optimizing an energy storage device to balance following the RegD signal (which changes every 2 seconds and is used to smooth out power flow variations) with maximizing revenues from the variations in electricity prices (which change every 5 minutes), which produces an energy storage problem with 43,000 time periods, to optimizing energy in the presence of time-dependent loads, stochastic prices and stochastic wind described with a rolling forecast.  Both of these problems produced fundamentally new algorithmic strategies: backward approximate dynamic programming (for the first), to parametric cost function approximations (for the second).  We also tested simple dispatch rules (such as buy low, sell high), and an array of methods based on approximate dynamic programming/reinforcement learning, and direct lookahead policies.  This work spans all four classes of policies which evolved from this (and other) research.  Notably, the problem with rolling forecasts appears to be both a common problem in operations research, and yet has been completely overlooked in the academic literature, despite its many applications.  We invented the parametric cost function approximation which appears to be the first practical method for solving the problem of dynamic inventory management in the presence of rolling forecasts.  This research is featured in our latest book, Reinforcement Learning and Stochastic Optimization: A universal framework for sequential decisions (see http;//tinyurl.com/RLandSO/), which draws on our energy storage research (see chapters 9, 11, and 13). \n\nBroader impact\n\nEnergy storage is, by itself, an important problem domain as it is considered central to the practical use of renewables (wind and solar).  The combination of wind and solar farms with energy storage (which may use batteries, thermal storage, hydro reservoirs, hydrogen, compressed air, and deferred demands) is viewed as central to reducing the use of fossil fuels in the grid.  Our research fundamentally impacts our ability to control these complex devices.  At the same time, energy storage is just one example of inventory problems that arise in a wide range of applications in supply chain management (a $15 trillion business), health supplies (e.g. vaccines, testing kits), finance (e.g. financial reserves), and emergency response management (e.g. storing water), to name a few.  Our contributions extend beyond energy storage (or inventory problems in general).  We invented backward approximate dynamic programming to solve a complex energy storage problem, and have since used this method for optimizing clinical trials for new drugs, and in a problem for allocating IMF loads in Africa.  Backward ADP is now featured in our new book (see chapter 15).  Then, the parametric cost function approximation, invented to handle the energy storage problem with rolling forecasts, has turned out to be a powerful method for many applications that lend themselves to use a parameterized deterministic lookahead model.  One example is how grid operators optimize energy generation for tomorrow in the presence of uncertainty; they use a parameterized lookahead model, but fail to realize that the parameterization is a stochastic optimization problem.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/07/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Warren B Powell"
