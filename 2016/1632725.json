 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Audience Summary \r\n\r\nThe PI, an expert in science and technology studies, will engage in long-term participant observation at two laboratories of neuroscience and cognitive psychology that study olfaction (the sense of smell). The focus of her study is a well-known argument that olfactory experiences cannot be conveyed by language. She will shed new light on this argument by using laboratory studies to document and communicate the language of olfaction that is used in the context of scientific experimentation. The project will contribute to graduate student training and to broadening participation; the PI has plans to recruit a graduate student research assistant from an underrepresented group. Her research results will be disseminated in a journal article, a book chapter, and an edited volume. They will be used in a methods class for graduate students, and they will be of interest to non-scientists due to their relevance to eating disorders, obesity, and sensory disabilities.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary \r\n\r\nThe PI will use the laboratory studies approach project to provide new insights into one of the central conundrums involved in understanding human olfaction, its relationship with language. It will provide an alternative perspective on the sense of smell as a feature of practical work of science; in doing so, it will turn what is often regarded as illusive and hidden into a material and social feature of action and interaction in the laboratory. The project will draw from ethnomethodology (the study of examines how individuals use everyday conversation and gestures to construct a common-sense view of the world) to engage the sensory aspects of scientific knowing. It will also use insights from the arts, humanities, and other social science approaches to the senses. Its goal is to go beyond the visual-auditory dominance, and treat the sensory as part of the practical doings in the laboratory.",
