 "awd_abstract_narration": "Naturally occurring radioactive nuclides provide invaluable \"clocks\" with which to investigate a wide range of processes in earth and environmental sciences. Nuclides with shorter half-lives are well suited to studying rapid processes, but are often present at very low concentrations and are particularly difficult to measure. The goal of this Early Concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) is to develop and demonstrate a new analytical method for measuring bismuth-210 (half life, 5 days) in lake water, seawater, and associated particles. Because bismuth tends to become associated with particles more than its parent isotope lead-210 (half life, 22 years), the bismuth-210/lead-210 daughter/parent pair can potentially be used to investigate very short time-scale processes associated with particle (sediment) formation and cycling in lakes and the coastal ocean. Knowledge about such processes is important to understanding carbon and nutrient cycling in these productive and dynamic areas. \r\n\r\nThe specific goals of this exploratory project are to 1) demonstrate an improved method for measuring the lead-210/bismuth-210/polonium-210 trio in aquatic system samples; 2) measure lead-210/bismuth-210/polonium-210 in Lake Michigan; and 3) explore the feasibility of using bismuth-210/lead-210 disequilibrium as a proxy for particle flux. The project would support an undergraduate student researcher for the summer.",
