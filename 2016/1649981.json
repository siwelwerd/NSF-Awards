 "awd_abstract_narration": "Previous international studies of mathematics and science education have provided important perspectives on the global competitiveness of STEM education in the United States. The world, including the world of mathematics in schools, has changed in many ways over the past 20 years especially in the area of technology which is closely related to the discipline of mathematics. Many countries have revised their mathematics standards and currently, questions about what is needed for a 21st century curriculum continue to drive curriculum reform in virtually every country. Questions around what students need to know and be able to do in the 21st century are central in curriculum reform discussions in the U.S. and other countries. These questions have led the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) to plan and develop the Education 2030 International Curriculum Analysis. This project will take advantage of the developing opportunity to participate in OECD's Education 2030 Curriculum Analysis to develop a current international benchmark in mathematics against which the Common Core Standards for Mathematics (CCSSM) and other College and Career Ready Standards may be evaluated. The project will provide a window on the state of 21st century skills currently incorporated by countries into their curriculum in various ways.\r\n \r\nThe project staff will lead the Mathematics Curriculum Document Analysis (MCDA) project. The specific questions to be addressed through the mathematics document-based analysis are: What are the topics and key concepts currently focused upon in mathematics standards (guidelines) across over 20 countries? What do mathematics curriculum documents - standards and textbooks - reveal about the current state of the focus, rigor, and coherence of the mathematics curriculum? What do mathematics curriculum documents - standards and textbooks - reveal about the coherent inclusion of 21st century skills expectations for students? To what extent are the Common Core State Standards for Mathematics reflected in or consistent with the current mathematics standards for leading countries, i.e., those whose students do well on international assessments such as TIMSS and PISA? The project will work with international partners to create a multidimensional framework for analysis of curriculum standards and conduct a multidimensional analysis of standards and textbooks in the US.",
