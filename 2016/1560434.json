 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CISE Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site award funds a new REU site at Tennessee Technological University focused on security of cyber-physical systems. Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems that are built from, and depend upon, the seamless integration of computational algorithms and physical components. New CPS technology will transform the way people interact with engineered systems that often are fundamental to daily lives including transportation, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, building design, and many other areas critical to our society.  It is vital that these systems operate and interact with people seamlessly and that they are secure and privacy-preserving.  The REU site will provide undergraduates the opportunity to work during the summer with faculty mentors in state-of-the-art research labs on projects that are compelling and important to all of us.   The Division of Graduate Education CyberCorps (R) Scholarship for Service Program is co-funding this project.\r\n\r\nThe project is led by an outstanding team offering modern facilities and professional mentors to guide undergraduates in explorations of problems related to developing secure cyber-physical systems. Students will learn how to use current tools and techniques to solve those problems that have direct impact on people and the quality of daily life.  The team will use proven strategies to recruit undergraduate students from groups traditionally under-represented in computer science.   The students will participate in research and professional development activities all designed to achieve the goals of retaining and graduating undergraduate students in computer science and engineering, recruiting students from groups traditionally under-represented in computing fields, and increasing recruitment of students into graduate programs.",
