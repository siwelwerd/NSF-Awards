 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF), Professor Tong Ren from Purdue University and colleagues Matthias Zeller and Suzanne Bart have acquired a single crystal X-ray diffractometer equipped with a molybdenum source. In general, an X-ray diffractometer allows accurate and precise measurements of the full three-dimensional structure of a molecule, including bond distances and angles, and provides accurate information about the spatial arrangement of a molecule relative to neighboring molecules. These studies impact a number of areas, including organic and inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry and biochemistry. This instrument is an integral part of teaching as well as research and research training of undergraduate and graduate students in chemistry and biochemistry at this institution that awards one of the largest number of PhD degrees in the country. The X-ray facility has a tradition of providing data collection and structure solution services for faculty and students from small colleges (PUIs) in the surrounding area. The diffractometer allows this courtesy to remain and be expanded. Finally, building on Purdue's ongoing efforts of making modern research instrumentation available at K-12 levels through the Purdue Science Express Program, the use of X-ray diffraction for K-12 educational purposes is being explored.\r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) synthesizing conjugated metal acetylides, (b) studying organometallic chemistry of uranium complexes, (c) designing, preparing and investigating single-site catalysts used in green and sustainable chemistry transformations, (d) synthesizing bioactive molecules, (e) designing new HIV-1 protease inhibitors and (f) synthesizing highly reactive radical species.",
