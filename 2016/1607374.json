 "awd_abstract_narration": "Low-dimensional topology, which studies manifolds of four or fewer dimensions, is a central, active area of mathematics. Many of the mathematical tools successfully used to study high-dimensional manifolds do not apply in low dimensions, and despite advances in the last forty years, fundamental, important problems remain unresolved. Low-dimensional topology is at the nexus of many branches of mathematics. Methods from geometry, minimal surface theory and analysis, group theory, number theory, dynamical systems, and theoretical computer science have contributed to its development, and conversely, research in low-dimensional topology stimulates advances in these areas. This research project addresses topics in hyperbolic geometry, lamination and foliation theory, Heegaard theory, and smooth 4-dimensional manifold theory. Many of the questions under study are accessible to graduate students and new researchers, several of whom will be involved in the project.\r\n\r\nThe investigator will continue research on the topology of ending lamination space, the classification of both small cusped and low volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds, and the classification of Heegaard splittings.  Through a novel approach, the project will investigate the smooth 4-dimensional Schoenflies conjecture: any smoothly embedded 3-sphere in the standard 4-sphere bounds a smoothly standard 4-ball.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe PI continued his research on the geometry and topology of low dimensional manifolds, an extremely active and exciting area of contemporary mathematical research. Using minimal surface theory, muti-parameter sweepouts and combinatorial topological methods the PI (with Colding and Ketover) found an effective algorithm to classify up to isotopy the irreducible Heegaard splittings of non Haken hyperbolic 3-manifolds.  Along the way, the PI (with Colding) found an effective version of Tao Li's finiteness theorems, namely given a non Haken hyperbolic 3-manifold there is an effective algorithm to enumerate a finite list that contains all of its irreducible splittings. The proof of the classification result effectively weeded out the reducible and duplicate splittings.\n\nThe PI proved a light bulb theorem for smooth 4-dimensional manifolds; that is homotopy implies isotopy for embedded 2-spheres with a common dual sphere in a 4-manifold without 2-torsion in its fundamental group. Hannah Schwartz showed that no 2-torsion is a necessary condition by proving that there are closed 4-manifolds having homotopic embedded spheres with common dual spheres that are not even concordant.  This part of her Bryn Mawr Ph. D. thesis was co-supervised by the PI.  Subsequently, Peter Teichner and Rob Schneiderman showed that the Freedman - Quinn invariant is the obstruction to isotopy.   The light bulb theorem introduced new geometric methods, has various applications to smooth 4-manifold theory and stimulated further advances in the field. \n\nThe PI with Mehdi Yazdi found infinitely many counter examples to Thurston's Euler class-one conjecture, the last remaining open problem from his seminal 1976 paper on the Thurston norm.  This relied on a combination of a paper with Yazdi which proved the fully marked surface theorem and a paper of Yazdi based on his Ph. D. thesis written under the PI's supervision.   The fully marked surface theorem is a converse of  a fundamental theorem from Thurston's paper:  Given a 2-dimensional homology class in a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold whose Thurston norm is induced by the Euler class of a taut foliation, then there is another taut foliation with compact leaves representing that homology class.  Further, the two foliations have homotopic plane fields. \n\nIn terms of broader impact the PI (with Colding and Ketover) wrote an expository paper on geometric methods in Heegaard theory that includes a number of open problems.
