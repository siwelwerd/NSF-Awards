 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will provide partial support for the Educational Partnerships for Innovation in Communities (EPIC) Network to develop international collaborations that will expand the EPIC network. The EPIC-N Model gives communities direct access to institutions of higher education to conduct research and advance knowledge in areas of immediate need. The Model is a year-long, large-scale partnership that matches existing campus faculty and courses with high-priority projects identified by the community partner that address environmental, economic, and social issues. Through their coursework, students conduct research and provide creative, innovative, and multi-disciplinary designs and solutions for each prioritized project.   The results of successful collaboration stands to transform higher education, the way in which institutions of higher education and local governments work together, and the way in which we address sustainability and resiliency and the future challenges that face society. Promotion of the radically simple EPIC-N Model has the potential to impact hundreds of thousands of students, working with thousands of cities, and making a visible difference for millions of residents in communities worldwide. In addition, this is a great opportunity to promote the professional development of US scientists and to help foster future international collaboration in sustainability research.",

The purpose of the presentations and the series of meetings referenced above was to strategize how to replicate the EPIC Model internationally, particularly in communities in developing nations and in the Global South.</p>\n<p class=\"Pa4\">The specific, significant result was that an international EPIC-N training workshop was held at the following Resilient Cities 2017 conference on May 3, 2017. Thanks to collaboration between stakeholders from the EPIC Network, the US EPA, the UNEP, the NSF, the Global Adaptation Network, and the International City Management Association, a one-day workshop was provided by EPIC Network representatives, including the Jessica Barlow (PI), Marc Schlossberg and Nico Larco (University of Oregon), Courtney Griesel (City of Springfield, OR, USA), and Kristofer Patr&oacute;n-Soberano (San Diego State University, formerly of City of Tijuana, Mexico). Attendees to the workshop included city-university pairs from the Philippines, South Africa, Uganda, Malawi, Kenya, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Thailand, Nepal, Honduras, and Ecuador. The intensive workshop provided attendees with a detailed description of the EPIC Model, as well as tangible ways that the Model could be replicated in context-specific ways. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The key outcome is that the EPIC Model is already being replicated by some of the city-university pairs who attended the conference. In addition, the success of the training workshop has led to additional meetings and discussions to plan regional training workshops .</p>\n<p>Moreover, the original presentation at the Resilient Cities 2016 conference led to additional conversations with other key stakeholders, including representatives from the United Nations Framework Convention (UNFCCC) on Climate Change, who arranged for the PI to do a webinar for the UNEP and UNFCCC Lima Adaptation Knowledge Initiative Workshops. The presentation of the EPIC Model also drew the interest of representatives from the United Nations Habitat program, which ultimately led to the first US application of Guiding Principles for Climate Action Planning toolkit via SDSU Sage Project&rsquo;s partnership with the City of Lemon Grove, CA, USA.
