 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by investigating ways to make science assessment and science instruction more culturally relevant to Native Hawaiians. Closing Gaps: Connecting Assessment and Culture to Increase Achievement, a three-year design and development study, opens new doors for understanding how technology can enhance teaching and learning. The project focuses on ways in which technology-rich learning environments can improve instruction and assessment practices for diverse indigenous students. It combines two innovative learning technologies -- SimScientists and FieldScope -- that support STEM teaching and learning through the practices of science. Teachers in the Na Lei Na'auao Native Hawaiian Charter School Alliance use these innovative technologies in their classrooms and on ecosystems-themed field trips. Project researchers will study how features of each technology can foster learning and enhance assessment. The project addresses a persistent limitation of STEM learning: students' lack of access to connected and familiar experiences that can help build foundational knowledge. Although new technologies to support STEM learning are available each year, many deliver inaccessible information because the context of the information is unfamiliar and does not relate to children's own experiences and intuitive knowledge. This promotes fragile understandings rather than the kinds of knowledge valued by NGSS and in work environments. This project explores how to design educational learning tools that can be adapted to a local context yet be standardized enough to align with state and national guidelines. Findings may prove critical in improving test development practices for diverse populations. Testing in diverse indigenous communities is underexplored; little is known about how assessments can be adapted to serve the dual role of assessing content and practice standards while attending to specifics of the local context. This project intends to enhance the educational advancement of all students in STEM areas.\r\n\r\nThis project intends to advance the field of educational technology to maximize benefits of cultural and contextual diversity in technology-rich learning environments. It addresses four research questions: (1) Can features of two learning technologies be customized to be both contextually relevant and aligned with standardized learning goals?; (2) Can technology-rich learning environments be used to make salient connections between instruction and the culture in which learning is situated?; (3) Can assessment embedded into technology-rich learning environments be responsive to ways of knowing and demonstrating understanding unique to an indigenous culture?; and (4) Can assessment embedded in technology-rich learning environments support inferences about student understanding of the practices, core ideas, and crosscutting concepts of science with appropriate and sufficient evidence? In Year 1, the project will conduct initial feasibility studies with students and teachers to inform revisions to existing SimScientists modules and reflection activities. In Year 2, the project will revise existing modules to enhance their cultural relevance and then conduct small-scale usability and feasibility testing with the revised modules. In Year 3, the customized modules will be piloted with 12 teachers. Data collection and analysis strategies include: (a) design charrettes; (b) focus groups and usability testing; (c) cognitive labs for cultural relevance, construct validity and innovation impacts; (d) pre/posttest of American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) items; (e) benchmark assessment data; (f) teacher surveys; (i) case studies; (j) classroom and field trip participant observations (k) differential item functioning; (l) analysis of covariance; and (m) analysis of variance on posttest scores (outcome variable) to compare the means across student groups (by intervention mode) and their prior science achievement levels to measure the technical quality of the assessments. Project success means students will make personal connections between the knowledge they gain throughout the course of their lives and the knowledge that is important in STEM fields, offering additional ways to see the value and possibilities of STEM careers.",

This tension between standardization and localization reaches across many areas of life in our era of globalization.

Project staff&#8239;collaborated with teachers in Indigenous-focused schools to innovate a field-based technology, FieldScope, that supports contextualized STEM instruction and assessment.&#8239;This process involved adapting the FieldScope technology to examine how local contextual knowledge can be incorporated into science pedagogy to improve instruction, assessment, and learning. Following modification of FieldScope, the platform can now manage cultural data. With this added functionality, students can, for example, add historic maps and recordings of Elder interviews (a form of ethnoscientific knowledge captured in stories and brought forward through talk), and use these as evidence to inform learning about local and global science systems. For Indigenous communities to use the technology, they needed to be confident that information would be responsibly managed according to specific local norms. The adaptations to FieldScope give uploading users the power to determine who should gain access to the content and forms of data entered in FieldScope. Indigenous teachers and students in Hawaii who are currently using this new technology find it groundbreaking. \n\n\n(3) Professional Learning. The&#8239;series of  afterschool virtual and in-person teacher PLs that blended FieldScope and IKO content&#8239;included activities like interpreting facets of IKO, practicing adapting lessons to transform them into more culturally responsive learning opportunities, and visualizing data on FieldScope. The PLs reinforced teachers\u2019 confidence and broadened their skills to enact culturally responsive, technology-rich, field-based science lessons.  \n\n\n(4) Culturally Relevant Science Learning Assessment.  The project team established a process for developing culturally relevant NGSS-aligned science assessments. To ensure connections to culture and classroom instruction and to establish construct validity, a consultant with experiential knowledge of the cultural context of Indigenous education reviewed materials along with educators from the communities where the research would take place. These educators, also experts in assessment and the NGSS, ensured an alignment to Science Practices, Disciplinary Core Ideas, and Crosscutting Concepts that provide the framework for classroom instruction. Project staff with expertise in assessment and knowledge of STEM and the NGSS then reviewed the framework, determining that specifications were met. Community members verified the final outcome measure. The completed outcome measure was pilot tested with approximately 60 students. However, the COVID-19 pandemic arrived before we could validate the outcome measure with enough students. The pandemic led to additional constraints on schools (e.g., moving to virtual learning) making it difficult to approach teachers and schools as prospective participants in the study. Nonetheless, the project produced four task sets, each containing multiple choice and constructed response items that aligned with one of four specific geographic/sociocultural contexts, as well as a scoring rubric for the open-ended constructed response items. \n\n\nAs we expand across contexts, educators will need to increasingly find balance between the dynamic of standardization and localization through flexible and consistent pedagogy that is fundamentally responsive to context. This tension between standardization and localization reaches across many areas of life in our era of globalization. In education, the new learning standards (NGSS and Common Core) give a push in the right direction, but we do not yet have guidelines for how to create generalized educational opportunities that can attend to the specific ways of knowing and understanding already present within the local context and culture&mdash;a critical issue for education researchers to explore together with communities. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sharon S Nelson-Barber"
