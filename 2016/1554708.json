 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program project will investigate cartilage mechanotransduction in response to different types of forces and examine how energy is used by cartilage. Joints such as the knee or the hip are important for everyday activity like walking.  These activities result in forces on the cartilage in the joint.  Because more than 50 million Americans suffer from some type of joint disease, understanding how cartilage response to forces is important for improving joint function.  Mechanotransduction is the process that cartilage uses to sense and respond to forces.  There are many aspects of cartilage mechanotransduction that are not yet known. The results of this project will provide a foundation of information that will improve the basic understanding of how cartilage functions.  The potential societal benefits include new knowledge that will help scientists and engineers develop new treatments for problems like arthritis.\r\n\r\nChondrocytes, the cells of cartilage, respond to mechanical loads by both known and unknown mechanisms.  Metabolomic profiling describes the functional state of the cell by quantifying changes in small molecules using liquid-chromatography and mass spectrometry.  The first objective of this project is to define both shared and distinct metabolomic responses for chondrocytes in shear and compressive loading.  The second objective is to examine the conversion of mechanical energy from applied compression into biological energy used by chondrocytes.  For these studies, human chondrocytes will be encapsulated in hydrogels of physiological stiffness.  These gels will be subjected to relevant mechanical deformations, and metabolites will then be extracted.  Both global and targeted metabolomic profiling will be used to analyze the responses of chondrocytes to the applied deformations.  The targeted metabolomic data will be integrated into a systems model of energy metabolism, and analyses will examine how mechanical deformations alter chondrocyte energy usage.  The significance of this work is that by examining both global and targeted metabolomic responses to loading, these studies will provide the knowledge necessary to design and administer loading regimes for restoring cartilage and joint health.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWith every step we take, we squish the cartilage in our ankles, knees, hips, and other joints throughout our body.  This project studied the effects of squishing on the cells in the cartilage in our joints.  In healthy cartilage, these cells are specialized to produce the structural molecules of cartilage in response to squishing.  In cartilage, there are two types of squishing.  The first type is compression, which is similar to squeezing the water out of a sponge.  The second type is shear, which is the type of load that gives tires traction on the road.  In this project we defined the molecules that are produced after both types of squishing, compression and shear.  This is important for understanding the processes that cartilage cells use to respond to mechanical loading.  Extension of this work might lead to new ways to build and repair cartilage to treat joint injuries and diseases like arthritis.\n\nThis project also expanded a course in \"Cellular Mechanotransduction.\"  In this course, both undergraduate and graduate students learned the mechanisms by which cells respond to different types of squishing.  This is important for understanding how our bodies work because cells in our lungs, blood vessels, bones, and cartilage are all dependent on squishing.  These students are now prepared to develop the next generation of drugs and biomedical products that harness the ability of cells to respond to different types of squishing.\n\nA final goal of this project was to provide research experiences to students from backgrounds who are underrepresented in STEM.  This is important because for STEM fields to reach their maximum potential, they must rely on the best and brightest workforce.  In this respect several students from underrepresented groups performed laboratory research on this project.  These students received training in state-of-the-art methodology, and are strongly positioned to contribute to the future development of exciting biomedical products.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/12/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ronald K June"
