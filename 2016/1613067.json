 "awd_abstract_narration": "1613067\r\nGroppi\r\n\r\nThis award, made in response to a EArly-Concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) proposal submission, provides funds to allow for the acquisition of key electronic components necessary to develop a proof-of-concept microwave radar system ultimately intended to study volcano plumes. The so-called WAMS (Water and Ash MM-Wave Spectrometer), would be a two-antenna, active-passive system. The low frequency system would function as a water vapor radiometer, using the 22 GHz emission line, while the high frequency system would estimate water vapor temperature (via radiometry at 183 and 232 GHZ), and also function as a radar to study the ash.  The investigators at Arizona State University have experience in the design and construction of similar instruments for radio astronomy. \r\n\r\nA successfully developed WAMS instrument with a dual antenna active-passive radar capability for imaging volcanic plumes offers the potential to measure path-integrated water vapor in a volcanic plume concurrently with measurement of ash concentration in near real time and thus might contribute to fundamental advances in our knowledge of basic volcanic conduit processes leading to eruption.  This support will allow for development of a prototype instrument that will be laboratory tested by an ASU graduate student.  The potential of a realized WAMS instrument to yield a better understanding of volcanic ash plume dynamics and evolution (e.g., particle aggregation dynamics and transport) may have benefits for mitigating air traffic hazards from volcanic activity.   Coupled with the student training in electronics testing that will be fostered by this award, these two aspects support NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national welfare.\r\n\r\n*** \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBroader Impacts\r\n\r\nThe EAGER project would directly engage a graduate student in laboratory testing of the prototype WAMS instrument.  The potential of WAMS for better understanding volcanic ash plume dynamics and evolution (e.g. particle aggregation dynamics and transport) may have benefits for mitigating air traffic hazards from volcanic activity.\r\n",
