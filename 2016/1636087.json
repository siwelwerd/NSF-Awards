Mathematics has built a strong foundation for solving various problems in physics. In recent years, a number of exciting advances in high energy physics have been developed by using the newly discovered mathematical objects called cluster algebras.  This workshop will bring together both leading experts and young researchers working on applications of mathematical theory of quivers and bipartite graphs to problems in high energy physics. The NSF funds will be used to reimburse travel expenses for graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, young faculty members, members of under-represented groups, and researchers without federal support.\r\n\r\nCluster algebras have been uniquely suited for simplifying and carrying out massive calculations (e.g., related to scattering amplitudes), and formalizing and unifying key observations previously made by theoretical physicists. Since this new and dynamic inter-disciplinary area of research touches upon a wide range of topics including gauge theory, string theory, number theory, algebraic geometry, integrable systems, and representation theory, the funding will be used to help mathematicians from diverse research areas to learn, interact, and collaborate with world experts in mathematics and high energy physics. One hallmark of the workshop will be the increased cross-fertilization between the mathematical sciences and other areas of science, particularly physics.
