 "awd_abstract_narration": "The central objective of this project is to provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms that control how the information contained within genes is utilized by cells.  Because genes are responsible for essentially all aspects of cell and organismal biology, ranging from how cells divide to how animals respond to hormones, these studies will shed new light into processes of broad biological importance.  The project will also have a wide-reaching impact on the education of undergraduate students through the implementation of several initiatives.  First, 12 undergraduate students will be directly involved in several aspects of the research.  These students will be mentored by Dr. Duina and will be trained in a variety of laboratory and scientific skills.  Second, 30-50 undergraduate students will carry out part of this research in the context of a course Dr. Duina teaches at Hendrix College.  These students will be engaged in the excitement of science through an authentic research experience in the classroom.  Third, students in Dr. Duina's laboratory will present their research to their peers majoring in disciplines other than the sciences.  These sessions are designed to teach science students how to communicate science to the lay public as well as to expose non-scientists to the thrill of scientific inquiry.\r\n\r\nThis research will focus on elucidating the mechanisms by which the transcription elongation factor Spt16 interacts with transcribed genes in vivo. Within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, DNA is compacted through the formation of a protein-DNA complex known as chromatin, the fundamental unit of which is the nucleosome.  Nucleosomes consist of a short stretch of DNA wrapped around histone octamers, themselves composed of pairs of the four core histone proteins.  Nucleosomes represent physical barriers during the process of gene transcription and Spt16, as part of the FAcilitates Chromatin Transactions (FACT) complex, has been shown to play central roles in overcoming these barriers.  In this project, Dr. Duina's laboratory will use a combination of genetic, biochemical, and targeted proteomic approaches to assess contributions of DNA sequences, histone modifications, histones, and other proteins in regulating physical interactions between Spt16 and transcribed genes.  The model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae will be used for this project, and given the high degree of evolutionary conservation in the factors and processes under investigation, results from these studies will contribute to our understanding of a process relevant to all eukaryotic organisms, including humans.\r\n\r\nThis project is funded by the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe central goal of this award was to gain new insights into the process by which cells use their genetic information to produce proteins.  This process, referred to as the gene expression pathway, is critically important for the proper functioning of all organisms and represents one of the most conserved biological processes across all of life.  During the first step of the gene expression pathway, known as transcription, regions of the DNA are copied by an enzyme called RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) into related molecules referred to as mRNAs, which in turn are utilized by cells to produce specific proteins.  Whereas Pol II is the key enzyme involved in synthesizing mRNA, many other proteins, including a protein complex called yFACT, assist Pol II in this process to ensure that the DNA is effectively accessed by Pol II and that proper gene structure is maintained following transcription.  \n\nThe research supported by this award has resulted in several new findings. Using budding yeast as a model for understanding fundamental cellular processes, we first found that proper dissociation of yFACT at the end of the transcription process relies, at least in part, on Pol II dissociation.  Second, whereas we found that specific DNA sequences are for the most part not required for efficient dissociation of yFACT from genes, we identified one small stretch of DNA that was partially responsible for yFACT dissociation from the corresponding gene.  Finally, we have identified new regions within a particle known as the nucleosome that are important for ensuring proper yFACT departure from genes.  Collectively, these results expand our understanding of the basic mechanisms that control proper departure of yFACT from DNA following transcription.  An additional outcome resulting from this award has been the publication of a procedure that can be used by investigators in the field to study aspects of the gene expression pathway.\n\nAnother major outcome from this award has been at the level of undergraduate student mentoring.  Fourteen undergraduate students were actively involved in this project through research in my lab.  Through their experiences in the lab, these students acquired a variety of skills, including in experimental design and execution, data analysis and interpretation, and scientific writing.  Many also had the opportunity to present their findings at scientific conferences, with several of them receiving awards for their presentations.  In addition, forty-five students carried out experiments related to this award in the context of a course I teach at the college; many of these students expressed gratitude for having had the opportunity to carry out authentic and relevant research as part of one of their courses.  Many of my research students also presented their work to non-STEM audiences, including to Arkansas lawmakers at the annual Posters at the Capitol event in Little Rock and to their Hendrix College non-science-major peers as part of an event I organize every year for the lab that we call Come Hear What I Do in the Lab.  I consider myself very fortunate to have had the opportunity to share my knowledge and passion for science with so many gifted undergraduate students and I feel a sense of fulfillment to see that my mentoring has positively impacted many students as they move forward with their own scientific careers.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/18/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrea A Duina"
