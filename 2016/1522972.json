 "awd_abstract_narration": "Archaeologists have expended a lot of research effort trying to determine whether or not periods of past climate change had a significant effect on human populations. In the case of coastal Alaska over the past several thousand years, the available data indicate that for the most part, the answer has been \"not much\" - the marine ecosystem seems to have remained relatively stable, even through periods of climate change such as the Medieval Warm Period and the so-called \"Little Ice Age\". The one exception to this generalization is found on Unalaska Island, in the eastern Aleutians. At about 4000 years ago, ringed seals, which are an ice-adapted species, made up a significant portion of the subsistence base. This suggests that temperatures were substantially colder than they are today. However, many of the species that are common in the area today (in the absence of significant levels of sea ice) were also an important part of the subsistence economy 4000 years ago.  \r\n\r\nThis research aims to try to address this apparent contradiction; was it cold and icy? Or was it generally more temperate, much as it is today? To do so, the scientists will (a) study the growth patterns and shell chemistry of modern and archaeological butter clams, which will give us an indication of what the water conditions were like. They will also (b) conduct a detailed analysis of all of the species present in the archaeological midden sites, including the age composition of what was being harvested, as an indication of what the environmental conditions were like. And, finally, they will (c) conduct a detailed analysis of the artifacts associated with marine mammal hunting to determine the likelihood that hunters 4000 years ago developed a specialized toolkit for hunting in the sea ice.\r\n\r\nAs coastal communities throughout the Arctic face important decisions regarding the possibility of major climate change, the research team believes that it will be important to have some \"test cases\" that provide information on how various communities have responded to climate change in the past. The archaeological sites on Unalaska Island provide nearly 4000 years worth of data of adaptation to past climate change; data that are directly relevant to understanding the challenges of future climate change.\r\n\r\nThis project will investigate the effects of Late Holocene climate change on animal biodiversity and human foraging activity in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. This three-year, interdisciplinary study will use zooarchaeological, paleoenvironmental, biological, and oceanographic data to test the hypothesis that fluctuations in Late Holocene climate significantly affected local environments, ecosystems, and human hunting strategy in the eastern Aleutian Islands. This interdisciplinary project will apply models of human foraging behavior to research human-animal-environmental interactions in the context of climate change using three major lines of evidence: 1) growth patterns and stable oxygen isotopes in archaeological shellfish will be used to reconstruct the local paleoenvironment; 2) archaeological faunal material from several taxonomic groups will be used to test whether animal distribution and behavior have changed through time in response to changes in climate; 3) artifacts will be analyzed to look for adaptations to the marine mammal hunting toolkit in response to changes in climate and resource availability. More specifically, the research team proposes a research program that will use multiple datasets from Unalaska Island to address whether sea ice and ice-loving (\"pagophilic\") fauna were present in this region during the Neoglacial phase, suggesting a dramatic change in prehistoric climate. The interdisciplinary nature of archaeology makes it uniquely positioned to accomplish two things: 1) to offer truly long term data about the ecological, climate, and resource histories for the Gulf of Alaska, data that are vital to understanding both ancient and contemporary human and environmental interaction in this region and 2) to collaborate with local Native Alaskan communities and students, resource managers, and cultural resource managers to collect, interpret, and disseminate the data and findings.",

Unangax (Alaska Native) ancestors were faced with dramatically colder conditions from 5000-3000 years ago, when sea ice probably came as far south as Unalaska Island from the Bering Sea. We used the animal bones, chemistry, and artifacts in archaeological sites on Unalaska Island to test whether sea ice was present in this environment and how people adapted to this dramatic environmental change. The results demonstrate that conditions fluctuated: during periods when sea ice was not present, people continued to use local animals that prefer temperate conditions, such as harbor and Northern fur seals, Pacific salmon and cod, and a variety of local birds. However, during the coldest years, they also harvested animals from the sea ice that are not found on Unalaska Island today, including polar bear, brown bear, and ringed and bearded seal. This mix of animals in the archaeological sites suggest that conditions were sometimes cold enough to support sea ice in this normally temperate environment. The artifacts recovered from these sites offer further clues to this environmental change: while Unangax ancestors may have made use of ice-loving animals, they do not seem to have changed their hunting techniques or their complex hunting toolkit. The harpoons preserved in these archaeological sites indicate people continued to use familiar Aleutian hunting technology to harvest novel species when sea ice was present, rather than developing new tools. Together, the archaeological and environmental data produced by this project suggest that people were able to adapt their toolkits and hunting strategies to incorporate dramatic environmental change. USIP presents a complicated picture of successful human and animal adaptation to a changeable environment.</p>\n<p>We had permission from the Ouhnalashka Corporation to do this research, and USIP was a collaborative project among academic institutions, the Museum of the Aleutians (MOTA), undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows. The results of this work have been presented at academic conferences, in academic publication, in public talks in Alaska, at the Unangan Camp Qungaayux and with elementary school students, and in a museum exhibit at MOTA entitled <em>Using the Scientific Method: The Unalaska Sea Ice Project</em>. This exhibit will open in tandem with a meeting in the local community on &ldquo;ways of knowing&rdquo;, a conversation about how Western scientists and Indigenous Unangax people understand the past, facilitated by MOTA. The next stage of this research is to work with climate scientists and DNA specialists to understand exactly where the sea ice may have been on this landscape in the past, and to work with Unangax/Aleut descendants to reconstruct local knowledge of sea ice.</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 07/10/2024<br>\nModified by: Catherine&nbsp;F&nbsp;West</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div
