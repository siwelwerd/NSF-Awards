 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Early Career Undergraduate Research Experience (eCURe) program is an innovative model for improving STEM education at the community college level. Based on the effective practices demonstrated at the university level, the eCURe project seeks to use undergraduate research as a platform for engaging students in STEM education, promoting STEM careers, improving STEM skills training and enhancing critical thinking. More specifically, the project will be investigating how early research experiences for community college students lead to improved success and retention in their STEM academic path. This program, in collaboration with four-year institutions and industry partners, will create an employer-driven accelerated contextualized STEM pathway that provides more research-like experiences on a community college campus via redesigned curriculum and instructional methodology, and lead to summer internships for students at partner institutions. This project will allow underrepresented and economically disadvantaged students from the community college to have a similar experience as their counterparts at four year schools. These early research experiences will better prepare these students for both the workforce and transfer. This project will develop model curriculum that can be adopted at other community colleges and lead to increased diversity in the STEM fields. \r\n\r\nThe eCURe model includes purposeful redesign of STEM curriculum, including the scaffolding of research knowledge and skills across multiple STEM disciplines. Furthermore, the model will develop three levels of research experiences beginning with research exposure and building to full research internships similar to the National Science Foundation's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) model.  The incorporation of current research methods into introductory level STEM course work is unique at the community college level and the eCURe project will serve as a national model for building research capacity in two-year programs. Providing community college students with authentic research training and experiences within industry, government and university laboratories promises to increase real-world applied skills in STEM students. The eCURe project will serve as a pilot for determining the most effective means of providing STEM education that include required research knowledge and skills. The size and diversity of Pasadena City College makes it a prime candidate to adopt such a project and to serve as an exemplar for other community colleges throughout the nation. The project has been developed with a broad intent to ensure the ability to replicate the model at other institutions.",

The eCURe model includes purposeful redesign of STEM curriculum including the incorporation of scaffolded research knowledge via incorporation of current research methods into introductory level STEM course work in particular Introductory Chemistry, followed by more directed research training in a research methods course or independent research, followed by a summer research internship experience. Pilot Introductory Chemistry courses were offered where problem-based learning labs were incorporated and more active classroom engagement with Chemical Thinking.&nbsp;Multiple students said the passion and dedication of the instructor was essential to enjoyment of any introductory chemistry class, as was the ability to incorporate real world examples. Students also appreciated more active didactic strategies, such as solving problems together and more interaction between students and the professor. Research methods courses in both physical science and biological science were developed and offered. Students felt this research experience improved their understanding of research, integration of learning, research skills, and attitudes toward research.&nbsp;Twenty-nine students did summer research internships at our partner institutions: Jet Propulsion Laboratories (JPL), Oak Crest Research Institute of Science; Cal Poly Pomona; and Huntington Medical Research Institute (HMRI). These students presented their work with posters at research conferences like&nbsp;SCCUR&nbsp;(Southern California Conferences&nbsp;for Undergraduate Research),&nbsp;ACS&nbsp;(American Chemical Society) National conferences, CPP&nbsp;Creative Activities &amp; Research Symposium, and PCC's Celebration of Summer Research Poster events.&nbsp;Notable&nbsp;was in 2018, the&nbsp;CPP&nbsp;project was presented at 2018&nbsp;SANCAS&nbsp;: The National Diversity in STEM Conference in San Antonio, Texas where one of our student&rsquo;s&nbsp;presentation received one of the 2018&nbsp;SACNAS&nbsp;Student Presentation Awards. Also, one of&nbsp;students had his work at HMRI published in&nbsp;Alzheimer&nbsp;and Dementia, The Journal of the Alzheimer's Association. Many of these summer research students reported the greatest benefit of this research internship was exposure to different career options - Ph.D., MD, or both (contributing to their career plans). Some students felt that exploring different career options was really the purpose of the internship. Providing community college students with authentic research training and experiences within industry, government and university laboratories not only increased real-world applied skills, but also provided these students with a clear demonstration of what STEM careers could be.
