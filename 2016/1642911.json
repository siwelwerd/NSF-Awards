The funds are to increase participation of qualified US-based students with attention to for underrepresented groups. The grant gives students an opportunity to engage in technical, professional, and social components of the meeting, which will contribute to their formation as researchers in the field, will provide them with feedback about their work, and will create and strengthen collaborations.  It will help build the next generation of researchers in the field.",
