 "awd_abstract_narration": "The integration of computer science and mathematics for middle school is a growing area of interest for increasing students' access to computer science concepts. There are natural opportunities to merge the two when considering mathematics topics such as operations on numbers and interpreting and writing algebraic expressions, which are critical concepts for later mathematics. The project will select mathematics topics that research has shown to be challenging for students and develop  computer science modules situated in real-world contexts to engage students' and support their learning of both the mathematics and  computer science content. The project creates a collaboration between computer scientists, STEM education faculty, and practicing teachers in order to develop these learning modules for middle school. The project will investigate what is needed for schools and teachers to successfully integrate  computer science and mathematics. Evidence of learning will be gathered from student work in small groups and individual assessment data. Thus, the study will investigate what it takes to broaden participation in computer science via integration with mathematics. The STEM+Computing Partnership (STEM+C) program seeks to advance multidisciplinary integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning through applied research and development across one or more domains. \r\n\r\nThe proposed work will examine the implementation of  computer science modules for middle-school general mathematics courses (i.e., not just for advanced students). The investigation uses a design-based research framework to study both the creation of modules and their implementation in middle school mathematics. The project will engage design teams, including middle school teachers and university faculty to develop the modules. The mixed methods research design is used to examine both the process of design (i.e., design principles) and the results for student learning in mathematics and  computer science. To analyze the data, the project will draw on a \"communities of practice framework\" to examine the design process used by the team members and relate it to students' learning outcomes.",

The project developed 12 integrated math/CS curriculum modules (four each for grades 6, 7, and 8), complete with student tasks and teacher materials to guide classroom implementation. The development of the curriculum was guided by the principles of Design-Based Research (Design-Based Research Collective, 2003). Across the project, sixteen teachers from four middle schools representing different school contexts (urban, high needs, suburban) participated as members of the design team and trial testers of the math/CS modules. Approximately 50-100 middle-school students participated in the classes of those who taught each year. The project examined what it ?takes? for mathematics teachers to implement math/CS modules in their classrooms and determined student outcomes related to these modules. The results of this project provide preliminary proof of concept evidence for inclusion of such modules into mathematics instruction. The objectives which successfully guided the project were to: (1) employ Design-Based Research for the development and implementation of CS modules for general mathematics courses at each middle-school grade level (6, 7, and 8); (2) engage teams of middle-school mathematics teachers, CS university faculty, and STEM educational researchers in collaborating in the design and development of these CS modules; (3) examine the effectiveness of the CS modules for teaching selected Common Core aligned mathematics content and practices; (4) examine the effectiveness of the CS modules for teaching basic, foundational CS content and practices; and (5) explore the capacity building necessary for schools to successfully integrate CS modules into mathematics instruction at the middle-school level.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The project was driven by the growing realization of the importance of CS and data science in many job sectors, yet by some estimates less than 25% of U.S. K-12 schools offer high quality programming and coding courses (The White House, 2016; 2021). Another driving force was the lack of diversity in students currently engaged in CS and further, that girls (Hur, Andrzejewski, &amp; Marghitu, 2017 ) and students of color (Royal &amp; Swift, 2016) are less likely to be exposed to CS than their white, male counterparts. To examine ways to reverse these trends, the project engaged a diverse group of students at an early point in their academic paths (middle school), a time when they are developing their conception of themselves as STEM \"able\" or not. Thus, the <strong>Intellectual Merit</strong> of the project arose from determining that the math/CS curricula were effective at engaging a diversity of students in general middle-school mathematics classes in CS and mathematics. (Because of mathematics education trends, general mathematics classes include a more a diverse group of students than do more advanced mathematics classes.) Finally, as there are growing interests in CS integration into mathematics, the determination of what is needed to build school and teacher capacity is key for such instruction to occur. Thus, the intellectual merit of the proposal stemmed from (1) determining the effectiveness of early CS experiences (middle school) in supporting both mathematics and CS learning in diverse groups of students, (2) developing a set of design principles for integrating CS into mathematics instruction, (3) fostering an awareness of and possible interest in CS in a diverse group of students, and (4) determining what it \"takes\" to develop school and teacher capacity to provide such experiences.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The Broader Impacts are closely related to the Intellectual Merit, namely, to impact society more broadly by the development and pilot testing of integrated math/CS curriculum in middle-school general-mathematics courses. The curriculum developed by the project has the potential to contribute to increasing the number and diversity of students interested in and prepared for high-school and post-secondary work in CS and mathematics. It is has been shown (Ashcraft et al., 2012) that such a foundation is important for broadening the representation of girls and minorities in CS?groups currently underrepresented in the discipline at the high-school, undergraduate, and graduate levels as well as in the workforce.</p>\n<p>References:</p>\n<p>Ashcraft, C., Eger, E., Friend, M.
