 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) program is a broad-based, community-guided, upper atmospheric research program. It is aimed at understanding the behavior of atmospheric regions from the middle atmosphere upward through the ionized upper layers of the atmosphere and into outer space in terms of coupling, energetics, chemistry, and dynamics on regional and global scales. The mid-latitude ionosphere serves as the intermediary between the active ionospheres of the polar and equatorial regions, but it has not been studied very thoroughly. This Collaborative CEDAR award involving University of Texas at Dallas, Virginia Tech University, and the University of Colorado is aimed at developing the first quiet-time empirical model of the ionosphere electric field distribution to fill in the necessary ground truth needed to produce a true understanding of the global dynamics of the ionosphere. The research effort would use 15 years of Air Force Defense Meteorological Space Plasma (DMSP) measurements of ion zonal flow speeds in the mid-latitude ionosphere to construct an empirical model of mid-latitude ionospheric quiet-time electric fields. This data set would be supplemented by ion drift data obtained from the mid-latitude SuperDARN sites. This database would be made available to outside users, and thus, would be a valuable ionospheric community resource. Following the completion of the development of the quiet time model, observations from storm times will be compared to predictions based upon application of the new quiet time model. The determined differences would be analyzed within the guidance and context of the CTIP (Coupled thermosphere ionosphere plasmasphere)-RCM model runs to understand the underlying physical mechanisms causing the observed variability relative to the baseline model established, to quantify the magnitude and extent of storm-time disturbances, and finally, to quantify the coupling of the mid-latitude ion drifts to the neutral atmosphere and the transfer of energy between the polar and equatorial regions. Finally, making use of nearly two decades of DMSP data to understand and develop empirical models goes to the heart of one of the fundamental challenges of the CEDAR Aeronomy program, which is to quantify a baseline model of mid-latitude electric fields. Consequently, the question of variability as a function of solar phase, geomagnetic activity, and dynamical coupling to the lower atmosphere and to the magnetosphere regions can be more carefully assessed. The results achieved would be of great interest and use to the ionosphere and thermospheric modeling community and also relevant to the CEDAR mission of \"understanding the fundamental properties of the space-atmosphere interaction region (SAIR); identify the interconnected processes that define the SAIR's global behavior, evolution, and influence on the Sun-Earth system\".  \r\n\r\nThe main goal of this project is to quantify the response of the ionosphere relative to direct, spectrally separated measurements of solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from the TIMED and SDO spacecraft. This approach constitutes an immense improvement over previous studies based on proxies. The C/NOFS and DMSP spacecraft at a range of altitudes will provide corresponding measurements of ionospheric parameters. This dataset, spanning more than a solar cycle, allows for the use of advanced statistical analysis techniques and will be used together with the SAMI-2 model to address outstanding science questions related to understanding the ionospheric response to solar EUV variability. Interesting questions to be investigated include the relative importance of and interaction between the responses in the neutral and ionized components of the upper atmosphere.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEarth\u2019s ionosphere extends in altitude upwards from about 80 km.  It consists of a partially ionized plasma that interacts with the neutral atmosphere, in particular through collisions between ions and the neutral constituents (molecules and atoms).  At latitudes below the auroral zone the dominant driver for ionospheric plasma motion is thought to be the neutral wind.  At higher latitudes the ionosphere links via geomagnetic field lines to the magnetopause, which is the boundary where the solar wind is deflected creating a volume that is dominated by Earth\u2019s magnetic field known as the magnetosphere. Coupling across the magnetopause drives plasma motion in the high latitude ionosphere at very high velocities, typically hundreds to thousands of meters per second.  This coupling is thought to extend to a cut-off latitude that coincides with the equatorial boundary of the auroral zone.  The ionosphere at lower latitudes is effectively shielded from the coupling of the solar wind to the magnetopause by electrodynamic processes in the outer magnetosphere. An abrupt transition is usually observed across the boundary to plasma velocities on the subauroral side that typically measure tens of meters per second, except when a major geomagnetic storm disrupts the shielding and the coupling penetrates to lower latitudes.\n\nIntrinsic merit: This project engaged experimentalists and modelers in a study of the nature and origins of subauroral plasma motion in the ionosphere.  The component supported specifically under this award focused on the analysis of radar measurements of subauroral plasma flow over the zone extending equatorward of the auroral boundary by about 10&deg;.  Many years of data collected with radars of the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) chain located in the U.S. were analyzed to produce statistical models of subauroral plasma flow across the nightside ionosphere.  Comparison with models of neutral winds over the same region indicate that coupling to the neutral atmosphere is not the only, or even primary, driver of subauroral plasma motion.  Significant features are consistent with leakage of solar wind coupling effects into the subauroral zone even in the absence of geomagnetic storm activity.  A closer examination of seasonal factors indicates that the conductivity of the ionosphere plays a role in mediating the relative effectiveness of the solar wind coupling and neutral wind factors.  In addition, it was shown that penetration of solar wind coupling manifests directly in the subauroral plasma flow in terms of the well-known dependencies of high latitude convection on the orientation of the magnetic field carried by the solar wind. This work has demonstrated decisively that penetration of solar wind coupling effects to subauroral latitudes is a persistent feature of the ionosphere. It has generated the first detailed model of subauroral plasma flow that incorporates factors such as season, the solar wind magnetic field, and geomagnetic disturbance level.\n\nBroader impacts: The findings from this study represent points for testing and developing comprehensive models of ionospheric dynamics.  There are potentially consequences for the broader discipline of space weather in that disturbance effects due to solar wind coupling have been found to impact the ionosphere at subauroral latitudes even during non-storm periods. Technological systems that rely on the ionosphere as a propagation medium such as HF radar, communications, and GPS, could be impacted. Over the course of this project a graduate student was trained in advanced methods of analysis and performed research that was published in leading journals. The work of this project contributed substantially to the student satisfying the requirements for award of the PhD degree.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/18/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: J.
