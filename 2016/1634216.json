 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a workshop on fluid power advanced manufacturing. Fluid power is a unique method for power transfer and motion control. The two major domains of fluid power are hydraulics and pneumatics. Fluid power is widely used in industrial and mobile applications. For example, many off-road vehicles including construction machines and agriculture equipment use fluid power to propel the vehicle and conduct working functions. The amount of energy transmitted through fluid power accounts for 2 to 2.9 Quads (or quadrillion BTUs) per year. Advanced manufacturing, such as additive manufacturing, offers new opportunities for improving performance and efficiency of fluid power components and systems. The workshop will help to connect the manufacturing innovations with model-based design and analysis to enable new fluid power systems and applications.\r\n\r\nThe objective of the workshop is to identify the pre-competitive research needs and approaches of integrating manufacturing innovations with model-based design and analysis for fluid power components and systems. The workshop will be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Researchers in manufacturing, fluid power components and systems, system modeling, analysis and control will be invited to attend the workshop. The organizing committee will work with the industry advisory team to select plenary speakers. The workshop will last two days and consists of both plenary sessions and breakout sessions. The organizing committee will compile a comprehensive report on the workshop outcomes that include a list of participants, presentations, notes from the plenary session and breakout session discussions. The report will outline the main challenges and approaches in integrating advanced manufacturing with model based design and analysis for fluid power.",
