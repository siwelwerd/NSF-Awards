 "awd_abstract_narration": "Aggression between dating partners is a serious societal, health, and criminal justice problem that affects many persons, particularly adolescents and young adults. Although often understood as a phenomenon that is transmitted across generations, growing up in an aggressive household does not necessarily lead to aggressive romantic relationships.  Identifying factors associated with resilience versus risk for young adult dating aggression is an important step for developing effective and targeted educational and intervention programs.  Much of the prior research focuses on static individual characteristics to identify who is at risk for dating aggression. However, this study focuses on the dynamic interplay between individual, contextual and emotion regulation processes as they unfold in real time. Conflict sensitization theories, which guide this study, propose that conflict can be escalated when individuals experience both heightened physiological arousal and behavioral and emotional sensitivity. Young adult dating couples are relatively unfamiliar with the challenges of handling conflict in romantic relationships. Therefore they offer a prime opportunity for understanding how conflict is triggered in everyday interactions and for linking conflict patterns to earlier family relationships. \r\n\r\nThis study advances science by taking the study of dating aggression out of the laboratory and into real-world, ecologically-valid home environments. The study examines everyday interactions between dating partners, and how individuals adjust and adapt, a process called \"self-regulation,\" via behavioral, physiological, emotional, and vocal processes. Such processes will vary in dating couples' home environments as a function of naturally-occurring changes in relationship stress. These measures capture regulatory processes that will be time-linked to couple irritation and conflict, allowing for the assessment of the beginning phases of negative escalation cycles.  Smartphone technology is used to capture momentary assessment of partners' activities, emotions, spoken words, vocally encoded arousal, and physical proximity. Mobile health technologies assess physiological arousal through measurements of skin conductance and heart rate. Using multi-modal cutting-edge methodologies for data collection in couples' naturalistic environment, this research may provide new insights into how regulatory systems are linked in real time within and across partners. The research will also yield new insights about how aggression affects regulatory processes, and how dating aggression can be reduced.",

Narayanan\n\nFor most adults, romantic relationships are important sources of both risk and resilience for overall well-being.  Despite the importance of these relationships, research into adult romantic relationships has been relegated primarily to imprecise measurement, namely global self-reports or time-limited observations of couple interactions in controlled laboratory settings. Such methods provide only limited insight into important relationship phenomena.  The USC Couple Mobile Sensing Project, in contrast, captures the dynamic, fluctuating features of couple relationships through smartphone technologies and wearable biosensors.  A unique contribution of this study is the simultaneous and ongoing data capture of vocal, relational, emotional, and physiological signals over an entire day. With these data streams, we have been able to illustrate how regulatory microprocesses are linked within individuals and across partners, and how the microprocesses relate to larger relationship phenomena such as couple aggression, family-of-origin aggression, and relationship quality.\n\nThe role of technology in capturing couple phenomena that heretofore have been understudied:  With a research team comprising psychologists and engineers, we designed procedures to capture detailed information in real time across 24-hours as couples go about everyday activities.  Mobile phones were used (with participant consent and ethical guidelines) to record approximately 50% of couple conversations as well as hourly reports of emotions, stress, relationship closeness, and annoyance.

An important dimension of our work has been developing machine-learning models involving multiple data streams (acoustic, linguistic, physiological, contextual, and self-reports) to detect couple conflict and personal stress.\n\nHow prior experiences of aggression infiltrate couples' everyday conversations:  A key question of our project is whether prior experiences with aggression in close relationships seep into couples' naturalistic, momentary interactions.  From our data, reports of prior relationship aggression were related to hostility coded from recorded daily conversations, but the direction of effects differed for women and men.  Women who are recipients of partner aggression expressed less hostility in their daily interactions whereas men who are recipients of partner aggression expressed more hostility. Linguistic analyses showed more collaborative 'we' and 'I' speech in couples with low aggression, but greater symmetry in 'you' speech during hours of annoyance for couples with high aggression. In line with intergenerational transmission of aggression theories, participants reporting more family-of-origin aggression exhibited more hostility in daily communications, although somewhat differently for women and men.  Linguistic analyses showed that men reporting more parent-to-child aggression and higher annoyance through the day directed more angry words at their partner in spoken words.  Women's angry words fluctuated in relation to men's annoyance.  Moreover, for women exposed to family aggression, the link between their annoyance and anger words was heightened.  Such findings from naturally occurring conversations reveal possible mechanisms underlying conflict processes, and identify potential points of intervention.\n\nRelationship Processes and Physiological Reactions: Our study of physiological reactivity in daily life showed that dating aggression perpetration was linked to generally lower levels of EDA in both women and men; family-of-origin aggression was linked to lower EDA only in men.  However, when feeling annoyed at their dating partner, women who perpetrate more dating aggression and report more family-of-origin aggression exhibited higher EDA. Moreover, family-of-origin was linked with dating partner aggression via heightened EDA, suggesting biological sensitivity as a possible mechanism underlying the intergenerational transmission of aggression.

The linkage increased during hours that partners felt close to another, but not when they were annoyed.  In our examination of couples' heart rates in daily life, men's lower heart rate when sleeping was associated with women's feelings of closeness during the day, whereas men's higher nighttime heart rate was associated with women's daytime annoyance.
