This first symposium of its kind in the new and emerging area of Networked CPS is to be held at the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) of the Technical University of Munich (TUM) tentatively on September 19-20, 2016. The plan is to have this Symposium on an annual basis, with the location alternating each year between TUM, Munich, and UMD, College Park. This symposium will aim at the establishment of collaboration in the new area of Networked CPS at an international level. The broader societal impact of the proposed effort is likely to be high due to its strong relevance to a new generation of industry, namely exploiting the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The training, education, and workforce development involving under-represented groups are going to play a critical role in this new development and will be discussed as well.\r\n\r\nAt this workshop, the critical research challenges will be identified by world renowned researchers from several countries (USA, Germany, England, Switzerland, Greece, and The Netherlands), who are experts in a variety of fields related to the interdisciplinary area of Networked CPS. The workshop will also aim to explore the intellectual underpinnings of a highly important and emerging area, potentially having great global and technological impact due to its strong relevance to a new generation of industry, namely involving the so called the Internet-of-Things (IoT). The results of the workshop will be made available to the public in the form of a report. Requested funds will be used primarily to cover the expenses of plenary and invited speakers and researchers from the USA.",

This was the first symposium of its kind on the very new and highly relevant area of Networked CPS (Net-CPS). Net-CPS is a cross-cutting theme which includes aspects of networked and distributed decision making and control, multi-agent systems, hybrid systems, networks, formal methods for verification and synthesis, safety, security, privacy.&nbsp;While in CPS a key challenge is the modeling, performance evaluation and design of the tight integration of cyber and physical components, additional critical challenges emerge when such CPS operate in a networked setting. The challenges start even for defining and modeling what is meant by \"network\" in these scenaria.</p>\n<p>The Symposium was co-organized by Professor John S. Baras (Institute for Systems Research (ISR), University of Maryland (UMD)) and Professor Sandra Hirche (School of Electrical Engineering and the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS), Technical University of Munich (TUM)).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One of the key objectives of the Symposium was to strengthen and broaden collaboration in this important technical area between USA scientists and engineers and German scientists and engineers, and in a broader sense European scientists and engineers. Furthermore the organizers have undertaken special efforts to ensure balanced participation from academia and industry, as well as from women and other under-represented groups.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The principal objective of the symposium was to provide a forum for presenting state of the art work and describe challenges in this emerging and critical area. The overall program consisted of three plenary lectures, twelve invited lectures and two panels. Fifteen international experts delivered invited lectures, organized around the four themes:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1)&nbsp;Verification of Net-CPS</p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;Electric Energy Systems as Net-CPS</p>\n<p>3)&nbsp;Traffic systems as Net-CPS</p>\n<p>4)&nbsp;Control and security in Net-CPS</p>\n<p>More than 90 researchers from several countries participated.</p>\n<p>The following important points of discussion and conclusions by the two panels have had broad impact on CPS as evidenced by various meetings including the annual NSF Pl meetings on CPS and the panels in these meetings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1.<span> </span>Networked CPS have very wide and diverse application domains. The transportation, energy and manufacturing sectors are currently the most \"pushing\" domains.</p>\n<p>2. The scale and complexity of Networked CPS grow continuously as inexpensive communication, computation and sensing become increasingly more available. Analysis and design methods have to measure up in scalability. The effect of the network, and on its different possible meanings - be it the interaction, information sharing, or communication network - needs to be better understood.</p>\n<p>3. Due to the complexity, multi-physics, multi-time scale, and distributed nature of Networked CPS, their modeling poses a significant research challenge. Furthermore, the sources, and thus the quality of models, might be heterogeneous, which needs to be considered in analysis and design. Combination of model-based and data-?based designs appears as one of the promising routes. Runtime calibration of models using data and run-time certification are further topics of high relevance.</p>\n<p>4. Safety, security, resilience, and privacy are important aspects of the design - in addition to performance. This often leads to contradictory design specifications, for example between performance and privacy, for which suitable trade-offs need to be found. Architectural principles for networked CPS are another open research challenge.</p>\n<p>5. Humans play a significant role in Networked CPS. Humans interact with a Networked CPS through interfaces, which need to be efficient and intuitive to use. Given the increasing autonomy of Networked CPS, it is important to determine when human intervention is needed / desired. Humans further determine the quality metrics in many Networked CPS application domains, e.g. in transportation and energy systems. Understanding human decision making, human-system interaction/cooperation, and human quality metrics is important. But also legal issues arising with increasing autonomy need to be considered, e.g. responsibility in case of failure.</p>\n<p>6. Education needs to change to address the new challenges raised by Networked CPS and the key role played by humans. Emphasis on modeling and validation methods and tools should be incorporated in both undergraduate and graduate classes, as well as analytical methods combining calculus and logic mathematics. It is also extremely important to develop courses providing hands-on projects with realistic Networked CPS and human elements.</p>\n<p>The Symposium had broad impact on the CPS discipline, as evidenced by new conferences on the topics discussed that appeared like the IEEE Conference on Cyber-Human-Physical-Systems, and the Dagstuhl Seminar on Networked CPS in May of 2019, among others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Several international collaborations were initiated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We have witnessed increased emphasis on papers in the technical literature on Networked CPS.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Research groups have been formed on the topic of Networked CPS in several major Universities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A Volume containing the Proceedings and conclusions of the First International Symposium on Networked Cyber-Physical Systems, was produced.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/23/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;S&nbsp;Baras</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1655009/1655009_10449304_1569211064402_Image-1-Net-CPS-2016--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1655009/1655009_10449304_1569211064402_Image-1-Net-CPS-2016--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Net-CPS 2016\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1655009/1655009_10449304_1569211064402_Image-1-Net-CPS-2016--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Net-CPS 2016\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">International Symposium on Networked Cyber-Physical Systems, September 2016, Institute for Advanced Study, Technical University of Munich.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">TUM and UMD</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;S&nbsp;Baras</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Net-CPS 2016</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1655009/1655009_10449304_1569211305524_170921-baras-1-160919-Group-Picture-2-DSC_0025(2)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1655009/1655009_10449304_1569211305524_170921-baras-1-160919-Group-Picture-2-DSC_0025(2)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Net-CPS 2016-PARTICIPANTS\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1655009/1655009_10449304_1569211305524_170921-baras-1-160919-Group-Picture-2-DSC_0025(2)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Net-CPS 2016-PARTICIPANTS\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Participants in the International Symposium on Net-CPS, Institute for Advanced Study, Technical University of Munich.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">TUM</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;S&nbsp;Baras</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Net-CPS 2016-PARTICIPANTS</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
