 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Noyce Teacher Scholarship and Stipend project will train 24 STEM teachers to teach in high-needs high schools in central and southern New Jersey.  The goal of the project is to develop sound, adaptable, and sustainable strategies for increasing the number and quality of K-12 science and math educators from underrepresented groups, particularly Latinos, in these traditionally low income communities.  The objectives are to (a) recruit student cohorts from Rider University and partner community colleges, (b) deliver sustainable academic and extracurricular programming that supports the development of highly qualified and culturally responsive high school STEM teachers, (c) provide frequent opportunities for faculty development across campus to institutionalize an emergent culture of civic engagement into STEM courses, as a tool to increase retention of the participants, and (d) support these teachers during an induction period.\r\n\r\nThe project will increase the number of high-quality high school science and math teachers from underrepresented groups, particularly Latinos.  Relying on social science research, the project clearly identifies challenges (inadequate mathematics and science preparation, poor self-efficacy, negative sociocultural factors, hostile campus climate, and economic burdens) that underrepresented students face as they attempt to attain STEM degrees and describes how these challenges will be addressed.  Central to the project are the development of culturally responsive teachers through the incorporation of Science Education for New Civic Engagements & Responsibilities (SENCER) techniques into their STEM curriculum, the creation of a grow-your-own recruitment plan that integrates elements such as family-centered and bilingual and bicultural engagement, and the use of established inquiry-based professional development institutes during the induction period.  Project evaluation will focus on the effectiveness of the educational strategies used for the Noyce scholars before graduation and during induction.  Affective outcomes such as STEM teaching self-efficacy will be examined along with academic success, and retention in the field.  The effectiveness of the scholars' teaching practices will also be assessed using teaching evaluation scores from AchieveNJ, the state educator evaluation agency.  Project curricula will be disseminated through the SENCER website and results will be submitted to the Journal of STEM Education or the Journal of Research in Science Teaching.",

Our approach was executed within two major themes:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Installation of Sustainable &amp; Imitable Curricular Pathways:</strong></p>\n<p>The Teacher Education programs offered by Rider&rsquo;s College of Education &amp; Human Services (CEHS) earn the highest accreditation by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP). These credentials prescribe that undergraduates in these programs must obtain their BA in Education (Elementary or Secondary) while pursuing a full second major outside CEHS&ndash;this latter requirement being consonant with the Noyce Track I program. Uniquely, all required Teacher Education coursework can be completed in four semesters, theoretically allowing STEM transfers to graduate only two years following their Associates degrees. However, the notoriously high credit loads of STEM majors, compounded by the conflicting schedules of labs and in-field placement, make graduating with both degrees in four years an impossibility, for transfers and non-transfers alike. Additionally, while STEM students prefer their degree in their STEM field&ndash;seeing themselves primarily as mathematicians and scientists&ndash;Rider&rsquo;s preexisting curricular path is at odds with this disposition. In recruiting STEM undergraduates into this academic pathway, it is essential to be conscious of its value proposition, balancing the perceived personal/professional value of the degree with its cost&ndash;which at Rider is higher than its commensurate state schools. To this end, in addition to offering full-tuition scholarships and complete coverage of costs associated with licensure, our team collaborated with the Registrar, Office of Financial Aid, Academic Deans, and Academic Policy Committees to implement initiatives that would enable and attract undergraduates to complete Rider&rsquo;s STEM/Education program within four years:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Additional financial support for taking up to 12 credits as J-Term &amp; summer courses.</li>\n<li>Mandated Praxis tutoring for students receiving scholarship, provided at no cost<em> </em>by Rider&rsquo;s Academic Success Center or Noyce-contracted resource.</li>\n<li>Admissions permitted transfer-scholars to transfer more than the standard 60 credits fulfilling general education, cognate, and major requirements. Deans were likewise flexible with either waiving or substituting certain general education requirements.</li>\n<li>Established lower-credit BA degrees (49-54 credits) in Biology, Chemistry, &amp; Environmental Science, decreasing the number of cognate courses involved in the existing BS degrees (64-66 credits).</li>\n<li>Education/STEM dual majors received their STEM BA or BS as their primary degree, as reflected on their transcript. Furthermore, Deans often permitted overlapping of general education courses to fulfill the disparate requirements of both degrees.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>2. Professional Development in Culturally Responsive Pedagogies &amp; Strategies:</strong></p>\n<p>With the understanding that classroom management is one of the greatest factors contributing to novice teacher attrition&ndash;a statistic exacerbated in high-need school districts&ndash;we established meaningful, immersive opportunities for scholars, scholar candidates, and graduated scholars to learn, practice, and adopt culturally responsive classroom management strategies and teaching pedagogies, designed to minimize disruption and facilitate student engagement toward improved student learning:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A new three-credit course EDE 226: Teaching &amp; Managing in the Urban Classroom, was developed. Readings, discussions, and assignments focus on urban education, classroom management, and educational inequity, and the course culminates in an immersive two-week residential Philadelphia Urban Seminar program. The Noyce grant covered all costs associated with the course and program.</li>\n<li>Scholars participated in a series of mandatory professional development workshops, focused on adapting and adopting best teaching practices for concept attainment, guided inquiry, and confidence building in STEM disciplines. Furthermore, free professional development opportunities sponsored by the NSF-funded Philadelphia Regional Institute of STEM Educators (PRISE) and other organizations were (and still are) regularly forwarded to scholars.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of the 22 graduated scholars, 70% were recruited from local community colleges, 40% were from populations traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields, and 44% were first-generation college students. Overall, while Rider only increased its STEM Education graduates by 8% over a five-year period, a 300% increase in the proportion of those students graduating with teaching certification in a science discipline is directly attributable to the STEM Scholars program. All Noyce fellows have either fulfilled or are currently fulfilling their service requirements. While (1.1) &amp; (1.2) above are not sustainable after the grant period, the other initiatives represent Rider&rsquo;s systemic change in the priority it gives to preparing the next generation of STEM educators, which we are confident will continue to attract STEM majors to Teacher Education in the absence of financial benefits. Overall, this collaboration has resulted in the development of new coursework and curricular pathways, multiple presentations at academic conferences, and scholarly manuscripts in preparation for publication in peer-reviewed journals.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/20/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Danielle&nbsp;L&nbsp;Jacobs</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1557389/1557389_10415344_1687209829824_websiteheader--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1557389/1557389_10415344_1687209829824_websiteheader--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"website header\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1557389/1557389_10415344_1687209829824_websiteheader--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"website header\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">the header that was developed for the website</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Rider University</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Danielle&nbsp;L&nbsp;Jacobs</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">website header</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
