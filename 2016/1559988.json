 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Michigan Physics REU program provides a transformative summer research experience for undergraduate students from around the country who otherwise may not have access to a major research program. The first goal of the program is to prepare the students for a career in the physical sciences. The second goal is for the students to perform cutting edge research in modern physics laboratories with active research groups and dedicated faculty. The research areas include astrophysics and cosmology, atomic, molecular and optical physics, condensed matter physics, high energy physics, nonlinear dynamics, complex systems and nuclear physics.\r\n\r\nThe REU students work closely with a faculty mentor on a carefully crafted ten-week research project. The selected students are interviewed to determine their interest and are then matched to faculty who are active in research in that area. The project is defined based on the interest of the student and the research needs of the faculty. In addition to the research project the students are exposed to a variety of research topics and methodologies through a series of faculty research seminars. Professional development is a critical part of the REU program and students participate in tutorials on ethics, applying to graduate school, applying for grants, scientific writing and giving scientific presentations. Students engage in additional educational and social activities, including safety training, machine shop and electronic shop classes, lab tours and a variety of lunches with other students and faculty. These activities allow students to put their research experience in a wider perspective, to build a network of professional contacts, and to develop professional skills in a scientific environment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Department of Physics at the University of Michigan has a long history of promoting outstanding undergraduate research.  This award continues the long-running and successful REU Site hosted by the Department.\n\nThe primary goal of this REU Site is to provide a transformative research experience, especially to students with limited opportunities to participate in research at their home institutions, and to recruit a diverse set of students into the STEM fields.  Over the three-year period covered by this award, the Department hosted a total of 30 REU students from a variety of institutions, including 14 from primarily undergraduate institutions. \n\nIn addition to a strong focus on meaningful research under the supervision of a world-class faculty mentor, the REU Site organized a wide variety of professional and enrichment activities.  These included weekly research seminars as well as workshops on giving presentations, applying to graduate school, preparing for the GRE and on the responsible conduct of research.  The students were also trained in laboratory safety and had the opportunity to take a machine shop course.  One of the highlights of the REU program was an overnight trip to Fermilab that included free time to explore downtown Chicago.\n\nMany program activities, including the REU Symposium held at the end of the summer, included students from the Biophysics and other REU programs as well as internal students at the University of Michigan.  This provided numerous opportunities for the students to interact and begin to build up a professional network and to frame their projects in the context of the overall environment at a major research university.\n\nBased on student surveys, this REU Site has been successful in having students gain confidence in performing research and in functioning independently in a laboratory setting.  After participation, the majority of students have gone on to PhD programs in Physics, Applied Physics and Astronomy.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: James T Liu"
