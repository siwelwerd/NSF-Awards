 "awd_abstract_narration": "Deep-sea hydrothermal vents, first discovered in 1977, are exemplary ecosystems where microbial chemosynthesis rather than photosynthesis is the primary source of organic carbon. Chemosynthetic microorganisms use the energy generated by oxidizing reduced inorganic chemicals contained in the vent fluids, like hydrogen sulfide or hydrogen gas, to convert carbon dioxide (CO2) into cell material. By doing so, they effectively transfer the energy from a geothermal source to higher trophic levels, in the process supporting the unique and fascinating ecosystems that are characterized by high productivity - oases in the otherwise barren deep ocean landscape. While the general view of the functioning of these ecosystems is established, there are still major gaps in our understanding of the microbiology and biogeochemistry of these systems. Particularly lacking are studies measuring rates of microbial activity in situ, which is ultimately needed to understand production of these ecosystems and to assess their impact on global biogeochemical cycles. This project makes use of the Vent-Submersible Incubation Device (Vent-SID), a robotic micro-laboratory that was recently developed and tested in the field. This instrument makes it possible for the first time to determine rates of carbon fixation at both in situ pressures and temperatures, revolutionizing the way we conduct microbial biogeochemical investigations at deep-sea hydrothermal vents. This is an interdisciplinary and collaborative effort between two US and foreign institutions, creating unique opportunities for networking and to foster international collaborations. This will also benefit two graduate students working in the project, who will get exposed to a wide range of instrumentation and scientific fields, facilitating their interdisciplinary education.  In collaboration with Dr. Nitzan Resnick, academic dean of The Sage School, an elementary school outreach program will be developed and a long-term partnership with the school established. Further, a cruise blog site to disseminate the research to schools and the broader public will be set up. The results will be the topic of media coverage as well as be integrated into coursework and webpages existing either in the PI's labs or at the institution.\r\n\r\nThis project is using a recently developed robotic micro-laboratory, the Vent-SID, to measure rates of chemoautotrophic production and to determine the relative importance of oxygen and nitrate in driving chemosynthesis at deep-sea hydrothermal vents at in situ pressures and temperatures and to tackle the following currently unresolved science objectives: 1) obtain in situ rates of chemoautotrophic carbon fixation, 2) obtain in situ nitrate reduction rate measurements, and 3) directly correlate the measurement of these processes with the expression of key genes involved in carbon and energy metabolism. Although recent data suggests that nitrate reduction either to N2 (denitrification) or to NH4+ (dissimilatory reduction of nitrate to ammonium) might be responsible for a significant fraction of chemoautotrophic production, NO3-reduction rates have never been measured in situ at hydrothermal vents. The researchers hypothesize that chemoautrophic growth is strongly coupled to nitrate respiration in vent microbial communities. During a cruise that will take place approximately 12 months into the project (~Feb 2017), the researchers will carry out a total of 4 deployments of the Vent-SID as well as ancillary sampling collection at the 9\u00b046N to 9\u00b053N segment of the East Pacific Rise. They will focus efforts on two diffuse-flow vent sites, \"Crab Spa\" and \"Teddy Bear\". \"Crab Spa\" is a diffuse flow vent site (T: 25\u00b0C) that has been used as a model system to gain insights into chemoautotrophic processes and has been frequently sampled over the last several years. This vent site has been very well characterized, both geochemically and microbiologically, providing excellent background data for the proposed process oriented studies. \"Teddy Bear\" is a diffuse-flow site that was discovered in Jan 2014, and it has a lower temperature (T: 12\u00b0C), making it a good comparative site. The researchers will perform a number of short duration time-course incubations to assess the role of different environmental parameters that have been identified as likely key variables (e.g., O2, temperature, NO3-), and to link these process rate measurements to the expression of functional genes using metatranscriptomic analyses. This study will be the first attempt to measure critical metabolic processes of hydrothermal vent microbial assemblages under critical in situ conditions and to assess the quantitative importance of electron donor and acceptor pathways in situ. In the future, it is envisioned that the Vent-SID will become a routine application by the oceanographic community for measuring time series rates of relevant metabolic processes at hydrothermal vents under in situ pressures and vent fluid temperatures.",

Yet, there is currently a lack of studies measuring rates of chemosynthetic carbon fixation in situ, i.e., directly at the seafloor, which is a measurement ultimately needed to constrain production in these ecosystems. To this end, we have developed the Vent-Submersible Incubation Device (Vent-SID), a robotic micro-laboratory that makes it possible for the first time to determine rates of carbon fixation directly at the seafloor <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">and</span> at the temperature of the vent fluids at diffuse flow deep-sea hydrothermal vents. This is made possible by the novel capability of controlling the temperature of the twin incubation chambers, which mimic the physical conditions within warm water hydrothermal vent fluids being sampled at the sea floor and which likely exist deeper below the seafloor. In addition, the Vent-SID chemically preserves incubated samples at the time of subsample acquisition in a manner compatible with the latest molecular techniques for assessing the biochemical pathways utilized by the microbes.</p>\n<p>A cruise with R/V Atlantis/HOV Alvin took place in May 2017 to the 9&#730;N hydrothermal vent field on the East Pacific Rise (AT37-12). During the cruise, a total of three deployments took place. While the instrument worked as expected during test runs performed on deck, the deployment and recovery of the Vent-SID went very well, and no issues were encountered, we were unfortunately not able to get a successful seafloor deployment. In the end, it turned out that the stalling of the piston in the incubation chamber at in situ pressure had caused the instrument to fail to execute the program. To demonstrate proof of concept, we performed shipboard incubations using vent fluids collected by major titanium water samplers. In total, we conducted 6 on-deck incubation experiments to simulate a sea-floor incubation of the Vent-SID. The six 6-hour long incubations were all carried out at ~25&#730;C, the temperature of the vent fluids. Overall, the results of these shipboard incubations show that the incubations worked as envisioned, validating our approach. In the meantime, we have fixed the issue that occurred during the cruise and have performed successful tests at WHOI?s pressure test facility showing that the chambers function at the pressure of the studied vent sites. This makes us confident that we will be able to perform seafloor incubations under in situ conditions. The Vent-SID is a very exciting piece of equipment that has the potential to revolutionize the way we conduct microbial biogeochemical investigations at deep-sea hydrothermal vents.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts.</strong>&nbsp;The project implemented education and outreach efforts at multiple levels. The project involved the participation of undergraduate and graduate students, resulting in one PhD thesis. For the cruise, a blog site was set up (Dark Life II; https://web.whoi.edu/darklife/) to educate and inform a broad audience about our research and related activities, including reports by 11 first-time divers in Alvin. Sievert worked with teacher Lisa<strong> </strong>Troy and academic dean Dr. Nitzan Resnik of The Sage School on an Engineering Design Challenge related the Vent-SID for a 6<sup>th</sup> grade class. As part of the project, the students had to design, build, and test a sampling chamber using the design and engineering process. Along the way, they learned about the discovery of deep-sea vents and the functioning of the ecosystem, the role of microorganisms, challenges to conduct research and measurements in the deep-ocean, difference between heat and temperature, heat transfer, and the effects of pressure.
