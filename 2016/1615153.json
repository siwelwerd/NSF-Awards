 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support three important experiments in neutron beta decay, a process in which a neutron decays because of the weak nuclear force (or weak interaction) into a proton, an electron and an anti-neutrino.  The weak nuclear force is important because it powers our sun and helps determine the abundance of elements in the universe.  Neutron decay in particular is important because it plays a key role in the formation of helium in the early universe.  Additionally, neutron decay involves only a single nucleon and that makes it possible to calculate very precise predictions from the Standard Model of fundamental particles and interactions without complications from other nucleons.  With very accurate measurements of neutron decay, we can perform a kind of particle physics forensics, looking for discrepancies in the Standard Model that can indicate the presence of new forces but without using high energy particle beams.  This research is a part of the \"precision frontier\" for physics, and defines the cutting edge of our knowledge of the weak nuclear force and possible new interactions.\r\nAn important aspect of this research is the training of students and post-docs.  This contributes to the spreading of technical methods and expertise.   This training comes from the specific nature of the projects, which use nuclear physics analysis and technology, and from the many opportunities students have to perform research at our national laboratories and nuclear facilities. Some of the techniques used have real-world applications in energy generation and medical imaging.\r\n\r\n \r\nOne of the experiments supported by this award, Nab, will use an unpolarized beam of cold neutrons at the Spallation Neutron Source from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to measure the angular correlation between the decay electron and the neutrino, with the goal of improving the precision of this correlation by over an order of magnitude improvement.  The other two experiments, UCNA and UCNtau, are situated at the ultracold neutron (UCN) source at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The UCNA experiment measures the angular correlation between the neutron spin and the decay electron momentum (called the beta-asymmetry), and aims for a factor of 3 improvement over the precision of the global data set for the axial form factor. UCNtau is designed to measure the lifetime of the neutron, with the goal of a 1 second uncertainty during the proposal period.  These programs will impact: (1) knowledge of the axial form factor at the level required for a the establishment of the CKM matrix element Vud from the neutron at the same level as the super-allowed decays, (2) knowledge of the neutron lifetime at a level such that it will not limit tests of cosmological 4He abundance models for some time, and (3) limits on tensor couplings at or above the level expected from CERN.  For each of these experiments, the group brings its experience in beta decay measurements to bear on key sources of systematic error by developing instrumentation and analysis required by the experiments.",

In neutron decay, the neutron transforms into a proton, with an electron and an antineutrino emitted as well.

This is one of the essential goals of our experimental program: provide the most reliable and precise characterization of the charged weak interaction. For the case of neutron decay, this requires two measurements to determine both the vector and axial-vector coupling constants of the standard model.\n\nUsing  lifetime and angular correlation data together, consistency tests are possible that probe for new physics, and when the measurements are sensitive enough, these experiments can compete directly with particle physics at the highest energy collider experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN.  One of the most sensitive BSM tests, the CKM unitarity test, is of particular interest because of recent theoretical progress, both increasing the potential \"reach\" for beta decay for new physics and also suggesting that there may already be an issue with unitarity at roughly the two sigma level.\n\nWe report on a measurement of the neutron lifetime,UCNtau and two angular correlation measurements, UCNA and Nab.  Both UCNA and UCNtau use ultracold neutrons (UCNs) to measure neutron decay.  Ultracold neutrons have effective temperatures below about 4 mK and can be stored in material and magnetic bottles.  A strong magnetic field can be used to effectively 100% polarize UCNs which can then be used for decay experiments.  UCNA used polarized UCN to measure the angular correlation between the initial neutron polarization and the direction of the decay electron.  UCNA was the first experiment to use UCN to measure an angular correlation in beta decay, and was brought to conclusion during this project period, where this angular correlation was measured to be -0.12054(76). This resulted in an axial coupling constant value of -1.2772(20) when taken together with previous UCNA results, with a relative precision of 0.16%.  UCNA provided what is still the most precise cross-check of current cold neutron beams experiments, with UCNA's sensitivity comparable to that from the LHC.\n\nUCNtau trapped the polarized UCN in a bowl-shaped array of magnets, call a Halbach array, using magnetic repulsion to trap the weak-field seeking spin state, and using gravity to keep UCN from escaping out of the top of the trap.  UCN are loaded into the array, cleaned to remove UCN with high energies which can escape from the trap, then stored for either a short or long storage time.
