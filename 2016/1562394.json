Support will be provided for attracting student participation and allowing their interaction with experts in the field of high-performance devices. This will permit to discuss recent research or education findings, and to expose them to new research and education techniques in the field. The conference will actively recruit and support speakers and other attendees from under-represented groups in science and engineering. The research results presented at the conference will be summarized in abstracts that will be distributed to participants and will be made available through proceedings to the wider public.",

The technical program includes 3 keynote speeches, 13 invited talks, 26 contributed talks (19 by students), and 25 posters (17 by students). The conference proceedings with 15 selected papers were published by IEEE through its Xplore online archive. Topics covered in the conference include high-frequency devices (high-frequency electronics, Schottky devices, Bloch-wave oscillators, vacuum electronics, high-frequency passive components), power switching and energy-efficient devices (high-power electronics, normally-off devices, bioinspired energy storage, wide-bandgap electronics), digital logic devices (low-power and energy-efficient logic switches, new materials, phenomena, and devices concepts for next-generation logic), optical emitters (infrared emitters for communication and sensing applications, light-emitting diodes for solid-state lighting and visible light-based communication, ultraviolet light-emitting diodes for disinfection and sensing, lasers, quantum-cascade lasers), photovoltaics and photodetectors (high- efficiency and flexible photovoltaics, photonic techniques for energy generation and transmission, high-quantum-efficiency photodetectors, avalanche photodiodes), bioelectronics and micro-electromechanical systems (bioelectronics, chemical/biological sensors, micro-electromechanical devices and systems).<strong> </strong></p>\n<p>There were approximately 90 participants in the conference, including 61 from the academia, 16 from the industry, and 12 from the government. Among all the participants, there were 35 students and 17 women. Foreign participants include 8 from Japan, 2 from Korea, and one each from Germany, Greece, Sweden, Pakistan, and Vietnam. Companies represented include Crystal IS, HRL Labs, Intel, IQE, Lehighton Electronics, Matheson, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon, Teledyne Scientific, Fujitsu (Japan), Toyoda Gosei (Japan), and COMSATS Institute (Pakistan). Government entities include Army Research Office, Army Research Lab, Office of Naval Research, Navel Research Lab, Department of Energy, National Renewable Energy Lab, Sandia National Lab, and National Institute of Information and Communication Technology (Japan).</p>\n<p>The conference provided many opportunities for training and professional development. 35 students participated in the conference, including 19 who made oral presentations and 17 who made poster presentations. During lunch on Aug. 2, an invited talk on &ldquo;Recent Trends in US Patent Litigation&rdquo; was given by a patent attorney. On the evening of the same day, a special event &ldquo;Women in Engineering&rdquo; was attended by approximately 10 men and 10 women. On Aug. 3, a keynote speech was given by a program manager from the Department of Energy on its R&amp;D programs, including special programs for university-industry collaboration.
