Monitoring drinking water quality at the point of use is vitally important to inform consumers about the water safety and to facilitate the decision-making process to minimize public health threats for a sustainable community. This project targets to: i) provide a brand new and transformative drinking water monitoring system by leveraging the collective power of crowdsensing in a community; ii) address fundamental challenges in crowdsensing and enable humans to be both sensors and users of the system; iii) integrate education and research through citizen science to enhance knowledge of common people on water quality and public health; and iv) engage government officials and residents (end users) throughout the process to address a real-world problem in a local community, and generate outcomes that will be broadly applicable in other places to enable more sustainable and connected communities.\r\n\r\nIn this project, the PIs plan to develop a new Smart Water Sensing (SWS) system to reliably monitor the water contamination levels in a local community (Granger, IN) and a novel Crowdsensing Data Analysis Engine (CDAE) to address the data reliability and data sparsity challenges of using crowdsensing data. The research is a novel combination of two distinct disciplines: computer science and environmental engineering. The development of the proposed SWS system is exploratory given little prior work, but the success of this project would help to make crowdsensing a reliable alternative that transforms the household drinking water quality monitoring process.",
