 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is funded by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program of the Division of Chemistry at the National Science Foundation. The goal of a chemical separation is to separate a complex mixture into its individual components by taking advantage of differences in the degree of interaction a species exhibits between a stationary phase and a mobile phase. In this project, Professors Maryanne Collinson and Sarah Rutan at Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) are exploring an alternate approach in the field of chemical separations. Instead of manipulating the composition of the mobile phase during the course of a separation, the stationary phase composition is instead changed. Gradual changes in stationary phases have many advantages including the ability to improve selectivity, separation times, and the ability to detect species in the mixture.  The synergy between the collaborating research groups enhances the training of a diverse body of undergraduate and graduate students in state-of-the-art materials synthesis, chromatography, and the predictive power provided by simulations. In addition, by developing a peer-coaching relationship with new faculty, undergraduate instruction in analytical chemistry at VCU is being enhanced.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on the following three specific aims: (1) design, construction, and characterization of liquid chromatography columns with a continuous gradient in chemical functionality along their length, (2) development and implementation of tools to predict the chromatographic responses for various sets of analytes on a continuous gradient stationary phase, and (3) coupling simulations with experiments to determine what gradient lengths and compositions are needed to obtain optimum separations, thus avoiding the trial and error approach usually used in method development. For proof-of-principle, silica monolithic columns and columns packed with superficially porous particles are strategically modified to incorporate a continuous gradient in C8, C18, amine, and/or phenyl groups using silane chemistry and controlled rate infusion (CRI), a method recently developed in the Collinson group. The integration of the Collinson group's expertise in sol-gel chemistry and surface chemical gradients with the Rutan group's expertise in modeling of separations and liquid chromatography is leading to the development of new methodologies for problems of societal relevance, ranging from biomarker discovery to detection of low levels of environmental contaminants.",

One valuable and widely used tool to separate complex mixtures is Liquid Chromatography (LC). The overriding goal of this work was to explore an alternative paradigm in separation science:  the use of gradient stationary phases to manipulate retention and optimize selectivity in LC separations.  Traditionally, a gradient is implemented in the mobile phase.  To create these novel stationary phases, new approaches to synthesize continuous gradients in chemical functionality on particle-packed and monolithic columns for LC were developed, methods to simulate the results of these gradient separations in order to design appropriate gradient materials were developed, and gradient stationary phase separations were implemented with model analytes.  Our results are as follows: (1) Two approaches were developed to create continuous stationary phase gradients on silica supports using silane chemistry.  One involved forming chemical bonds in a time-dependent fashion; the other involved breaking bonds in a time-dependent fashion.  The most promising results were obtained on particle-packed columns using \u2018destructive\u2019 or bond-breaking chemistry.  These experiments were time consuming and challenging at times, but overall successful.

Simulations proved valuable to evaluate neighboring ligand effects taking place on gradient stationary phase columns using model analytes as well as band focusing effects when coupled with a mobile phase gradient.

Collectively, this work indicates the promise of stationary phase gradients as a tool to improve selectivity.   Further experimental- and simulation-based research is needed to realize the promise such materials have in separation science. \n\nThis project\u2019s broader impacts included contributions to the enhancement of STEM workforce by helping to train numerous graduate students, undergraduate students, and a postdoctoral research associate in the fields of analytical chemistry, materials chemistry, and chromatographic science.  Fifteen presentations have been given by the project participants at scientific meetings including the American Chemical Society, the Pittsburgh Conference in Analytical Chemistry, and the International Symposium on High Performance Liquid Separations and Related Technologies.  Three Ph.D. theses and one undergraduate thesis directly resulted from this work.  Several of the undergraduate students are pursuing a Ph.D. in Chemistry.  One of the undergraduate students, in particular, was awarded an NSF graduate fellowship.   These students especially benefited from the collaborative nature of the project.
