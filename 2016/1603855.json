Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The subject area of the project for this fellowship to Ben Krause is harmonic analysis. The host institution for the fellowship is the University of British Columbia, and the sponsoring scientist is Izabella Laba. \r\n\r\nThis award was supported with funding from the Office of International Science & Engineering",
