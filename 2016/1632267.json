 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is in support of Branch Technology's novel Additive Manufacturing (AM) process that combines 3D printing technology and conventional construction materials to enable a new way to create buildings. The construction market in the US is approximately 8% of GDP.  Any portion of the market that could be enhanced would have a large impact in the US economy.  To that end, Branch is creating a process similar to building found in the natural world.  In the formation of natural systems, material is the most expensive commodity; a structure is derived by the efficient use of material, but shape is free to be created in almost any form.  Branch can approach this efficiency with additive manufacturing, where form is created and material is deposited only when needed and little waste is created. At the core of Branch's method of AM-based construction are three key developments: a three-dimensional freeform structure (the cellular matrix or lattice) which serves as a scaffold for other materials, a robotically- controlled extrusion mechanism by which the cellular matrix is produced, and the algorithms necessary to control the robot for successful production.  The proof of concept for this process and more have already been demonstrated by Branch in Phase I of this grant.\r\n\r\nThe technical objectives for Phase II focus on improving the procedures and technology already created. The focus areas for this phase are algorithm development, hardware improvements, the application of finishing materials, code compliance testing, and material science experiments. Algorithm development consists of refining and creating the software necessary to extrude the printed matrix and support a client base. Hardware improvements are necessary to improve the speed and efficiency of the process to create a commercially viable workflow. This research will necessitate the purchase of extra hardware for experimentation.  American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing for load bearing capacity is necessary to enter the market and provide code compliant construction. Experimentation in the application of finished materials to the 3D printed lattice such as spray foam and concrete are vital to the realization of complete buildings.",

This award funded research to create iterations on Branch's Cellular Fabrication (C-Fab?) process. Built on industrial robotics, geometric algorithms, and a novel \"Freeform\" extrusion technology that allows printed material to solidify in free space, C-Fab? produces composite construction components that can be tailored for specific applications and product lines. Branch improved its printing technology, digital production and modeling techniques, material portfolio, and industrial workflow through the Phase II scope of this award. With the Phase IIB award, Branch began researching code compliance, building science, and product development initiatives to create commercialized product lines of 3D-printed construction components. This scope resulted in two assemblies that passed&nbsp;the flagship test, National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA) 285 Flame Propagation of Building Exterior Components. Branch also produced and shipped exterior construction panel systems for two buildings in the life of this award - a credit union building's facade in Chattanooga, TN and a parking garage's rainscreen in Huntsville, AL. These two completed projects are proof that commercialization of the technology developed with these awards was successful. In the future, Branch hopes to grow and scale its additive manufacturing and prefabrication operations to produce more projects and continue to streamline construction processes. The company will also develop more product lines and other instances where 3D-printed construction components can economically outperform traditionally-manufactured building products.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/08/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Robert&nbsp;P&nbsp;Boyd</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1632267/1632267_10460679_1631112704902_BI4A8194-HDR--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1632267/1632267_10460679_1631112704902_BI4A8194-HDR--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tennessee Valley Federal Credit Union 3D-Printed Facade\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1632267/1632267_10460679_1631112704902_BI4A8194-HDR--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tennessee Valley Federal Credit Union 3D-Printed Facade\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Branch Technology used Cellular Fabrication to additively manufacture the composite panels on the exterior of this building.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Branch Technology</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;P&nbsp;Boyd</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tennessee Valley Federal Credit Union 3D-Printed Facade</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1632267/1632267_10460679_1631112999889_BI4A8181-HDR--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1632267/1632267_10460679_1631112999889_BI4A8181-HDR--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tennessee Valley Federal Credit Union (TVFCU 3D-Printed Facade\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1632267/1632267_10460679_1631112999889_BI4A8181-HDR--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tennessee Valley Federal Credit Union (TVFCU 3D-Printed Facade\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Branch Technology additively manufactured the 260+ unique panels of this facade with Cellular Fabrication.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Branch Technology</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;P&nbsp;Boyd</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tennessee Valley Federal Credit Union (TVFCU 3D-Printed Facade</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1632267/1632267_10460679_1631113125905_ImagefromiOS(2)--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1632267/1632267_10460679_1631113125905_ImagefromiOS(2)--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Huntsville's Monroe St. Parking Garage 3D-Printed Rainscreen\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1632267/1632267_10460679_1631113125905_ImagefromiOS(2)--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Huntsville's Monroe St. Parking Garage 3D-Printed Rainscreen\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Branch Technology used Cellular Fabrication to additively manufacture the large panels on this parking garage.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Branch Technology</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Robert&nbsp;P&nbsp;Boyd</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Huntsville's Monroe St. Parking Garage 3D-Printed Rainscreen</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1632267/1632267_10460679_1631113389305_OneC1tyBandshell03-Copy--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1632267/1632267_10460679_1631113389305_OneC1tyBandshell03-Copy--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"The world's largest-spanning 3D printed structure\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1632267/1632267_10460679_1631113389305_OneC1tyBandshell03-Copy--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"The world's largest-spanning 3D printed structure\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Branch used Cellular Fabrication to manufacture this pavilion at the OneC1ty Development in Nashville, TN in 2018.
