 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will lead to developing a basic understanding of how to create beams of ions to be used to improve silicon wafer processing. The silicon chips at the heart of the modern age of electronics are comprised of millions to billions of very small manufactured structures. To function electronically, these structures have to have their ability to conduct electrons modified and they have to be physically constructed through a nanoscale machining process. Both of these processes rely on having plasmas (very hot gasses whose atoms have been broken up into positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons) interact with the silicon wafer. The plasmas cut through, or etch, the silicon to create the structures; and electric fields created by the plasma embed high speed ions into the silicon to change the electrical resistance of the silicon. This project focuses on a new device that creates beams of ions to be used in this manufacturing process. It is a partnership between scientists at West Virginia University (WVU) and Varian Semiconductor Equipment - a business unit of Applied Materials Corporation. Using diagnostics developed at WVU and an industrial processing tool, the team will investigate the process of ion beam formation in the tool in order to improve the three-dimensional processing of nanoscale computing and memory devices. In addition, this project supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students in a research environment that synergistically combines basic and applied plasma physics; improves the percentage of women and minorities obtaining advanced degrees in physics; attracts high quality undergraduates into physics through involvement in cutting-edge research activities; and supports a STEM education initiative that extends to over half the counties in West Virginia.\r\n \r\nWhile the extraction of ions from aperture sheaths is a key part of many technologies, the direct measurement of beam properties in the compact geometries of plasma processing tools is problematic. The goal of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of the dependence of beam properties of Applied Materials new ion implantation tool on the key control parameters and geometry of the beam source.  This, in turn, will enable creation of validated, predictive models of the entire ion implantation system. The specific scientific questions to be addressed in these studies will resolve long-standing questions concerning the extraction of ion beams from boundary sheaths and will thereby advance the state-of-the-art in ion beam technology.",

The raw silicon material is modified by embedding other materials, dopants, into the silicon. These additional elements supply the electrons that turn the insulating silicon into a semiconductor. Deep trenches only a few nanometers wide are then cut into semiconducting silicon and filled with conducting metal. The process of making the few nanometer wide patterns that are etched into the silicon is a complex process that defines the state-of-the-art for computer chip manufacturing. For decades the spacing of the patterns has regularly decreased, enabling chips to process calculations faster and faster. However, the pattern spacing has reached a quantum mechanical limit and chip manufacturers are moving from two-dimensional patterns etched into flat silicon wafers to three-dimensional structures that will allow them to pack even more transistors into the same area on future chips. Three-dimensional structures require new ways of embedding dopants into the silicon. The dopants will need to be able to hit the sides of the three-dimensional structures and that requires new ways to form and control beams of dopants. Using a tunable laser as a \"radar gun\" for ions, researchers at West Virginia University have measured the spatial structure of an ion beam extracted from the optics of a commercial plasma source. The measurement, shown in the first figure demonstrates that the ions are staying together in a tight beam-like structure and their trajectory is bent to the side by the electric fields of the beam extraction structure. Most importantly, the measurements show that the ions in the beam have very little random thermal motion in the direction perpendicular to their trajectory. In other words, the ions are moving almost exclusively in the direction that they are guided by the electric fields. Computer models of the ion beam source (shown in the second figure) predict that the ions will come out in a narrow beam only a few mm wide. The model gives insight in the experimental parameters that should lead to steering of the ion beam.</p>\n<div id=\"_mcePaste\" class=\"mcePaste\" style=\"position: absolute; left: -10000px; top: 0px; width: 1px; height: 1px; overflow: hidden;\">\n<table class=\"MsoTableGrid\" style=\"margin-left: -18.25pt; border-collapse: collapse; mso-table-layout-alt: fixed; border: none; mso-border-alt: solid black .5pt; mso-border-themecolor: text1; mso-yfti-tbllook: 1184; mso-padding-alt: 0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt;\" border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" width=\"709\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"mso-yfti-irow: 0; mso-yfti-firstrow: yes; height: 4.5in;\">\n<td style=\"width: 243.0pt; border: solid black 1.0pt; mso-border-themecolor: text1; mso-border-alt: solid black .5pt; padding: 0in 5.4pt 0in 5.4pt; height: 4.5in;\" width=\"324\" valign=\"top\">\n<p class=\"Default\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Earl   Scime</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"Default\"><em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">West   Virginia University </span></em></p>\n<p class=\"Default\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"Default\"><strong style=\"mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Plasma Etching</span></strong></p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"margin-top: 0in; margin-right: 10.7pt; margin-bottom: 1.0pt; margin-left: 0in; text-align: justify; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: normal; tab-stops: 0in;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10.0pt;\">Raw silicon is turned into computer chips through a   series of manufacturing steps that involve plasmas.
