 "awd_abstract_narration": "The 2nd ASTFE/IWHT Conference and Workshop on Fluid Flow and Heat Transfer is the primary and most important international conference being organized by the American Society of Thermal and Fluids Engineers (ASTFE). This is the second conference being organized by the society, following the successful first conference held in New York last year. This conference is rapidly becoming the main conference in thermal transport and fluids, providing a new venue for dissemination of top research in the thermal-fluids area.  \r\n\r\nThis conference also provides a forum for the open exchange of progress in the research, development, manufacturing and application of thermal-fluids engineering. Last year the conference attracted researchers and practitioners from all over the world, and from academia, industry, and government and served as a conduit for knowledge dissemination and collaboration among its participants. The conference also attempts to connect a diverse global engineering community and already has support from the International Centre of Heat and Mass Transfer (the premier international institution of the thermal transport processes community), Begell House Publishing and from the UNLV.",
