 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will further develop and commercialize an innovative coating which minimizes the accumulation of mineral fouling on industrial heat exchanger surfaces.  Heat exchangers are used to heat or cool fluids in industrial processes, such as chemical manufacturing, oil refining, power generation, food processing, electronics manufacturing, and many more.  Air conditioning for factories and large commercial buildings also represents a significant use of heat exchangers.  Fouling occurs when naturally dissolved minerals in water, often called \"hard\" water, precipitate out of the water when it contacts a hot surface.  This fouling can be seen in a typical home on the surface of a teakettle or showerhead.  The resulting mineral crystals adhere strongly, and form an insulating layer that materially reduces the thermal efficiency of industrial heat exchangers.  Mineral fouling is estimated to cost U.S. industry $40 Billion per year, and waste $3 Billion of energy, representing upwards of 1% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions.  In addition to wasting energy, this worldwide, never-ending problem increases factory downtime and maintenance costs, causes industry to spend large amounts on chemical treatment of water supplies, and decreases the useful life of heat exchanger systems.  An effective coating will result in substantial environmental benefits including the elimination of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the wasted energy, and a reduction of the water treatment chemicals, which eventually enter community wastewater streams.\r\n\r\nThe coating material is a low surface energy, self-assembling hydrophobic material which is a composite of a host polymer and a nanoparticle. The low surface energy of the coating impedes the attachment of the minerals to the coated heat transfer surface. Phase I results showed that any fouling accumulation on a coated surface exhibits low adhesion strength, which allows any fouling that does occur to predominantly be dislodged by the force of the water flowing over it - a phenomenon call \"self-cleaning.\"  The coating is very thin - less than 500 nm - which minimizes impedance of heat transfer due to the presence of the coating itself.  Phase II research will focus on optimizing the properties of the coating, including substrate adhesion, surface energy, and toughness to ensure a useful life under industrial conditions.  This will be accomplished by changing the host polymer chemistry to facilitate self-assembly, and also by changing the chemistry of the nanoparticle to obtain a covalent bond between the host polymer and nanoparticle.  Work will also be performed to design the application process for industrial scale, and validate lab results with field trials at industrial sites.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNano Hydrophobics (Nano) has developed a very thin coating that can be applied to the surfaces of heat exchangers in order to prevent or inhibit the accumulation of mineral and other types of fouling, thereby preserving efficient heat transfer, lowering energy costs and reducing factory carbon footprints.\n\nSurface fouling in manufacturing processes is viewed as the major unresolved problem of heat transfer.  Efficient heat transfer is important because almost all manufactured products require heat in one or more steps of their manufacturing process.  Factories often use water to heat process fluids or to recapture heat because water is thermally conductive and inexpensive. Mineral fouling occurs when the naturally dissolved minerals in water come into contact with the hot surfaces of heat exchangers.  The dissolved minerals turn into crystals and strongly adhere to the heated surface. Mineral fouling is often seen in kettles or on bathroom plumbing fixtures.  These unwanted deposits act as thermal insulators, and as the crystal deposits accumulate, the transfer of heat is reduced which decreases the overall efficiency of the heat exchanger and the factory.\n\nHeat exchanger fouling has been estimated to cost the U.S. economy over $40 Billion per year, wasting upwards of 1% of U.S. energy consumption and generating approximately 1% of greenhouse gas emissions.  Since this is a natural problem, it affects factories around the world.  It is also a never-ending problem, which will grow in severity as industrial output increases to meet the rising demand of the world's rapidly growing population.\n\nNano\u2019s coatings have been developed to lower the surface energy of the surfaces that the coatings are applied to.  Essentially, the coatings work like \"Teflon on steroids\".  As a result, mineral crystals and other sources of fouling can not adhere as strongly to the coated surfaces, and the resulting lower adhesion strength of the crystals, combined with the energy of the moving water flowing through the heat exchanger, cause the fouling to release from the surface, keeping the surface clean.  The coating provides a \"self-cleaning\" property to the surface.  Additionally, if the coating is damaged, it has the capability to \"self-repair\".\n\nNano\u2019s coatings are applied as a very thin layer, with thicknesses well under one micron. As a result, you cannot see the coatings on the heat exchanger surface.  Due to the thinness of Nano's coatings, the coating itself causes only a very negligible impact on the thermal efficiency of heat exchangers.  In comparison, most industrial coatings are much thicker (ten to one hundred microns), which causes the thermal efficiency of the heat exchanger to decline significantly.  As a result, earlier-generation coatings can have as much adverse impact on heat transfer as the fouling which they are intended to prevent.  Nano's coatings provide fouling protection without adverse impacts on heat transfer of heat exchangers.\n\nNano Hydrophobics is grateful to the Molecular Foundry, the nano-science user-facility of the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, to the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory, and to the National Science Foundation for their generous support and encouragement.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/04/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Calvin Kennell-Heiling"
