 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will establish an I-Corp team for seeking an experiential learning opportunity to help in determining the commercial readiness of the developed technology for the state-of-the-art germanium detectors, which will improve the detection of radiation from objects including human diseases (cancer), personal travel items and cargos at the gate of airports and harbors for the applications of diagnosis in nuclear medicine, materials screening, monitoring of decommissioning of nuclear power plants, and homeland security. An imaging camera has two detection planes, which will be made of high purity germanium crystals with excellent energy resolution. The imaging camera has a bright future as a screening detector or medical imaging device considering its portability, compactness, low patient dose, multiple-radioisotope tracing capability, inherent three dimensional (3D) imaging capability at a fixed position. Currently, however, the image resolution of the Compton camera is not sufficient for medical imaging. In this project, the I-Corps team intends to improve imaging system using germanium detectors with high sensitive energy resolution and position resolution. The developed technology can be especially helpful for detecting abnormal growth in body tissue or the growth of lymph nodes, which use gamma-ray sources as diagnostic radiation tools. Similar, tumor growth or cancer, such as breast cancer, in the human body can be detected by this technology because gamma-ray sources are often used for cancer treatment as well as diagnostic purposes. Recently, cancer has become one of the most devastating diseases worldwide. One of the techniques used for treating cancers is nuclear medicine with radiation tracers, which can emit gamma rays. Philips, GE and Siemens are some of the leading companies in the domain with scanning technology for cancer treatment. The proposed detector technology is based on a dynamic read-out that provides both excellent energy resolution and position resolution as a camera can be commercialized through either through licensing, establishing a joint venture or establishing a standalone company.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the project is to develop and commercialize an imaging camera using germanium detectors that will improve the detection of radiation from objects including human diseases (cancer), personal travel items, and cargos at the gate of airports and harbors. The scope is to develop the technology in two phases within three years. The Phase I project is to develop a large germanium detector with 23 \u00d7 23 dynamic read-out system for proof-of-concept in a year. A dynamic read-out system will be accomplished by measuring the charge induced on electrodes with multiple channels that are positioned close but not electronically connected to the detector materials. The multiple electrodes will be fabricated on a circuit board that is positioned 0.5 mm from the detector surface onto which charge is collected. A dynamic read-out system with multiple channels will adopt the proximity read-out technique developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory by utilizing its advantages of simplified detector fabrication, expanded electrode geometry options, and greatly improved position resolution through simple signal interpolation. In Phase II, the team will fabricate a germanium orthogonal dynamic read-out detector (GODD) for testing new detector technology innovations as an imaging system in two years. The GODD will then be tested on passengers' travel items and cargos, mimicking airport and harbor nuclear and non- nuclear imaging tests. The simulated airport and harbor tests will be performed at The University of South Dakota (USD) under a subcontract and compare the relative merits of the GODD in airport or harbor situations with modern imaging systems. GODD response to realistic test objectives will be established. With a dynamic read-out system that greatly improves position resolution of a germanium detector, which can detect small, low contrast objects, including position of the source of radiation and even tumors in human body. New fabrication methods for contacts, improved electronics and experience with long term stability of germanium detectors, make them important for national security tasks.",

This award has established an I-Corp team for seeking an experiential learning opportunity to help in determining the commercial readiness of the developed technology for the state-of- the-art germanium detectors, which will improve the detection of radiation from objects including human diseases (cancer), personal travel items and cargos at the gate of airports and harbors. The Phase I of the technology is to develop a 23 x 23 dynamic read-out system with a large-size germanium detector. In Phase II, we will fabricate a second germanium orthogonal dynamic read-out detector (GODD) for testing new detector technology innovations while bench testing the existing detectors. These tests will include detector characterization, establishment of database from radionuclide, correction for spatial variations in response characteristics (detector and collimator), and assessment of response for selected test objects. The GODD will then be tested on passenger&rsquo;s travel items and cargos mimicking airport and harbor nuclear and non- nuclear imaging tests. The Simulated airport and harbor tests will be performed at The University of South Dakota (USD) under a subcontract and compare the relative merits of the GODD in airport or harbor situations with modern imaging systems. GODD response to realistic test objectives will be established. We plan to have these test objects taken to other research centers where competitive state- of-the-art imaging is under development. In this manner, comparisons of other pixellated scintillator and semiconductor detectors will determine differences in experimental performance to supplement simulation comparisons that others and we have performed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>High-purity germanium crystals approximately 12 cm in diameter is grown in a hydrogen atmosphere using the Czochralski method at the University of South Dakota (USD), as shown in Figure 1.

The axial and radial distributions of impurities in the crystals were measured to be within 3&acute;10<sup>10</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> using the Hall Effect system. A planar detector was also fabricated from one of the crystals and then evaluated for electrical and spectral performance, as shown in Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4. &nbsp;We created a company in Vermillion, South Dakota, to market detector-grade crystals produced at USD by developing large-size imaging detectors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The developed technology will advance germanium detectors with high position resolution.

We will fabricate prototype GODD for gamma-ray imaging studies using amorphous germanium contacts, which will simplify the production of GODD. With GODD, we can demonstrate that a gamma-ray interaction event in the detector can be located in three dimensions.

This technology will take advantage of the bipolar blocking nature of the amorphous-semiconductor contacts in order to investigate the use of field shaping electrodes.

In addition, the incomplete charge collection process can also be reduced by adjusting the properties of the amorphous-semiconductor layer.</p>\n<p>This proposal will help the I-Corp team to develop a transition plan to move the technology forward to market. Gamma ray imaging combined with high-resolution spectroscopy form a powerful tool that is needed for many applications including those in the areas of nuclear science, astrophysics, particle physics, medical physics, environmental remediation, and nuclear safeguards monitoring. Detectors based on high-purity germanium (Ge) with their excellent energy resolution and efficiency are commonly used for spectroscopy applications. However, producing position-sensitive Ge- based detectors with the fine spatial sensitivity required for many imaging applications has been a significant technical challenge. Despite this, significant progress has been made in the development of these detectors. The amorphous-semiconductor contact technology in particular could potentially fulfill the needs in this area. This technology has the advantages of requiring only a single contact process for the entire detector, providing automatic passivation between detector electrodes, and allowing fine electrode segmentation for accurate position measurement. The science involved in technology will produce a number of Master&rsquo;s and PhD dissertations. In addition, the development of technology will involve several undergraduate, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows.
