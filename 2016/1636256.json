 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigation of the properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials - materials that are one atomic layer thick - has revealed truly remarkable behavior that, in principle, enable the development of the next generation of electronic and optical devices. For example, the flexibility, strength and opto-electronic properties of some 2D materials make them ideal candidates for applications in flexible electronics (e.g. displays). However, the technological impact of these materials has not been fully realized because these devices cannot be manufactured at scale.  Moreover, the steps used to create 2D electronic materials-based devices in the laboratory are inefficient and unreliable, and result in a very low yield of working devices. This Scalable NanoManufacturing (SNM) award is aimed at developing an economical, scalable, high-yield approach to the production of opto-electronic devices based on 2D electronic materials.  This highly interdisciplinary research relies on several science and engineering disciplines including nanomanufacturing, electrical engineering, materials science and computation to develop and optimize the manufacturing process.  The research will immerse a number of young scholars diverse in both background and experience within a highly collaborative and interdisciplinary research environment.\r\n\r\nThe laboratory process for creating devices from 2D electronic materials employs \"sticky tape\" as a means for exfoliating single layered samples from bulk crystals and transferring them to other substrates. Typically, the first exfoliated layer consists of multiple 2D layers of the desired material requiring repeated sticky tape exfoliation to produce a single monolayer of the material. This painstaking process is not scalable and often yields a sample too small to enable the manufacturing of devices.  Recently, the research team has discovered that thin metallic films covalently or semi-covalently bonded to the surface layer of a crystal can be used as an improved sticky tape. The properties of the thin films enable isolation of monolayer samples up to 0.5 mm in lateral dimensions during the first exfoliation step. This discovery opens the door to development of a scalable nanomanufacturing approach to the fabrication of devices built from 2D electronic materials. Using a combination of theory and experiment, this award will determine the choice of metal films for exfoliation of prototypical 2D materials. Using these films, the project will develop a highly multiplexed elastomer stamping approach to automate the exfoliation process and to demonstrate the scalable fabrication of 2D electronic materials-based devices for applications ranging from opto-electronic devices to chemical sensors, and as compliant substrates for the epitaxial growth of other materials.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nIn the coming years, materials composed of 2D layers of atoms stacked in a predetermined fashion will form the basis of new opto-electronic technologies.  It is also evident that these stacks of 2D materials, known as 2D van der Waals heterostructures, can display unexpected opto-electronic properties.  For example, two graphene layers stacked such that one is rotated relative to the other can display superconductivity at \"magic\" rotation angles.  Accordingly, there is great interest in being able to rapidly and reliably manufacture 2D van der Waals heterostructures for both the purposes of discovering new physical phenomena, and to immediately enable manufacturing these devices at scale.\nMechanical exfoliation was the method first used to isolate the Nobel Prize winning prototypical 2D material graphene.  Geim and Novoselov isolated graphene by repeatedly exfoliating graphite using adhesive tape (Fig. 1).  This process, while suitable for some research purposes, is not suitable for manufacturing nor high-throughput fabrication of devices as it produces small irregularly shaped and positioned samples after an uncontrolled number of exfoliation steps.\nNevertheless, mechanical exfoliation is attractive, in principle, for the nanomanufacturing of van der Waals heterostructures particularly in comparison to the direct growth of van der Waals heterostructures in a layer-by-layer fashion.  The reason is that growth of one material upon another requires development of a specific growth process for each layer and presumably, each relative orientation. Assembly of previously exfoliated 2D materials would circumvent this processing bottleneck, and make available a broad spectrum of van der Waals heterostructures.\nTechnical Merit\nOur work, then, focused on developing mechanical exfoliation as a nanomanufacturing process for van der Waals heterostructures.  We began by developing a detailed atomic-scale theory for the physics of the mechanical exfoliation process.  In this theory, we showed how lithographically patterned thin metallic films might be used in between the 2D materials and the adhesive tape to exfoliate, in one step, arrays of large sized 2D monolayers from a bulk source.  The key observation is that the metallic film can impart a strain to the exfoliated layer before the exfoliation, and that this strain weakens the binding of the exfoliated layer to the remaining bulk layers (Fig. 1).  We worked through a simple model of the exfoliation dynamics, and showed that it should be possible to reliably and deterministically exfoliate large area monolayers using one exfoliation step. [For details see Sun et al., Physical Review Materials 2, 094004 (2018).]\nWe then used this knowledge to fabricate arrays of van der Waals heterostructures.  Specifically, we developed an experimental approach that exfoliates a lithographically defined array of high-quality monolayer samples. The process we developed, Covalent Bond Exfoliation (CoBEx), is able to produce arrays of exfoliated samples with defined shapes with dimensions of the order of 100 microns (Fig. 2).  [For details see Gramling et al., ACS Applied Electronic Materials 1, 4076 (2019).] The overall yield from CoBEx is roughly 50%, meaning that we successfully exfoliate and transfer to a substrate 50% of the monolayers defined in our lithography step.  While this yield is not yet sufficient to form the basis of an economically viable nanomanufacturing process, it does represent a successful proof of concept, and we are confident that with further work, the yields can be increased substantially.\nOur next step was focused on creating van der Waals heterostructures using our mechanical exfoliation based methods.  The culmination of this experimental effort is a process that we named Covalent Bond Exfoliate Align and Release (CoBEARs).  CoBEx requires adhesive tapes, and up to this point, the adhesive tapes were not transparent.  This prevented accurate alignment of exfoliated samples when fabricating heterostructures. CoBEARs was enabled by development of a new transparent transfer medium fabricated by spin-coating a partially-crosslinked and transparent adhesive onto a transparent, electrostatically active backing material with low surface energy. WS2/MoS2 van der Waals heterostructure arrays fabricated by this method showed the expected coupled exciton between the monolayers (Fig. 3). We also successfully fabricated electroluminescent devices. [See  V. Nguyen et al. Journal of Micro- and Nano-Manufacturing 7, 041006 (2019) for details.]\nBroad Impact\nWe believe that our work takes an important first step towards the development of mechanical exfoliation based methods for nanomanufacturing van der Waals heterostructures.  The work offers the potential to expand the range of heterostructures accessible to both fundamental study and subsequent manufacturing at scale. In addition to these technologically important advances, this work helped to train the next generation of scholars that will advance this field.
