 "awd_abstract_narration": "One of the major intellectual achievements of the 20th century was the development of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. This model succeeded in classifying all of the elementary particles known at the time into a hierarchy of groups having similar quantum properties. The validity of this model to date was recently confirmed by the discovery of the Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. However, the Standard Model as it currently exists leaves open many questions about the universe, including such fundamental questions as to why the Higgs mass has the value it has and why there is no antimatter in the universe. \r\n\r\nOne of the primary areas to search for answers to these and other open questions about the universe, how it came to be and why it is the way it is, is to focus on a study of the properties of neutrinos and to use what we know and can learn about neutrinos as probes of science beyond the Standard Model. Neutrinos are those elementary particles that interact with practically nothing else in the universe. They have no electric charge and were once thought to be massless. Like other elementary particles, they were believed to have an antimatter counterpart, the antineutrino. Moreover, the Standard Model predicted that there were actually three different kinds of neutrinos that were distinguishable through the different interactions that they did undergo whenever there was an interaction. But recent measurements have totally changed our picture of neutrinos. We now know that neutrinos do have a mass and because they do, they can actually change from one type to another. Detailed measurements of these changes, along with other current neutrino experiments, form one of the most promising ways to probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model. \r\n\r\nThere have been hints in various experiments of new types of neutrinos, and clarifying these \"hints\" is one of the main thrusts of this project. The work itself will be the further development of the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) technology for use in neutrino physics as part of the Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND) experiment and the MicroBooNE experiment. These neutrino experiments are all located at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL). The MicroBooNE experiment should significantly increase the physics reach toward answering the important question of whether predicted \"sterile\" neutrinos exist and resolving the anomalies in recent neutrino experiments. In addition to the contribution to the fundamental neutrino physics mentioned above, this research will serve as an invaluable proving ground for the calibration, reconstruction and analysis techniques that will be needed to make future experiments, such as the planned DUNE experiment, a success.\r\n\r\nThe Broader Impact of the project involves bringing current techniques in high energy physics to the broader local community. The south side neighborhoods surrounding the UChicago campus are largely populated with underrepresented groups in STEM fields, and this project aims to build a program within the Department of Physics that connects university students with local elementary and middle school children to introduce them to concepts in physics with the aid of fun, interactive demonstrations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNeutrinos are, in many ways, the simplest form of fundamental matter that we know of in the Universe.  They have barely any mass at all (a million times less than the electron), and due to the feeble nature of the Weak nuclear force, the only force neutrinos experience, they can penetrate dense material or travel across the cosmos completely unaffected.  Nonetheless, half a century of research into the properties and behavior of neutrinos has led to deep insights and unexpected surprises in fundamental physics.  The discovery of neutrino oscillations, for example, has been one of the most important discoveries in particle physics in the past few decades.  Today, neutrinos provide us numerous opportunities for further exploration of fundamental questions in particle physics and cosmology.  Do neutrinos and antineutrinos behave differently in a way that could help us understand how the early Universe became dominated by matter over antimatter?  Could neutrinos and neutrino experiments provide us a window into a new 'dark sector' of fundamental matter?  This NSF CAREER Award supported new research in experimental neutrino physics in pursuit of answers to questions such as these.  The research was carried out by a team of PhD students, postdocs, and undergraduate students, and led by PI David Schmitz, at the University of Chicago.    \n\n \n\nA major focus of this research has been the development of the Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) Program, an ambitious new experimental program being hosted at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois.  The SBN Program will address a class of anomalous results from past neutrino experiments that could be hinting at exciting new phenomena in particle physics.  By combining information from multiple state-of-the-art neutrino detectors that are exposed to the same neutrino source, SBN maximizes the potential for discovery.  The SBN detectors also serve as a development platform for a transformative new technology in neutrino physics, the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC).  The University of Chicago group, supported by this NSF award, has played a leading role in the design and construction of the Short-Baseline Near Detector (SBND), a 112-ton LArTPC, as well as the development of the SBN science program.  Schmitz has served as co-spokesperson for the SBND Collaboration since the experiment was first proposed in 2014 and throughout this grant period.  The SBN Program will continue to operate and produce new physics results, expanding our knowledge of neutrinos, through most of this decade.\n\n \n\nThroughout this research there have been excellent educational and training opportunities for early-career scientists who have been involved in every aspect of the projects, from detector design and construction to software development and data analysis.  Two graduate students earned their PhDs during this grant period and have gone on to postdoctoral research positions, and several more are continuing work on their research.  Two former postdocs have moved on to university or national lab permanent positions.  Numerous undergraduate students have contributed to the research as well, many of whom are now in graduate programs in STEM.  \n\n \n\nThis NSF award also supported an annual science education program for middle school students.  Each summer, around twenty students from Chicago South Side Public Schools participate in a week-long science camp hosted in the Physics Department student laboratories on the University of Chicago campus.  During the week, students do hands-on projects with micro-electronics involving programming and wiring of simple circuits, they design a personal webpage to present their findings, and they work alongside current university students who assist in running the program.  As a bonus, these university students gain valuable mentoring experience.   Each year the program attracts a diverse group of participants, representative of the Chicago South Side communities, and equal numbers of middle school boys and girls.  We intend to continue and grow this program into the future. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/28/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Schmitz"
