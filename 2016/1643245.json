 "awd_abstract_narration": "The U.S. Southwest is an arid region that experiences large interannual variation in precipitation. The region has experienced a series of severely dry years in the past two decades, most recently in 2012. However in an El Nino year, such as 2016, winter precipitation can be several times greater than average. Drought years increase mortality in forest and woodland trees, and the trees that survive drought require a period of several years before regaining normal growth capacity. Although high winter precipitation generally promotes better growth, it may be the case that a tree's ability to take advantage of a good year depends on its drought history. This is because the anatomical and physiological changes in trees that survive seem to reduce a tree?s ability to transport water and support high rates of photosynthesis and new growth.  This project will use a set of study sites in the Four-Corners region of the southwest that span a wide range of increased winter precipitation from the current El Ni\u00f1o.  Because previous studies at these same sites have documented the growth impacts of recent droughts, this project can now test whether trees that suffered larger drought impacts are less able to respond positively to the increased water provided by the El Ni\u00f1o.  The study species include aspen, pi\u00f1on pine, and juniper, species that differ in drought tolerance and ability to use shallow versus deeper soil moisture. The results from this project will strengthen understanding of how precipitation variability, which is expected to increase with continued climate warming, affects productivity of southwestern ecosystems.  This study will provide research experience for multiple undergraduate students including individuals from underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\nThe current El Ni\u00f1o has produced a rare gradient in winter (Oct 2015-Feb 2016) precipitation across the Four-Corners region, spanning 25% to over 400% of the long-term mean. Four years prior, the 2011-2012 drought significantly and negatively impacted tree populations, soil moisture availability, and ecosystem carbon sequestration. Recent work has demonstrated that it takes 3-5 years for tree growth, ecosystem carbon fluxes, and net ecosystem productivity to recover from past, severe droughts.  What is unknown is whether these prolonged impacts of past droughts affect how trees and ecosystems respond to extreme increase in precipitation created by an El Ni\u00f1o. Thus, this project seeks to determine the extent to which past climatic conditions, especially droughts, govern tree physiological and growth responses during wet periods.  To accomplish this, the project will sample multiple U.S. Forest Service forest inventory (FIA) sites representative of the climate variability in the Four-Corners region and for which complementary tree- and plot-level data are available. These sites support three focal, foundational tree species (aspen, pi\u00f1on, juniper) that differ in their drought tolerance strategies. The study will employ a unique combination of repeated physiological measurements, dendrochronology approaches, and statistical modeling that will enable new insight into climate legacies, their impact on tree physiological processes, and subsequent implications for tree growth during potentially ?favorable? conditions. This study will generate a unique and extensive dataset over a relatively short time period, which can be used to test the na\u00efve assumption that high precipitation significantly stimulates tree growth. It is expected to demonstrate that tree growth responses to rare wet years are controlled by past climatic influences. Field campaigns and laboratory studies will involve multiple undergraduates, an early career research associate, and will seek to involve individuals from under-represented groups. Findings from the study will be disseminated via the scientific literature and popular media; tree-ring data will be contributed to the freely accessible International Tree-Ring Data Bank.",

(\"Southwest\") is characterized by highly variable precipitation patterns that juxtapose severe droughts against heavy wet periods. Recent trends indicate that the region will likely experience more extreme dry and wet periods. The occurrence and severity of these wet and dry periods is also the result of cyclic climate patterns such at La Ni?a and El Ni?o cycles. El Ni?o periods are generally associated with higher than average winter rainfall in the region, and the El Ni?o of 2015-2016 resulted in higher than average winter rainfall in parts of the Southwest (eastern Colorado and New Mexico), but much lower than average rainfall in other parts (low to middle elevation areas in Arizona and Utah).</p>\n<p>This project evaluated how such large variation in rainfall, partly due to the 2015-2016 El Ni?o, affects tree growth and productivity in the Southwest, with a specific focus on the Four Corners region defined by Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. Forests and woodlands in this region provide valuable services to society; they affect access to clean water, afford recreational opportunities, and provide critical wildlife habitat. This region has also experienced a series of severe droughts over the past decade or so; some of which have resulted in large tree die-offs or have been linked to increased forest fire activity and insect outbreaks. Studies suggest that such repeated drought events will negatively impact trees and the forests and woodlands that they comprise. For example, if drought events become more frequent, which is supported by recent climate records and model forecasts for the future, then many trees and their associated woodlands and forests may not be able to recover from a drought before being hit by another. These issues motivated this project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual merit:</strong></p>\n<p>We visited 24 sites across the Four-Corners region and collected tree and soil samples from each site. We sampled 3 common tree species from the region: trembling aspen, pinyon pine, and juniper, and we studied ponderosa pine and Douglas fir at 1 additional site. We collected leaves (or needles), stem, and soil samples associated with 5-10 trees per species per site. We measured sugar and starch (non-structural carbohydrates) concentrations in the plant samples, and extracted water from the stem and soil samples. We also measured the carbon isotope composition of the leaves/needles, and measured the hydrogen and oxygen isotope composition of the stem and soil water. These data were complemented by other measurements related to site characteristics (e.g., slope, tree density) and tree physiological status. We also collected tree cores using increment borers, which allowed us the identify and measure widths of the annual growth rings. Together, these data provided insight into physiological responses of the trees, how those responses relate to annual growth, and how both are influenced by climatic variability. Application of statistical analysis methods to these data allowed us to evaluate how past and contemporary drought and precipitation conditions influence the health and productivity of the species sampled.</p>\n<p>We found that past drought continues to influence tree growth for several years afterwards, and the degree to which trees continue to be influenced by past drought is related to the amount of starch they store. These lingering effects (legacies) of past droughts were generally most pronounced for aspen. We also found that prior to the major 2002 drought, growth responses to climate differed among sites, but after the 2002 drought, nearly all species and sites exhibited notable synchrony in how they responded to precipitation. Additionally, based on stable isotopes measured in the water samples, trees that experienced drought during the 2015-2016 winter were able to switch from using relatively deep soil water during the winter to more shallow soil water in the summer, after the arrival of the summer monsoon rains. In general, drought impacts on tree function varied across species and sites, and can linger for multiple years after the drought event.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader impacts:</strong></p>\n<p>This project involved collaborations among 5 institutions/agencies, and it engaged a large number of students and early career scientists in research, including: 4 post-doctoral researchers; 1 research technician; 4 high school students; 3 undergraduate students via a \"research experience for undergraduates\" project; 15 hourly, temporary research assistants, including 8 graduate students, 9 additional undergraduates, and 1 recent high-school graduate. Research results were broadly disseminated via multiple (at least 8) oral presentations at regional and national scientific conferences.
