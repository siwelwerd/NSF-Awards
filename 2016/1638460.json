 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Fund for the City of New York proposes to host a meeting for thought leaders in the computer science (CS) education community in order to identify core characteristics of a new CS community organization or hub that could serve to coordinate and accelerate the impact of the many organizations responding to the national Computer Science For All initiative. The meeting comes at a critical time in CS education:  there is a building momentum, and CS is increasingly recognized as a basic skill in a student?s education. A number of states and school districts--including Arkansas, Rhode Island, Utah, Broward Country, New York City, and San Francisco--have announced that CS will be offered in all of their K-12. Chicago has gone even further, requiring a year of Computer Science for high school graduation.  Many nonprofits have joined the effort, including most notably Code.org, but also the Computer Science Teachers Association, NCWIT (National Center for Women and Information Technology) CSNYC, MassCAN (Massachusetts Computer Alliance Network), and the Expanding Computer Science Pathways (ECEP) Alliance). This meeting aims to contribute to the design of an organization that facilitate the coordination, cooperation, and amplification of all of these stakeholders.\r\n\r\nAt the one-day meeting, participants will consider, explore, and interrogate a variety of elements relating to this proposed central entity, including its role, key functions, governance, and membership. More specifically, the day will consist of a series of Collective Impact-type activities that will support attendees in envisioning the long-term goals of CS learning, what will be needed to achieve those goals, and the role that a possible hub entity might play in those efforts. The outcomes of the meeting will be synthesized, and sent to all participants. After that, it is expected that the proposed organization will be further refined in conference calls. This effort will bring together a diverse range of federal and private organizations who are already leading important work to bring CS to our students, with the goal of amplifying and increasing their impact and success.",
