 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Coupling, Energetics, and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (CEDAR) program is a broad-based, community-guided, upper atmospheric research program. It is aimed at understanding the behavior of atmospheric regions from the middle atmosphere upward through the ionized upper layers of the atmosphere and into outer space in terms of coupling, energetics, chemistry, and dynamics on regional and global scales. The mid-latitude ionosphere serves as the intermediary between the active ionospheres of the polar and equatorial regions, but it has not been studied very thoroughly. This Collaborative CEDAR award involving University of Texas at Dallas, Virginia Tech University, and the University of Colorado is aimed at developing the first quiet-time empirical model of the ionosphere electric field distribution to fill in the necessary ground truth needed to produce a true understanding of the global dynamics of the ionosphere. The research effort would use 15 years of Air Force Defense Meteorological Space Plasma (DMSP) measurements of ion zonal flow speeds in the mid-latitude ionosphere to construct an empirical model of mid-latitude ionospheric quiet-time electric fields. This data set would be supplemented by ion drift data obtained from the mid-latitude SuperDARN sites. This database would be made available to outside users, and thus, would be a valuable ionospheric community resource. Following the completion of the development of the quiet time model, observations from storm times will be compared to predictions based upon application of the new quiet time model. The determined differences would be analyzed within the guidance and context of the CTIP (Coupled thermosphere ionosphere plasmasphere)-RCM model runs to understand the underlying physical mechanisms causing the observed variability relative to the baseline model established, to quantify the magnitude and extent of storm-time disturbances, and finally, to quantify the coupling of the mid-latitude ion drifts to the neutral atmosphere and the transfer of energy between the polar and equatorial regions. Finally, making use of nearly two decades of DMSP data to understand and develop empirical models goes to the heart of one of the fundamental challenges of the CEDAR Aeronomy program, which is to quantify a baseline model of mid-latitude electric fields. Consequently, the question of variability as a function of solar phase, geomagnetic activity, and dynamical coupling to the lower atmosphere and to the magnetosphere regions can be more carefully assessed. The results achieved would be of great interest and use to the ionosphere and thermospheric modeling community and also relevant to the CEDAR mission of \"understanding the fundamental properties of the space-atmosphere interaction region (SAIR); identify the interconnected processes that define the SAIR's global behavior, evolution, and influence on the Sun-Earth system\".  \r\n\r\nThe main goal of this project is to quantify the response of the ionosphere relative to direct, spectrally separated measurements of solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from the TIMED and SDO spacecraft. This approach constitutes an immense improvement over previous studies based on proxies. The C/NOFS and DMSP spacecraft at a range of altitudes will provide corresponding measurements of ionospheric parameters. This dataset, spanning more than a solar cycle, allows for the use of advanced statistical analysis techniques and will be used together with the SAMI-2 model to address outstanding science questions related to understanding the ionospheric response to solar EUV variability. Interesting questions to be investigated include the relative importance of and interaction between the responses in the neutral and ionized components of the upper atmosphere.",

This penetration field drives a zonal (east-west) flow in the midlatitude ions, so we can use measurements of these ion flows in the ionosphere to determine how far equatorward the penetration electric field reaches and how it changes during the storm. One of the keys to understanding the coupling of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system is seeing how much symmetry or asymmetry there is between the northern and southern hemisphere response during a geomagnetic storm.\n\n \n\nWe started by making a model of the quiet-time zonal flows in the mid- and lower latitudes from one leg of an orbit in one hemisphere of one spacecraft over several days prior to a storm.  This gives us the background quiet zonal flows we use as our control.  During the storm day we take the observed zonal flows on each orbital leg and compare them to the quiet-time control flows.  The first figure here shows the north (left) and south (right) legs of the DMSP-F16 duskside orbits in latitude and longitude over the storm day of March 17, 2013. The first of the fourteen legs of the day cross the equator at 235-245 degrees longitude (about 10 o'clock on the dial) and the subsequent orbits appear going clockwise around the dial.  The first three passes occur before the storm offset and show essentially no difference with the quiet-time flows.  Starting with the fourth leg the colors in the bins denote the magnitude of the change in flow and it is clear that there are large changes and they extend well into the midlatitude region in both hemispheres for the rest of the day. Measuring the most equatorward bin where there is a significant difference in the flows (&gt; 100 m/s) we then convert that location from geographic latitude into magnetic latitude in order to determine if there is an asymmetry in the penetration electric field relative to the Earth's magnetic field.  The second figure shows the resulting time history of the penetration electric field in magnetic latitude for both hemispheres after the storm's onset. It is clear that the overall trends in both hemispheres follow the same pattern (initial equatorward expansion during the storm onset, followed by a retreat when the solar wind magnetic field turned northward, followed by a second expansion, and finishing with a slow recovery).  But it is equally clear there is a significant difference between the extent in the two hemispheres that is outside the limits of observational error or time lags in the measurements.  This unambiguous evidence of a hemispheric asymmetry in the behavior of the penetration electric field during a geomagnetic storm is the main result of this project and we will be extending this work by examining other storms.\n\n \n\nAlong with this work we also examined the reaction of the ionosphere to the shadow of the moon during the August 21, 2017 eclipse.  We anticipated that the blocking the light from the sun would cause the temperatures of the electrons and ions in the ionosphere to decrease in a smooth manner within the moon's shadow.  In reality we found the temperatures stayed essentially the same with deep, highly local temperature drops.  Using a more sophisticated model where we modeled the bright UV-generating spots of active regions on the surface of the sun and when the moon obscured those regions we found these temperature dips corresponded to the locations of sharp temperature gradients in the UV-light intensity.  The third figure here shows a comparison of the electron temperatures (where red is hotter, white is cooler) during the DMSP-F17 pass through the moon's shadow overlaid with the mask showing the model of the UV light's gradient. This work has led to a further NSF grant to study the DMSP spacecraft's measurements of the ionosphere during half a dozen other eclipses.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/22/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marc R Hairston"
