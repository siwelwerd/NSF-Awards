 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award uses funds, under the auspices of the Rapid Response Research (RAPID) concept, to dig three new snow pits and collect two new ten-meter long cores from the Quelccaya ice cap (QIC) in southern Peru.  Samples from these pits and cores will be physically and chemically analyzed to address the hypotheses that post-depositional features (e.g., melt features) and elevated concentrations of dry deposited trace species (e.g., black carbon, dust, ammonium) provide new and reliable markers of past El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and also help facilitate the quantification of the event's intensity.  These new markers will be also applied to other ice cores from the southern Andes that exist from extended tropical ice core archives collected over the last forty years.\r\n\r\nThe chemical and physical fingerprints of past El Ni\u00f1o events are preserved in ice cores from Andean glaciers, particularly the QIC, and offer the potential to quantify past regional ENSO variability.  Previous isotopic (delta 18-Oxygen) records from the QIC provided a long annually resolved history (1,800 years) of Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variations. However, delta 18-O on the QIC is also influenced by other internally varying climate system processes (e.g., South American Monsoon, ITCZ position).  Consequently, additional El Ni\u00f1o proxies are needed to reduce the uncertainties inherent in past El Ni\u00f1o reconstructions and to help facilitate more accurate projections of intensity and frequency.\r\n\r\nThe new data that could result from the research is aimed at testing two hypotheses: 1) the snow melt and percolation induced by El Ni\u00f1o is identifiable in the prior year's snow layer and can be calibrated to the El Ni\u00f1o's strength in terms of temperature and radiative forcing; and 2) the concentration and co-association of biogenic and evaporitic species will be enhanced and detectable deeper in the ice and thereby reveal past El Ni\u00f1o frequency.\r\n\r\nThe potential broader impacts include capturing the chemical and physical signatures of a modern El Ni\u00f1o event in real time that could help evaluate past ENSO variability preserved in ice cores as well as assessing the role of solar forcing in climate. The research will help support an early career female scientist and the research results will be disseminated in short video segments appropriate for the public.",

Our glaciological expedition to Quelccaya was conducted several weeks after the climax of this very strong El Ni&ntilde;o event, allowing the recovery of its freshly formed signature in terms of snow accumulation and post-depositional processes (i.e., melting and percolation, sublimation and/or diffusion). The thickness of the annual snow layer was determined from the snow stratigraphy, and moisture origin was deduced from measurements of the ratio of oxygen isotopes (&delta;<sup>18</sup>O) in the snow collected in a shallow (10 m) ice core and a 1.9 m snow pit (Photograph 1).</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"Default\">&nbsp;The results of this project emphasize the impact of this El Ni&ntilde;o event when it is placed in the perspective of a 42-year long glaciological survey effort conducted by our group on the summit of Quelccaya which is the world&rsquo;s longest monitored tropical ice cap. We found that during the 2015/2016 season, the snow accumulation on the glacier was the smallest measured since 1974 (the layer thickness was 64% smaller than the 42-year average). &nbsp;This indicates that this El Ni&ntilde;o event enhanced the impact of the ongoing warming that is taking place in the tropical Andes (Figure 1).
