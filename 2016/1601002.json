 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) are one of the most diverse groups of organisms on the planet: worldwide there are approximately 160,000 species, including around 14,300 species in North America. Moths and butterflies are a conspicuous component of terrestrial habitats and one of the most diverse groups of plant-feeding animals worldwide. This group insect includes species of great economic importance. Their juveniles feed on plants useful to humans, including grains, cotton, tobacco, and timber and shade trees. However, many of the adults are beneficial as pollinators and are icons of conservation as evidenced by Monarch butterflies. Given their economic importance and sheer beauty, butterflies and moths are one of the most abundant insect group in museum collections, but only a fraction of the approximately 15 million specimens in non-federal collections have had their specimen label information digitally recorded and accessible to researchers and educators. Of those specimens that have been digitized, fewer than 10% of the North American Lepidoptera species have sufficient, accessible occurrence data to make reliable predictions about habitat use, susceptibility to global change impacts, or other ecologically important interactions. This project will digitize and integrate existing, unconnected collections of lepidopterans to leverage the outstanding potential of this group of organisms for transformative research, training and outreach. \r\n\r\nThe Lepidoptera of North America Network (LepNet) comprises 26 research collections that will digitize approximately 2 million specimen records and integrate these with over 1 million existing records. LepNet will digitize 43,280 larval vial records with host plant data, making this the first significant digitization of larvae in North American collections. LepNet will produce ca. 82,000 high-quality images of exemplar species covering 60% of North American lepidopteran species. These images will enhance remote identifications and facilitate systematic, ecological, and global change research. In collaboration with Visipedia, LepNet will create LepSnap, a computer vision tool that can provide automated identifications to the species level. Museum volunteers and student researchers equipped with smartphones will image >132,000 additional research-quality images through LepSnap. Up to 5,000 lepidopteran species will be elevated to a \"research ready\" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses. LepNet will build on the existing data portal (SCAN) in consolidating data on Lepidoptera to the evolution of lepidopteran herbivores in North America. Access to these data will be increased through integration with iDigBio. Data for a broad range of research, including the evolutionary ecology of Lepidoptera and their host plants in the context of global change processes affecting biogeographic distributions will be generated. The LepXPLOR! program will spearhead education and outreach efforts for 67 existing programs, engaging a diverse, nationwide workforce of 400+ students and 3,500+ volunteers. Overall, LepNet will generate a sustainable social-research network dedicated to the creation and maintenance of a digital collection of North American Lepidoptera specimens (http://www.lep-net.org/).",

The final year for formal NSF-TCN funding focused on annotating existing data and continued solicitation to digitize Lepidoptera specimens, from TCN and non-TCN collaborators.</p>\n<p><strong>* What was accomplished under these goals and objectives</strong></p>\n<p>Specific Objectives:</p>\n<p>LepNet has three interrelated objectives for the digitization of specimen-related data and images that can be readily used for research. The first goal is to database and mobilize label information from 1.7 million specimens in the 26 partnering collections and integrate these with more than 1 million existing records. Databasing in LepNet consists of digitally capturing the information from specimen labels and georeferencing as many as possible of the geographic localities represented, using a combination of automated and manual pipelines. The second goal was to generate 214,000 images of Lepidoptera specimens. Approximately 80,000 will be high-resolution DSLR camera images, at a species-exemplar level, that will document over half of the Lepidoptera species diversity in North America. The remainder of images were to be smartphone- quality images for selected lepidopteran groups, which will be represented by larger numbers of images per species; these will include butterflies, distinctive moths, and species exhibiting geographic variation. Collectively, these digitization targets are aimed at elevating approximately 5,000 North American Lepidoptera species to a \"research ready\" status suitable for complex, data-driven analyses. The third goal is making all images and data available online and as downloadable datasets through the LepNet, iDigBio, and GBIF data portals.</p>\n<p><strong>Significant Results:</strong></p>\n<p>See Key Outcomes below. We are within 95% of our goal to document occurrences, and non-TCN partners have contributed an additional 68,000 records, putting us currently at 99% of our original goal. TCNs are initiator projects, and thus we expect to achieve at least 1.7 million records within the next two years with other funding sources. The percentage of species identifications is at 92%, which is phenomenally higher than the ~60% for most insect clades. Seventy-eight percent of records are georeferenced and we can increase that with batch georeferencing, primarily through GeoLocate. LepNet has exceeded the imaging target by over 7-fold.
