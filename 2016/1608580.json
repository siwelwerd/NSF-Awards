 "awd_abstract_narration": "The National Science Foundation, Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division funds Dr. Coran M. H. Watanabe and his research group from Texas A&M University to study how a natural soil dwelling microbe makes a molecule known as azinomycin. This molecule is a member of an important class of molecules with cancer treatment potential. The research group is investigating the biosynthesis of the azinomycins, i.e. how nature constructs these molecules. These studies will not only shed light on how these molecules are constructed by nature but also pave the way for future engineering of the pathway genes for therapeutic purposes.  These investigations enable graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdoctoral fellows to develop a broad skillset in chemical biology and biotechnology.  Moreover, this research is integrated into the classroom where students learn that bioactive agents are often derived from the environment by carrying out their own field collection of soil samples, which are assayed for natural products with antibiotic activity.  This project also includes an outreach component.  High school students learn about natural products research through a lecture and lab on antibiotics and drug resistance.  A tailored set of activities is carried out for elementary school students, which centers on \"Man vs. Microbe.\"\r\n\r\nThe azinomycins are densely functionalized and architecturally fascinating.  The basic framework of the molecule is generated through a polyketide synthase/nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS/NRPS) skeleton while the aziridino[1,2-a]pyrollidine moiety is alkaloid derived.  From an enzymological perspective the natural product represents a rich treasure trove of unusual biosynthetic transformations to be mined.  The objective of this application is to functionally reconstitute and characterize enzymes of the azinomycin biosynthetic pathway and is being investigated through three primary project areas: [1] evaluation of the mechanism of polyketide ring expansion mediated by AziB and AziG,  [2] evaluation of the catalytic role of AziA3, and [3] functional characterization of azabicycle biosynthetic enzymes.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe azinomycins are a class of anti-tumor agents produced by a soil bacterium.  The activity resides in their ability to target DNA (Figure 1), the genetic basis of all life.  The compound is architecturally fascinating with different portions of the molecule contributing to the biological actions of the compound.  The current investigation evaluates how portions of the molecule are biosynthesized, i.e. how nature constructs these molecules.  In the long term, such studies might enable the genetic manipulation of the pathway for the development of more selective cancer therapies.   This study reports and reveals the unusual biosynthetic formation of the 5-methyl naphthoate moiety, which is essential for effective DNA association. The project also provides the inroads to the biosynthetic construction of the azinomycin epoxide and azabicycle units.  These two positions in the molecule enable crosslinks to form with DNA and is associated with the anti-tumor activity of these compounds.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nOrganic Chemistry involves the study of carbon-based compounds including their structure, properties, and reactions.  The PI teaches the course from a life sciences perspective.  The course included an experiential component where the students performed their own field collection of soil samples for evaluation of antibiotic activity.  Soil contains microorganisms that harbor useful bioactive compounds that can be exploited for the development of drugs.  More than 50% of all therapies come from natural products (metabolites from the environment) or inspired by a natural product. \n\nThe PI taught a Chemical Biology course open to both undergraduate and graduate students.  Problem/game sessions (Aggieopoly and Wheel of Fortune) were incorporated as a learning tool.  It gave students the opportunity to practice their problem-solving skills in a more informal atmosphere and the students seemed to enjoy them.  The PI also gave an overview talk on her research program.\n\nThe PI visited College Station High School and gave a lecture and accompanying lab experiment on natural product discovery and antibiotic resistance.  Students learned about where drugs came from, the issues with antibiotic resistance, and the importance of taking the full-prescribed course of antibiotics.   They learned to carry out a zone of inhibition assay comparing the effect of ampicillin (a relative of penicillin) against E. coli and E. coli that contains a putative beta-lactamase (drug resistance gene).  See Figures 2 and 3 for pictures from some of these events.  The PI has adapted the above and completed the development of a short lecture on Man vs. Microbe and lab experiment for elementary school students. \n\nThe PI developed and serves as faculty advisor to OCDC (Organization for Cultural Diversity in Chemistry). The organization consists of grad students, undergrad students, and postdoctoral fellows of all races and nationalities and it values diversity of thought, background, ethnicity, and perspective and seeks to create and maintain a healthy department climate.  The organization is a local section within the newly founded and growing Alliance for Diversity in Science and Engineering.

OCDC hosted speakers including handling prejudice with respect to minority students and the LGBT community and identifying and reporting racist practices, hosted social events, and participated in several outreach activities including the Chemistry Open House, STEM Night at John C.
