Increased graduate student participation will infuse the perspectives of early career scientists into the conference and provide them with networking opportunities. This conference enhances the infrastructure for research and education by bringing together groups from industry and academia. It also promotes international collaboration among scientists. \r\n\r\nThe International Conference of Fluvial Hydraulics was established in 2002 by the International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research. It covers a range of topics in fluvial research. These topics are relevant to both the NSF Geomorphology and Land-use Dynamics Program and the Hydrological Sciences Program. Promoting the attendance of early career scientists to this conference will advance the goal of these programs to recruit and train the next generation of geomorphologists and hydrologists.",
