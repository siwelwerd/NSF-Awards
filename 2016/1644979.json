The symposium will be held at the annual American Association for Aerosol Research (AAAR) conference to be held in Portland Oregon from October 17-21, 2016. \r\n\r\nThe symposium will include presentations on the effects of anthropogenic nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) on BVOC oxidation and aerosol formation from laboratory, field, and modeling studies. The participation of both experimentalists and modelers and related discussions will enhance efficient knowledge transfer, where laboratory/field data will provide important constraints for improved parameterization of aerosol formation in models. By bringing together senior and junior scientists at the workshop, the meeting will serve to foster scientific training and networking opportunities for younger scientists, thereby greatly enhancing their career development.",
