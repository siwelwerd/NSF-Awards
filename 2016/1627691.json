 "awd_abstract_narration": "In social science, journalism, and popular culture we hear a lot about ideological differences in everyday domains such as life satisfaction, empathy, and intergroup relations. At the heart of these issues are the emotional experiences and reactions of individuals in their daily lives. Some research has examined ideological differences in emotional reactions and attitudes toward outgroups. This project examines more complex, deliberative processes namely, the ways in which individuals attempt to control or regulate their emotions in various domains of life. Understanding the various ways in which people regulate their emotions has implications not only for understanding ideological differences in fundamental emotional processes, but also for the outcomes of these processes. Furthermore, an appreciation of the different types of emotion regulation strategies that work best may hold the key to developing interventions designed to improve personal well-being as well as relations among various groups in society.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research involves three phases designed to illuminate ideological differences in emotion regulation processes in these two domains of life, explain these differences, and to develop catered interventions based on these differences. In 11 studies conducted in two countries (the United States and Israel, the latter of which is supported by the Israeli government), Dr. John Jost from New York University and his Israeli collaborator, Dr. Eran Halperin, will combine different methodologies to meet all three objectives. The first phase examines and maps how ideology shapes emotion regulation in the two domains using large-scale surveys, experience sampling, and EEG. In the second stage they examine four possible mechanisms that may drive ideological differences in emotion regulation through experimental manipulation of these mechanisms. Finally, in the third stage, they develop emotion regulation-based psychological interventions and test their effectiveness in improving well-being and intergroup relations.",

At the heart of these differences are complex emotional experiences and reactions of individuals in their daily lives. In this research program, which was carried out in the U.S., Israel, Netherlands, Hungary, and Turkey, we investigated how liberal and conservative citizens engage in specific (but distinctive) emotion regulation strategies to support their own ideological commitments, policy preferences, and group attitudes. We also addressed the implications of these processes for ideological polarization, conflict resolution, political protest, and the treatment of minority groups, including immigrants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Major Findings:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We find that people often use emotion regulation strategies to maintain ideologically congruent emotional experiences. For instance, when Americans were asked to recall an anger-inducing incident involving an immigrant in a large-scale nationally representative study (<em>N</em> = 498), self-identified conservatives experienced higher levels of initial anger and were more motivated to maintain their initial levels of anger, in comparison with self-identified liberals. Conservatives were also (a) less likely to use any ?down-regulation? strategies (such as distraction and re-appraisal) to reduce their anger, and (b) more likely to use ?up-regulation? strategies (such as rumination and expressive amplification) to maintain or increase their levels of anger at immigrants (see Figure 1). </li>\n<li>We conceptually replicated these results in a very different cultural context, namely Hungary.&nbsp; In a nationally representative study of Hungarians (<em>N</em> = 1,141), we observed that conservatives were again (a) less likely to use ?down-regulation? strategies to reduce their anger, and (b) more likely to use ?up-regulation? strategies to maintain or increase their levels of anger at immigrants (see Figure 2).</li>\n<li>Similar results were also obtained in the context of Israel using a ?least liked group? paradigm in which respondents are given the opportunity to specify which group in society they like the least and to answer questions about that group. In a study of Jewish Israelis (<em>N</em> = 203), we found that political rightists?and, to a slightly lesser extent, leftists?who expressed high levels of initial anger toward out-groups were more likely to engage in ?up-regulation? strategies to maintain or increase their levels of anger, in comparison with leftists (see Figure 3). </li>\n<li>In five studies, we examined whether people would seek to maintain ?ideology-congruent? emotions (e.g., anger and fear for rightists and hope for leftists), and whether this would be explained by the belief that a specific emotion would reinforce one?s ideological commitments. In a repeated measures study conducted during a two-week period of intense Israeli-Palestinian violence, we observed that Israeli leftists maintained hope for the violence to subside despite accumulated exposure to violence, whereas rightists? levels of hope diminished over time. Conversely, rightists were more likely to maintain higher levels of fear and anger than leftists over time. </li>\n<li>In follow-up studies we found that leftists in Israel, the U.S., and the Netherlands believed that hope reinforced their ideology more than rightists did, whereas rightists believed that fear reinforced their ideology more than leftists did. These beliefs helped to explain differences in emotional experiences in political domains in all three countries. In an experimental study, we demonstrated that U.S. liberals who were led to believe that hope reinforced (vs. undermined) liberal ideology experienced more resistance-based hope following President Trump?s election and were more supportive of collective action. </li>\n<li>Previous research establishes that legitimizing the societal status quo (system justification) is associated with less negative emotional experience and less support for collective action. In four studies involving university students in Israel and Turkey we investigated the possibility that ?expressive suppression? (actively trying not to express negative emotions) would be associated with decreased support for protest. Consistent with hypotheses, we observed that expressive suppression lowered feelings of system-based anger and guilt and attenuated the relationship between system justification and willingness to participate in collective action in both countries (see Figure 5). These findings suggest that emotional down-regulation strategies can diminish the motivation for collective action even among people who are relatively low in system justification.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/02/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: John&nbsp;T&nbsp;Jost</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1627691/1627691_10449691_1578010547383_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1627691/1627691_10449691_1578010547383_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1627691/1627691_10449691_1578010547383_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jost, Pliskin, Halperin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;T&nbsp;Jost</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1627691/1627691_10449691_1578010583993_Slide2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1627691/1627691_10449691_1578010583993_Slide2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1627691/1627691_10449691_1578010583993_Slide2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jost, Pliskin, Halperin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;T&nbsp;Jost</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1627691/1627691_10449691_1578010631103_Slide3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1627691/1627691_10449691_1578010631103_Slide3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1627691/1627691_10449691_1578010631103_Slide3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 3</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jost, Pliskin, Halperin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;T&nbsp;Jost</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1627691/1627691_10449691_1578010715242_Slide4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1627691/1627691_10449691_1578010715242_Slide4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1627691/1627691_10449691_1578010715242_Slide4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 4</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jost, Pliskin, Halperin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;T&nbsp;Jost</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1627691/1627691_10449691_1578010758391_Slide5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1627691/1627691_10449691_1578010758391_Slide5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1627691/1627691_10449691_1578010758391_Slide5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 5</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Jost, Pliskin, Halperin</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;T&nbsp;Jost</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 5</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
