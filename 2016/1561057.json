 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project proposes to analyze how organizations and industries change over time by building a large-scale database compiled from Internet web pages of over 1,000,000 private and public firms, and an analytical web-based tool to provide efficient access to this database. This large-scale database will contain information on products and services directly offered by public and private firms to their customers over the last 20 years, as well as links to the US Patent and Trademark Office's patent data for the last 20 years. The resulting database and analysis tool will enable researchers to answer many questions, including: How do industries, competition in industries and their products change over time? What are the dynamics of product introduction rates for private and public firms and how did private firms and their array of product offerings change during the recent financial crisis? What products are introduced by public and private firms following increases in patenting activity within an industry? Do the patenting firms introduce the new products or do non-patenting firms? Which government policy changes were most effective in stimulating the growth of entrepreneurial firms, and in what kind of markets did these policies work best? What local product market conditions are most conducive to successful entry by entrepreneurial firms and how do waves of innovation impact product market competition? What economic forces trigger firms to cross the boundary between public and private status? In addition to impacting academics that study innovation and how industries change over time, business decision makers, consumers, and regulators will benefit from the new industry designations. Businesses can use the database and web based tool to assess existing market structure around new products. This will facilitate more informed decisions about where and when to commit scarce resources to enter new markets. By examining the nature of existing competition and market structure by both public and private firms, large and small, entrepreneurs can also better assess the likely success of their new ventures. Regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) can also benefit from refined knowledge of industry structure and product market boundaries. \r\n\r\nThis project will produce a highly scalable approach for mining historical Web data to create comprehensive product-based databases and tools to query and analyze this data. This integrated database will be built using firm web pages from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine project. Using the text from these web pages, the resulting database will classify firms as competitors, which will be used to build new industry definitions. These new industry definitions will be based directly on the product and service descriptions firms use to interface with customers. The project will produce a publicly available web-based analytical tool based on \"Elasticsearch\" (www.elasticsearch.com). This tool will allow users to query the database of public and private firms, their competitors, and the products they offer. Using this tool, a user will be able to input a company, or list of companies, and the tool will provide that company's product descriptions and a list of its competitors that produce similar products, along with the corresponding similarity scores, indicating the strength of competitive links. The analytical tool will also allow a firm's local product market to be visualized as a network. In addition to the hosted, online search tool, users will be able to download bulk datasets to perform their own local processing.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project is to build a large-scale database, which we call the Web Text-based Network Industry Classification (WTNIC), of data about both public and private companies in the US.   This large-scale database provides information on the competitive network of 950,000 firms over the last 20 years.   This database is constructed using firm archived web pages from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine project.  This database is also linked to the last 15 years of patent data from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nAs part of this project, we explored the efficacy of an array of potential computational linguistic methods to generate the most informative network of peers.

The team developed algorithms that have been run on all 950,000 WTNIC firms over all of the years of our sample from 1997 to 2016.  The research team examined numerous methods for computing these similarities. The team explored neural network embedding technologies implemented using word2vec and doc2vec.  The result of this analysis on the WTNIC data is that doc2vec offers the best results thus far both in terms of informativeness and scaling. \n\nIn preparation for launching the final WTNIC database, the team explored techniques to link the companies in the WTNIC network database to a number of frequently used financial economics databases.  This step is necessary to realize many broader impacts including the empowerment of a much wider array of research in financial economics.  Specific databases that we linked to include the USPTO patent database, the Venture Expert VC funding database, the CRSP and Compustat public firm databases, and the underlying WTNIC firm list.  The team experimented with many algorithms over the duration of this project including Stata, RLTK, edit distances, and deduplication and matching programs written in Python.  After much examination and testing for accuracy, the research team identified the python DEDUP algorithm as the optimal tool for this purpose as it is both accurate and scales to the required size. \n\nThis project will have an impact across multiple disciplines.  The issues of market structure and product market competition are important issues in many disciplines. For example, empirical studies in the fields of economics, finance, accounting, and management examine market structure and competition.   This practice is especially difficult when studies include private firms given the lack of reliable industry data for these firms.  Currently most researchers rely on Census produced Herfindahls, which are only available for manufacturing industries.  The new data developed in this project can improve these strands of industry research and can further impact researchers in multiple disciplines through the methodological contributions.  The study of entrepreneurship will in particular be aided by the data linked from web pages to data from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.   Researchers studying entrepreneurship will be able to assess the impact of patents on industry structure and evolution.\n\nThe WTNIC repository has been used as a key component of the Business Open Knowledge Network (BOKN) project (NSF grant # (#1937153), a separate NSF funded project associated with the NSF Convergence Accelerator program.  Attesting to the value of the WTNIC repository, the most exciting broader impacts of the follow-on project draw heavily from the tools developed for the WTNIC project.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/07/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Craig A Knoblock"
