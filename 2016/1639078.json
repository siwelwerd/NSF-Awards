Students who graduate with a background in atomic, molecular, and optical physics acquire a broad range of knowledge and skills that enable them to contribute to progress in many areas of science and technology.\r\n\r\nThis award provides travel support for student participation in the 47th Annual Meeting of the American Physical Society Division of Atomic, Molecular, and Optical Physics (APS-DAMOP). Support is provided only for US students (students enrolled in US universities). This Conference has grown in recent years and attracts over one-thousand participants. Covering all the major areas of atomic, molecular and optical physics, this conference series is of outstanding importance to the vitality of atomic, molecular, and optical physics in the United States. This Conference offers an opportunity for students to present their research results and to interact with senior scientists primarily from the United States, but also the broader international community.",
