 "awd_abstract_narration": "To understand how sensory inputs can guide behavior, it is important to identify how the structure of sensory signals, the patterns of brain activity that encode these signals, and the abilities of animals to perceive them are related.  We still do not understand the general principles that link specific neural response properties with the structure of behaviorally relevant signals. This project will address this question by comparing how the brain encodes communication signals several closely related species of electric fish that display key differences in their signals. The project will use neurophysiological experiments, behavioral assays, and signal analysis to ask how brain mechanisms are optimized to species-specific signal properties and how these neural mechanisms influence the ability of the animals to perceive signals. The project will test the hypothesis that the structure of communication signals and the patterns of neural responses are efficiently matched across species to enable to detect and/or the discriminate conspecific signals. The model system, the communication signals of weakly electric fishes, is an ideal platform to link evolutionary, neurophysiological, and computational approaches to understanding the neural basis of behavior.  Furthermore, electric fishes' use of a \"sixth sense\" to detect their world and communicate is a fascinating phenomenon that can engage public interest in animal diversity and neurobiology. The project will train high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. The researchers will also work with K-12 teachers to develop lesson plans that are linked to the project?s research and that are aligned with the learning goals of the AP Biology curriculum.\r\n\r\nCommunication signals often evolve with peripheral sensory filters to optimize species-specific signal capture. Much less is known, however, about how central sensory circuits evolve to efficiently extract and analyze complex features of conspecific signals. This project will comparatively study the communication signals and sensory systems of weakly electric fish to investigate relationships between signal structure, neural mechanisms of sensory processing, and perceptual tasks. The central hypothesis is that sensory coding and signal structure co-evolve in response to perceptual demands to permit efficient detection and discrimination of conspecific signals. The project will first analyze how cross-species variation in the structure of two communication signals that impinge on the same sensory channel influences the conspicuousness of signals. The project will then use in vivo electrophysiology to compare how the coding strategies of central sensory neurons are related to the structure of signals across species. Finally, behavioral tests will quantify how signal structure and sensory coding strategies influence the abilities of the fish to detect and discriminate signals. The project thus explicitly links signal diversity, sensory systems, and behavior. This project has strong potential to open a new direction in studying the mechanisms and evolution of communication systems by revealing how complex features of species-specific signals are co-adapted with neural coding strategies and the sensory tasks they accomplish. The CoPIs will take advantage of the interdisciplininary approaches of the project and the charismatic and engaging nature of the animal model to provide outreach and educational opportunities from the K-12 to advanced graduate levels.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBackground:\n\nTo communicate effectively, signalers must coordinate properties of their communication signals with perceptual mechanisms of receivers.  Signals are also often embedded environmental and social noise, and receivers must extract salient signal features from that noise. The central aim of this project was determining how properties of different communication signals that impinge the same sensory modality co-evolve with each other, with sensory mechanisms to detect and discriminate signals, and with the social environment in which signals are transmitted.\n\nThis question was addressed with comparative studies of the electric communication signals of South American knifefishes. The  ~200 species of knifefishes all produce weak, electric organ discharges (EODs) from electric organs in their tails. EODs are detected by ultrasensitive electroreceptors in the skin that allow fish to identify nearby objects.  Electroreceptors also detect interference between a fish\u2019s own EOD and EODs of other fish, thereby allowing fish to communicate with EODs. EOD waveform and frequency act as signals conveying species identity, sex, and social status. During social interactions, fish also transiently modulate EOD frequency and amplitude to produce signals known as chirps.  Properties of EODs and chirps vary across species.  EOD frequency and waveform are perceived as a regular amplitude modulation (beat) created when a receiver\u2019s own EOD interferes with that of another fish.  Chirps are perceived as disruptions in the regular beat of the two interacting EODs.\n\nBy comparatively studying how properties of EODs and chirps interact to influence the conspicuousness and discriminability of chirps, this project characterized how evolution of one signal (EODs) could influence the structure and perception of another signal (chirps) that uses the same sensory channel. The project also examined whether signal structure and conspicuousness co-evolved with sociality. In collaboration with the co-PI at West Virginia University, this project examined co-evolution of signal structure and sociality with central sensory mechanisms of signal perception.\n\nIntellectual merits:\n\n(1)   The project characterized how EOD frequency and waveform are encoded in the beat created when EODs interact.  Specifically, EOD waveform is represented nonlinearly in beat structure such that simple and highly complex EOD waveforms are more difficult to finely discriminate than EOD waveforms of intermediate complexity.\n\n(2)   The project found that interspecific variation in EOD frequency and waveform strongly influences conspicuousness of chirps, suggesting that different signals (EODs and chirps) impinging on the same sensory modality influence each other\u2019s perception and should co-evolve.  However, chirps were not always most conspicuous when produced on conspecific EOD waveforms, suggesting that multiple factors influence the evolution of chirp and EOD structure.\n\n(3)   The project found that chirps occurring on complex beats in highly social contexts are much less conspicuous than those occurring on simpler beats during dyadic interactions, suggesting that social species must solve more complex sensory problems to detect and discriminate signals.\n\n(4)   This project comparatively tested the social complexity hypothesis, which posits that highly social species produce more complex communication signals to resolve more intricate social relationships.  This hypothesis was not supported because chirp complexity was not correlated with sociality across species.\n\n(5)   The project refined a conditioning paradigm for assessing signal perception in electric fish by pairing communication signals with movements of a shelter tube and using automated video analyses to measure anticipatory tracking of the shelter tube.\n\n(6)   The project characterized the structure of communication signals in several additional species of electric fish.\n\n(7)   The project found that chirp production depended heavily on experimental paradigm and social context, and that signal production was often not repeatable within individuals across contexts.  It also found that chirping in different social contexts varies markedly across species, suggesting that the function of homologous communication signal is evolutionarily labile.\n\nBroader impacts:\n\n(1)   Research training and professional mentoring was provided for 3 graduate students, 15 undergraduates, and 6 high school teachers.  The two graduate students who have graduated pursued research careers.  Of 12 undergraduates who have graduated, five pursued higher degrees or jobs in science and five went to medical or professional school.\n\n(2)   The project fostered collaborations between two laboratories that use diverse approaches to study animal behavior, sensory biology, and neurobiology. Research collaborations were facilitated by joint lab meetings and co-mentorship of graduate students by the PI and co-PI.\n\n(3)   The project engaged K-12 students and community members through educational outreach events employing electric fish to illustrate concepts in evolution, sensory biology, physiology, and social behavior.  These events included IU ScienceFest, an annual event drawing hundreds of community members, and the Indiana Junior Academy of Science, which brings high school students across the state to campus.  During the pandemic, an interactive, online outreach module was developed.\n\n(4)   The PI collaborated with high school teachers in the Biology Summer Institute to develop classroom modules on electric fish that were related to the project aims and aligned with state high school biology curriculum standards.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/18/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gerald T Smith"
