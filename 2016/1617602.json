 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to develop a new non-invasive and easily-implemented optical diagnostic of an ionized gas, a plasma, for the particular class of low-pressure molecular gas plasmas.  Industrial processes involving plasmas contribute to a long list of societal benefits that continues to grow at a rapid pace.  The unique properties of low-pressure ionized gas plasmas enable the manipulation of materials in ways that cannot be achieved by other means. Specifically, their complex dynamics lead to non-equilibrium chemistry; energetic ions, radicals (atoms, molecules or ions that react strongly with substrate surfaces), and photons produced in the plasma through collisions with energetic electrons etch, modify or deposit thin films on materials surfaces. Process outcomes are thus critically sensitive to the abundances of electrons of different energies and other plasma parameters. This project will also celebrate plasma technology and enhance public 'plasma literacy' through the development of a new hands-on outreach exhibit highlighting plasma thrusters for spacecraft propulsion.  The centerpiece of the display will be a working plasma thruster operating at atmospheric pressure. The display will be created in partnership with the Rocket Club at Madison West High School and will become part of the Rocket Club's popular traveling exhibit, viewed by thousands of people each year at science festivals and school visits.\r\n\r\nThe spectrum of light emitted by the plasma carries an encoded mapping of plasma parameters.  Probing plasma properties by measuring the intensity of plasma light emissions at characteristic wavelengths is made possible through a model that predicts emission spectra by accounting for the excitation and de-excitation processes that govern light emission by the plasma. This project's innovation is the creation of a quantitative emission model for molecular gases, with oxygen as an initial focus.  Through careful consideration of known excitation rates, the study will identify spectral features for inclusion in the model, choosing some that show a strong quantitative dependence on the electron energy distribution function and others that are strong functions of the dissociation fraction, i.e., the fraction of molecules broken up into constituent atoms.  This approach will allow plasma parameters to be determined as the values for which the model produces a best fit to the observed spectral intensities, measured using optical emission spectroscopy (OES).  To demonstrate and explore the capabilities of the molecular OES diagnostic, it will be applied to selected discharge phenomena (i) that exhibit complex plasma dynamics not fully understood, (ii) for which new molecular OES is likely to contribute new insights and (iii) for which the new insights obtained have relevance for development of industrial processes.",

The production rates of ions, radicals (atoms, molecules or ions that may react strongly with material surfaces), and photons produced in the plasma through electron collisions are critically sensitive to the relative abundances of electrons of different energies (EEDFs), which can sometimes be quantitatively characterized as an electron temperature. Toward the goal of providing tools to aid researchers in the understanding, design, optimization and control of plasma processes, we have sought to advance the capabilities of non-invasive optical emission spectroscopy (OES)-based diagnostics of plasma properties for low-pressure plasmas widely used in materials applications.\n\nIntellectual Merit:  Determining plasma properties by measuring the brightness of plasma light emissions at characteristic wavelengths is made possible through the development of emission models, for selected specific gas mixtures, that predict emission spectra by accounting for the excitation and de-excitation processes that govern light emission by the plasma.  \n\nThe research conducted for this grant on rare gas plasmas and oxygen plasmas falls into two categories.  First, we extended on our prior work implementing OES measurements in rare gas plasmas by expanding into regimes with different EEDFs.  In a magnetized plasma (helicon), interpretation of the recorded line-averaged quantities required accounting for radial variations in the concentration profiles of electrons caused by the confining magnetic field.  In an unmagnetized plasma (inductively coupled plasma), an emission model was successfully constructed to measure an EEDF that was deliberately altered through the injection of extra energetic electrons from an auxiliary source.\n\nThe bulk of this research effort went into the development of a quantitative emission model for a molecular gas (oxygen) plasma.  Using measurements for a wide range of plasma operating conditions, spectral features of oxygen plasmas were carefully examined as candidates for inclusion in the oxygen emission model, resulting in a set of features collectively exhibiting strong quantitative dependence on the electron temperature and the dissociation fraction (fraction of neutral gas in atomic form).  For the spectral features arising from emissions from electronically excited O atoms, the emission model must include contributions both from excitation of free O atoms and from dissociative excitation of O2 through collisions with energetic electrons; in the case of O2+ emissions, electron collisions with both O2 and O2+ must be considered.  To construct an emission model suitable for determining electron temperature, the dependence of the excitation rates on electron temperature in some cases had to be determined experimentally, which we accomplished by conducting and using measurements of the spectral intensities, as well as a number of other diagnostics, to perform numerical fits.  Implementation and validation of the resulting emission model as a diagnostic for the electron temperature and the dissociation fraction is currently underway.\n\nBroader impacts: The NSF funding through this award supported the contributions of three graduate student research assistants and two undergraduate students to the development and implementation of OES diagnostics.  Both undergraduates have completed UW engineering degrees (one is now a UW grad student); two grad students completed degrees (MS and PhD, respectively) and the third is completing a PhD on an OES diagnostic for oxygen plasmas.\n\nWith funding from this NSF award, a collaboration was established with the Madison West High School Rocket club.  The collaborative team created an engaging and interactive public outreach exhibit on plasma thrusters for interplanetary space travel. The completed exhibit includes:\n\nInteractive working plasma thruster in air.  With only 0.5 watts of electric power, it produces sufficient thrust for a demonstration in which the exhaust deflects a dangled lightweight object.\nInteractive full-scale 3D printed model cubesat with integrated thruster model.  The realistic satellite model (built entirely by the Madison West team) includes simulated solar panels with embedded light sensors.  When the \"sun\" (a flashlight) shines on the panels, the model plasma thruster \"turns on\" (blue LEDs to represent thruster plasma \"exhaust\"), once the gauge indicator signals that the \"batteries\" have charged.\nInteractive video display showing thruster plasma and emitted spectrum.
