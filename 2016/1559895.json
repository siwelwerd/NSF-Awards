 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Department of Atmospheric Sciences at Texas A&M University will host thirty undergraduate students over a period of three summers to conduct research with faculty mentors and their research groups in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site.  The Texas A&M Department of Atmospheric Sciences faculty and students conduct research across a broad range of atmospheric disciplines.  The experience provides career enrichment and opportunities for students to explore research topics in the atmospheric sciences.  The site offers an opportunity to study meteorology and atmospheric science topics especially relevant to the Gulf Coast states, including severe weather, numerical prediction, atmospheric chemistry, and climate.  \r\n\r\nThe primary objectives of this REU site are (1) to provide a high-quality scientific research experience and (2) to increase diversity in the population of students interested in and preparing for research careers. The program is designed to parallel the graduate research experience as closely as possible by embedding participants in research groups with graduate students and a faculty mentor.  Weekly activities and meetings on individual and group research are supplemented with professional development and seminars on communicating, graduate and career opportunities, and on campus events with REUs in other fields.  Special attention will be given to furthering students' quantitative skills via individual mentoring, group tutorials, and small group workshops based on specific needs.  Students will have opportunities to report their results in presentations on campus and at national conferences.  This program makes a specific effort to recruit and include participants from smaller colleges and minority-serving institutions, partnering with institutions throughout the Gulf Coast region that serve historically underrepresented populations to help recruit a diverse pool of applicants.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFaculty in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences at Texas A&amp;M welcomed thirty-two (32) undergraduate students into their research groups for nine-week, in-residence summer programs as part of this Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) award.  Beginning in the summer of 2017, approximately ten (10) students each year traveled to College Station, Texas, from schools across the country to work on projects in meteorology, climate, atmospheric chemistry, and remote sensing.  These students were paired with both a faculty mentor whose research matched the interest of the student and a graduate student mentor from the same group.  Individual projects were developed in consultation with the faculty mentor, implemented under the guidance of both the faculty and graduate student mentors, and results culminated with a research poster presentation open to faculty from across the university at the conclusion of the summer program.  Students then had the opportunity to present their posters again at a national research conference, and the vast majority of ours did so at either the American Geophysical Union\u2019s (AGU) annual meeting or the American Meteorological Society\u2019s (AMS) annual meeting the following winter.  In addition to the individual projects in research groups, team research projects and meetings were conducted throughout the program with the entire cohort.  Led by the principal investigators, the cohort worked on group projects that introduced students to the instruments used in the atmospheric sciences, and took field trips to field sites from the Gulf Coast to Great Plains to collect data near sea breeze boundaries or severe thunderstorms.  Students met at least weekly with the principal investigators to discuss their progress and any issues, as well as learn about research and fellowship opportunities in the field.  Because the majority of participants had limited access to atmospheric science research at their home institutions, the program provided an opportunity to become immersed in atmospheric science research in a new way, testing or developing their appetite for graduate study or professional opportunities in the field.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robert L Korty"
