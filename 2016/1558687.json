 "awd_abstract_narration": "A joint effort by the NSF, University of Hawaii, and the privately funded Schmidt Ocean Institute in 2014 surveyed the seafloor along the western Hawaiian Ridge and obtained nearly complete coverage in water depths greater than 50 m of the 2500-km-long chain of extinct volcanoes.  This exceptional data set will be used to study the strength of the tectonic plate.  The gravity data and seafloor maps record the downward bending of the tectonic plate when volcanos are built on it.  Models will be used to simulate this bending and provide an estimate of the strength of the tectonic plate.  The results will complement, or could even revise, results produced by experimental methods in which the strength of rock samples is measured in the laboratory.  The project will contribute to the understanding of earthquakes which requires an understanding of rock strength. The project will also contribute to the professional training of graduate and undergraduate students in advanced STEM fields.  In addition, a graduate student seminar will be developed whose topic will be on the strength of the plate, and guest lectures will be given remotely via Skype and made available on iTunes University and YouTube sites.\r\n\r\nRheologic properties of the Pacific Ocean lithosphere will be investigated along the older section of the Hawaiian Ridge.  In this area, volcanoes of different sizes have erupted on crust of roughly the same age (about 85 Ma).  This will allow the researchers to isolate the effect of the size of the load and age of the load from the effect of the thermal age of the lithosphere in their models of the lithosphere response to the loads. The researchers will use multibeam bathymetry and gravity data collected in this region to quantify the rheological laws that control the flexure of the underlying lithosphere and thus, characterize the strength of the lithosphere.  This study could motivate revisions to our understanding of lithosphere rheology overall.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe \"lithosphere\" is the outer stiff shell of the Earth composing the tectonic plates.  The temperatures and rock material properties of the lithosphere controls its \"rheology\", or  how it deforms due to imposed loads such as those of volcanoes, mountain belts, melting of glaciers, changes in sea level, as well as those at boundaries where two plates meet and generate earthquakes.  The Hawaiian Island Chain in the Central Pacific offers an opportunity to study the strength of the underlying oceanic lithosphere--the type of lithosphere generally present in all settings in and around the oceans.  \n\nThe first research project involved using geophysical data collected from shipboard surveys of the Hawaiian chain within the Papah&#257;naumoku&#257;kea National Marine Monument.  These data reveal the degree to which the underlying lithosphere has been warped or flexed downward by the weight of the volcanoes. Measured topography provides information about volcano mass, whereas measured variations in the pull of gravity provides information about subsurface density structure that reveals how the lithosphere has flexed.  Computer models that predict the response of lithosphere flexure to the observed volcano loads, given a set of rock strength properties, show that the lithosphere beneath the Hawaiian Chain is much weaker than expected from laboratory experiments of rock deformation.  Either the strength laws derived from the laboratory experiments should be revised, or the lithosphere is weak because it is unusually warm as a consequence of the anomalous temperatures and magmatic activity associated with the volcano chain .  The former possibility has broad implications for a general understanding of rock strength within the lithosphere.  The latter possibility is important to our understanding of how the lithosphere responds to active volcanic processes. \n\nThe second research project involved studying pyroxene and garnet minerals in rock samples that were ripped out from the lithosphere and delivered by magma onto the surface of the Hawaiian island of Oahu.  The texture and composition of these minerals are used as \"geobarometers\" and \"geothermometers\" to estimate the pressures and temperatures of the minerals within the lithosphere prior to them being extracted.  We find that these minerals equilibrated at mid?lithosphere depths of 50 km below the surface and were 200-300 degrees Celcius hotter than expected for normal oceanic lithosphere.  This result supports the possibility of unusually hot lithosphere beneath the Hawaiian Chain.\n\nThe first research project supported the graduate education and research training of a female masters student at the University of Hawaii.  The second project provided professional research experience for a female graduate student, who is also an African American.  This student has since begun a graduate degree in earth science.  Both projects are relevant to understanding earthquake hazards for the state of Hawaii and other similar ocean island settings.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/28/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Garrett T Apuzen-Ito"
