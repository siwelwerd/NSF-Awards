 "awd_abstract_narration": "Just as volcanoes have alternating periods of eruption and repose, igneous intrusions can also have alternating periods of injection and crystallization.  This study will provide a better understanding of the emplacement process and its effects in intrusive systems, specifically in mafic sills.  The study will identify the diagnostic physical and chemical signatures of magma reinjection into a partially crystalline system and the specific textural characteristics of a reinjection horizon that can be used to determine its timing and thermal conditions.  Diagnostic criteria for recognizing reinjections in mafic systems will allow this process to be positively identified in other intrusions and will place important constraints on models for magma chamber formation and evolution.  In addition, the data to be developed (texture, composition, and mineralogy profiles) will be widely distributed as a resource for developing and testing petrologic hypotheses, and for recognizing additional processes beyond those specifically addressed in this study.\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of this study is to define the detailed signature of reinjection events using a continuous drill core profile through a diabase sill (the Black Sturgeon sill) from Nipigon, Ontario.  Petrographic data will include modal mineralogy, textures (crystal size distributions), and fabric (alignment factor).  Geochemical data will include bulk-rock major and trace-element chemistry and mineral compositions.  Preliminary results have been used to tentatively identify the positions and effects of several reinjection events in the Black Sturgeon sill.  This project will document the fine-scale variations around these sites and locate and characterize other potential reinjection zones.  These textural and compositional variations will provide a set of discrete criteria that can be used to demonstrate and document the existence of reinjection horizons in magmatic systems.  Numerical cooling models will then be integrated with textural observations and with MELTS modeling to provide quantitative constraints on the emplacement history of the Black Sturgeon sill, including the timing and spatial distribution of the individual replenishment events.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe goal of this project was to characterize the signatures of magmatic reinjections in sills, primarily in terms of mineralogy, geochemical composition, and texture.  A complete drill-core profile through the Black Sturgeon Sill, a 250-m thick diabase intrusion from Nipigon, Ontario, provided an ideal opportunity to identify and sample across reinjection horizons.  Although it was clear from preliminary data that this sill was composite, the textural and compositional breaks associated with reinjections were too subtle to be recognized through hand-sample variations.  Thus, the signatures identified through this project would serve as valuable indicators of the scale of variations that can be expected to be found in a wide range of similar intrusions.\n\nThe most important scientific outcome of this project has been a quantification of the compositional effects of reinjection.  Because of the very large number of samples analyzed as a part of this project (&gt;550), principal component analysis was used to characterize compositional variations at all scales in the sill.  This technique not only provided an efficient tool for identifying the compositional signatures of reinjection, but it also provided a framework for determining the precise petrologic processes responsible for these signatures.  Interestingly, the compositional breaks were more consistent with changes in the proportion and mineralogical character of crystal cargo than with more or less evolved liquid compositions.\n\nAlthough several of the reinjection horizons can be recognized based on texture and mineralogy as well as composition, other horizons could only be recognized using rock compositions.  The initial hypothesis had been that textural signatures would be more robust than the compositional signatures, as disruptions to the cooling process would be universal, even if successive magma pulses had very similar compositions.  In the course of the study, it was recognized that variable populations of crystal cargo can overwhelm the signatures of thermal-driven coarsening and chilling.\n\nThe scientific results from this project are anticipated to be widely applicable to other intrusions.  There is nothing exotic or unusual about the Black Sturgeon Sill.  The same techniques that were used to recognize reinjections in this system could be applied to any other igneous intrusion.  Follow-up work will revisit the textural signatures to attempt to decouple the effects of cooling and the accumulation of crystal cargo.\n\nAlong with the direct scientific results, perhaps the most important long-term outcome of this project is an extensive compilation of textural and geochemical data through the Black Sturgeon Sill.  As a part of this project, over 500 new samples were analyzed for bulk-rock geochemistry, the majority of which were also point-counted to determine modal mineralogy and measured for textural characteristics including plagioclase and olivine grain size and plagioclase orientation.  The resulting highly detailed stratigraphic profile represents an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate both large and small-scale variability in relatively homogeneous igneous bodies.\n\nThis project was designed in part to enhance the professional growth of Slippery Rock University (SRU) undergraduates by involving them in all aspects of the scientific process and to enhance the research culture of the university.  Throughout this project, SRU geology students assisted with sample selection and preparation, conducted many of the point counts and textural characterizations, and presented the data that they collected at scientific conferences.  Along with the geology students, students and faculty from the data analytics and computer science programs also used the sample database for student research projects in these disciplines.  Two students who participated in all phases of this research enrolled in geoscience graduate programs after completing their work at SRU (one PhD and one MS).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/28/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Zieg"
