(See http://sites.lsa.umich.edu/npworkshop2016/.) The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers in nonparametric statistics, practitioners requiring these methods, and graduate students interested in this area, in a relaxed and stimulating atmosphere focused on research and applications. The development of nonparametric methods contribute to an essential part of modern data analysis and provide important research topics within statistics. Reduction or elimination of overfitting, uncontrollable biases and elevated variation through approaches supported by theoretical and numerical investigations have always been the key exercises in the field of nonparametric statistics. Exposure to and understanding of these methods are essential to practical applications and education of the next-generation statisticians. NSF funding will ensure that junior researchers are able to attend this conference.\r\n\r\nThe University of Michigan will host a conference on Nonparametric Statistics: Integration of Theory, Methods and Applications, October 5-7, 2016. Plenary speakers for the conference are Peter Bickel, Raymond Carroll, David Ruppert, and Jane-Ling Wang. The goal of the conference is to bring together researchers in nonparametric statistics, practitioners requiring these methods, and graduate students interested in this area, in a relaxed and stimulating atmosphere focused on research and applications. This award provides travel support for junior researchers to attend the conference.",
