 "awd_abstract_narration": "People use a compass to learn their direction of travel.  Such a compass works because its tiny magnetic needle aligns with the magnetic field of Earth and indicates the direction of North.  On scales much larger than Earth, our own Milky Way Galaxy also has its own magnetic field.  In fact, all galaxies in the Universe appear to have magnetic fields, and these magnetic fields can have profound effects on a galaxy's development throughout its lifetime.  Through a series of sophisticated computer simulations, this project aims to unlock the puzzling origin of the magnetic fields found in galaxies.  Upon completion this project might point to an origin of these magnetic fields that coincides with the birth of the Universe itself.  Such a result could have a profound influence on our current understanding of fundamental physics, and its pursuit serves the national interest of developing US scientific leadership in astrophysics.  This project will also strengthen the US science workforce by directly training undergraduate and graduate students in general and computational astrophysics.  Project plans also include a vigorous education and public outreach program.\r\n\r\nMore technically, observations show that galaxies have magnetic fields with a component that is coherent over a large fraction of the galaxy with field strengths of order microgauss.  These fields are assumed to be from the amplification of initial weak seed magnetic fields of unknown nature.  The two scenarios of their origin are (1) a bottom-up astrophysical one, where the needed seed field is generated on smaller scales and (2) a top-down cosmological scenario where the seed field is generated prior to galaxy formation in the early Universe on scales that are large now.  Based on current observations, this project aims to distinguish between these two scenarios.  To achieve this goal, the evolution and observational signatures of cosmic magnetic fields will be studied in different astrophysical environments such as clusters, galaxies, and interstellar medium.  Numerical simulations will model the evolution of cosmic magnetic fields in the expanding Universe with time varying dissipative properties when initial conditions correspond to the different scenarios of the magnetogenesis.  This project is divided into the following related parts: (i) theoretical studies of magnetogenesis mechanisms including the cosmological and astrophysical scenarios; (ii) numerical simulations of large-scale magnetic fields evolution to analyze whether astrophysical mechanisms can lead to extragalactic magnetic field strengths comparable with the lower bounds; and (iii) determining potentially observable signatures of cosmic magnetic fields coherent at large scales---including cosmic structure formation, microwave background fluctuations, or ultra high energy gamma-ray propagation.  The project will search for signatures of primordial cosmic magnetic fields that distinguish cosmological seeds from astrophysical sources.",

Currently two basic scenarios of seed magnetic field generation are widely considered: a astrophysical scenario, where the seed is typically very weak and magnetic field is transferred from local sources within galaxies to larger scales, and a cosmological scenario where a significant seed field is generated prior to galaxy formation in the early universe on scales that are large now. Observations of blazar's spectra indicate the possible presence of large-scale magnetic fields in cosmic voids that is challenging to be explained through astrophysical scenarios, and favors the primordial origin of the large-scale magnetic fields in the universe.&nbsp; Our major goal was to distinguish between these two scenarios. For this purpose we have performed an interdisciplinary research that includes i) theoretical studies of primordial magnetogenesis mechanisms; (ii) direct numerical simulations (DNS) of the primordial magnetic field evolution during different epochs of the universe expansion, starting from the moment of the magnetic field evolution till the present epoch; iii) development of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the primordial plasma, and associated effects, such as decay and amplification of MHD turbulence and generation of kinetic motions of plasma; iv) investigation of chiral magnetic effect in the early universe and DNS-based modeling of the turbulent chiral-magnetic cascade;&nbsp; (v) comparison of the outcome magnetic field strengths with the lower bounds of the large-scale magnetic fields imposed through the blazar?s spectra observations by FERMI and VERITAS collaborations; (vi) investigation of observable signatures of primordial magnetic fields and MHD turbulence, including cosmic microwave background fluctuations and gravitational waves; (vii) DNS of MHD turbulence in interstellar medium (ISM) in order to better understand turbulence in Milky Way Galaxy and the Galactic microwave background polarization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The interdisciplinary nature of our research have led to the results having implications in &nbsp;various fields.
