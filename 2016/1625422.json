 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project is for the University of Minnesota to acquire a next-generation electron microprobe to replace a well-used but aging 23-year-old instrument. This investment provides the newest capabilities in high-resolution mapping of elements in rocks, organic material, and high-technology materials.  This support is congruent with NSFs mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare, given the importance of expanding the frontiers of knowledge in the earth and environmental sciences, engineering, archeology, biotechnology and dentistry.  The new instrument serves a national research community as well as universities in Minnesota, western Wisconsin, the Dakotas, and Montana.\r\n\r\nThe University of Minnesota will acquire a next-generation electron microprobe, which houses multiple energy-dispersive spectrometers, including a Soft X-ray Emission Spectrometer (SXES).  The instrument means that elements can be mapped at a high-spatial resolution of 200 nanometers.  The SXES provides for a new capability in the analysis of light elements and organic matter, phosphates, carbonates, and polymers. Research programs at Minnesota that depend on electron microprobe analyses include experimental petrology, mineral and rock physics, geobiology, geomicrobiology, and bioremediation, tectonics and metamorphic petrology, mineral and rock magnetism, aqueous geochemistry, paleoclimate, and economic geology.\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award facilitated the purchase of a state-of-the-art Electron Probe Microanalyzer (EPMA), which combines scanning electron microscope imaging to characterize textures of materials at very high spatial resolution (30 nanometers) with the capability to determine their composition in the sub-micrometer range.   The EPMA is used chiefly for Earth sciences research.   Topics that are addressed include the formation and evolution of terrestrial planets (Earth, Moon, Mars), the origins of volcanos and mountain ranges, geomagnetism, the origin of economic mineral deposits, and interactions between rocks and microbial life.  The EPMA is also used in other academic physical science and engineering research, including physics, chemistry, biology, material sciences, chemical engineering, civil engineering, aeronautical engineering, and dentistry.  Additional users come from government and industrial organizations interested in topics that range from minerals exploration, remediation of mine waste and ground water contamination, and development of new biomedical devices.  \n\nThe new EPMA improves greatly on previous similar instruments.  The 3rd generation field emission electron microprobe allows highly improved spatial resolution (see figures).  The new generation of spectrometers allows quantitative analysis of elements in concentrations as low as 10 parts per million and characterization of chemical bonding between elements in compounds through the novel soft X-ray spectrometer (SXES).  It also facilitates creation of high spatial resolution (less than 1 micrometer) maps that show variations in chemical concentrations and chemical bonding.\n\n The new EPMA is used for routine analyses of natural and engineered materials, but is also used for development of novel analytical methods and tools that facilitate new applications of EPMA instruments, and these are adopted in other laboratories around the world. \n\nThe new instrument is also used for teaching and education of graduate and undergraduate students, for training of junior and senior scientists in electron microscopy and quantitative microanalysis techniques, and in outreach activities that reach the general public through museum exhibits as well as in electronic and print media.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/11/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Marc M Hirschmann"
