 "awd_abstract_narration": "This summer research program will train and mentor underrepresented minority students at the University of Connecticut Health Center (UCHC) in interdisciplinary research projects involving biomaterials, stem cells and tissue engineering strategy development for orthopedic as well as craniofacial tissues. The program is designed to provide hands-on research experience and will mentor students in scientific writing, professional development, and general communication skills. The unique structure of the training will allow undergraduate mentees to learn about medical/dental school, while obtaining research training under the guidance of a mentor. The principal investigator has a successful track record of training and mentoring underrepresented minority students and has excellent resources available to him at UCHC that would help the program to be successful.  \r\n\r\nThrough research training and mentoring, the program would enable and encourage URM students to pursue biomedical science, biomedical engineering, and physician and physician scientist careers, which in the long-term could help address workforce diversity issues in the biomedical science/engineering and related fields.",
