The goal of the event is to deepen analogies and uncover novel connections between noncommutative covering dimension (i.e., \"nuclear dimension\"), K-theory, coarse geometry, and dynamical systems. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.",

This meeting brought together experts from around the world. Indeed, there were 11 domestic universities and nine from Europe and Asia represented at the meeting. This breadth of research expertise was crucial as the topic of the meeting was an emerging new direction in the field of operator algebras. Roughly speaking, there were two broad streams of researchers: experts on the analytic side and those on the geometric side. The primary goal of the meeting was to stimilulate collaboration between these groups as recent analogies between noncommutative topological dimension on the analytic side and asymptotic dimension on the geometric side point to exciting opportunities for both camps to benefit from such cross fertilization. As part of this process, it was necessary for experts on each side to explain various results and ideas to researchers in the other camp. As such, we arranged nine lectures by eminent researchers and expositors (Marius Dadarlat, Nigel Higson, Narutaka Ozawa, Rufus Willett and Stuart White) aimed at bringing the other participants up to speed. After that a typical slate of research talks were presented. Feedback on the scientific content of the meeting was uniformly positive.
