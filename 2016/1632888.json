 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description\r\nThis project will expand and enhance the surface-water sensing capabilities across Kentucky and West Virginia, providing a foundation for understanding the impacts of agricultural and hydropower production on water quality, particularly as it relates to harmful algal blooms.  It will bring together experts in engineering and aquatic ecology, involving five research groups from three universities in the two states, jointly motivated to develop more sustainable water, food, and energy systems.   Using a surface water-quality sensing network and supporting data visualization and modeling capabilities, the project will address three research questions: 1) What are the interconnections among water quality issues relative to increasing agricultural production, changing land-use patterns, climate change, energy production, and ecosystem dynamics across Kentucky and West Virginia?s aquatic environments? 2) What are the environmental, physical, and biogeochemical features leading to water-quality changes and how might advanced technologies be applied to better understand and monitor those changes? and 3) How might modeling and management scenarios of land use, nutrient loading, and water-control systems operate in concert to reduce degradation of systems at local and basin scales?  Along with its research focus, the project will work to enhance and diversify the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce in Kentucky and West Virginia and support the professional development of early-career faculty.\r\n\r\nTechnical Description \r\nThe research team will focus on the environmental drivers associated with the formation and propagation of cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms.  Extensive in situ sensing infrastructure will be installed at two hydropower-producing water bodies and along two watersheds in regions with heavy agricultural land use.  Thirty-three new instruments will be acquired and deployed to monitor nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), inorganic carbon, dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, turbidity, conductivity, algal pigment and cell numbers, water flow parameters, and meteorology.  Cyberinfrastructure upgrades will be included to allow near real-time data collection and visualization. Analyses will focus on identifying the presence, extent, and timing of the harmful algal blooms as they relate to the measured parameters.",

CyanoHABs have become a world-wide threat to water quality, particularly in heavily agricultural areas where excess fertilizers are applied on the landscape or from poor livestock practices.&nbsp; We focused on acquisition and deployment of the newest sensor technology together with instruments to measure real-time or near real-time water quality parameters including phosphorus, nitrogen, and algal metrics in an attempt to predict where and when harmful bluegreen algal blooms (CyanoHABs) might occur. The project was led by Murray State University in partnership with the University of Kentucky and Marshall University. The collaboration included aquatic ecologists, bioengineers, and agriculture engineers. The partnership also developed a number of collaborations with Federal agencies including the US Geological Survey and the US Environmental Protection Agency.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual merit: </strong></p>\n<p>The SENSE program focused on monitoring and modeling nitrogen dynamics in small karst streams to a large hydropower reservoir to the Ohio River, the primary stream and river systems in Kentucky and West Virginia. We built off cyberinfrastructure improvements from previous awards and added new types of sensors where needed for near real-time measurements of agricultural runoff and the potential production of harmful algal blooms. Complementary monitoring platforms with continuous data streams were employed in watersheds and receiving water bodies for Kentucky and West Virginia. The datastreams facilitated measurements of biological, physical, and chemical data that have been integrated with watershed and internal process models. Instrumentation and sensing of the lower Ohio River and the Kentucky Lake reservoir demonstrated that toxic algal blooms would be rare in that part of the watershed. Sensors permitted us to predict when and where the primary fluxes may occur in smaller karst watersheds in Kentucky and West Virginia. Karst refers to soluble limestone geology that often results subterrain caves and streams. These watersheds included the mixed-use landcover Elkhorn Creek karst agroecosystem, the nearly completely agricultural Camden Creek karst agroecosystem, and the mostly forested Fourpole Creek watershed. The contrasting watershed characteristics allowed study of the influence of agricultural on karst agroecosystems and nitrogen dynamics in the broader region. Model results demonstrate that mature karst tends to retain agricultural nitrogen runoff while nitrogen quickly passes through the more porous immature karst. The differences relate to the amount and types of sediments released. Several additional sampling sites and tasks were established based on results from the initial research. We also provide a prediction of how climate change might influence nitrogen dynamics in these aquatic systems and thus the potential for harmful algal blooms. Monitoring and modeling involved undergraduate and graduate students in every phase of the research.</p>\n<p>We produced 26 peer-reviewed journal publications, 147 professional presentations, submitted 36 research and education proposals for a total of $63,367,976.&nbsp; Eight were funded for a total of $5,791,386.
