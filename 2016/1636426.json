 "awd_abstract_narration": "This program will build a state-of-the-art database and user interface for the Subaru Measurements of Images and Redshifts (SuMIRe) sky survey.  SuMIRe is a 600-night imaging and spectroscopic widefield survey currently underway using the Subaru 8-meter Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.  Broader impacts of the work involve training of undergraduate and graduate students in data processing, analysis, and management skills.  The program will recruit five undergraduates from underrepresented groups each year.  Summer workshops for students on a national basis will extend training beyond the home institutions.  \r\n\r\nThe following are major scientific goals: (1) provide a public portal to the SuMIRe survey data (images and spectroscopy) for the astronomical community, and (2) develop a processing pipeline for the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) data that is part of the SuMIRe survey.  The multi-color imaging survey will be ~1400 sq. degrees to ~26 magnitude (much deeper but over a smaller field than Sloan Digital Sky Survey); the spectroscopic survey will cover 300 nights in 2019-2024 and will be based on targets from the imaging survey.",
