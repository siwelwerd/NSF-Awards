Centers are part of complex ecosystems and vary greatly in the type of science conducted, organizational structures and expected outcomes.  The ability to realize their objectives depends on transparent measurement systems to assist in decision making in research translation.  \r\n\r\nThis research introduces a hierarchical decision model that uses both quantitative and qualitative metrics. A generalizable model is developed based upon program goals. The results are validated through consultation with experts. The method is validated using data from the National Science Foundation's industry/university cooperative research centers (IUCRC).   The methodology provides a basis for a generalizable model and measurement system that compares performance of university science and engineering focused research centers supported by industry and government.",
