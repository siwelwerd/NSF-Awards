 "awd_abstract_narration": "Administrative boundaries that establish land management jurisdictions affect both ecological and social processes. In the US, undeveloped lands occur in mosaics of public and private jurisdictions with varying management. These mosaics thus support varying regional cultures as well as natural-resources-based economies. These mosaic landscapes also support many species and are sources of ecosystem services such as pollination, carbon fixation, water supply and purification, and pest control. For differences in these mosaics, this research will determine (1) how social and ecological boundaries, fragmentation, and connectedness are related; and (2) how such partitioning affects management priorities and outcomes, including social relationships, management decision-making, landscape-scale management challenges, and ecological functioning. Results will enhance regional land management and decision making through a decision-support system shared with stakeholders so as to enhance the scientific basis of land management.  \r\n\r\nThis project will explore how administrative partitioning affects feedbacks within and between social and ecological systems. Five mosaics comprising US National Parks and adjacent parcels in the western US will be analyzed.  How complexity and differences in management across the administrative landscape affect processes and outcomes in terms of connectivity, well-being, decision-making, and cooperation in the social landscape; connectivity of habitat and processes in the ecological landscape; and feedback pathways between social and ecological landscapes will be modeled. Research activities will include (a) a focus on the influence of the management mosaic on decision-making by managers; (b) soil/vegetation/remote sensing assessment to delineate ecological boundaries; (c) novel development of landscape scale social decision-making and ecological connectivity models; (d) integration of social and ecological data into a generalizable spatial coupled systems model; and (e) an analysis of factors contributing to the success or failure of participatory processes. This research will improve understanding of how management challenges are affected by collaboration and connectivity across boundaries, the scale at which ecological divergence occurs, and factors facilitating attainment of diverse management objectives.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>Across the US, undeveloped lands are divided among a diversity of management jurisdictions. Different land management entities?federal, state, local government, or private?make management decisions that emerge out of different management missions, mandates, resource availability, and objectives. Management decisions in turn influence ecological conditions. In a series of interrelated study components, we investigated these coupled social and ecological drivers of environmental heterogeneity across landscapes, in order to understand how and when ecological and social fragmentation are predictive of one another. We tackled two primary goals: (1) to advance our understanding of the mechanisms and patterns of feedback between social and ecological systems across broad landscapes (intellectual merit); and (2) to assist managers and policymakers aiming to enhance and maintain ecological connectivity across large, multi-jurisdictional landscapes, in the face of rapid environmental change (broader impacts).</p>\n<p>We found that differential management of fire, grazing, and forest pests, as well as differential responses to disturbances in general, are related to significant changes in ecological variables in neighboring jurisdictions. Our results suggest that enhanced cooperation and coordination in management activities across jurisdictional boundaries may promote ecological connectivity and facilitate conservation of species and resources.</p>\n<p>As an example of the more detailed findings of this effort: we examined plant and soil characteristics across jurisdictional boundaries within four Protected Area-Centered Ecosystems (PACEs). Disturbances (fire, grazing, forest management) were associated with shifts in percent cover of bare ground, forbs, grass, shrubs, and trees, as well as in tree species richness, soil stability, and total carbon. We found that landscape and regional context matters: there was high PACE-to-PACE variance in effect size. We then conducted interviews and surveys with land mangers within five PACEs: Rocky Mountain National Park, Grand Canyon National Park, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Lassen Volcanic National Park, and Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park. Cooperation among private landowners was predicted by awareness of surrounding land and landowners. Private landowners reported willingness to work with public agencies, but communication barriers impede efforts. We used exponential random graph modeling to analyze coupled social and ecological drivers of wildfire governance in the Sequoia-Kings Canyon PACE. Findings confirmed that actors collaborate when gains outweigh costs; actors are likely to connect when each perceives the other to have operational capacity and useful information. We explored partnerships that have formed in response to management challenges such as forest pest outbreaks and conservation of imperiled species, learning that more complex and varied threats require more extensive and thus costly partnerships for success.</p>\n<p>To further explore the interaction between jurisdiction type and disturbance, we performed a systematic literature review combined with Forest Inventory and Analysis plot data analysis to compare disturbance occurrence, response, and tree growth rate among federal jurisdictions.</p>\n<p>The greatest diversity of responses was reported for BOR and for weather/climate disturbances. Tree growth rate was influenced by the interaction between ownership type and disturbance occurrence in Grand Canyon and Great Smoky Mountains PACEs, but not Yellowstone, Rocky Mountain, or Lassen. We next performed a novel examination of changes in fire speed across boundaries, finding significant differences in fire speed across jurisdictions varying in GAP status.</p>\n<p>Landscape-scale ecological elements that may respond to different management trajectories include fire, biological invasions, water quality and quantity, wildlife, pollution, and more.
