 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation Program (CRIF) as well as the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), Professor Robert Cichewicz from the University of Oklahoma Norman Campus and colleagues Laura Bartley, Marc Libault, Zhibo Yang and Si Wu have acquired a high resolution exact mass liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer (LCMS) with ultra performance liquid chromatograhic (UPLC) capabilities. In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex matrices. In a typical experiment, the components flow into a mass spectrometer where they are ionized into the parent ion and its fragment ions and their masses are measured. This highly sensitive technique allows detection and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. An instrument with a liquid chromatograph provides additional structural identification power by separating mixtures of compounds before they reach the mass spectrometer. The acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and research training using this modern analytical technique. It also provides training opportunities to a large number of undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students as well as high school students through a variety of internship programs, such as the STEM-to-Store Academy and Sooner Upward Bound.\r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in areas such as (a) analyzing chemical and biochemical species in single cells; (b) studying changes to the biomolecules inside of single plant root hair cells in response to environmental stresses; (c) mapping the spatial distribution of molecules in biological tissues; (d) studying the spatial distribution of metabolites of grass stems to investigate cell wall development; (e) characterizing the proteomics of regulatory networks controlling legume nodulation such as detecting the transcription factor binding partner networks involved in nodulation; (f) analyzing the metabolites of plant stem cell wall synthesis and regulation; (g) analyzing the proteomics of fungal secretomes for biomass degrading enzymes and (h) quantifying the diversity of the fungal natural product chemosphere.",
