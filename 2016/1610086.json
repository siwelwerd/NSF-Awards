 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists and science educators have emphasized the vital role that reasoning with analogies plays in innovation, making new discoveries, and advancing science. Chemists are adept at using such analogical reasoning to make connections between observations that can be made with the senses (macroscopic level), the behavior of submicroscopic particles such as atoms and molecules, and the various representations used in chemistry. However, many chemistry students struggle with making these connections in college courses, and this creates a barrier to their learning. The CORE learning cycle (Chemical Observations Representation Experimentation) is designed to provide an environment where students can develop their analogical reasoning skills in a sequence that mirrors the process of experimentation and discovery. A main goal of CORE is to support the development of strong analogical reasoning skills in a way that fosters the connections between macroscopic, submicroscopic and representational domains. Another key goal is to foster the integration of strong analogical reasoning into the experimental design process and in construction of scientific arguments. This project will investigate how students use analogical reasoning in constructing scientific arguments related to chemistry laboratory work and how repeated exposure to CORE experiments influence students' abilities to coordinate their ideas across macroscopic, submicroscopic, and representational levels. Thus, it has the potential to provide undergraduate students with the skills needed to be successful in participating in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in the future.\r\n\r\nThis NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE: EHR) project will gather critical evidence to better understand how to develop undergraduate chemistry students' analogical reasoning skills and help students coordinate ideas across macroscopic, submicroscopic, and representational levels. The research will investigate student participation in CORE learning cycles over a series of five CORE experiments. The underlying frameworks embedded in the CORE learning cycle are based on Structure Mapping Theory and the Teaching-with-Analogy model. Two research questions will be addressed: (1) How do students use analogical reasoning in constructing scientific arguments related to chemistry laboratory work? and (2) How does repeated exposure to CORE experiments influence students' abilities to coordinate ideas across macroscopic, submicroscopic, and representational levels? Students' laboratory work will be analyzed to assess their understanding of analogical reasoning, their appreciation for the limitations of analogies, and the quality of students' scientific arguments. An adaptation of Toulmin's model of argumentation will be used to assess the quality of students' scientific arguments. The three-year project will involve 32 student participants per year and will engage a K-12 science teacher each summer to adapt CORE experiments for K-12 classrooms. The project will contribute new knowledge to inform both science education researchers and STEM instructors about ways to foster analogical reasoning skills and coordination of ideas across macroscopic, submicroscopic and representational levels.",
