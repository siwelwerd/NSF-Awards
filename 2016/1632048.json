 "awd_abstract_narration": "Extreme floods have significant societal and environmental impacts in arid/semi-arid regions. However, these extreme floods occur only rarely in these dry areas. Because they are rare events, it is a challenge to understand the root causes for these floods and to determine ways to prevent adverse impacts. In this study, flood response in a different watersheds in the Southwestern US and Israel will be examined and properties of extreme floods in the two study regions will be compared. Examining different watersheds in two geographically distinct settings will allow the investigators to better understand the physical mechanisms controlling extreme floods in arid/semi-arid regions. Results obtained from this research will be of significant interest to a wide range of users, including emergency management offices, regional planning programs and flood forecasting offices.  \r\n\r\nThe upper tail of flood peaks for the Southwestern United States and Israel will be examined through a combination of empirical and numerical modeling studies and through development and implementation of new stochastic methods for rainfall and flood frequency analysis. The research activities will center on analyses of extreme floods from approximately 50 watersheds in the two study regions. Central to the analyses will be the application of high-resolution radar observations to examine rainfall variability in time and space for convective rainfall in the Southwestern US and Israel.  The principal questions that will be addressed in this study are: 1) How does extreme flood response in arid/semi-arid watersheds depend on temporal and spatial variability of rainfall rate? 2) What are the characteristic patterns of storm structure and evolution for extreme flood-producing storms in arid/semi-arid regions? Do they vary with storm and watershed type? 3) What are the characteristic features of arid/semi-arid regions in terms of extreme rainfall and flood patterns? 4) Are extreme floods in arid/semi-arid regions associated with distinctive \"mixtures\" of flood generating mechanisms? 5) What is the \"nature\" of the upper tail of rainfall and flood magnitudes in arid/semi-arid watersheds?",
