 "awd_abstract_narration": "Stigmatization appears across human societies, yet our scientific understanding of who is stigmatized, and why, is still incomplete. One reason people may stigmatize is that they perceive others to threaten their freedoms, values, health, safety, or resources. When people perceive a group to pose one of these threats, they feel negative prejudices (e.g., anger and fear) and actively discriminate (e.g., via expulsion and avoidance). Considerable evidence supports this threat-based perspective. However, accumulating findings suggest that stigmatization can also occur without negative prejudice and active discrimination. Sometimes, people simply fail to attend to and remember members of certain devalued social groups, and may feel indifferent toward them. This \"social invisibility\" does not have the negative emotion and discriminatory behavior of threat-based stigmatization, but may nonetheless be consequential, as it could lead a stigmatized person to be passed over for promotions and recognition; to not be seen as a viable friend, romantic partner, or teammate; or to be passively excluded from social situations. It is thus important to understand such social invisibility. The investigator, Rebecca Neel (University of Iowa) introduces an innovative theoretical perspective that can account for both invisibility and threat-based forms of stigmatization. The Affordance Management approach suggests that people attend to aspects of their social environment that offer them opportunities to act (affordances) in the course of striving to reach particular goals. Thus social invisibility emerges when a person is perceived as irrelevant, rather than as a threat, to important goals like staying safe, finding a romantic partner, or finding a job. That is, people focus their attention and emotion on others who may impact important goals, and as a consequence fail to attend to those they perceive as irrelevant to current concerns. \r\n\r\nAcross nine studies, the proposed research employs eye-tracking technology, memory tests, and an indirect measure of emotion to examine novel hypotheses about when different forms of stigmatization emerge. Some theoretical perspectives suggest that only certain groups will experience social invisibility. In contrast, these studies test the hypothesis that anyone may be socially invisible depending on the context. Sometimes individuals of a certain gender, ethnicity or other group membership may be subjected to social invisibility, whereas other times they may be stigmatized as a threat. In addition, studies test whether indifference and inattention can emerge from comparative processes: Whether a particular person is socially invisible may depend on whether they seem more or less goal-relevant than nearby others. As part of the research the investigator develops new face stimuli varying in race, gender, and age. Relatively few face stimuli of Asian and Black older adults are currently available to the scientific community. The stimuli will be made publicly available to other researchers to support future work on attention, emotion, and judgment of older adults. Furthermore, beyond building a foundation for understanding these dual forms of stigmatization and when each will emerge, the project may set groundwork for tailored interventions to address and reduce these dual forms of stigmatization.",
