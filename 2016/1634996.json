 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the winters of 2013/14 and 2014/15 the Northeast Pacific experienced the warmest ocean temperatures ever recorded in this region. The warm water mass anomaly spread initially throughout the Gulf of Alaska region and later reached the North American coast, covering an area larger than the size of the continental United States. This prolonged multi-year ocean extreme caused dramatic changes in the marine ecosystems including bird and mammal die offs, and harmful algal blooms that contaminated shellfish across Washington, Oregon, and California. The atmospheric changes associated with this extreme event were also implicated in the 2014/2015 strong drought conditions over western North America. The research proposed here is to diagnose the mechanisms underlying the generation and persistence of ocean temperature extremes ('ocean heat waves') in the Northeast Pacific, and to investigate whether these events will become more intense under greenhouse forcing. This proejct will provide a broad range of interdisciplinary scientists with new understandings of the dynamics controlling the 2014/15 North Pacific warming, and of its possible links to climate change. Project investigator Di Lorenzo has acted and will continue to act as interdisciplinary communicator to bridge the climate, physical and biological oceanography communities by making the results of this research available to marine ecosystem scientists through his ties to the California Current Ecosystem LTER (long-Term Ecological Research) and the PICES (North Pacific Marine Science Organization) community. Given the strong interest of resource managers and public in the 2014/15 North Pacific extreme, the principal investigator will compile a set of outreach videos to explain the findings of this research to a broader non-scientific audience. These videos will be posted on the project website and advertised through social media. The model and analyses data will be made available through the Georgia Tech data server and the project website. The project will support the training of female graduate student.\r\n\r\nBy diagnosing the basin- and regional-scale forcing dynamics of multi-year ocean temperature extremes, this project will develop a mechanistic framework to understand the generation, persistence, and evolution of ocean extremes in the Northeast Pacific. This mechanistic framework will not only allow us to interpret the dynamics of recent climate extremes in the Northeast Pacific, but will also provide a physical basis for understanding how such climate extremes will evolve under greenhouse forcing. This proposal aims at (1) diagnosing the basin- and regional-scale mechanisms underlying the generation and persistence of ocean temperature extremes in the Northeast Pacific, including the role of tropical/extratropical climate teleconnections and Pacific decadal variability, and (2) investigating whether there are physical links between these multi-year ocean extremes and greenhouse forcing. The primary tools for this investigation will be observational reanalysis datasets from operational meteorological centers like National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) and the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), sensitivity simulations with the NCAR Community Earth System Model (CESM), and the CESM Large Ensemble (LE) data. The CESM ensemble will allow us to clearly separate the internal vs. the anthropogenic-forced changes in North Pacific climate variance, and quantify its significance. Guided by our diagnostic understanding of North Pacific climate in the CESM-LE analyses, we will explore whether our findings are robust across a select set of climate models used for the fifth assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), using both control and carbon-forced simulations available in the Climate Modeling Inter-comparison Project 5 (CMIP5) archive.",

Through a series of data and numerical modeling analyses, this research identified the key mechanisms that lead to the formation and evolution of these prolong ocean extremes, and how their behavior is influenced by anthropogenic forcing. Specifically, it was found that large-scale atmospheric teleconnections to and from the equatorial Pacific are important for sustaining the North Pacific extremes for periods longer than 1-year. These two teleconnection pathways were further explored and summarized in the attached figure. The first teleconnection, referred to as the Meridional Modes dynamics, is initiated in the central and eastern North Pacific by a reduction in the off-equatorial trade winds. This reduction in winds causes the ocean to warm because of lack of evaporative cooling, which in turn weakens even more the surface winds creating a positive feedback. The positive feedback drives a coupled ocean-atmosphere modes that propagates along the meridional axis and results in the generation of surface temperature positive anomalies in the central tropical Pacific. When the anomalies reach the equator, they favor the development of the El Ni?o Southern Oscillation, which in turn drives the second large-scale teleconnection from the tropics back into the North Pacific. This two-way coupling, which on average takes about 1.5-2 years, was shown to provide the dynamical memory that makes the North Pacific warm extremes so persistent from one year to the next. By combining experimental, modeling data, and theory, we showed that this coupling is becoming stronger as the earth surface is warming and is creating more frequent prolonged warm events.
