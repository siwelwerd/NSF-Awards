No longer is our primary concern non-polar compounds that persist and bioaccumulate, but the inventory of organic contaminants has expanded greatly to include many polar and ionic compounds with potential adverse ecotoxicological effects. This study offers an innovative approach to adapt computational chemical tools to the prediction of organic ligand sorption to metal oxides.\r\n\r\nThe proposed approach represents a transformative advance in the quantitative a priori prediction of sorption coefficients for polar and ionic compounds in the environment. The integration of molecular dynamics calculations to obtain quantum mechanics measures of van der Waals, electrostatic energies and solvation effects overcomes the challenge of deconvoluting coupled structure effects from experimental measures of sorption energies alone, is at the current state of the science. Furthermore, other related sorption problems provide opportunity to expand Linear Interaction Energy approximation techniques because environmental sorbent characteristics are more generalizable than protein binding site characteristics. The overarching hypothesis of the project is: that changes in organic ligand structure by the addition/removal of non-ligand group substituents impart regular changes in sorption free energy as a result of coupled hydrophobic, electronic and proximity (i.e., steric and chelation) effects that are in turn mediated by solvent effects. The ultimate goal is to quantitatively describe organic ligand sorption to oxides as a function of specific sorbate structure criteria. A novel approach is used to identify structural criteria by bridging well-established experimental techniques with innovations in computationally relevant environmental surface chemistry, and by using the representative soil oxide, goethite. Task 1: The goethite force field will be fine-tuned using density functional theory to determine accurate compound conformations for a library of test sorbates. The chosen library includes sorbates with incremental changes in structure that allow us to identify the influence of specific ligand and non-ligand structural moieties. Computational efforts will be validated by infrared spectra to delineate binding mechanisms and transmission electron microscopy to identify relevant crystal faces. Quantum mechanics calculations will be used to calculate free energies of the inner sphere complexation reaction. Task 2: Experimental measures of sorption energies, infrared spectra and goethite measures will be obtained for test sorbates sorbed to high purity goethite. Task 3: The Linear Interaction Energy approximation will be used with molecular dynamics simulations and Task 1 force fields and inner sphere binding energies to calculate van der Waals and electrostatic contributions to overall sorption free energies. Linear Interaction Energy offers significant reductions in computational cost because molecular dynamics simulations are conducted only for the bound and unbound states. van der Waals and electrostatic energies will be regressed against experimental measures of sorption free energies to generate a predictive model for sorption coefficients. Findings from Tasks 1-3 will be integrated to identify how specific structural features can be linked to regular changes in van der Waals and electrostatic energies, thereby indicating structure-sorption relationships relevant to quantitative models. The PIs will mentor graduate and undergraduate researchers through the processes of experimental design, manuscript preparation and national professional society presentations. They will also work closely with high school students and teachers to introduce sorption concepts into public education with hands-on demonstration modules of everyday applications: home drinking water treatment and pesticide application. The PIs will continue their committed record of engaging student researchers from groups underrepresented in the sciences and engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nEnvironmental fate evaluations of polar and charged organic compounds (e.g., pharmaceuticals, surfactants and pesticides) are limited by the lack of suitable models to predict their interactions, or sorption, with environmental solids.  One important characteristic of such models is the extent to which they capture the influence of compound structure on coupled electronic and hydrophobic sorption interactions.  The goal of this project was to examine whether tools from computational biochemistry could be adapted to address this gap in environmental chemistry knowledge.  The research strategy used both experimental measures of sorption coefficients for groups of organic compounds with related structures and substructures and computational biochemistry tools to model the atomistic interactions of charged compounds with representative surfaces of important environmental solids. \n\nThe original application of this research was toward the prediction of potentially negatively-charged organic compound (ligands) sorption to metal oxides.  Compounds with structures related to hydratropic acid that interacted with iron oxides by electrostatic interactions showed sorption coefficients to increase linearly with compound concentration.  The magnitude of the sorption coefficients followed trends of structural substituents having more strongly electron-donating characteristics to have larger sorption coefficients.  Compounds with structures related to salicylic acid that interacted with iron oxides by forming stronger complexes at the solid surface showed sorption coefficients to become smaller with increasing compound sorption, indicating specific interactions at a limited number of surface iron oxide sites.  For these compound types, sorption coefficients followed trends of increasing magnitude with substituents having more strongly electron-withdrawing characteristics.  Application of computational biochemistry tools to interpret these trends was delayed beyond the project duration by collaborator availability.\n\nTo meet the project goal, a second application of this research was directed toward the prediction of positively-charged organic compound sorption to organic matter.  Compounds with structures related to benzylamine showed increasing extents of sorption with groups that were substituted on the ring structure, and decreasing extents of sorption with groups that were substituted on the nitrogen group of the amine structure.  A computational biochemistry tool of the class known as \u2018docking models\u2019 was applied to interpret the observed trends in experimental sorption coefficient measurements.  Docking models were able to predict overall trends in sorption by calculating the individual contributions to sorption interactions &ndash; electrostatic, hydrogen bond and van der Waals interactions and desolvation changes.  Calculations of the individual sorption interactions confirmed that sorption interactions arise from coupled contributions of each of these interactions.  This outcome explains why experimental measures of sorption energies alone &ndash; the current state of the science &ndash; are not sufficient to de-convolute coupled structure effects for the development of predictive sorption models for positively-charged compounds.  This work showed that docking models represent a transformative advance to make a priori predictions of compound sorption to environmental solids.\n\nThe broad impacts of this research project addressed both scientific findings and training advances.  The findings extend the knowledge base of cationic organic compound sorption to environmental solids and provides mechanistic insights into the differences in sorption coefficient trends for organic matter solids, compared to previous research for aluminosilicate clay solids.  The personnel trained in advanced graduate degrees through this project were all from groups underrepresented in engineering.  Additionally, outreach demonstrations on water treatment at the ASCE Central Ohio STEM Expo targeted K-8 students from school districts with a large fraction of students of color.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/26/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Allison Mackay"
