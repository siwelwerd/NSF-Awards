 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project examines the usefulness of the Open Researcher & Contributor ID (ORCID) as a method for identifying journal article authors, and as a basis for detecting emerging scientific topics studied by these authors.  Authors of scientific works may use non-standard ways of reporting their names and affiliations in journal articles and other publications, change affiliations over their careers, or have names that are similar to those of other authors.  Such variations can make it difficult to correctly match authors with their publications and institutional affiliations.  Against an assortment of government or publisher registration methods and machine learning approaches to deal with these problems, ORCID stands out for its potential to extend across methods and nations with its open source approach.  Improved capabilities for identifying authors are vital in studying scientific mobility, networks, the contribution of authors to the emergence of new scientific topics, and other subjects in the Science of Science and Innovation Policy domain.  More needs to be understood about the strengths and weaknesses in ORCID coverage by country, field, and other areas for it to be useful in Science of Science and Innovation Policy studies.\r\n\r\nThe project uses two bibliometric methods to examine ORCID usage over time and by author characteristics.  First, the project uses comparative sampling by disciplinary area, and considers ORCID coverage within country, organization, and citation distribution categories in these disciplinary areas. Second, the project investigates the potential of ORCID in identifying emerging science-driven technologies by employing it in the development of an emergence indicator based on a semi-automated numerical scoring system.  The emergence indicator is designed to take topical terms with recent, sharp increases in publication and/or patent activity and examine them in the context of identified scholars to potentially highlight concentrations of research and development activity on emergent fields of science and technology.  The resulting intelligence is intended to be useful in informing government, commercial, and academic analyses of leading-edge players and other contributors to rising science and technology domains.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nScientific publication is the main vehicle for distributing research findings.  This project addressed two complementary information elements to 1) help identify authorship and 2) distinguish content of research publication records.  Both serve to facilitate further analyses of scientific contributions. \n\nFirst, we assess the extent of use, over time, of the Open Researcher &amp; Contributor ID (ORCiD) by studying large samples of publication records in the Web of Science (WoS).  Figure 1 sketches the actions involved in linking authors? ORCiD?s to particular WoS records. The figure shows the complexity and variety in approaches, some automated and some manual, for ORCiD IDs to get into a WoS record.\n\nSecond, we advance measurement of cutting edge research content by designing and trialing ?tech emergence indicators.?  Those indicators distinguish terms or topics whose use in a set of research abstract records meets criteria of novelty, persistence, and community, and shows accelerating growth.\n\nFigure 2 illustrates the use of emergence scoring to identify ?players? (countries, organizations, or individuals) most active in publishing on emergent (cutting edge) topics.  In this case we searched for, downloaded, and cleaned WoS records treating ?non-linear programming.?  The Figure plots a scattergram of countries? publications on this topic (horizontally) vs. their normalized emergence scores (vertically) for a 10-year period (2003-2012).\n\nWe label two countries to offer an interesting comparison.  The USA published the most papers (~300) on non-linear programming; Iran published the fourth most (~110) in the period studied.  However, Iran?s fewer papers showed a higher concentration on the highly emergent topics in non-linear programming.  One could go further to examine particular American or Iranian organizations and authors to identify leaders based on this measure of emergence.\n\nR&amp;D emergence indicators provide a complementary metric to established measures, including funding level, publication activity, and citations received by those publications.  Emergence offers an added dimension in ascertaining what is cutting edge research and who are the key players pursuing that research.\n\nOur research findings were disseminated via eight journal articles and several conference presentations.  Notably, we organized five sessions at the 2017 Portland International Conference on Management of Engineering and Technology (PICMET).  Discussions there led to the organization of a contest to devise alternative emergence indicators conducted in 2019.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/06/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan L Porter"
