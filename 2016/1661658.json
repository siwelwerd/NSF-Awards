 "awd_abstract_narration": "A remarkable aspect of algebraic number theory lies in the connections it finds between objects that appear to be of entirely different natures.  The overarching principle of the research of the PI is that certain algebraic problems can be reinterpreted directly as geometric problems in higher dimension, providing fascinating connections between objects from different parts of mathematics.  A great wealth of such connections have been found indirectly through intermediate objects of an analytic nature.  The research outlined in the proposal aims to provide a window through which well-known conjectures and statements of arithmetic may be seen in a new and more direct light.\r\n\r\nThe PI has conjectured an intricate but explicit relationship between modular symbols and the arithmetic of cyclotomic fields that may be viewed as refining the Iwasawa main conjecture.  Roughly speaking, this conjecture identifies class groups of cyclotomic fields with quotients of homology groups of modular curves by actions of Eisenstein ideals.  The central project of the award is the extension of this conjecture to higher dimensions and other global fields.  The expectation is that the geometry of locally symmetric spaces should explicitly determine the arithmetic of lattices in Galois representations, which is to say the structure of Selmer groups.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award funded research of the PI in the area of mathematics known as algebraic number theory.  Algebraic number theory concerns the solutions of polynomial equations in a single variable with coefficients that are rational numbers. The solutions to these equations give rise to large sets of complex numbers known as number fields on which one can perform standard arithmetic operations, thus generalizing the rational numbers. Each number field contains a ring of integers, much like the rational numbers contain the usual integers. There is, however, a notable difference in that these rings of integers may not enjoy the property of unique factorization that the usual integers enjoy.  An algebraic object called the class group measures the failure of this unique factorization. \n\nThere are many interesting families of number fields, and of even more general fields.  Among them are the cyclotomic fields, which are obtained by considering numbers that can be formed out of the rationals and some root of one inside the complex numbers.  The class groups of these fields have been studied since the mid-1800s, which is a mark of both their significance and their mysterious nature.  The prior research of the PI unveiled a deep, unexpected connection between the class groups of cyclotomic fields and another class of objects known as modular curves.  These complex \"curves\" are really surfaces formed from the upper half plane of the complex numbers by identifying certain points that are taken to each other by M&ouml;bius transformations of the upper half plane.  Moreover, the PI made two conjectures regarding the very specific nature of this connection.  Subsequent work of T. Fukaya or K. Kato proved one of the PI?s conjectures and also that another is true if a certain hypothesis one expects should always hold is satisfied.\n\nIt became clear early on that analogues of the PI?s conjectures should be expected to hold in a more general context than the original setting.  However, even the formulation of such analogues presented a significant challenge.  Moreover, the PI also enivisioned the formulation of refinements of the original conjecture and of the exploration of certain applications in its original context. That is, the PI's opened up a new and rather vast program of study, in which many researchers have since engaged.\n\nFor the award, the PI worked on numerous avenues of study, both alone in and in collaboration with several groups of researchers, to carry out the PI?s research program.  For instance, the PI, together with Fukaya and Kato, improved one of the results of Fukaya-Kato on the PI?s conjectures.  They also wrote a paper that suggested a broad greater framework for such conjectures.  They began to develop the framework more concretely in a vast but distinct setting, i.e., for analogues of number fields known as function fields.  This work led them to construct compactifications of analogues of modular curves in this new setting, which is very roughly to say that they showed how to fill in certain holes in the latter spaces.\n\nDuring the course that the original award was held at both U. Arizona and then subsequently transferred to a new award at UCLA, six Ph.D. students graduated under the PI?s direction.  Their research explored different directions within and outgrowths of the research program of the PI and contributed substantially to the award?s results.  The PI also gave numerous talks at workshops and in seminars, including a major lecture series for which the PI wrote lecture notes on the PI?s research program and worked with a team of graduate students on projects of the PI?s design.  The PI also wrote hundreds of pages of hyperlinked lecture notes on various topics of fundamental importance for mathematics graduate students, especially those planning to do research in algebra and number theory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/28/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Romyar T Sharifi"
