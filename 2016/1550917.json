 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientific drilling and coring is crucial for the advancement of the Earth Sciences. Vast\r\nresources have been invested in drilling and coring operations around the world: on land,\r\nin the oceans, and in the polar regions. The return of these investments must be maximized\r\nby ensuring optimal access and re-usability of the data generated through drilling and coring\r\nprojects.\r\n\r\nThis project, Open Core Data (OCD), is a next-generation approach to data management that will \r\nopen vast stores of existing and future geoscience data to new and innovative scientific use by \r\nradically improving discoverability, accessibility, citability, preservation, and integration \r\nof data from past, current, and future drilling and coring projects.\r\n\r\nResearch objectives of the International Ocean Discovery Program and Continental\r\nScientific Drilling communities provide impressive examples of the breadth of scientific\r\nthemes that drilling and coring helps address, ranging from the nature of the deep biosphere\r\nand oceanic sub-seafloor, to understanding environmental change, species evolution, fault\r\nzone dynamics, magmatism, and tectonics, among many others. The scientific potential enabled\r\nby OCD is therefore large and expected to impact many geoscience domains. OCD will form the\r\nnucleus of a federated data infrastructure that will support entirely new scientific approaches\r\nand lines of inquiry by facilitating integration of continental and marine data for synthesis\r\nstudies.\r\n\r\nOCD will align with NSF data policies to provide open access to all scientific drilling data.\r\nBoth research and the process of transferring data to archives for permanent curation will\r\nbe simplified and streamlined through this effort. Open Core Data will structure and integrate\r\nscientific drilling data optimally to enable data-driven science that faces substantial barriers\r\nat present related to data heterogeneity in discovery, access, and formats. Open Core Data\r\nwill enable geoscience domains that utilize scientific drilling and coring in their workflows\r\nto come closer to realizing the full potential of their data, and to make their own unique\r\nnew contributions that benefit science and society as new research is enabled.",
