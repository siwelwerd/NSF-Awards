 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this (CAREER) project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Michael K. Brown of the Department of Chemistry at Indiana University is introducing new methods for the catalytic construction of carbon-carbon bonds, which is an important objective in modern organic chemistry.  The overarching goal of this research is to utilize inexpensive copper (Cu)-catalysts to assist in the synthesis of useful molecules such as new pharmaceutical agents.  This new catalytic method promotes sustainability by using first row (non-precious metal) copper catalysts.  Such catalyst are more abundant, less toxic and less environmentally harmful than precious metal catalysts.  The educational goal is accomplished by developing engaging chemistry-themed classroom activities and by evaluating, improving and replicating a permanent chemistry-themed exhibit at a children's museum recently developed by the Brown Lab.  These activities introduce and connect a known concept, smell, to something unknown, chemical structure.  Professor Brown's efforts meet two needs in science education: development of chemistry-themed exhibits at science museums, and introduction of chemistry to children at a young age.\r\n\r\nProfessor Brown is developing two general classes of Cu-catalyzed methods for carbon-carbon bond formation: 1) Suzuki-Miyaura-type cross-coupling reactions, and 2) Suzuki-Miyaura-type cross-coupling reactions that are interrupted by an alkene.  Implementation of these methods enables chemists in academia and industry to access complex molecular scaffolds that were previously difficult to prepare.  The impacts and intellectual merit of these studies are expected to be the following: 1) introduction of inexpensive, sustainable Cu-catalysts for Suzuki-Miyaura-type cross-couplings, 2) discovery of new methods for the functionalization of readily available unactivated alkenes, and 3) uncovering new modes of reactivity with Cu-catalysts. This research promotes sustainable chemistry by using first row (non-precious metal) copper catalysts.  The educational goal is accomplished by developing fun and engaging organic chemistry-themed classroom activities and by evaluating, improving and replicating a permanent organic chemistry themed exhibit at a children's museum recently developed by the Brown Lab.  These activities introduce and connect a known concept, smell, to something unknown, chemical structure.  As the educational component of his project, Professor Brown is developing materials that educate children in grades K-6 about very basic concepts related to molecular structure and organic chemistry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nDuring the course of this award, we have made several contributions to the field of organic chemical synthesis.  Early studies focus on the development of Cu-catalyzed cross coupling reactions.  These efforts were aimed at not only replacing precious metals, such as Pd, but also uncovering complementary reactivity.  Additional studies on Cu-catalyzed cross coupling led to the development of a conjunctive process that combines indoles, boronates and propargyl alcohols.  Finally, these studies have led to the introduction of a new type of Cu-catalyst, specifically a Cu-pyridylidene.  This catalyst has much broader impact to the community as it appears to have superior reactivity to more commonly used complexes.  The intellectual merit of these studies is in achieving a greater understand of the mechanism of Cu-catalyzed reactions.\n\nIn a separate area of research, we have developed boron enabled cycloaddition reactions.  Early work focused on [4+2]-cycloaddition reactions, with an emphasis placed on the development of enantioselective variants.  Here were introduced a novel chiral auxiliary.  Additional studies led to the development of [2+2]-cycloaddition reactions.  The broader impact of these efforts is that they lead to the synthesis of saturated carbocyclic boron compounds which are of high value in the construction of complex molecules.  The intellectual merits of this research program is that boron can now be viewed as activator for cycloaddition processes. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael K Brown"
