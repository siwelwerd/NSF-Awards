 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation (MRI) and Chemistry Research Infrastructure and Facilities programs, Professor YuHuang Wang from the University of Maryland College Park and colleagues Janice Reutt-Robey, Lawrence Sita, Chunsheng Wang and Liangbing Hu have acquired an atomic force microscope system. In an AFM a laser beam is directed to a surface by means of a cantilever and tip. As the cantilever is displaced by interacting with the surface, a reflection of the laser beam is displayed on a detector (photodiode). In this way an image of the surface can be created with the aid of an electronic system. In general, an AFM has three major abilities: force measurement, imaging, and manipulation. The microscope is an important tool in the investigation of the surfaces of materials. It is used in fundamental and applied research to study morphology of surfaces, surface imaging and functionalization, electrical, magnetic, chemical and mechanical properties of surfaces. This knowledge enables advances in developing better materials in fields such as nanoscience and energy science. The instrument is used in the research and training of undergraduate and graduate students preparing them for technical careers and opportunities for advanced education.   \r\n\r\nThe proposal is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels, especially in: (a) studying nanoparticle transport and internalization at model interfaces, (b) probing quantum defects in low-dimensional carbon materials, (c) mapping peak current and peak force of carbon nanoparticles in covetics, (d) imaging small circuits on glass, (e) studying living polymerization and direct assembly of precision polyolefins, (f) assessing the integrity and stability of xeolite membranes, (g) understanding and tailoring designing of solid state interphases for nanostructured silicon electrodes and (h) studying solid electrode interface formation, structure and evolution of molybdenum disulfide.",
