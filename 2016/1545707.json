 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the 11th International Conference on Computability, Complexity, and Randomness, held on the campus of the University of Hawaii at Manoa during January 4-8, 2016. The conference features invited talks, contributed talks, and a tutorial. The conference covers topics such as computability theory, computational complexity theory, algorithmic randomness, and interactions between logic and analysis. Participants may submit abstracts for talks which upon acceptance by the program committee may be presented at the conference. Selected papers based on the talks will be published in a post-conference journal volume. The conference organizers are committed to helping to advance the careers of young researchers, women, and minorities in mathematics. Priority for financial support to attend the conference will be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to faculty at smaller institutions who do not have other sources of financial support.\r\n\r\nThe CCR conference series has become a fixture in the community of algorithmic randomness researchers since its inception in 2004. Many of the most prominent workers in this field make a habit of attending it most years. The conference promotes applications of algorithmic randomness and computability theory in other areas of mathematics, and in other disciplines such as statistics, economics, and finance. The invited presentations provide a platform for the latest developments in the field. Moreover, the contributed talk session gives graduate students and young researchers an opportunity to expose themselves to the most recent research trends and present their own work, thereby contributing to their training and professional development. Financial support to attend the conference will preferentially be given to graduate students, postdocs, women, and minorities, as well as to junior faculty who may not otherwise be able to attend the conference.\r\n\r\nThe conference website is located at http://math.hawaii.edu/wordpress/ccr-2016/",
