 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Idaho State University medium-energy nuclear physics group will conduct several key measurements at Jefferson Lab using high-energy electrons to precisely probe the underlying substructure of nucleons, where a nucleon is a proton or neutron, and they will make fundamental measurements on how force and matter interrelate.  The group seeks to understand the nature of the strong and weak nuclear forces and how these forces govern the nucleon's constituents (quarks).  Due to these forces, protons and neutrons are arranged slightly differently inside large nuclei as evidenced by neutrons tending to occupy the outer layers of heavy nuclei, with the protons being closer to the center.  The group will lead an experiment to probe this outer neutron skin by making use of telltale signatures of the weak force in scattering electrons off complex nuclei.  This issue further bears upon the structure of neutron stars.  The group will also determine the precise and accurate diameter of the proton, where there are currently several conflicting measurements.   This group has a strong tradition of bringing undergraduate and graduate students into their research program. \r\n  \r\nThe CoPIs in this proposal are all co-spokespersons on experiments at Jefferson Lab to perform measurements on the underlying symmetry and structure of the quark and gluon components of the nucleon, the size of the proton, and the characteristics of the skin or surface of a nucleus. Dr. Tony Forest is continuing a measurement of the down quark fractional polarization in the nucleon to test predictions of pQCD via JLab experiment E12-06-109. Dr. Philip Cole is co-spokesperson on E12-09-003, an experiment that will measure the change of the dynamical quark mass as well as the nature of the nucleon structure and internal quark interactions as the probe's distance scale enters a regime that directly accesses quarks decoupled from the meson-baryon cloud.  Dr. Cole is also a collaborator on the ELSA experiment BGO-OD, which will anchor N* measurements at the q2=0 point.  Dr. Mahbub Khandaker will conduct a high-precision measurement of the proton charge radius&#8232;in experiment E12-11-106 to resolve a current discrepancy between the proton radius extracted from muonic and electronic hydrogen experiments. Dr. Dustin McNulty is continuing his work using parity violation to precisely measure the neutron skin of lead and calcium to test nuclear model predictions of the difference between the radii of protons and neutrons in a heavy nucleus, E12-12-004.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPI McNulty:  This award supported the precision electroweak measurement programs PREX-2/CREX and MOLLER at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (Jefferson Lab) in Newport News, Virginia.  The Pb Radius Experiment (PREX-2) and the Calcium Radius Experiment (CREX) completed data collection by September 2020; two of three planned publications from this work have been submitted to Physical Review Letters.  This award also supported the continued development of the MOLLER project at Jefferson Lab -- a search for potential physics beyond our current understanding through a precision measurement of the weak-nuclear charge of the electron.  The MOLLER experiment is now a fully funded project and is scheduled to start installation and commissioning in 2025.  Two Ph.D. students and two M.S. students earned degrees from Idaho State University (ISU) based on this work and were partially funded by this award.  In addition, several undergraduate ISU STEM students contributed to this work and gained valuable research experiences that propelled them into graduate school or industry careers.\n\n\nThe PREX-2 and CREX experiments used parity violation in electron-nucleus scattering to measure the neutron radius of Pb-208 and Ca-48 nuclei, respectively, with statistics-dominated uncertainties at the few percent level.  Nuclear theory predicts that for large or complex nuclei, neutrons organize themselves into spatial distributions with larger radii compared to the protons, thus creating a pure neutron skin layer on the outer nuclear surface.  Measuring this skin thickness has broad applications throughout the physics community -- from fundamental nuclear structure to neutron star astrophysics.  Nuclear electric-charge (or proton) radii have been known with precision for decades from conventional electron scattering experiments.  Taking the difference between our novel neutron radii measurements and the known proton radii allows a direct extraction of the neutron skin thicknesses.  Our measurements indicate a relatively thick neutron skin for lead and a thin skin for calcium.  This award provided support for the design, construction, and testing of the main integrating focal-plane detectors used during PREX-2 and CREX as well as several other auxiliary detector systems: SAMs, A_Ts, and GEM particle trackers.\n\nThe MOLLER experiment at Jefferson Lab aims for an ultra-accurate measurement of the weak-nuclear charge of the electron through parity violation in electron-electron (Moller) scattering.  The theoretical prediction for this quantity, given known physics, is extremely precise; any significant difference between the theoretical prediction and the MOLLER measurement result could indicate the presence of as yet determined particle interactions (new physics).  This is relevant for dark matter searches and is complementary to the discovery potential at the Large Hadron Collider.  This award supported the design, construction and testing of prototype Shower-max detectors as well as the continued development and use of a detailed Monte Carlo simulation (using GEANT4) to advance the MOLLER experimental design.  One of my Ph.D. students is now a postdoctoral researcher on MOLLER at Virginia Tech.  \n\nCo-PI Cole    This  research program is a study of the fundamental properties and structure  of nucleons by using a beam of linearly-polarized photons and/or  polarized electrons at Jefferson Lab and at ELSA.

We have made significant progress on delineating the behavior of photoproduced omega meson in the nuclear medium and how baryon resonances from bound protons are distorted in the presence of a nearby neutron.   \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dustin E Mcnulty"
