 "awd_abstract_narration": "Wildlife are fed by humans intentionally or accidentally all over the world. This common activity can change wildlife physiology and behavior, intensify human-wildlife interactions, and influence human health through the transmission of infectious disease. This research will examine how feeding wildlife influences the spread of infectious disease, focusing on vampire bats and rabies virus. It will develop models that can a) forecast the future spread of rabies when livestock rearing expands into undisturbed habitats and b) predict human and animal rabies risk in areas undergoing rapid land conversion. Results could alter societal views on activities ranging from bird feeders to ecotourism and will directly improve predictions of the spread of a lethal disease. The project will support education and training of a doctoral student in modern molecular biology techniques and will develop new tools for evaluating disease in bats. \r\n\r\nThe research will integrate observed relationships between livestock abundance, antiviral immunity, and bat dispersal between colonies into mathematical models of rabies transmission. Earlier research showed that livestock rearing is associated with higher chronic stress, lower antibody levels, and larger vampire bat colonies, suggesting that livestock rearing produces source populations of immune-impaired vampire bats. The first research goal will use novel immunological tools on field-collected samples to characterize expression of antiviral cytokines of vampire bats across a livestock density site gradient in two regions. These data will be used to test if bats in livestock-dense habitat invest more or less in responses that promote resistance to rabies virus. The project's second goal will use molecular genetics approaches to characterize the connectivity of bat populations at fine spatial scales through field-collected tissue samples. Results will determine whether or not bat movement varies with livestock distribution. Finally, the researchers will develop a spatially explicit mathematical model of rabies transmission that incorporates results from the first two goals to provide a mechanistic framework for understanding how resource heterogeneity affects viral spread.",

Growing evidence suggests that food resources provided to wildlife can have far-reaching and often complex effects on the transmission and impacts of infectious diseases. For example, wildlife can aggregate around food sources and experience higher rates of exposure to pathogens through decreased movement and crowding. On the other hand, well-fed wildlife can mount more robust immune defenses to guard against infection. Because resource provisioning often brings wildlife, humans, and domestic animals into close proximity, studies of wildlife-pathogen responses can help predict pathogen exposure risks for humans. This project focused on vampire bats in Latin America to ask how human-provided resources affect bat ecology, immunity, and infection. Increased livestock rearing in recent decades has provided blood-feeding vampire bats with an abundant food source that contrasts with less abundant naturally occurring wild prey. Given that vampire bats can transmit rabies and other pathogens to humans and livestock, understanding how increased bat feeding on livestock influences viral transmission and immunity carries economic and public health implications. This research examined how livestock rearing influences (1) bat antiviral defenses, (2) spatial movements of bat populations, and (3) the spatial spread and persistence of rabies virus in a given landscape.

The investigators developed a general mathematical model to describe the transmission of rabies in response to changes in bat movement and immune defense in the context of livestock rearing. Results showed that both antibacterial humoral responses and antiviral immune genes were upregulated in bats from high livestock areas, consistent with prior findings of greater innate immune defense in bats feeding on livestock, and indicating that livestock rearing may enhance bat resistance to rabies virus. Population genetic work showed that bat connectivity was similar for high versus low livestock sites, suggesting that livestock feeding has limited consequences for bat dispersal or that effects occur at a geographic scale that cannot be detected with currently available molecular markers. A general mathematical model showed that human-provided food can increase the spread of infection when infected animals are poor at dispersing, in part by generating more dispersers (e.g., by increasing birth). A rabies-specific mathematical model, parametrized using laboratory and field data, will evaluate model output against observed rabies serology data to ask how shifts in bat immunity and movement affect rabies risks. Finally, results showed moderate to high prevalence of two bacterial pathogens (<em>Bartonella </em>and hemoplasmas) across vampire bat populations, and suggested that livestock abundance predicts lower infection by one (<em>Bartonella</em>) but not the other (hemoplasmas) pathogen type, potentially owing to changes in antibacterial immune defense.</p>\n<p>This project supported the training of PhD student Daniel Becker, who developed skills in transcriptomics and population genetics, in addition to mathematical modeling.
