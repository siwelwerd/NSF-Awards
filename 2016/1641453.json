 "awd_abstract_narration": "\r\nThis is a proposal to conduct an oceanographic research cruise on the R/V Atlantis dedicated\r\nto leadership development for 24 Early Career Scientists (ECS). Novel to this proposal are\r\nthe use of the National Deep Submergence Facility assets Alvin and Sentry, research telepresence between the Inner Space Center (ISC) University of Rhode Island and R/V Atlantis, and a science communication component. Mentors include four senior scientists with extensive experience\r\nin deep-submergence science and one science communications expert. Key development objectives for the ECS include experience in i) planning and executing collaborative, interdisciplinary\r\nresearch, ii) leadership in cruise and dive/mission planning and execution, iii) integrating instrumentation with Alvin/Sentry/other deep-submergence assets; iv) telepresence-enabled data acquisition and seafloor-to-ship-to-shore communications, v) data management, sharing, reporting, and vi) science communication and outreach to broader audiences.\r\nIntellectual Merit :\r\nThe deep-ocean remains largely a hidden library of knowledge for us to probe and understand,\r\nand deep-sea ecosystems and ecosystem services remain poorly understood even as they are increasingly subject to anthropogenic change through resource extraction, waste disposal, acidification,\r\nwarming, etc. For the US to remain a leader in deep-ocean science, there is need to train\r\nthe next generation of leaders in deep-ocean research. This proposed effort builds on recent\r\nshore-based leadership development efforts, including the 2015 Alvin New Users Workshop and\r\nannual DeSSC (Deep Submergence Science Committee) workshop for early-career scientists.\r\nBroader Impacts :\r\nThe proposed cruise will benefit 24 early-career scientists with interests in deep-ocean research using National Deep Submergence Facility assets, providing them with experience in pre-cruise and at-sea leadership and decision-making, ship and shore practice in telepresence-enabled research, and science communication, as well as post-cruise follow-up opportunities. Participants should attain an enhanced ability to prepare competitive proposals to lead shipboard science\r\nand have expanded their interdisciplinary network. Outcomes from the program will be reported by participants at the annual early-career workshop and DeSSC meeting, may be reported at\r\na special session at the fall AGU meeting, and disseminated in on-line documents on DeSSC webpages, and elsewhere. Basic assessment tools will document learning outcomes and inform subsequent deep-submergence training programs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn 2011, the University National Oceanographic Laboratory System (UNOLS) introduced Chief Scientist Training Cruises to engage Early Career Scientists (ECS) and new users with leadership responsibilities of multi-disciplinary science at sea (Reimers &amp; Alberts 2012).  In support of this engagement with ECS and new users, a roadmap for oceanographic expeditionary planning (DeSilva &amp; Girguis 2014) is available on the UNOLS website.  In addition, an on-shore ?Alvin New Users Workshop? was convened at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) in September 2015 (12 participants) and focused on capabilities, sampling, and proposal strategies, with dive simulations for recently graduated PhDs and post-docs, most with limited exposure to deep-submergence field experiments.  The UNOLS Office maintains a longitudinal record of UNOLS-supported oceanographic trainees and their subsequent engagement in oceanographic research proposals and expeditions. \n\nThe Deep-Submergence Science Committee (DeSSC) initiated an ECS program in 2012, and has convened 4 workshops for ECS/New Users as an extension of its fall meeting.  These workshops focused on deep-sea research, grant writing, technology, data management, etc.  As a result of this and other DeSSC efforts, including the recent DESCEND 2 workshop that solicited participation by ECS, there exists a cohort of ECS and new users well aware of deep-submergence assets and capabilities and who are informed about priorities for research in the deep sea.   Until this project, there had been no at-sea leadership development opportunities for ECS using National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF) assets.  \n\nSeparately, NSF has supported exploration of new approaches to telepresence-enabled oceanographic research, and the deep-submergence science community has been a major player in this effort, including the TREET program (Transforming Remotely-Conducted Research through Ethnography, Education, &amp; Rapidly Evolving Technologies) led by C German (WHOI).  This is the first engagement of ECS in a telepresence-enabled research program.\n\nIn this EAGER program, we conducted a research and training cruise for Early Career Scientists.  Novel to this program were the use of the NDSF assets Alvin and Sentry at sea, research telepresence between the Inner Space Center (ISC) University of Rhode Island and R/V Atlantis, and the explicit inclusion of a science communication component.
