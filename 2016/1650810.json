 "awd_abstract_narration": "Harmonic analysis studies how signals (functions) break up into a superposition of basic harmonics--signals with a well-specified duration, intensity and frequency--and how operations (filtering) applied to these components affect the reconstructed signal. Variants of this time-frequency decomposition process are performed in countless real-world applications, such as audio or image compression and filtering, image pattern recognition, data assimilation and denoising.  One of the broad objectives of this project is the  investigation of the theoretical feasibility threshold of the time-frequency techniques in terms of the relative size and smoothness of the input. An analogous procedure is adopted in tomographic imaging, where a solid body is reconstructed by means of sampling its density along penetrating waves, mathematically described as lines in three-dimensional space.  This project will study mathematical toy models of sampling along lines or curves, whose theoretical understanding may play a significant role in the derivation of improved analytical image reconstruction methods.  An integral component of the project is the training of graduate and undergraduate students within the active research group in harmonic analysis at Brown University, with the particular intent of attracting young and promising researchers to the field.\r\n \r\nThe central objects of study of this project are modulation-invariant singular integrals and their behavior at or near the boundary of their known boundedness range. The model question, involving Carleson's maximal partial Fourier sum operator, is the characterization of the sharp integrability order sufficient for the almost-everywhere pointwise convergence of the Fourier series of a periodic function. The second, deeply related question concerns the extension of the Lacey-Thiele Holder-type estimates for the bilinear Hilbert transform to the boundary of the known range. Together with his collaborators, the principal investigator has recently obtained the current best results for both problems, relying in particular on a newly developed Calderon-Zygmund decomposition adapted to the modulation-invariant setting. It is expected that further developments of this technique will lead to additional improvements  towards the solution of these two central questions, as well as of other significant open problems. A standout question is the extension of the known uniform estimates for the bilinear Hilbert transform to the full expected range of exponents, completing the original program of Calderon for the boundedness of the first commutator. Another central direction of the proposed investigation is the study of singular integral operators with rotational symmetries, a prime example of which is the Hilbert transform along a smooth vector field in the plane, by means of multiparameter time-frequency analysis techniques. Further improvements of the aforementioned techniques are also expected to impact on several questions concerning summability of multiple Fourier series.",
