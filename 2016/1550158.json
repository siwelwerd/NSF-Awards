 "awd_abstract_narration": "The propensity for fault zones to become long-lived zones of weakness that can be reactivated during geologic history plays a significant role in the migration of fluids in Earth?s crust and formation of hydrocarbon, economic mineral and ground water resources, seismic hazards, and the evolution of mountain belts. From 160 to 50 million years ago, the western U.S. was tectonically similar to modern day western South America, which is characterized by high elevation mountains (the Andes) that formed in the continental crust above an actively subducting oceanic plate.  When subduction ceased along western North America, a new regime of widespread crustal extension began, resulting in localized exposures at the surface of deep levels of the ancient mountain belt. This project will examine the Funeral Mountains in Death Valley National Park, which the principal investigators hypothesize records the cycle of mountain building followed by extension.  In particular, they hypothesize that the same fault (a thrust fault) initially responsible for substantial burial and thickening of the crust was reactivated twice during the exhumation of the rocks to the surface. They further argue that the reactivation of thrust faults may be a common phenomenon in the western U.S., explaining many similar occurrences in other mountain ranges. Rocks in the Funeral Mountains are ideal for testing this hypothesis due to excellent exposures and abundant rocks suitable for study.  This project will accomplish many benefits to society as identified by NSF: (1) helping the U.S. maintain competitiveness and leadership in the global Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) workforce; students who participate in the project (three graduate students and five undergraduates) will develop high-level expertise and teamwork experience in a STEM discipline; (2) increased public scientific literacy by dissemination of findings to the academic community through presentations at professional conferences and publications, and to the general public and Death Valley enthusiasts by presenting at meetings of the Death Valley Natural History Association, the Las Vegas Natural History Museum, and the Nevada Geological Society; (3) development of research partnerships between two universities as part of collaborative research efforts, and the development of research infrastructure at each institution; and; (4) the investigators seek to engage the full participation of women and underrepresented students in STEM education through targeted recruiting efforts.\r\n\r\nReactivation and tectonic inheritance are long-recognized phenomena, important to our understanding of how the continental lithosphere deforms. The thesis of this proposal is that many Tertiary detachment faults and shear zones in the western US reactivate faults or sub-planar zones of earlier deformation. The Funeral Mountains metamorphic core complex of the Death Valley region represents an ideal locality in the Sevier-Laramide hinterland to evaluate the role of tectonic reactivation in the development of metamorphic core complexes, as well as to resolve important details regarding the tectonic history that predates Tertiary extension. We hypothesize that the Boundary Canyon detachment fault, which underwent greater than 40 kilometers of top-the northwest slip in the Miocene, formed as the last reactivation of a major Jurassic thrust of opposite slip that was responsible for deep burial and regional metamorphism of the footwall. We propose a multi-faceted approach to evaluate the hypothesis of protracted tectonic reactivation through detailed studies along the metamorphic and strain gradient that includes: (1) field mapping and structural analysis, (2) petrographic, microstructural, and kinematic analyses aided by Electron Backscatter Diffraction analysis of quartz-rich rocks, (3) applying petrochronology (Laser Ablation Split Stream Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry) to date accessory minerals (metamorphic titanite, monazite, xenotime, and zircon overgrowths) and Lutetium-Hafnium dating of garnet in garnet amphibolites, and (4) determining the metamorphic conditions and prograde pressure-temperature paths to evaluate the prograde burial history, possible grade discordances across major shear zones, and the regional thrust-induced paleodip. Recognition of tectonic reactivation has important implications for understanding the older Jurassic and Cretaceous history of the Sevier-Laramide orogen, the magnitude and distribution of contraction and extension that occurred during orogenesis, and the episodic nature of post-orogenic extension.",

Despite their commonality, there is much debate regarding how they form as their orientation is not predicted by traditional concepts of fault mechanics. This project investigated whether the Miocene Boundary Canyon detachment fault in the Funeral Mountains metamorphic core complex in Death Valley National Park reactivated a Jurassic thrust that developed during an earlier period of mountain building. The Funeral Mountains expose Proterozoic rocks that experienced systematic spatial changes in depths of metamorphism from 30 km in the northwest (Monarch Canyon) to 17 km in the central part of the range (Indian Pass). The project determined that in the Middle Jurassic the rocks were buried during thrusting along the Funeral thrust, and were exhumed by two major extensional events, the first in the Late Cretaceous (83-70 Ma) and the second in the Miocene (11-7 Ma). \n\nMiddle Jurassic thrusting is recorded by the metamorphism and deformation of Proterozoic rocks, coupled with radiometric dating.  Studies of garnet schist revealed an early increase in pressure at near constant temperatures during metamorphism, recording rapid thrust burial. Ages of metamorphism were determined using the radioactive decay of naturally occurring Lutetium, which is incorporated into garnet in trace quantities during growth. Garnet that grew during increasing pressure yielded an age of 167 Ma.  Additionally, we analyzed and dated numerous tiny grains of the mineral monazite using laser-ablation mass spectrometry.

Trace abundances of heavy rare earth elements in monazite can be used to infer whether monazite grew during garnet growth, after garnet growth, or as garnet was being resorbed.  The results show that garnet began growing at about 168 Ma. Field and petrographic structural studies revealed that metamorphism was concurrent with a previously unrecognized top-southeast shearing event that is interpreted to represent the movement direction of the hanging wall of the Funeral thrust.  \n\nA shear fabric with top-NW kinematics progressively overprints the Middle Jurassic top-SE thrust fabrics towards the NW.  We determined the age of this fabric by dating the mineral titanite in high-strain rocks by laser techniques using the decay of Uranium to Lead, which yields ages ranging from 77 - 80 Ma.  We have indirectly substantiated this age through a laser-ablation mass spectrometry study of monazite in rocks in Monarch Canyon below this shear zone.  Monazites show changes in heavy rare earth element abundances with age that are consistent with the breakdown of co-existing garnet during decompression, from 86 to 72 Ma, consistent with expectation of the exhumation of rocks from below an extensional shear zone.\n\nLower temperature extensional shear associated with the (11-7 Ma) Miocene Boundary Canyon detachment fault is restricted to weaker rocks at higher levels within the shear zone, with Cretaceous shear preserved in stronger rocks and at deeper structural levels.  The Boundary Canyon detachment, which only omits &lt;2km of stratigraphic section yet places lower greenschist facies rocks over middle amphibolite facies rocks, took advantage of the tilt of the metamorphic rocks in the footwall of the Funeral thrust in its localization.  \n\nThe project also made advances in the utilization of techniques useful for evaluating metamorphic pressures in garnet-bearing rocks.  We evaluated the efficacy of determining pressures of metamorphism from differences in elastic properties between quartz inclusions and garnet hosts (QuiG barometry) by comparing QuiG pressures determined on 250 quartz inclusions in garnet hosts in samples from the Funeral Mountains (and the Wood Hills in eastern Nevada) to pressures determined using traditional thermodynamic methods that assume chemical equilibrium.  Comparison of the two methods of metamorphic pressure estimation showed that QuiG pressures are generally 2-4 kbars higher than thermodynamically determined pressures. The explanation for the difference is elusive, but includes the possibility of non-equilibrium compositions in garnet developing due to overstepped nucleation. Inclusion pressures were also determined by synchrotron X-ray diffraction, which reproduced QuiG pressures determined from Raman Spectroscopy, bolstering confidence in the QuiG method.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/02/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael L Wells"
