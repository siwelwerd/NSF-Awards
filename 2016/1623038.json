 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\nNon-Technical:\r\nTwo dimensional semiconductors show great promise for optoelectronic applications, due to a myriad of highly attractive properties, however, to date they have shown tremendously poor photoluminescence quantum yield. High quantum yield is a requirement for materials used in optoelectronic devices such as light emitting diodes, lasers, and solar cells. \r\nThis EAGER project addresses the quantum yield issue of transition metal chalcogenides (2D material). The PI has demonstrated that the surface defects of MoS2 (2D material) can be repaired/passivated through surface chemical treatments. As a result; the quantum yield can be enhanced from less than 1% to over 95%. The work outlined in this EAGER will seek to demonstrate a functional electro-optic device based on a high quantum yield 2D monolayer.\r\n\r\nTechnical:\r\nThe figure of merit for materials used in optoelectronic systems is their photoluminescence quantum yield (QY). This determines the efficiency of light emission from a population of optically or electrically generated electron hole-pairs and is critically dependent on the defect density/type in the material. Final QY values dictate key performance metrics such as the power consumption in LEDs, threshold currents for semiconductor laser, and the upper limit of open circuit voltage in solar cells. \r\nTwo dimensional (2D) semiconductors, suffers from very poor quantum yield (<1%). Recently the PI?s group has addressed this problem of low QY in 2D materials and developed a chemical treatment procedure using an organic super acid which is able to enhance the QY in the most heavily studied 2D system: MoS2 from an initial value <1% in the as exfoliated case to over 95%.\r\nThis work shows that the procedure is stable in ambient and does not change other key properties in the material (such as crystal structure, band gap, electrical properties, etc.). The detailed mechanism of the treatment need to be fully understood for this result to realize its full impact. \r\nThe PI will address many of these key questions, focusing on: (i) obtaining high QY for additional 2D materials such as WS2, and ReS2 via exploring and optimizing additional chemicals and optimizing the existing treatment procedure for different materials. The demonstration of an optoelectronic device using this technology, specifically a 2D LED, with a high QY will be demonstrated.\r\nThis project will involve one graduate and one undergraduate student; the training and mentoring of the undergraduate student in particular will be emphasized. The nature of the proposed work is interdisciplinary and spans the fields of chemistry, materials science, and device fabrication.",

In this work, we demonstrate for the first time a two-terminal monolayer thick light emitting device with millimeter dimensions capable of high-level bipolar carrier injection <em>via</em> a single Schottky barrier contact to the semiconductor, independent of the contact quality or polarity. Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have been established as a promising class of materials for future optoelectronic devices such as large-area transparent displays. TMDC monolayers have naturally terminated surfaces and can exhibit near-unity photoluminescence quantum yields in the presence of suitable defect passivation, without the need for cladding layers. However, a key issue to date for optoelectronic devices based on TMDCs has been the lack of ohmic contacts to both electrons and holes. Ohmic contacts to both carrier types are typically a requirement for high-performance light-emitting diodes, however are challenging to achieve in practice. This is particularly true in the case of monolayer semiconductors, which show significant Schottky barriers at metal-semiconductor junctions.</p>\n<p>We overcome this fundamental challenge by leveraging transient-mode device operation. Utilizing monolayer TMDCs in this dopantless device, an AC voltage is applied to a gate electrode to generate alternating electron and hole populations in the thin semiconductor film. Crucially, this operation mechanism bypasses the parasitic series resistance of the Schottky contact <em>via</em> large tunneling currents present during the AC transients. In addition to a detailed study of the physics and operational principals of this device, we also demonstrate its versatility and simplicity. While previous demonstrations of electroluminescence in TMDCs have been limited to single devices at the micron scale, we achieve a 7-segment display and a 2 mm ? 3 mm device which is transparent in the off-state and bright in ambient room lighting. This is the first demonstration of light emission based on a monolayer semiconductor that is bright enough to be captured by a simple hand-held camera (various videos are supplied) in ambient lighting, achieving a long-term goal of this rapidly growing research field. The facile carrier injection technique described here can be leveraged in wide-bandgap semiconductors where achieving ohmic contacts is challenging. One of the notable advantages of this device structure is that the light emitting surface is directly exposed, meaning that it can be readily integrated with optical structures such as photonic crystal cavities. Finally, this device structure is considerably simpler than other previously reported devices to realize electroluminescence in 2D materials. This work represents a fundamental breakthrough in the development of optoelectronic devices with important scientific and practical implications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/29/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Ali&nbsp;Javey</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1623038/1623038_10416679_1553724971312_Fig.4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1623038/1623038_10416679_1553724971312_Fig.4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Seven-segment display and millimeter-scale t-EL device\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1623038/1623038_10416679_1553724971312_Fig.4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Seven-segment display and millimeter-scale t-EL device\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">a Optical microscope image and b, PL image of a 7-segment t-EL display. c, 7-segment display showing EL in the shape of C-A-L. d Schematic of a mm-scale device. e, f Photograph of a packaged device. g Photograph of a mm-scale transparent device. h, i Photograph of large area transparent device.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Ali Javey</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Ali&nbsp;Javey</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Seven-segment display and millimeter-scale t-EL device</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1623038/1623038_10416679_1553723387728_Fig.1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1623038/1623038_10416679_1553723387728_Fig.1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Transient EL in TMDCs.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1623038/1623038_10416679_1553723387728_Fig.1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Transient EL in TMDCs.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">a Schematic of the t-EL device.
