 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award, the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Chemistry Division is funding Professors Stefan Franzen and Reza Ghiladi of the North Carolina State University to study the conversion of pollutants to less harmful products.  The conversion is done using  naturally occurring enzymes found in a segmented worm that lives in shallow coastal waters. The project provides a better understanding of how we can use naturally occurring processes to create technologies for environmental restoration. The research also gives fundamental insight into how proteins can have more than one function in living organisms. The project provides outreach to middle school science classrooms with demonstrations, lectures, and lessons plans for teachers on the chemistry of life processes through the \"Creating STARS\" outreach initiative. Professors Franzen and Ghiladi also promote the mentoring of high school students in summer-long internships through Project SEED. \r\n\r\nThe protein known as dehaloperoxidase-hemoglobin (DHP) is a recent example of a multi-functional protein that challenges many of the assumptions behind the structure-function correlation in enzymes. While structure is clearly related to function, Professors Franzen and Ghiladi are investigating whether structure uniquely defines function. Research on DHP suggests that structure does not uniquely define function, at least within the scope of the heme protein function. DHP was initially identified as a dual function protein capable of both oxygen transport and the enzymatic dehalogenation of halophenols as a natural function. DHP has been recently shown to also possess peroxygenase, oxidase, and oxygenase activities. TDHP represents an ideal platform for testing whether the structure-function paradigm too closely associates protein structure with a single function. It may be revealed that the classic view of protein structure may be too narrow to capture all functions a protein may possess. The focus of the research is a combined structural, spectroscopic and mechanistic (kinetics) study that elucidates the specific set of substrate/inhibitor interactions and dynamics changes for each of the four known functions of DHP.",

These systems provide many new and exciting opportunities to apply chemical principles to investigate biomolecular processes. One such example can be found in structural biology, where it is generally assumed that the function of a protein is closely linked to its three-dimensional molecular structure. This protein structure-function paradigm enables scientists to predict how a protein will perform based upon its structure, and underpins many of the advanced tools that scientists use to interrogate protein function. For proteins such as hemoglobin or the P450 enzymes found in the liver that have important pharmacological activities, this structure-function correlation is key to understanding their role in the chemistry of life processes. When a foundational principle such as the structure-function correlation fails for a specific protein, however, there is an urgent need to explore why, as it highlights that our understanding of such systems is still incomplete.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merits.&nbsp;</strong>The protein structure-function correlation has been built from decades of study of primarily monofunctional systems, but whether (and how) structure uniquely defines function in multifunctional systems is a significantly more complex subject to address. This complexity is easily seen within the heme protein superfamily, where functions as diverse as O<sub>2</sub>-binding, oxygenase, oxidase, peroxygenase, and electron-transfer all occur at active sites that often contain a surprising number of similarities, both structural and mechanistic, but where the protein environment exquisitely controls the chemical reactivity of the heme group to ensure maximum intended function with a minimum of unintended cross reactivity. Understanding how Nature controls functional selectivity (?activity differentiation?) across the heme protein superfamily has been a longstanding question that penetrates to the core of the protein structure-function correlation. Despite decades of study, a challenge remains to fully understand the factors in a multifunctional system that influence a reactive heme intermediate between, as just one example, peroxygenase (oxygen atom transfer) and peroxidase (electron transfer) activities.</p>\n<p>Our work has focused on the enzyme dehaloperoxidase (DHP), a multifunctional hemoglobin from the marine worm&nbsp;<em>Amphitrite ornata</em>. DHP has been shown to possess four additional activities necessary for the survival of <em>A. ornata</em> (peroxidase, peroxygenase, oxidase and oxygenase), all of which employ a common active site. From the research performed in this NSF award, we showed that substrates trigger changes in the DHP protein structure that lead to different aforementioned activities. In a paradigm shift away from the traditional protein structure-function correlation, we have found that the substrate itself, and not the protein structure, plays a pivotal role in determining which enzyme activity is performed by DHP. We have termed this the Substrate Directed EnzymatiC Activity paRadigm (\"SiDECAR\"), and have now hypothesized that this new paradigm may be a common feature of a number of enzymatic hemoglobins. Given that it is capable of the five major activities associated with heme proteins within a single active site, DHP is a prime example of a multifunctional protein that can advance our understanding of the structure-function correlation beyond what has been built from decades of study of monofunctional proteins, namely how the substrate itself can direct the enzyme?s function.
