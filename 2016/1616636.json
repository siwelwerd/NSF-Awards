 "awd_abstract_narration": "Scientists from the University of Virginia and Northern Kentucky University will work together to count how many stars in the Milky Way galaxy exist in pairs. Using an instrument that splits the light from each star into a \"spectrum\" they will show if each pair is made up of large or small stars, hot or cold stars, old or young stars. With this information astronomers can better understand how stars form in the Milky Way, and how important being a member of a pair can be to the birth of planets. The light from over 163,000 stars will be analyzed over a three year period by graduate and undergraduate students from each university. The data will be obtained using the Sloan Foundation Telescope at the Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico and the Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile.\r\n\r\nThis is a collaborative proposal between Steven Majewski of the University of Virginia (UVa) and Nathan De Lee of Northern Kentucky University (NKU). Together with graduate and undergraduate students at both universities, these researchers propose to analyze Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) radial velocity survey data of 163,000 stars spread throughout the galaxy (disk, halo and bulge) to search for companions to stars with a broad range of stellar spectral types, metallicities, and ages. They will exploit data acquired as part of the SDSS-III/APOGEE-1 high-resolution IR spectroscopic survey, which has already observed over 14,000 stars in multiple (dozens of) epochs. The proposers will complement these data with a new survey, SDSS-IV/APOGEE-2, to extend temporal baselines and the number of observed sources. Their goal is to determine the frequency of companions as a function of host star chemistry, dynamics, evolutionary stage, position in the Milky Way, and environment. They also propose follow-up near-IR speckle interferometric observations of a sample of targets using a new speckle camera on the WIYN telescope, which they plan to build with funds from this award. A pilot spectroscopic survey based on APOGEE-1 data has already produced samples of stellar, brown dwarf, and hot Jupiter companions in a few hundred systems. Dr. Majewski is the PI of both the APOGEE-1 and APOGEE-2 projects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMost of what we know about the multiplicity of stars and the nature and distribution functions of their stellar and substellar (planet, brown dwarf) companions comes from observations of stars in the solar neighborhood.  Much less is known about such companions in other parts of the Galaxy (e.g., distant parts of its disk, halo, and bulge), in populations of much different metallicity and age, and in environments differing in the density of stars and dark matter (DM). Moreover, most studies of companions have focused on main sequence stars; much less is known about the distributions of companions of stars in other evolutionary stages.  Finally, very little of our census of the properties stellar companions and their hosts has been based on large, systematic, and unbiased samples of stars, and ones that include high quality information on the abundances of multiple chemical elements.\n\nThis project was meant to redress many of these shortcomings via a systematic survey of stellar companions across all major Galactic stellar populations and environments for samples of many tens of thousands of stars by exploiting data from the APOGEE and APOGEE-2 surveys of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).  APOGEE is a large-scale, high resolution spectroscopic survey of Milky Way stars, and the first conducted at infrared wavelengths, which allows it to sample stars that are typically obscured at optical wavelengths by dust obscuration in the Galactic midplane.  The high spectral resolution means that APOGEE is able precisely to characterize the temperatures, gravities (i.e., evolutionary state), chemical compositions, and Doppler velocities of stars.  Together, the APOGEE surveys sampled about ? million stars, with most stars observed multiple times over the decade span of APOGEE observations; the latter allows a uniquely large variety of stellar companions to be discovered in the APOGEE star sample via wobbles the companions induce in the measured Doppler velocities.  For stars having many APOGEEepochs, the orbits of the companions were able to be determined.\n\nThus, APOGEE provides a grand opportunity to conduct a variety of studies of stellar companions, and we have exploited this resource for that purpose.  For example, we combined APOGEE with GALEX and Gaia space mission data to create a large, systematic survey of main sequence stars in compact binary systems with white dwarf companions, many for which we calculate orbital periods.  This large, homogeneously surveyed database provides constraints on the evolution of compact binaries.  We were also able to conduct large statistical surveys that showing the strong influence that stellar chemistry, particularly the abundances of \"alpha-elements\" like C, O, and Si, have on the propensity to form multiple star systems, as well as the influence of close binary companions on the rotations of stars, with those rotations also measured using the APOGEE spectra.  We have also discovered and explored compact binaries containing red giants in symbiotic states of mass transfer onto companions, publishing several papers about such systems lying in Milky Way satellite galaxies.  We also explored \"wide binaries\", systems where both stars can be individually measured by APOGEE, Gaia, etc., and used the combined data to show that, based on chemistry, the components of wide binaries have a common origin, and also how these components can themselves have companions in compact orbits, including planets.  For example, we discovered two quadruple systems where each wide binary star has its own orbiting planet, which represents an order of magnitude increase in the known examples of such hierarchical systems. \n\nAPOGEE observations of known planet hosts identified by the Kepler and TESS satellites were also exploited for a variety of studies.  For example, the first ever measurements of the correlation between planet occurrence and APOGEE-derived chemical abundances were made for ten different elements (C, Mg, Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Mn, Fe, and Ni), and these show increases in Super-Earths, but a higher increase in Sub-Neptunes, as the host star chemistry increases for any of these elements.  A correlation between orbital period and host star chemistry was also found where small exoplanets orbit statistically more-enriched host stars for planets with periods less than 8.3 days.  APOGEE data were also used to characterize a number of interesting individual Kepler and TESS systems over the course of the grant period.  \n\nOver the full time period this grant was active, the work it supported led to 53 publications, 35 of these in refereed journals, and contributed to the training of no less than five graduate student, four undergraduate student, two post-baccalaureate, and one postdoc participants at the University of Virginia.  The participants have used the knowledge gained from these studies to guide the selection of targets for the Radial Velocity Companions program of SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, which will continue to expand these studies forward into the next decade.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/16/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Steven R Majewski"
