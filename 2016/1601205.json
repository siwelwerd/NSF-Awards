 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participants at the Macaulay2 Development Workshop, May 7th-10th, 2016, at the University of Utah.  Macaulay2 is one of the world's leading open source software systems devoted to supporting research in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers in these fields to develop new packages and functions that utilize Macaulay2's existing functionality to perform computations essential for research in algebra and geometry. These are then made available for use by other mathematicians throughout the world.  Many of the current Macaulay2 packages were started at, or greatly enhanced by, work at workshops such as this one. More information is available at the conference website\r\nhttp://wiki.macaulay2.com/Macaulay2/index.php?title=Utah2016_-_Main_Page\r\n\r\nThis workshop is designed to help guide researchers, including graduate students and faculty members at both research universities and 4-year colleges, in the development of packages for Macaulay2.  This will be done by having groups of participants consisting of a mix of experienced and novice members work intensively on developing packages.  Many of these packages will eventually be integrated into Macaulay2, with some of those also going through a peer-review process at the Journal of Software for Algebra and Geometry.  These packages can then be used by researchers throughout the world.",
