 "awd_abstract_narration": "Part 1: Non-technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe International Congress on 3D Materials Science (3DMS) is the premier forum for presenting research regarding the newest advances in three dimensional characterization, visualization, quantitative analysis, modeling, and investigation into the structure and structure-property relationships among materials.  The Third International Congress on 3D Materials Science (3DMS 2016) will bring together researchers, professionals, and engineers and provide multiple settings for presentation, discussion, and networking. This atmosphere will facilitate rich interactions between the experimentalists, modelers, and computational and image processing experts who attend.  Research within the 3DMS community gives rise to unprecedented advances in materials science and engineering applications. 3DMS 2016 is the environment for leaders in this field to showcase their research, interact with their peers, and hold important discussions to continue to advance the state of 3DMS research. It is the goal of the organizers to ensure a high quality conference that holds a strong international presence and aims to highlight the important advances in 3DMS research on a global scale. As with previous 3DMS congresses, student participation is greatly encouraged in order to give students exposure to recent advances in this field. This meeting is open to all interested individuals and will attempt to provide the most advanced technical meeting possible, with a mixture of attendees from research, industry, and educational professions.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2: Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nThe field of 3DMS has revolutionized materials characterization and has enabled the examination and modeling of 3D microstructures, which is critical to understanding and predicting materials processing-structure-property relationships in 3D. As with previous iterations of the event, all materials classes will be considered as part of the congress. In particular, metallic materials have greatly benefitted from 3D characterization, analysis, and modeling and research in this area will be presented along with additional materials classes such as polymers, ceramics, and composites. Morning sessions will run in parallel, with two sessions on similar topics following an all-conference plenary session of invited speakers. Evening sessions will be single-session. This format provides the optimum balance of breadth of information with depth of discussion and interaction opportunities. All types of research institutions (academia, government, and industrial research laboratories) will be represented. This meeting is open to all interested individuals, with a mixture of attendees from academic research, industry and educational professions, representing both senior and junior investigators, post-doctoral trainees and students. The six overarching topical areas proposed for this international congress include: experimental techniques for 3D data acquisition, image processing and digital representation of 2D and 3D microstructural data, process?microstructure-property relationships in 3D, advances in reconstruction algorithms, advances in 3D materials modeling, and future directions and challenges for 3D materials science.",

The three dimensional (3D) structure of various materials can be characterized in a number of ways with different tools and techniques.  3DMS 2016 was the premier forum for scientists and engineers from a variety of backgrounds representing industry, academia, and government laboratories to discuss cutting edge research on a variety of materials types.  It provided professionals at different stages in their careers  the opportunity to engage in quality interactions with their peers.  In addition, the organizing committee heavily promoted the participation of students in order to expose them to this dynamic field.  This meeting was open to all interested individuals and attempted to provide the most advanced technical meeting possible. 179 attendees met to discuss modeling, experimental and computational techniques, image processing, and data collection among other topics.  A closing panel discussion allowed international experts to interact with attendees to discuss the most challenging problems the 3DMS community faces and some potential pathways forward for how to address them.  The potential impact from the 3rd International Congress on 3D Materials Science (3DMS 2016) and its outputs are predicted to reach a wide-ranging and diverse community of scientists and engineers.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/21/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Laura Beringer"
