 "awd_abstract_narration": "Coral reefs, the tropical rain forests of the marine environment, are under significant threat from a variety of stressors such as pollution, overfishing, coastal development and climate change.  There is increasing interest by the coral reef research community in the ecology and evolution of other groups of organisms besides corals on coral reefs with sponges being of particular interest.  Sponges are a very old group of organisms essential to reef health because of their roles in nutrient cycling, providing food and homes for many other reef organisms, and their ability to synthesize diverse chemical compounds of ecological importance on the reef, and of interest to the biomedical community.  Many of these important functions would not be possible without the symbiotic microbes (e.g., bacteria) that live within sponges.  In this project, the investigators will examine relationships between the sponge host and its microbiome in the ecological roles described above.  Like the human microbiome, understanding the sponge micobiome may be the key to understanding their ecology and biodiversity.  The investigators will use a combination of classical ecological approaches combined with sophisticated biochemical and molecular analyses to unravel the role of the symbionts in the ecology and evolution of sponges. Both the University of New Hampshire and the University of Mississippi will provide training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students as well as veterans and post-doctoral researchers, especially from underrepresented groups.  Additionally, the investigators will develop unique outreach programs for public education on the importance of coral reef ecosystems.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this study is to examine the relationships between marine sponges and their microbiomes, and reveal the phylogenetic, genetic, and functional biodiversity of coral reef sponges across the Caribbean basin. This research will provide a better understanding of sponges as a major functional component of the biodiversity of coral reef communities.  This transformative project will examine important paradigms relative to sponge communities worldwide that will provide unique insights into the integrative biodiversity of sponges on coral reefs and enhance our understanding of the ecology and evolution of this extensive, yet understudied, group of marine organisms.  This is essential because sponges continue to emerge as the dominant taxon on many coral reefs, particularly following regional declines in coral cover over the last three decades, and their ecological importance to shallow coral reef communities is unequivocal.  In addition, many marine sponges host a diverse assemblage of symbiotic microorganisms that play critical functional roles in nutrient cycling within sponges themselves and in the coral reef communities where they reside, and many sponges can potentially transfer photoautotrophically derived energy to higher trophic levels.  As shallow coral reefs continue to decline, the phylogenetic, genetic, and functional diversity of coral reefs will increasingly be found in taxa other than scleractinian corals, such as soft corals and sponges. The investigators predict that co-evolution of the sponge host and microbiome leads to emergent functional properties that result in niche diversification and speciation of sponges.  To assess this, they will quantify trophic modes (e.g., DOM and POC uptake, photo-autotrophy) of sponges in the Caribbean, as well as the production of chemical defenses.  These character states will be analyzed in the context of the phylogenetic composition of the sponge hosts and their microbiomes, and the functional activities of the host and symbionts at the genetic level (i.e., transcriptomics and metatranscriptomics).  These data will provide unique insights into the co-evolution of sponges and their microbiomes, and how these symbioses influence the functional attributes of sponges within coral reef communities.",
