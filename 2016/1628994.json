 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Nearly all man-made solids are made up of many small crystals referred to as grains. The sizes of these grains and the way that they are attached - characteristics determined when the material is made - influence many of the solid's properties. Existing models for the evolution of the grains during processing fail to predict observed outcomes. Because of the complexity of the problem, it is not even obvious that it is possible to make accurate predictions of how grains evolve during processing. The research will test the hypothesis that it is possible to predict the evolution of the grains within a material if information about the properties of the interfaces between the grains is included. The research will couple simulations with newly developed experimental techniques to test the hypothesis. Methods will be employed to identify where current models are insufficient, how they can be improved, and the degree to which it will be possible to predict grain evolution. The broader impact of this research is that the ability to predict how grains change during processing will make it possible to avoid trial and error experimentation and develop improved materials more quickly and at a lower cost.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Predicting exactly how microstructures evolve during thermal annealing is one of the longstanding problems in materials science. While it is known how the average grain size will change with annealing, very little is known about the evolution of the grain boundary character distribution, the texture, and the grain shape. The main assertion of this research is that with knowledge of the grain boundary properties and how the properties vary with the crystallography of the grain boundary, it will be possible to predict how the microstructure will change during grain growth. A continuous feedback cycle of observations, simulation, comparison, and correction will be employed with the objective of creating accurate, predictive models for grain growth. The research will focus on materials with a range of anisotropic grain boundary properties. Ferritic iron has the most isotropic properties. The grain boundary properties of strontium titanate vary mostly with respect to grain boundary plane orientation. The grain boundary properties of nickel are anisotropic with respect to both lattice misorientation and grain boundary plane orientation. The studies of three-dimensional microstructure evolution in this research will make it possible to test proposed mechanisms for the development of anisotropic grain boundary character distributions and grain growth stagnation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nTo the eye, most common metals and ceramics used in commercial products appear to be uniformly solid. But at the microscopic level, they are polycrystalline, made up of aggregates of grains that have different sizes, shapes, and crystal orientations. The grains are tied together by a network of grain boundaries that influence the material\u2019s properties. Materials scientists manipulate the density of grain boundaries to control the properties.  For the last 70 years, the movement of grain boundaries (which determines their density) was predicted using a theory that says that the velocity at which a grain boundary moves through a heated material is correlated to the boundary\u2019s curvature.  The overall goal of this research was to determine if this was true for polycrystalline aggregates and, if so, to use this knowledge to develop predictive simulations that could be used to control the density of grain boundaries and, therefore, the properties of the material.\n\nTo reach the project goal, we used a synchrotron-based X-ray technique called near field, high energy diffraction microscopy to measure the structure of polycrystalline materials at different times, advanced computational analysis techniques to determine grain boundary properties from these measurements, and computer simulation techniques to determine if it is possible to make predictions that are consistent with the experimental observations.  Completing the research required close cooperation among experts in these three areas, with continuous feedback between the experiments and simulations.  The most significant result from the study was that the assumed rule for grain boundary migration in polycrystals is not correct.  In polycrystalline nickel and iron, the velocity of a grain boundary is not correlated to its curvature, as previously thought.  Furthermore, the velocity of the boundary is related to the orientations of the adjacent crystals.  This means that existing models for grain boundary migration will fail to predict how polycrystalline aggregates evolve with time when heated.\n\nThe intellectual merit of this project is represented by the new discoveries about grain boundary migration. This will lead to improved predictions about both the structural evolution and the properties of materials used in the automobile, aviation, construction, and other industries.  This project had broader impacts through the dissemination of the findings in scientific publications and conferences, the education of doctoral students, and our 3D microstructure workshop.  Each summer, the workshop engaged 40 to 50 participants from industry, national labs, and other universities.  The workshop taught the basic skills needed for the study of polycrystals in three-dimensions.  Four doctoral students received degrees based on dissertations created as part of this research.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/08/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory S Rohrer"
