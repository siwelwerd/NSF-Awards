The program features technical papers, panels and invited talks, and discussion sessions. The 8th HOST will be held in fall 2016 in the Washington, DC, area. The funds support travel grants for students to attend the conference. HOST is the top conference devoted to hardware security. By increasing student participation at the HOST conference, it may encourage more students to get involved in hardware security research and pursue further graduate education and careers in this area.",
