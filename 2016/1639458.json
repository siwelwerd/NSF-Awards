 "awd_abstract_narration": "Concerns over food, energy and water (FEW) security and an enhanced ability to withstand future disturbances and shocks (i.e., resilience) require careful management of these coupled resources. This project is centered on the Columbia River Basin (CRB) comprising portions of seven states in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and a portion of Canada.  The project will develop a resilience assessment facing the FEW systems as a result of rapid changes in land use and human populations, climate variability, and the complex interactions between physical, biological, and human systems. This understanding can then be used to assess the governance and policy challenges associated with the CRB from both national and international perspectives.  Engagement with stakeholders throughout the project will provide information on which management strategies are feasible within existing political and socio-cultural institutions, and what aspects of institutions might be relaxed or reformed to enable innovations and greater resilience.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding interdependencies within the Food-Energy-Water (FEW) system is critical to maintain FEW security. Strategies are needed to increase the overall resilience of FEW systems across multiple spatial and temporal scales. This project examines the hypothesis that coordinated management of physical (e.g., reservoirs, aquifers, and batteries) and non-physical (e.g., water markets, social capital, and insurance markets) storage systems across the three sectors promotes resilience. The overarching goal is to examine effective strategies to mutually balance benefits and increase resilience across integrated FEW systems. The project will develop a transferable framework for FEW systems involving 1) a theoretical foundation characterizing the region's FEW system that is generalizable to national and global scales, 2) integration of state-of-the-science computational models to capture FEW system interactions, 3) identification of ancillary benefits or unintended consequences using the modeling platforms, and 4) utilization of a two-way stakeholder engagement to develop new strategies and remove barriers to adoption of new coordinated practices.",
