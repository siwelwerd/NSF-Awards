 "awd_abstract_narration": "The cognitive and communication prowess of the large-brained, highly gregarious bottlenose dolphin is legendary and has captured the interest and imagination of scientists and the public at large. Notably, dolphins are one of a handful of species that are vocal learners; thus the dolphin presents us with a unique and alternative model to songbirds to advance our understanding of the processes that underlie vocal learning and communication in a large-brained mammal showing high social and behavioral complexity. Despite decades of research on dolphin vocal communication, the constituent elements, the sequential and temporal organization of the elements, and the nature of vocal transactions between dolphins remain enigmatic. In order to decipher dolphin communication and further elucidate these issues, the PIs will use observational approaches in the wild and in an aquarium as well as two experimental approaches in an aquarium. A first approach studies how dolphins coordinate their behavior in the face of novelty: How do dolphins synchronize their behavior when requested to present novel behaviors in tandem? How do they succeed in working as a team when confronted with a new challenge? In a second approach, the researchers will provide dolphins with a two-way, interactive touchscreen and audio system. Their proclivity for vocal learning and their other cognitive processes will be probed by giving them choice and control over the interactive system and observing and documenting how they use and respond to the contingencies of their interactions, which shall be obtaining novel acoustic signals temporally paired with objects, interactions or activities. The aquarium studies are particularly conducive to outreach efforts and informal science education since the dolphin-related activities will be conducted in an open amphitheater environment at a leading aquarium. The exhibit has changed from dolphin shows to more educational demonstrations about animal care, behavior, and conservation. The research activities will take place concurrently with visits of the public and field trips of school children and therefore, the research endeavor will be communicated to the public in real time. Virtually all the activities proposed can, with modest effort and cost, be made into an open exhibit at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, instructing visiting schoolchildren on the research process and on collaborative research across scientific boundaries. The field trips to the research sites are organized jointly with undergraduate and graduate courses in field research for Hunter College students and are excellent opportunities to showcase and engage actual cutting edge research to these students. This tightly-knit interdisciplinary collaboration between the labs of animal cognitive psychologist and marine mammal scientist and physicist, computational neuroscientist and bio-acoustician, seeks to and extend high-throughput settings to dolphin communication studies in captivity.\r\n\r\nA key intellectual merit of this proposal is to address these fundamental questions in the field of animal cognition and communication through powerful methods drawn from statistical mechanics, machine learning, and signal processing. Central technical problems in \"decoding\" dolphin communication are the difficulty in sound localization and attributing the detected vocalizations to specific individual dolphins, the lack of automated behavioral analysis methods, and the crucial step of creating an integrated picture of attributed vocal and behavioral transactions or \"conversations\" that can be subjected to high-through analysis. Another technical problem is the design and deployment of an advanced two-way interactive system consisting of an underwater touchpad and real-time audio input/output, plus the associated set of interaction interfaces. Finally, this project also addresses important technical problems in the deployment of aerial and aquatic drones for field studies.",

Our previous research (Reiss and McCowan, 1993) demonstrated the efficacy of providing dolphins with interactive keyboard system that afforded them degrees of choice and control and the dolphins demonstrating self-organized learning. The touchscreen is a more advanced interactive system with a large 4 x 8 ft touchscreen to 1) provide dolphins with choice and control in obtaining specific objects for play, 2) enable dolphins to partake in interactive games, and 3) facilitate interactions with their caregivers. The touchscreen can display images, produce sounds and register the dolphins&rsquo; input/responses through rostrum touching (using optical near field deep-red tracking). The touchscreen was affixed to the outside surface of a window of a dolphin pool at the National Aquarium in Baltimore, MD and visual stimuli such as images of objects, videos of dolphins and other species, and animated interactive games were rear-projected on the screen. To test the efficacy that the optic-touchscreen screen technology would work with the dolphins, we first exposed two male dolphins to a dolphin-friendly game we created entitled &lsquo;wack-a-fish&rsquo; in which animated fish move across the screen. &nbsp;One dolphin, Foster, stopped immediately as the video started and touched nearly every fish as it moved across the screen (click this link to view the video <a href=\"https://www.rockefeller.edu/news/19742-researchers-create-interactive-touchscreen-dolphins/\">https://www.rockefeller.edu/news/19742-researchers-create-interactive-touchscreen-dolphins/</a>).<em> </em>It was quite impressive to see this level of interest and ability in a non-technological species.<em> </em>We further used the touchscreen to investigate the behavioral responses and preferences of the two male dolphins when viewing a series of 30-second social videos (videos of familiar dolphins) and non-social videos (the body and hands of a trainer offering fish in a feeding context) and control videos (fish swimming or the dolphin pool without the dolphins in the scene). Both dolphins spent more time viewing social videos than non-social or control videos. These findings demonstrate the dolphins&rsquo; high motivation to view social video and discriminate between the social versus other video categories which provides support for the future use of videos to investigate perception and cognition with delphinids. When viewing the wack-a-fish game and video segments, the dolphins positioned in close proximity to the screen, within a foot or less, consistent with our past observations of dolphins positioning in close proximity to a mirror when viewing themselves (Reiss &amp; Marino, 2001; Reiss &amp; Morrison, 2018). Our findings provide evidence that the dolphin&rsquo;s visual acuity at close range may be better than previously thought.
