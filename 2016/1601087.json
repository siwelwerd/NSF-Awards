 "awd_abstract_narration": "Titanium and its alloys represent an important family of materials providing energy efficiency along with mechanical and environmental advantages but have seen only limited application primarily due to the high cost of production.  Electric field-assisted sintering technology, sometimes called spark plasma sintering, is a novel process for the consolidation of powders or particulates that offers cost advantages over conventional approaches.  The team of this Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) project will contribute to the fundamental understanding of molecular diffusion behavior during field-assisted sintering for titanium and titanium powders that will enable cost-effective manufacturing of these materials while maintaining material attributes such as high strength, low density and environmental inertness.  The findings will impact both the automotive and aerospace industries. The collaborative university-industry research team will educate university students as well as provide outreach activities to attract high school students to engineering careers.\r\n\r\nAvailability of diffusion data in multicomponent systems has been scarce due to the complexity of diffusion analyses and the dependence of interdiffusion coefficients on composition.  This has prevented accurate modeling of the kinetics of sintering for ternary or higher order systems encountered in commercially important materials.  The research team will generate ternary interdiffusion coefficients for titanium-aluminum-niobium systems, an important material system for automotive and aerospace applications.  In the presence of an electric field during field-assisted sintering, the phase equilibrium can be altered giving rise to new phases or eliminating certain phases during processing. The effects of an imposed electric field and microstructural length scale will be assessed through a set of experiments and simulations that will provide insight into the thermodynamics and kinetics of the interdiffusion and phase equilibria/transformation for the chosen material system. With this insight, titanium alloys can be designed and manufactured with desired properties at lower cost than is available today.",

The results show that the applied electric current reduced the activation energy for the nucleation of TiAl<sub>2</sub> significantly, although it did not alter the phases formed during the reactions between Ti and TiAl<sub>3</sub>. &nbsp;Moreover, the kinetics of the reactions between Ti and TiAl<sub>3</sub> were enhanced when the TiAl<sub>3</sub> had a refined starting microstructure, and the applied electric field restrained the growth of the TiAl<sub>2</sub> and TiAl grains in the nanocrystalline Ti/Al powder blend compact more effectively, leading to a more refined microstructure in the reaction zone. Furthermore, effort was dedicated to investigate atomic mixing, structural features of interphase boundaries between constituent phases (Ti, Al), grain size effect, and resultant phase formation in Ti-Al system, under severe deformation (See Image 2). &nbsp;High-resolution transmission electron microscopy revealed the structural features of the interphase boundaries, and found that the Al/Ti interphase boundaries significantly promote the generation of dislocations during deformation. &nbsp;The chemical mixing between the Al and Ti phases was enhanced by defect-mediated short circuit diffusion and dislocation shuffle controlled plastic deformation at the interphase boundaries. The intermetallic phases formed during severe deformation are associated with the strain energy stored by the high density of dislocations at the interphase boundaries.&nbsp; Furthermore, research efforts were devoted to an investigation of interdiffusion in Ti-Nb and Ti-Al-Nb systems at various compositions in the &beta; (BCC) phase using solid-solid diffusion couples assembled at three different temperatures of 1060<sup>o</sup>C, 1100<sup>o</sup>C, and 1170<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp; The interdiffusion fluxes were determined after fitting the experimental concentration profiles with <em>Multi</em>DiFlux software and the ternary interdiffusion coefficients were evaluated at various compositions using Kirkaldy&rsquo;s approach.&nbsp; See the Image 3 for one example at 1060<sup>o</sup>C. &nbsp;The interdiffusion of Nb was the slowest, while Ti and Al showed similar interdiffusion kinetics. The main interdiffusion coefficients for the three components are positive. The cross interdiffusion coefficients of Ti and Nb are comparable in magnitude to their respective main terms indicating the presence of strong diffusional interactions in this system. The cross coefficient &nbsp;is positive indicating that the interdiffusion flux of Ti is enhanced down the concentration gradient of Nb. The negative value of the cross-term &nbsp; indicates that the interdiffusion flux of Nb is enhanced up the gradient of Ti.&nbsp; The information generated also includes the diffusion paths developed in various couples annealed at 1060<sup>o</sup>C, 1100<sup>o</sup>C and 1170<sup>o</sup>C are plotted on ternary Gibbs triangles in the Image 4. &nbsp;Diffusion paths are in typical non-symmetric S-shaped curves for all the couples, and vary with temperature although not significantly, possibly because of the difference in activation energies of diffusion for the three components and thermodynamic interactions being dependent on temperature.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through the performance period (July 1, 2014 &ndash; June 30, 2018), this program has generated five journal papers and two conference presentations, and trained four graduate students and two postdoctoral researchers.<strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong>This GOALI research program has generated fundamental knowledge, particularly with the ternary interdiffusion coefficients and diffusional interactions at various compositions of Ti-Al-Nb system, which is essential for synthesis and processing of Ti alloys.&nbsp; The deriving materials synthesis/processing technology will make fabrication of Ti and its alloys more affordable with expanded applications. &nbsp;The findings will impact industries beyond automotive, including aerospace and other sustainable transportation systems that require materials with attributes such as high strength, low density, environmental inertness and cost effectiveness.&nbsp; The research activities has promoted intellectual collaborations and academic exchanges between UC Irvine (and UC Davis), GM and Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK), via joint research efforts in experimental investigation and modeling analysis of diffusion phenomena in binary and ternary alloy systems.&nbsp; Graduate student from IITK visited UC Davis to conduct joint research.&nbsp; This program has also promoted international student exchanges with Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China.&nbsp; Moreover, the industry-university collaborative research has enriched outreach program at UC Irvine.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/27/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Enrique&nbsp;J&nbsp;Lavernia</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1601087/1601087_10310590_1538080999356_CMMI_Image_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1601087/1601087_10310590_1538080999356_CMMI_Image_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"CMMI-1601087_Image_1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1601087/1601087_10310590_1538080999356_CMMI_Image_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"CMMI-1601087_Image_1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Electron microscopy micrograph, electron probe microanalysis of Ti, and X-ray mapping of Al are shown for Ti/Al compact in (a), (b) and (c), respectively, and for TiAl3/Ti compact in (d), (e) and (f), respectively.
