 "awd_abstract_narration": "The stars in the outermost regions of galaxies preserve a fossil record of the birth of stars and dynamics of that galaxy over its lifetime. These stellar halos extend far beyond the crowded inner regions of galaxies, where the majority of the stars reside in disks or dense spheres.  Stellar halos are thought to be made of stars that formed very early on, in the galaxy's newly formed disk, as well as stars that were originally part of smaller, dwarf, galaxies that fell into the large galaxy and were torn apart.  The investigators will study the physical properties of the stars in the Andromeda galaxy's stellar halo, and will determine the relative importance of these two different ways of contributing stars to a galaxy's halo.  Their goal is understanding of how massive galaxies grow.  They will deduce the properties of destroyed \"dwarf\" galaxies and their rate of forming new stars.  This will give insight into the properties of dwarf galaxies that did not survive until the present day. This program will train young astronomers and introduce high school students to scientific research.\r\n\r\nThe Andromeda galaxy is the nearest large galaxy to our own. It is similar in many ways to our Milky Way galaxy, but shows evidence that it has merged with more small galaxies than the Milky Way.  The investigators, along with students, will use an archive of Keck telescope spectra from previous observations of tens of thousands of stars, and will also perform new spectroscopic observations.  They will use the spectra to measure the abundances of atomic elements and track the properties of the chemical environment in which the stars formed.  The investigators will perform the first large-scale chemical abundance study of Andromeda's stellar halo.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will recruit students to engage in summer research related to this program.  They will focus their recruitment at schools that have a large fraction of students from demographic groups that are under-represented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  Completing a cutting-edge astronomical research project will both introduce these students to working in a STEM field and give them confidence that they can succeed in a STEM career.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is the nearest large, spiral galaxy to our own Milky Way galaxy.  Andromeda is particularly useful for studying how galaxies like the Milky Way form and evolve because it is close enough to observe individual stars in great detail, yet it is far enough away that we can readily observe its entire extent.  \n\nWe were interested in learning about the smaller galaxies that Andromeda has ingested over its lifetime.  While these smaller galaxies no longer exist, having been torn apart by gravitational forces, their stars now orbit around Andromeda and provide clues to what types of galaxies they were born in.   \n\nWe studied Andromeda used the DEIMOS multi-object spectrograph on the Keck 2 telescope located on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.  We wish to recognize and acknowledge the very significant cultural role and reverence that the summit of Mauna Kea has always had within the indigenous Hawaiian community. We are most fortunate to have the opportunity to conduct observations from this mountain.\n\nWe used spectra of individual stars to determine how Andromeda and its collection of surviving smaller galaxies formed their stars over time.  When a star's light is spread out into a spectrum, we can measure the amounts of different elements in the star.  We were interested in measuring the ratio of lighter elements, like calcium, magnesium, silicon, and titanium, collectively called alpha (&alpha;) elements, to the heavier iron (Fe).  When this ratio (&alpha;/Fe) is measured and compared against the amount of iron for a population of stars, it tells you how fast, or efficiently, stars were formed.  We developed techniques to measure the amounts of iron and lighter &alpha; elements in the atmospheres of the stars.\n\nWe observed 256 stars in the small \"dwarf galaxies\" that orbit Andromeda and an additional 239 stars in the outskirts of Andromeda.  We observed these stars for about 5 to 6 hours each, compared with previously typical observation times of 1 hour.  The long observations led to high-quality spectra from which we measured the compositions of the stars.  We also developed techniques to measure the amounts of elements from the existing shorter observations, by combining the spectra of small groups of stars.  This let us measure the amounts of iron and lighter elements in more than a thousand stars which we had previously observed.\n\nWe found that stars in different components of Andromeda showed varying ratios of &alpha;/Fe, which implies that the different components were more or less efficient at forming stars.  The stars in the dwarf galaxies have low &alpha;/Fe, which indicates that they formed stars slowly and inefficiently over a long time.  In contrast, stars in the outskirts of Andromeda have higher &alpha;/Fe ratios at a given amount of Fe, which indicates that they formed stars quickly and efficiently.  \n\nGalaxy simulations predict that surviving dwarf galaxies were less efficient at forming stars than galaxies that were torn apart long ago to form the outskirts of larger galaxies like the Milky Way and Andromeda.  Our observations of the &alpha;/Fe ratios confirm this prediction in Andromeda.  Although this trend has been known for almost 20 years in the Milky Way, our measurement of the same trend in Andromeda is an important verification of the leading theory of galaxy formation. \n\nWe found that the stars farthest out - at distances over 350,000 light years from Andromeda's center - have the highest &alpha;/Fe ratios and the lowest amounts of Fe. This is the first time these measurements have been made at distances this large in any galaxy, including our own Milky Way.  The most distant reaches of Andromeda may be composed of stars from smaller, fainter objects than those that lost the majority of their stars closer in. \n\nAndromeda had a recent collision with a smaller galaxy that left behind a system of bright and large streams of stars.  This smaller galaxy may have been a significant fraction of the size of Andromeda: Andromeda may be only 2 to 4 times larger than the galaxy that was torn apart.  If that is the case, it challenges our understanding of how disks in galaxies react to collisions.  We measured the &alpha; and Fe abundances of stars in this stream system, and found that the amounts of these elements were most consistent with the stream system being torn from a fairly large galaxy.\n\nThis project trained junior researchers at all levels.  Researchers at the postdoctoral and graduate student level supported by the project were responsible for many of the above results.  We also recruited high school students and rising college freshman from groups under-represented in STEM (for their race, ethnicity, gender identity, or sexual orientation).  These students conducted original research, asking questions whose answers were not known. The students reported overwhelmingly positive experiences and a desire to continue studying STEM fields in college.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/12/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Karoline Gilbert"
