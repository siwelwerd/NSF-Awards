 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacteria can grow on liquid/air interfaces by attaching to the interface, excreting proteins, and reproducing. This creates a slimy, elastic sheet called a pellicle (a biofilm grown at an air/water interface). Pellicles occur in the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients, where they allow infection to spread, or in oil spill cleanup where they enable oil-degrading bacteria access to crude. To reduce infection, pellicles should be made less stable; to enhance oil cleanup, pellicles should be made more stable. The stability of pellicles depends in part on the bacteria type, which in real-world applications cannot be changed. Therefore, to alter pellicle properties, the local environment needs to be changed to affect bacteria behavior. The PI will alter pellicle properties by adding materials directly to liquid interfaces. For instance, adding soap to an interface weakens biofilms, whereas adding small particles strengthens them. This research will study a range of materials that can modify interfaces and determine how and why the properties of interfaces can be used to control pellicle mechanical strength.  An interesting 'super Saturday' science club for elementary students will be supported. 'Science it's a girl thing' for 5th and 11th grade students will also be created. The PI teaches fluids and also serves to promote graduate school to undergraduates. He is part of a formal program in mechanical engineering to enhance diversity and women participation which is low in engineering in particular for mechanical engineering. He will teach a new course and solidly integrates research and educational plans.\r\n\r\nWhen surface active materials adsorb to an change the properties of a liquid interface, it is known to affect the viscoelasticity of a pellicle. However, there is little study of this phenomenon and still confusion as to what mechanisms cause observed changes. This research will determine how mechanical and chemical properties of an interface such as viscoelasticity, charge, and wettability affect interfacial viscoelasticity of P. aeruginosa pellicles. This will be done by using specific adsorbed particles, proteins, and surfactants to systematically control interfacial properties.  A custom-built rheometer will be employed to characterize interfacial viscoelastic storage and loss moduli and simultaneously monitor bacteria movement within the biofilm. This will allow discernment of the impacts of interface properties on pellicle formation and correlation of biological behavior to interfacial mechanics in a way that has not been previously accomplished. The conclusions drawn about the role of interface properties on pellicle formation will be broadly applicable to all pellicle-forming bacteria due to the focus on mechanistic processes. The resulting data will provide a unique understanding of pellicle formation and a new means to change ultimate mechanical properties of pellicles.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBiofilms are slimy materials that form from bacteria aggregating together and excreting substances that make the environment more favorable to their survival.  When they form, biofilms can resultant in persistent wound infections, contamination of food products/equipment, and/or cleanup of oil spills. Because they form in dynamic conditions, the mechanical strength of the biofilm is very important to its ability to survive, and therefore has been a subject of much interest to scientists.\n\nThe vast majority of biofilm studies have looked at their formation on solid surfaces, but they can also form at air/liquid surfaces.  When formed in these locations, the biofilm is called a pellicle.  Because they are located at the liquid interface, pellicles have different material properties then solid surface biofilms.  Furthermore, properties of the interface, like surface tension, also affect the way the pellicle grows.  The goal of this work was to understand how the liquid interface affects pellicle formation.\n\nMost importantly, we found that surface tension of the interface allows formation of biofilms in non-ideal conditions for bacteria that would not have success forming biofilms on solid surfaces.   That is because surface tension is capable of trapping the bacteria at the interface regardless of what the bacteria are doing. \n\nFurthermore, we found that by modifying the interface though the addition of materials that also like to sit at the interface, like soap, we could change the growth rate and strength of the biofilm forming.  Even more important, we found that although such materials change surface tension, they impact the formation of the pellicle in other ways.  In fact, by changing the size of the molecule used (i.e. using different types of soap), we were able to slow down the rate of pellicle formation and weaken the strength of the pellicle even when surface tension values were the same. \n\nOur work shows the potential for impacting the strength and rate of pellicle formation through use of tailored molecules.  This will allow surfactants to have a greater impact on inhibiting pellicle formation.  By allowing us to more easily weaken these pellicles, we can prevent a range of negative impacts due to their formation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/07/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gordon F Christopher"
