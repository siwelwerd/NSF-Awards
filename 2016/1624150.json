CCC is the world's primary conference for research on computational complexity, i.e., the absolute and relative power of computational models under resource constraints.  The conference's technical content and international networking opportunities are particularly valuable to students.  Because the meeting is outside the U.S., students with accepted papers may have difficulty attending.  This award will provide partial support to approximately ten student attendees to defray costs of registration fees, shared hotel rooms, and travel.  Co-funding is provided by the Office of International Science and Engineering.",
