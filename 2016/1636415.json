This research project will quantify how rivers reestablish equilibrium channel characteristics in response to changes in flow and sediment flux.  The investigators will test the assertion that the equilibrium form of a channel cannot be uniquely defined and that channel properties depend on the dominant mode of sediment transport.  A clear understanding of river channel equilibrium is vital for river management and restoration. Project findings will provide regional planners, watershed managers, nongovernmental organizations, and others with new methodologies for prioritizing watersheds for restoration and for seeking better ecological and economic advantages from river systems.  The project also will contribute to improved education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields through special opportunities for the involvement of graduate students and mentoring programs for female scientists.\r\n\r\nWatershed managers and policy makers currently lack the necessary analytical metrics to gauge the magnitude of river disturbance to determine whether restoration activities are effective in promoting geomorphologically stable rivers that are in equilibrium.  In this project, the investigators will identify the various possible geomorphic expressions of watersheds in dynamic equilibrium through the use of sediment tracers, channel transects and flow modeling, and in-channel sediment measurements.  They will use sediment bedload information for quantifying the covariant and non-singular pathways that characterize channel recovery from disturbances, and they will employ mathematical models for simulating channel recovery in systems with varying sediment supply along longitudinal profiles of stream channels.  The insights developed through this project will be essential for understanding the resiliency of watersheds and for the implementation recovery and restoration efforts of river systems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project examined the multiple pathways that stream channels recover from disturbances.  For example, we showed that small, run of river (RoR) dams, the most common type of dam in the U.S. and elsewhere, transmit and trap the upstream sediment supply to the same degree as the river?s natural reach-scale morphological units.  Since RoR dams are likely not trapping more sediment than is typically sequestered in natural river reaches, these dams do not disconnect the normative downstream flux of sediment nor result in channel morphological disequilibrium downstream of the dam.  However, the minimal effect that small, channel spanning RoR dams have on the morphological equilibrium state of a channel does not suggest that RoR dams have no ecological footprint.\n\nMore generally, this project showed that rivers adjust rapidly to on-going boundary condition shifts such as the emplacement or removal of dams and changing climate, but that they adjust along a continuum of possible stable states.  This means that after being disturbed, the channel bed and sediment flux attain equilibrium within a few years, but that the stable state may differ from the pre-disturbance state.  This result has important implications for river restoration as it implies that, at least in temperate climates, it may be most cost-efficient to let natural river processes restore the river channel geometry rather than trying design its final state a priori based on, e.g., the geometry of undisturbed reference reaches.  Instead, river restoration should focus on mitigating unwanted impacts, such as the downstream flushing of sediment during this period of adjustment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/18/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Carl E Renshaw"
