 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Morgan State University seeks to infuse critical thinking and other evidence-based strategies throughout the introductory computer science programming course taken annually by about 100 students. A strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project.\r\n\r\nThis project has the specific goals to: integrate and evaluate critical thinking skills with the existing curriculum alongside programming skills; teach general problem-solving techniques with a flowchart-based programming environment and without using specific programming concepts or languages at the beginning of the curriculum; put greater emphasis on core computer science principles with less of a focus on syntax by introducing Python as the introductory programming language; incorporate visual and interactive learning; and actively engage students in collaborative learning. The desired outcome is to retain more students in the Computer Science major and to prepare them for graduate studies and/or the workforce.",

An introductory programming course is among the most challenging in the computer science (CS) curriculum, particularly for the freshmen from minority or underrepresented population (around 85% at MSU) without any computing background. Within the overarching goal of creating an intellectual, active, and engaging academic environment and   improving students\u2019 motivation towards programming and increasing retention, this project accomplished many of the objectives:\nInfused Computational Thinking (CT) with the existing Curriculum: The project addresses different ways of problem solving, logical reasoning, algorithm design, and programming constructs with minimal or no emphasis on syntax. A CT framework is developed by identifying key concepts and a set of problem-solving strategies and practice activities are performed in a visual programming development environment (RAPTOR) based on flowcharts to allow a focus on CT principles right away.  Several teaching materials (e.g., lecture slides, exercises, quizzes, and small projects) are developed to infuse CT in addition to create an assessment (CT test) to gauge the ability of incoming students and measure the progress at the end of a semester. Improvement in performances were observed in between pre and post CT tests in several semesters which were during the project period.\nIncorporated Interactive Learning in teaching Python: For a  dynamic classroom, an  interactive cloud-based  programming environment, Repl.it  is used  in instruction by letting  students  focus on coding, collaborate, and build  and minimizing the time spent acquiring, setting up, supporting, debugging, or adding a third-party package to an IDE.  To change the instructional approach to a studio model that combines the lecture and code simulation exercise in Repl.it during the same classroom period, an eBook (https://pybook.mdrahmanlab.com/) is created to interactively learn Python Programming.\nIntroduced Collaborative Learning as Team Projects: Project based collaborative learning is introduced   through teamwork on well-defined projects with well-crafted rubric where collaborations include use of basic task management tools, platforms, and multiplayer tool so that the students can critic, supplement, improve peer works and learn through the process.  The repl.it multiplayer feature helped in providing the collaborative \u2018team-based\u2019 learning environment intended for the students as this feature makes it possible for all members of the group to code on the same editor (like Google Docs) and execute their programs in the same interpreter.\nThis project is exploratory in nature and addressed the primary research question \"does the proposed techniques increase student engagement, facilitate learning, and contribute to the progress of students in this course? The success is measured as 1) students\u2019 global perception of Course Experience based on positive responses of survey result 2) improvement of CT skills as measured from pre and post CT tests and 3) preparedness of COSC 111 students for consequent courses. Robust statistical analysis proved the central research hypothesis of this project that programming proficiency of novice learners is dependent on the teaching approaches proposed in this project.
