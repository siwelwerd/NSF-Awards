 "awd_abstract_narration": "Amphibians (frogs, toads, salamanders) are central members of many biological communities. As tadpoles, they consume vegetation in streams and ponds, and as adults, they consume large numbers of insect prey. They, in turn, are eaten by snakes, birds and small mammals.  Thus, the balance of many ecosystems depends on amphibians. Currently, nearly one third of amphibian species worldwide are at risk for development of a fungal skin disease that has driven more than 150 species into extinction. Fungi that cause disease have complex interactions with their hosts, and host immune defenses generally keep them in check. However, many pathogenic fungi have developed immune evasion strategies. This project will investigate the mechanisms used by a pathogenic fungus to impair the immune system.  It will examine the chemical nature of factors released by the fungus that inhibit lymphocytes. If the factors are novel, they may be developed as therapeutic agents to control immune disorders.  Success in this investigation will greatly advance our understanding of the specific mechanisms that are used by this fungus to evade immune clearance and may suggest novel virulence mechanisms used by other pathogenic fungi that affect humans.\r\n\r\nBatrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd) is a skin fungus that is one cause of worldwide declines and extinctions of amphibians. Fungi that infect vertebrates have complex interactions with their hosts, and host immune defenses generally keep them in check. However, many pathogenic fungi have developed immune evasion strategies. This project will investigate the mechanisms by which Bd inhibits lymphocyte functions.  Investigators and students at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Villanova University, and Gwynedd Mercy University will investigate the immunotoxic molecules produced by Bd and a second amphibian fungus, Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans. The objectives are to isolate and characterize immunomodulatory and cytotoxic molecules produced by pathogenic Bd strains responsible for chytridiomycosis; (2) to further examine the mechanisms of immune system evasion by Bd, the subsets of lymphoid cells affected, and to determine whether other non-lymphoid cells are targets of Bd factors; (3) to determine whether Batrachochytrium from different geographic locations and with differing genetic makeup vary in their metabolic profiles and production of molecules toxic to lymphocytes and other cells.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe amphibian skin disease, chytridiomycosis, caused by a chytrid fungus continues to threaten survival of amphibian populations on a global scale.  Loss of amphibians would affect other members of the food web that are eaten by amphibians and also the other animals that feed on amphibians (like snakes and birds).  Like humans, amphibians are protected by an immune system, but many amphibians are unable to clear the fungus, suggesting the fungus can interfere with immunity.  With the help of natural products chemists on the project, the research revealed three fungal products that can inhibit cells of the immune system, demonstrating that the fungus can indeed fight back.  Many tropical frogs in Panama have been especially susceptible to this fungus, but some of them are now recovering.  Our studies helped to show that the fungus has not changed in the last approximately 15 years, but the frogs have become more resistant.  The resistance is correlated with better skin immune defenses.  The bacterial community on the skin can help to protect against the skin fungus.  Working with a lab group in Panama, we helped to show that a bacterial product called viscosin from frog skin bacteria could inhibit the fungus.  Thus, the skin community of bacteria and the frog immune products can help to keep the fungus in check on the skin.\n\n \n\nWithin the skin mucus, many frogs have small proteins called antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) made and stored in special skin glands.  These peptides are local antibiotics for the frog, released when the frog is alarmed or injured.  Our studies showed that one of the stressful effects of traffic noise in young wood frogs is failure to produce protective AMPs.   In young southern leopard frogs, low temperature and the presence of the skin fungus impaired their capacity to produce and release AMPs. This combination resulted in death of many of the young frogs.  Thus, this important defense in young frogs can be disturbed by natural or human causes resulting in less protection from chytridiomycosis.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/11/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Louise A Rollins-Smith"
