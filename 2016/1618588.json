 "awd_abstract_narration": "Applications continue to grow both in the size of their code and in the amount\r\nof data they access.  Whether on mobile, desktop, or server platforms,\r\napplications are written in a modular fashion, relying heavily on common\r\nfunctionality provided by a large number of libraries.  Modern operating\r\nsystems leverage this commonality by sharing libraries across applications to\r\navoid duplicate copies of instructions in memory.  However, operating systems\r\nstill maintain independent memory management (address translation) data\r\nfor each process, consuming memory resources proportional to the number of\r\nsimultaneously executing processes.  The goal of this project is to enhance\r\nthe efficiency of memory system access and management for shared code\r\nlibraries.  The success of these efforts will contribute to the long-term\r\nsustainability of the world's fast evolving digital economy and society,\r\nreducing computational waste and improving responsiveness.  The education\r\ncomponent will include improving classroom instruction by contributing new\r\ncourse modules as well as training graduate students in the importance of\r\nefficient sharing.\r\n\r\nThis project involves designing novel hardware and software to promote\r\nefficient access to shared code in a multi-tasking environment, including: 1)\r\nnew operating system memory management mechanisms and policies to eliminate\r\nduplication and minimize cache and translation lookaside buffer (TLB)\r\nfootprint, examining the tradeoffs between the use of variable segments and\r\nhierarchical page tables; 2) reexamining the need for caching translations\r\nwhen utilizing emerging low-latency persistent memory; and 3) using available\r\nprotection support for safe translation sharing in modern TLBs in addition to\r\ndesigning new hardware support to improve efficiency.",
