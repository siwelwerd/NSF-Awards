 "awd_abstract_narration": "Intermediate (70-300 km depth) and deep (300-700 km depth) focus earthquakes of great magnitudes are common in subduction zones. Though many ideas have been advanced, the cause of earthquakes at these depths remains as one of the most significant unresolved problems in the earth sciences. Researchers from University of Akron, Texas A&M University, and Brown University are exploring a new mechanism that might explain these enigmatic events: magnesite, a magnesium carbonate commonly observed in altered basalts and peridotite (primary constituents of the subducting plates), could initiate deep focus earthquakes. In this project, the research team is carrying out laboratory experiments in which magnesite is deformed under very high pressure and temperature conditions. Their recent experimental work demonstrated that magnesite is considerably weaker than peridotite, which indicates that veins of magnesite could act as nucleation points for earthquakes. In this project, they will experimentally investigate how two fundamental parameters, grain size and pressure, affect the strength of magnesite and incorporate the results in a computational model of earthquake nucleation. The project would advance desired societal outcomes by potentially shedding light on the causes of earthquakes and providing research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students.\r\n\r\nThe grain-size sensitivity of diffusion creep and the pressure sensitivity of magnesite deformation mechanisms in all three creep regimes (diffusion, dislocation and low-temperature plasticity) need to be quantified in order to apply experimental flow laws to models of creep and shear instability. These parameters are critical considering that diffusion creep is the dominant deformation mechanism in magnesite at many natural conditions and may cause strain localization and possibly seismicity at high pressure in subducting slabs. In this project, the research team will: (1) quantify the grain-size sensitivity of magnesite strength when deforming by diffusion creep and limited plasticity mechanisms; (2) determine the pressure sensitivity of magnesite deformation mechanisms; and (3) model dynamic slip by ductile instabilities in magnesite, applying the shear-heating model. Hydrostatic experiments will be performed to investigate the grain growth kinetics of magnesite. Deformation experiments with different grain sizes over a wide range of pressures will be carried out to determine the grain size and pressure sensitivities of magnesite deformation mechanisms, as identified by scanning and transmission electron microscopy. This will be achieved using state-of-the-art high-pressure deformation apparatuses, such as the D-DIA coupled with X-ray synchrotron radiation for in-situ strain and stress measurements. The results will allow accurate determination of the rheology of magnesite, evaluation of its effects on the bulk rheology of subducting slabs, and prediction of conditions for shear instability where carbonates are subducted.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe earthquakes of greatest magnitude -- the ones that cause the most damage to lives and property -- are associated with subduction, which is the sinking of an oceanic plate back into Earth?s mantle.  The large earthquakes involve fractures at a depth consistent with pressures high enough, in general, to not allow rock of the composition of the plate to fracture: a scientific conundrum of long standing.  This research overall looks at the high-pressure deformation physics of the mineral magnesite (magnesium carbonate).  Normally not considered an important component of an oceanic plate, the carbonates of magnesium and calcium are important in ocean sediments and, as some sediment is subducted, the mechanical response of magnesite may well affect (and potentially effect) the deep earthquakes.  The experimental part of this research was the mechanical testing of magnesite, particularly at high confining pressures (1-to-2 GPa, consistent with a depths of ~30 to 60 km, within the range of deep earthquakes).  Differential (deformation) stress in the experiments, though, exceeds that of the geological conditions.  Thus, to extrapolate with confidence the experimental results to the Earth, one must study the deformation-affected microstructure of the material at the nanometer scale.  This (transmission electron) microscopy was the emphasis of this specific portion of the research.  The high mechanical energy experienced by the specimens created structures that included ~10-nanometer recrystallized grains and interactions of lattice defects that crenulated the crystal structure at a ~1-nanometer scale.  Statistical analyses of the deformation-induced microstructure are on going, but one result is that the microstructure is consistent with an effective viscosity of the material being an order of magnitude lower than other mineral constituents of the plate.  The lattice crenulations nevertheless embrittle the material, suggesting a way that fracture (potentially leading to earthquake) could occur in the material under conditions normally thought to promote ductility.  Yet to be determined are the relative roles of pressure and deformation stress in effecting (or, at least. promoting) the crenulations.  Beyond geophysics, the research has potential application in understanding the physics of ductility and fracture in metals and alloys having a non-cubic crystal structure.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/16/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Reid F Cooper"
