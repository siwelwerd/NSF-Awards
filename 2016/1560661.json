 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ethnographic research after natural disasters can uncover the dynamic, plural, and hybrid ways that communities understand and respond to extreme events. It can also document how populations learn through experimentation and innovation. However, much of the social science research to date has been primarily descriptive, focused on localized case studies and human agency rather than the theory building needed to enable the lessons learned in one post-disaster context to be applied to other contexts. In contrast, the research funded by this award takes a coupled social-ecological systems  approach. It will combine the broader theorization of interdisciplinary, quantitative critical transitions or regime-shift research with the more textured qualitative approaches of the social science of disaster. \r\n\r\nThe research will be conducted by Dr. Jeremy Spoon (Portland State University) in Nepal where there was a devastating series of earthquakes in the spring of 2015.  Earthquake recovery and reconstruction comprise a multi-staged process that occurs over weeks, months, and years. Spoon and his research team will conduct ethnographic and survey research using a retrospective survey of pre-earthquake states, at two short time intervals (about 10 weeks each) to track the impacts and recovery trajectory. The project will enroll 200-400 households in four communities. An additional 20-40 individuals participating in the initial household survey will be contacted for in-depth interviews. The data collection will focus on three to five key indicator variables that express adaptive capacity and follow them over time to uncover social-ecological transformation in the selected communities. The indicators include: biophysical attributes (characteristics integral to the ecological system structure and processes prior to the disturbance); institutional context (governance of the social-ecological system); connectivity (flows of information, knowledge, resources and linkages between the system and external actors); livelihood diversity (diverse patterns of resource use and heterogeneity of income); and social memory (prior experiences with disturbances). The timing of this project will allow the researchers to collect information on pre-earthquake states, the emergency response, the restoration of basic essentials, and the start of livelihood reconstruction. It will provide a window into transformation processes at the earliest stages, setting a foundation for a longer-term project that follows social and ecological reconstruction in the targeted areas over multiple years.",

These understudied earthquakes and aftershocks killed 8,790 people, injured more than 22,000, and damaged or destroyed more than 760,000 private houses and government buildings. Our overarching research questions include: what assemblages and articulations of factors contribute to the resilience of rural mountain households to natural hazards during the recovery phase? and at what point do households maintain their condition or undergo transformation to an alternative state after natural disasters? We are specifically interested in the contributions of five household domains of resilience to natural disaster recovery: accessibility and hazard exposure, institutional context, livelihood diversity, connectivity, and social memory.&nbsp;Each domain was represented by multiple variables identified through long-term ethnographic research and collaboration with the communities in the study area.&nbsp;Our study combined a multi-sited systems approach, longitudinal design, mixed quantitative and qualitative methods, and outreach. We focused on the state of 400 households at four sites before the 2015 Nepal earthquakes and recovery trajectories at approximately 9 months, 1.5 years, and 2.5 years following the events. We started data collection nine months after the earthquakes to allow enough time for the national reconstruction program to begin. Within the 400 household sample, 99% had their homes damaged or destroyed by the earthquakes and connected natural hazards. Between February-April 2016, we held eight community meetings attended by more than 500 individuals and conducted 400 household surveys and 40 in-depth interviews (approximately 80 hours) with an equal distribution of male and female consultants from the four groups of settlements and associated displacement camps within two highly impacted districts. We also gathered GPS coordinates for each household and created maps of the sample&rsquo;s geographic and administrative distribution. Between September-December 2016, we returned preliminary results and solicited feedback from more than 700 individuals at nine community meetings. Eight focus groups involved key consultants from the local communities, government, and aid organizations. We completed household survey data entry, and translated and transcribed all of the in-depth interviews and focus groups from both research phases. We mapped proximity to slope failure (landslides) and local infrastructure, supplemented by open source satellite imagery collected after the earthquakes. In October and November 2017, our team conducted eight local, national, and international research return workshops with newly elected ward representatives, government agencies, INGOs, NGOs, and applied academics to triangulate results and provide contextualization.
