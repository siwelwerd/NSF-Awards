 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue STEM graduate programs and/or careers. The project at St. Philip's College (SPC), a minority-serving institution designated as both a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) and a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), seeks to recruit, retain and provide math acceleration for first time in college (FTIC) students. SPC's students face many challenges to post-secondary educational success and unfortunately, only a small percentage of students enroll and succeed in STEM courses. The Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Enrichment by Design (STEMed) project will address the need for low entry students to improve their pathway to a successful STEM education. This project will allow students to move into college-level mathematics courses sooner than usual, therefore graduating earlier. This reduction in obstacles will increase the number of students graduating from SPC, transferring to a 4 year institution and continuing their STEM education, and/or entering the workforce. While SPC improves its developmental math and STEM programs, STEM students from diverse backgrounds will increasingly obtain a quality education. The local community and the nation will benefit from the increase in these future STEM professionals in the workplace.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the STEMed project is to decrease the time FTIC students take to complete their STEM degree and graduate by focusing on recruiting, retaining, and accelerating FTIC STEM students through developmental math. This goal will be accomplished through the following specific objectives: 1) recruit FTIC STEM students from San Antonio Independent School District and SPC's Veteran's Office; 2) implement the Accelerated Math Preparation (AMP) Program to help FTIC STEM students advance into college level math; (3) provide Student Incentive Stipends (SIS) for those in financial need who complete the program; and 4) mentor students until graduation and/or transfer to a four-year institution. The expected outcomes are to decrease degree completion time and increase the number of STEM degree graduates.",

In addition, the faculty have conducted training sessions on how to use the innovative platform ALEKS. The project personnel also have prior experience with recruiting and mentoring students, as well as awarding scholarships based on student requirements through institutional STEM Student Engagement Grants. This quality of prior knowledge and understanding transmits into success of student recruitment, student mentoring, and student progress within the Accelerated Math Preparation (AMP) Program of the Project.</p>\n<p>The STEM Enrichment by Design (STEMed) Project successfully trained AMP instructors. The project also successfully applied and modified emporium style instruction and modularized curriculum to improve implementation. The project's teaching techniques and course design have been adopted by the Engineering and Mathematics department and will continue to be implemented in the institution's Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Pathway. The, project created, STEM Pathway consists of a co-requisite model enrollment in MATH 1414 College Algebra - Precalculus track with MATH 0320 Intermediate Algebra. STEM students are encouraged to enroll in this STEM Pathway (co-requisite courses) in their first semester, beginning Fall 2020.</p>\n<p>The project faced some challenges in recruiting the proposed number of students despite multiple efforts. It became evident that there was a limit to the number of students who qualified to participate in the project. This factor, in addition to finding those within that group willing to take 3-4 accelerated math courses in one semester, made the pool of students to recruit from slim. Consequently, an average of 8 students per semester participated in this project. See figure 1. Participants are continually being mentored at least twice per semester.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts of this project include pipelining STEM education for transitional students from high school and/or FTIC students (including military) into St. Philip's College. As a minorityserving institution designated as both a Historically Black College and University (HBCU) and a Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI), the STEMed Project serves San Antonio's federally designated Eastside Promise Zone. The grant was able to successfully recruit 57 participants over the 7 semesters the AMP Program was implemented. Of these 57 participants, 79% completed at least three of the four courses in the AMP Program and therefore moved into higher-level mathematics courses within fewer semesters than the traditional track of one math class per semester. See Figure 2. While SPC improves its developmental math and STEM programs, STEM students from diverse backgrounds will increasingly obtain a quality education with a focus on retention and success. The local community and the nation will benefit from the increase in future STEM professionals in the workplace sooner as a result of fewer semesters in developmental math.</p>\n<p>This reduction in obstacles will continue to increase the number of STEM students graduating from SPC, transferring to a 4 year institution continuing their STEM education, and/or entering the workforce. The STEM graduation rate increased in the first two cohorts of the project; it is still too early tell for the last two cohorts. The data will continue to be collected and analyzed as all four cohorts continue to pursue their degrees. Further, the total (combined) graduation rate for grant participants is significantly higher than that of the non-participant graduation rate.
