 "awd_abstract_narration": "Providing services such as voice, web, cloud computing, social networking, video on demand, live streaming and augmented reality requires the ability to globally handle massive amounts of data, which must be efficiently processed, stored, and delivered to end users. The medium of delivery is shifting from wireline to wireless; it is predicted that mobile traffic will account for nearly two-thirds of the total data traffic by 2018 and nearly three fourths of the mobile data traffic will be video by 2019. This puts a tremendous pressure on the limited wireless bandwidth and necessitates revolutionary approaches that exploit alternative resources available in the network.  Motivated by the decreasing cost and abundance of storage capacity, this project considers joint design of storage and transmission schemes for the efficient delivery of video-based services over next generation heterogeneous wireless networks, by specifically taking into account the unique nature of video content and the wireless channel.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish this ambitious task, the work is organized into the three research thrusts that develop next generation of wireless caching networks for video delivery:\r\n\r\n-Thrust 1: Fundamental limits and practical schemes for cache-aided video delivery:\r\nThis thrust takes into account properties of video applications and their associated requirements for efficient and robust caching and delivery techniques particularly suited for such demands. \r\n\r\n-Thrust 2: Video delivery over future cache-aided heterogeneous wireless networks:\r\nThis thrust builds upon the foundations developed in Thrust 1 and expands the cache-aided video delivery schemes to consider and take advantage of heterogeneous wireless channel conditions and network topologies. \r\n\r\n- Thrust 3: Technology validation and experimentation: This thrust includes proof-of-concept prototyping efforts to validate the designs developed in this project.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts resulting from the activity in this project will include significant enhancement of video delivery mechanisms over wireless channels beyond the current state of the art. This of key importance since the total global mobile traffic was about 885 petabytes per month at the end of 2012, and is expected to keep increasing. As the storage capacity becomes cheaper, the techniques developed in this project will be able to alleviate the spectrum crunch by trading off memory for bandwidth. Industry outreach and dissemination will be done through Bell Labs Nokia and other industrial partners at NYU.  The PIs are committed to and have an excellent track record in increasing participation of as well as mentoring women and underrepresented minorities in the STEM fields. This grant will help to support these efforts.",
