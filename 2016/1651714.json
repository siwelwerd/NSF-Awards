The second is to provide a venue for statisticians and atmospheric and climate scientists to share ideas and facilitate collaboration aimed at understanding rare, high-impact climate and weather events.\r\n\r\nThe first day of the workshop will feature an introductory short course on the statistics of extremes, taught by Dan Cooley of Colorado State University.
