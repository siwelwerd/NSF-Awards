 "awd_abstract_narration": "The proposed project seeks financial support to support researcher participation in a workshop to be held September 13-15, 2016 at the University of Manchester, Manchester, UK. The Workshop will address research areas of a wide range of non-graphene 2D atomic layers such as phosphorene, transition metal di-chalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitride, tertiary compounds of carbo-nitrides, and complex oxides. The workshop should positively impact learning in the science and engineering disciplines through personnel exchange programs that are likely to catalyze from this workshop, including bi-lateral exchange of faculty, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows. Among the research challenges in the field of 2D layered materials are: a) devising techniques that can enable the scalable synthesis of these materials on multiple substrates, b) controlling layer number and defect density, c) understanding doping mechanisms and optimizing contacts for device research, d) utilizing interface-induced novel effects in planar and vertical heterostructures, e) developing predictive modeling and simulation techniques, and f) devising in situ and ex situ characterization techniques to measure material properties. This workshop will have significant broader impact by catalyzing potential international partnerships between leading researchers in the US and Europe to discuss broad directions for future research in this highly dynamic and interdisciplinary area. A final report detailing the discussion topics and conclusions/recommendations will also be posted.",

Participants have discussed a broad range of research topics related to 2D materials, allowing to highlight the complementarity of research activities and expertise across the Atlantic, as well as to identify the main issues of common interest such as access to dedicated infrastructure and the need to define materials characterisation standards. In addition, reporting of research results so that they can be broadly accessible and used (including by the private sector) as well as the challenge to identify most promising materials amongst the broad family of 2D materials have been emphasized. Specific actions and opportunities proposed by the participants are summarized in the report. The newly established grant mechanisms that enable exchanges between EU and US research groups were welcomed and the first applications have already been received and approved.
