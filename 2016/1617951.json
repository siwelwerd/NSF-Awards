 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many computational problems start with a model that is a mesh or graph drawn on a surface.  A classic example is the representation of a physical object for use in computer graphics systems by selecting points on the surface of the object and approximating the surface with triangles whose corners are the selected points:  the points become the nodes and the sides of the triangles become the edges of a graph and the graph can be viewed as drawn on the surface of the object.  When the surface is simpler, algorithms for manipulating a graph on the surface are more efficient; a surface is more complicated when it has features such as handles and holes.  A common way to deal with these features is to simplify the surface by cutting the surface open to remove the handles and holes.  \r\n\r\nThis project will develop accurate and efficient methods for simplifying surfaces in this way as well as for other closely related problems.  Because the problems are fundamental, new algorithms for them will provide efficient pre-processing tools for a wide range of applications.  The PIs will involve graduate students in the research and, building on earlier successes and the fostering of a welcoming research environment, endeavor to recruit students from underrepresented populations.\r\n\r\nThis project will address the above-described \"cut-graph\" problem as well as the problem of finding the minimum cycle-basis (a minimum-cost way to represent all the cycles in a graph) and the minimum homology-basis (a minimum-cost way to represent all the handles and holes in the surface on which the graph is drawn).  For graphs on surfaces, these problems are very closely related.  By considering these problems together, the PIs will develop fundamental techniques that will be translatable to other problems in these types of graphs.  Cycle bases behave significantly differently in graphs on trivial (handle-free) surfaces than in non-trivial surfaces.  For this reason, by further understanding the properties of surface graphs through the study of these problems, the PIs will provide the next step for algorithm design in surface graphs.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany objects can be represented as a set of triangles, squares or other simple shapes glued together, such as the skeletons of objects for rendering in computer graphics.  This research is interested in solving computational problems in these representations which are known as simplicial complexes.  Generally, the simpler the simplicial complex, the easier the computational problem.  For example, if at most two triangles can be glued along a single edge, the complex represents the surface of a 3D object.  Some surfaces are more complicated than others: a surface can be as simple as a sphere, or it can have many handles and tunnels.  In topology, we study the types of closed loops or cycles that you can draw on a surface or in a simplicial complex to better understand it.  Computational problems are typically more difficult on simplicial complexes on which many different types of cycles can be drawn.  For example, on the surface of a sphere all the cycles look the same. Thinking of two cycles as rubber bands stretched over the surface, you can slide the rubber bands until they overlap perfectly.  We call these two cycles homologous.  As another example, on the surface of a donut (a torus), a cycle going through the hole cannot be deformed across the surface to become a cycle going around the hole.  Mathematically, two such cycles describes the set of all possible cycles on the surface and we call it a homology basis.  The more complicated the simplicial complex, the more cycles there are in the homology basis.In this research, we developed algorithms to answer the following questions about homologous cycle and homology bases:    \n\nFor a given cycle, what is the shortest cycle in the simplicial complex that is homologous to it?\nFor a given simplicial complex, what is homology basis that is composed of the shortest set of cycles?\n\n\nAnswering question 1 is a step toward question 2, and an answer to question 2 provides a more precise description of a simplicial complex than an arbitrary homology basis that can be leveraged for more computationally efficient algorithms that involve the simplicial complex.  \n\nWhile these questions have been studied for surfaces, there had been, prior to this research, many fewer results for more general simplicial complexes, where cycles are more complicated than rubber bands.  Likewise, many problems that have been well studied in surfaces had not even been defined in simplicial complexes.  This research has shown that while some classic problems and their algorithms for surfaces generalize naturally to simplicial complexes, others become computationally intractable.\n\nThis research supported the PhD dissertation work of a student who, since this project was collaborative, had the opportunity to work with multiple professors at Oregon State University and the University of California at Irvine.nayyeri9:44 AM - 29 Nov\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Glencora Borradaile"
