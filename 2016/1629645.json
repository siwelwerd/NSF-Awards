The workshop will maintain and further refine the previous central thrusts of the meeting: to examine the state-of-the-art in high brightness beam physics and technology as it is applied in advanced accelerators and light sources. The choice of the location of the workshop indicates a continuing commitment to outreach to include a wider range of participants, including scientists from developing countries. The location of the workshop is also expected to help launch a new initiative that seeks to introduce the beginnings of light source infrastructure in the Caribbean basin. The workshop has obtained the endorsement of UNESCO and a broad spectrum of participants from the United States, Cuba, Latin America, Asia, and Europe is expected.\r\n\r\nThe award will be used to provide partial travel support for US students to attend the workshop.  The recipients of the travel support will be making presentations at the workshop.  Attendance of 18 US students will be facilitated by the funds provided by this award.  The workshop will be an excellent opportunity for young scientists to interact with more experienced researchers and their colleagues in the broader international scientific community.  This award is co-sponsored by the NSF's Physics Division and the Office of International Science and Engineering.",
