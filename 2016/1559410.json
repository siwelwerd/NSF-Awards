 "awd_abstract_narration": "Applied optics plays a critical role in experimental science and engineering research in fields as diverse as atomic physics and fluid dynamics.  Training the next generation of scientists and engineers in cutting-edge optical techniques is a national challenge that must be met with hands-on student participation in contemporary research.  Dr. Michael Lim of Rowan University will take 15 undergraduate students, between 2017-2019, to perform 10-week-long summer projects hosted by physics groups at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore.  NTU is a top-tier international university known for its outstanding science and engineering research.  Students will have unparalleled access to state-of-the-art laser/optical instrumentation and mentorship by Dr. Rainer Dumke and Dr. Claus-Dieter Ohl, well known international experts in their respective fields of atom optics and fluid flows.  The program is designed to immerse students in activities that include designing and constructing optical apparatus, and collecting and analyzing data.  Simultaneously, students will build the communication skills needed for future international collaboration.  Through mini-projects at Edmund Optics, Inc., they will also connect their academic work to industry, allowing them a first-hand look at the interconnectedness of academic research and international business.  A diverse student cohort will be recruited annually from Philadelphia-area institutions that include Rowan University, Rutgers University-Camden, Delaware State University, University of Delaware, Bryn Mawr College, and Temple University.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the strong optics education students at this consortium of schools, the selected cohort will be assigned summer projects in the Quantum Technology (Dumke) and Fluid Dynamics (Ohl) research groups, focusing on laboratory measurements in either ultra-cold atomic physics or modern fluid dynamics.  They will run projects that use optical manipulation or measurement to study laser-frequency stabilization, laser-cooled atoms near superconductors, pattern formation in microfluidic channels, and laser-produced shockwaves in liquids.   This research may result in the co-authorship of refereed journal articles, and all students will be expected to give presentations at scientific professional meetings in the U.S.  The scientific knowledge, technical skills, and experience in global collaboration that participants acquire will provide a competitive edge as students embark on their future career paths.",

This program targeted \"<em>the promise of optics and photonics [that] can be realized if the United States acts to cultivate this versatile scientific field through collaborative research and development activities</em>,\" as identified by the US National Research Council. [1] Successful applicants from Bryn Mawr College, Univ. of Delaware, Rowan Univ., Rutgers Univ.-Camden, and Temple Univ. prepared for travel and research through a journal club, orientation sessions, and a visit to Edmund Optics in Barrington, NJ to tour an optics fabrication and metrology facility. Students then joined research staff from about 20 different countries at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to perform experiments in atomic physics, quantum information, fluid dynamics (laser-induced cavitation and resonant acoustic bubble oscillation), and optical materials research (single-photon sources and detectors). Some students additionally completed a two-week mini-internship at Edmund Optics, Singapore, as a complementary introduction to the optics and photonics industry.<br /><br />The student researchers engaged in a wide range of lab work supervised by NTU Professors Rainer Dumke, Claus-Dieter Ohl, and Cesare Soci, developing expertise in areas such as laser cavitation and microsecond-scale image acquisition and analysis, saturated absorption spectroscopy, programmable micro-mirror arrays and laser holography for optical manipulation of ultracold atoms, atom interferometry, radio-frequency manipulation and readout of quantum bits (qubits), synthesis of perovskite quantum dots as single-photon sources, and simulation of plasmonic optical response for engineering efficient single-photon detectors. The general skills students acquired in practical lab optics, laser spectroscopy, computer control of instruments, computer simulation, signal processing, and image analysis, are transferable to many other pursuits in science and engineering.<br /><br />Students successfully contributed to the development of new technical capabilities through summer research; a few specific examples follow. One student designed, built and benchmarked a setup that produces arbitrary optical intensity patterns using a laser beam reflected from a programmable digital micromirror array. This enables programmable, dynamic optical trapping potentials for ultracold atoms. Another student developed transmon qubit-phase readout algorithms, ultimately writing code to execute two different methods for readout and assembling associated devices and instrumentation. A third student simulated surface patterning of superconducting nanowires for plasmonic enhancement of optical absorption. The result was a promising new design for fabricating a highly efficient single-photon detector that is now a candidate for experimental prototyping.<br /><br />PSIOPS-REU participants also received informal career mentoring from senior faculty, as well as intensive coaching in the development and delivery of research presentations at the end of the overseas phase. After the students returned to the US, this culminated in research presentations at the March Meetings of the American Physical Society, where a panel of professional physicists provided additional feedback to student presenters. The combined experience of foreign travel, high-level academic research, exposure to the optics industry, mentoring, and conference attendance was specifically designed to stimulate interest and enhance future pathways to success in STEM careers through optics-related training.<br /><br />Eight program alumni/ae entered or were accepted to MS and PhD programs in Physics, Material Science, and related fields at Dartmouth, Lehigh, Portland State, Rice, Stony Brook, UC San Diego, Univ. of Pennsylvania, and Yale. Seven participants have found employment in engineering or teaching at Accenture, Aerotek, Comcast, Clearview High School, Lockheed Martin, Northrup Grumman, and Planned Systems International. Among all participants in the PSIOPS-REU program (2017-2019), one is a veteran, 43% are women and 21% are Black or African American. This compares favorably to statistics gathered by the American Physical Society showing 22% of physics degrees awarded to women and 12% to all Underrepresented Minorities in the US in 2018.<br /><br
