 "awd_abstract_narration": "Empirical process theory, which originated in the fundamental question of how to estimate a probability distribution from sample data, has developed into a powerful set of tools and unifying methods for the study of the properties of a wide range of statistical procedures. This research project aims to broaden and deepen these tools and to develop additional methods. It is anticipated that this theoretical work will enable progress in several application areas, including sampling designs used in epidemiology and clinical trials, as well as models used for HIV-AIDS data. The project also involves training of graduate students and development of graduate level courses. \r\n\r\nThe investigator plans to study new statistical methods for shape-restricted models in univariate and multivariate settings. The shape restrictions to be studied include monotone, convex, log-concave, and log-convex functions. He aims to develop new basic empirical process tools and methods and to apply the new tools to problems involving shape-restricted inference, semiparametric models, bootstrap inference methods, and problems in high-dimensional statistics. The investigator intends also to introduce and evaluate new methods of estimation in semiparametric models based on complex sampling designs with missing data by design, and for estimation in semiparametric models defined by shape constraints.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nJon A. Wellner carried out research on several different topics, including:\n(1) estimation and inference methods under shape restrictions; (2) probability inequalities for empirical processes; (3) semiparametric models and problems in high-dimensional statistics; (4) inference for semiparametric models using complex sampling designs; (5) covariance inequalities and results for maximal density ratios.\n\nIn the area of topic (1), Wellner and former University of Washington graduate student Charles Doss developed new methods for inference about the mode of a log-concave distribution via inversion of likelihood ratio tests.  The new methods require no tuning parameter choices and seem to behave well relative to classical methods based on kernel estimation. Along the way, Doss and Wellner develop estimation methods for sub-families of the class of log-concave densities subject to symmetry or modal constraints.  Wellner, former University of Washington graduate student Nilanjana Laha, and current student Zhen Miao, introduced the classes of bi-s^*-concave distribution functions on the real line, extending work on bi-log-concave distribution functions by Duembgen, Kolesnyk, and Wilke (2017). A major finding of this work is a new family of confidence bands which account for the bi-$s^*$ shape constraint.  Wellner also collaborated with former UW graduate student Qiyang Han on studies of the rates of convergence of convex function estimators and the effect of envelopes on the rates of convergence of shape-constrained estimators more generally.\nIn the direction of topic (2), Wellner completed a study of Orlicz norm inequalities based on functions $\\psi(x) = exp(h(x))$ where $h$ is convex.  Particular choices of $h$ yield the ``Bennett Orlicz norm'' or the ``Bernstein Orlicz'' norm studied by van de Geer and Lederer (2013).   \nIn the direction of topic (3),  Wellner and former graduate student Qiyang Han studied nonparametric least squares estimators under very mild moment assumptions (only slightly stronger than existence of finite second moments) on the error distribution.  The new methods developed involve new multiplier inequalities for empirical processes.  The new multiplier inequalities enabled a study of the lasso estimator under considerably weakened moment conditions on the design matrix in the setting of a random design.  \nIn the area of topic (4),  Wellner and former graduate student Qiyang Han established new limit theory for finite-sampling empirical processes by showing that the requisite tightness condition is considerably easier to establish than had been previously thought. An especially important consequence is essentially that the tightness comes almost for free so that the crucial condition to verify becomes proof of the convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions of the process.  \nIn the direction of topic (5),  Wellner and Saumard studied a key monotonicity property due to Efron:  they used the new covariance formulas to extend Efron?s monotonicity property for independent log-concave measures, to the case of general measures on R^2.  In related work, Saumard and Wellner gave a new proof for an isoperimetric constant via covariance identities and a new ``two-sided'' Hardy inequality.  Klaassen and Wellner then showed that the two-sided Hardy inequality proved by Saumard and Wellner for continuous distribution functions $F$ continues to hold for arbitrary distribution functions.  Duembgen, Samworth and Wellner show that maximal density ratios dominate total variation distance when they are finite, and obtained new bounds for the maximal density ratios for a number of classical problems involving approximation of some complex distribution by some simpler distribution.  Duembgen and Wellner succeeded in bounding the maximal density ratio of the Poisson-Bernoulli distribution to the Poisson distribution with the same mean as long as that mean is no larger than 1, and conjecture that the new bound continues to hold when the mean is greater than 1.  \nIn general, research on most of these topics involved development of basic empirical process tools and methods, and applications of these new tools and methods to statistical problems concerning semiparametric models, shape restricted models, and missing data.  Applications include regression models for survival data with missing covariate data, studies of non- and semi-parametric maximum likelihood estimators used in AIDS research, new confidence bands for shape restricted inference, and both basic empirical process theory and new semiparametric estimation procedures for two-phase data dependent designs. The advances in inference methods for competing risks models are used to study causative effects of viral loading in HIV vaccine trials.  The developments in bivariate censored data are applied to studies of mother-to-child transmission of HIV-AIDS.  The work on two-phase data dependent designs has application to new designs with increased efficiency for clinical trials and case-cohort sampling in epidemiology.  The tools of empirical process theory allow investigations of many problems of current interest in other areas of statistics involving high-dimensional data and parameter spaces.  The research has benefitted education and human development by the training of graduate students and the inclusion of the resulting new statistical methods in statistics courses at the University of Washington and elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/21/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jon A Wellner"
