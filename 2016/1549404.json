 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project includes not only assistive technology for the severely motion-disabled, who currently find it impossible to use a touchscreen, but also many who are not officially diagnosed with a motion disability.  Initial sales to this wealthier, typically elderly, US audience will pay >$50, helping to fund company growth.  Phase I experiments will add new scientific insights in HCI.  Phase I will yield a low-cost accessory that, in large-scale production, will ultimately have a ~$10 price that is similar to the existing market for styli and texting gloves, which are of limited benefit to the motion-disabled, and more cost effective than accessories such as electronic pens.  This low-cost, single-chip accessory can be scaled up in manufacturing efforts to enfranchise hundreds of millions of motion-disabled individuals worldwide. The proposed device will be operating-system and device independent, and will require lower development costs than competing hardware such as electric pens. If the proposed technology were to be commercialized successfully at a reasonable price, millions in the US (and many times that worldwide) marginalized by the touchscreen revolution will be able to fully participate in the innovations these devices bring to society. \r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project has the potential to improve Human Computer Interaction (HCI) for (~34 million US) motion-disabled users who struggle with capacitive touchscreens.  These screens assume users' fingers act as intermittently connected capacitors. The motion-disabled are unable perform such gestures.  Software-only adaptations and the well-established accessories (styli or texting gloves) do not help the motion-disabled. This project combines an inexpensive hardware accessory, a custom chip and an extra-software-layer running on the touchscreen operating system (OS).  Many motion-disabled are low-income individuals who require low-cost, single-chip accessories?yet such chips have too much parasitic capacitance.  This project is designed to 1) demonstrate the feasibility of fabricating touchscreen accessories that reliably encode low-bandwidth information from the motion-disabled into the signals received by a capacitance touchscreen;  2) develop extra-software-layer applications that interface such accessories for motion disabilities in human-subject evaluation;  and 3) design a chip for such accessories that overcomes cost and parasitic-capacitance problems.  Feedback from human-subject and electronic measurements allow simultaneously optimization of three interrelated issues: hardware reliability, accessory form-factor, and the extra-software-layer functionality.  Results will include subjective and objective human-subject evaluations, accessory form factor, low-parasitic-capacitance integrated-circuit design, code, and OS/application interfacing techniques for such accessories.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMany millions of people in the US have motion disabilities (affecting control and stabilization of their arms and hands) from conditions like Parkinson's Disease, Essential Tremor and Arthritis.  They often feel cut off from family and friends due to the lack of their mobility. Sadly, they cannot place phone calls on a touchscreen phone, or visit with their family and friends on social media or texting because their motion disability prevents them from controlling a phone or tablet. People who depend on cell phones may not be able to make emergency phone calls and get medical counseling because the small virtual dialers require precise touches in order to dial.\n\n \n\nThis Phase I SBIR project developed a combination of a hardware button and software for Android 7.0 that allows a user with motion disability to select/activate apps; enter and select text;  dial phone numbers; scroll, magnify and rotate the view; manipulate images and do anything that a non-disabled user can do.\n\n \n\nThe software appears as a translucent layer on top of the underlying features of Android that are displayed on the screen.  The software receives all touch events, which prevents inadverent gestures from causing unintended invocation of those underlying features.  The user swabs the touchscreen to move an Aperture to select a coordinate.  Unlike conventional touchscreen gestures, swabbing works for the disabled user, who may take as much time as needed to arrive at the desired position.  Only then does the user push the button to invoke the desired action in the underlying app.  Until the button is pushed, no action occurs and the user's tremor cannot cause unwanted action.\n\n \n\nTo give the user full Android interaction, the software operates in three Modes that allow the disabled user to input the equivalent of a gesture that a non-disabled user can make via a single motion. The mode is identified both by a digit (1, 2 or 3) and a translucent color.  The digit indicates how many times the user needs to push the button before an action is invoked in the underlying app:  in Mode 1, each time the user pushes the button, a short tap at the location of the Aperture is sent to the underlying app; In Mode 2, the first push starts an arrow that extends while the user swabs the Aperture until the second push; In Mode 3, the first two pushes create an arrow, followed by swabbing to choose the position of a Pivot.  The size and color of the Pivot indicate how much magnification or demagnification occur. By positioning the Pivot colinearly with the arrow, zooming occurs; other Pivot positions cause rotation.  Special cases deal with additional gestures, like long taps and repeated scrolling.\n\n \n\nTwo versions of the button were developed.  One uses a wireless Bluetooth interface.  The other is a stylus that communicates (without needing a tablet or phone that uses Bluetooth) by encoding a signal with periodic interruption of the capacitive connection between the user's hand and the touchscreen.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/23/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark G Arnold"
