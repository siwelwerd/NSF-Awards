This goal will be accomplished by partially supporting the travel costs for U.S. Ph.D. students to attend the International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering, which is one of the flagship conferences of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. The conference attracts an international crowd that includes academics, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders.",
