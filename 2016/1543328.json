 "awd_abstract_narration": "The depletion of stratospheric ozone over Antarctica leads to abnormally high levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) from the sun reaching the surface of the ocean. This phenomenon is predicted to continue for the next half century, despite bans on ozone-destroying pollutants.  Phytoplankton in the near surface ocean are subjected to variable amounts of UVR  and contain a lot of lipids (fats).  Because phytoplankton are at the base of the food chain their lipids makes their way into the Antarctic marine ecosystem's food web.    The molecular structures of phytoplankton lipids are easily altered by UVR.   When this happens, their lipids can be transformed from healthy molecules into potentially harmful molecules(oxylipins) known to be disruptive to reproductive and developmental processes. This project will use state-of-the-art molecular methods to answer questions about extent to which UVR damages lipid molecules in phytoplankton, and how these resultant molecules might effect the food chain in the ocean near Antarctica.  \r\n\r\n\r\nLipid peroxidation is often invoked as consequence of increased exposure of phytoplankton to UVR-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS), but the literature is practically silent on peroxidized lipids and their byproducts (i.e. oxylipins) in the ocean.  In waters of the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP), spring-time blooms of diatoms contribute significantly to overall marine primary production.  Oxylipins from diatoms can be highly bioactive; their impact on zooplankton grazers, bacteria, and other phytoplankton has been the subject of intense study.  However, almost all of this work has focused on the production of oxylipins via enzymatic pathways, not by pathways involving UVR and/or ROS.  Furthermore, rigorous experimental work on the effects of oxylipins has been confined almost exclusively to pure cultures and artificial communities.  Thus, the true potential of these molecules to disrupt carbon cycling is very poorly-constrained, and is entirely unknown in the waters of the WAP.  Armed with new highly-sensitive, state-of-the-art analytical techniques based on high-mass-resolution mass spectrometry, the principal investigator and his research group have begun to uncover an exquisite diversity of oxylipins in natural WAP planktonic communities.  These techniques will be applied to understand the connections between UVR, ROS, oxylipins, and carbon cycling. The project will answer the question of how UVR, via ROS, affects oxylipin production by diatoms in WAP surface waters in controlled experiments conducted at a field station.  With the answer to this question in hand, the project will also seek to answer how this phenomenon impacts the flow of carbon, particularly the export of organic carbon from the system, during a research cruise. The level of UVR-induced stresses experienced by oxylipin-rich planktonic communities in the WAP is unique, making Antarctica the only location for answering these fundamental questions. Major activities will include laboratory experiments with artificial membranes and diatom cultures, as well field experiments with phytoplankton, zooplankton, and bacteria in WAP waters.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAntarctica's coastal waters are home to some of the most exciting and vital aquatic animals on Earth.  As winter transitions to summer and the sea-ice melts away, penguins, seals, and whales migrate into the area.  They are there to feed on the abundant plankton in the water, and to fatten up before winter when the plankton disappear. Animals need fat because it is rich in calories.  They eat fat-rich food to survive the winter, for reproduction, and to give them fuel for migration.  But where does this fat come from?  Our research is provided new information about fat in plankton, which is helping to answer that question.\n\n \n\nMicroscopic organisms in the ocean, called phytoplankton, are significant producers of fat. They store these fats in droplets inside their cells.  Phytoplankton are similar to plants.  They need sunlight and nutrients and grow in the spring and summer.  There are so many phytoplankton in the ocean off Antarctica that we thought fats might play a significant role in the food-web. Phytoplankton are at the base of the food web.  Krill, which are shrimp-like animals, eat phytoplankton, and they get fatter.  Krill, in turn, are eaten by penguins and whales.  Thus, the energy contained in fats made by phytoplankton ultimately makes its way up to the larger animals that make Antarctica such an important place.\n\n \n\nWe took samples of phytoplankton and other organisms in the ocean. We brought them to the laboratory to examine how much fat they contained. We also determined how quickly phytoplankton made fats.\n\n \n\nWe discovered that phytoplankton get fatter as winter gives way to summer.  It appears that the more light they get, the more fat they make.  This means that the phytoplankton in the surface are fatter than those even just 50 feet below the surface.  This might be one reason why krill feed so intensely near the surface: that is where their food is fattest and contains the most calories! \n\n \n\nOur research is relevant because the ocean near Antarctica is changing rapidly.  The amount of sea-ice is gradually going down as the Earth continues to warm.  Sea-ice blocks the sunlight that phytoplankton need.  If there is less ice and more sunlight, phytoplankton may contain more fat.  Whether this will help animals or not requires further research.  We hope to that our work convinces scientists that fats are essential and that they will continue to examine fats in the future. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin Van Mooy"
