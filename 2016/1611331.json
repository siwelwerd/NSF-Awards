 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nanomaterials, small particles consisting of only several thousand atoms and of only a few billionths of a meter in diameter, offer many opportunities for transformative science and technological applications. However, the lack of atomic precision during fabrication of nanometer-sized crystals restricts the ability to harness all the power of this broad and diverse class of materials. For example, a collection of real nanoparticles is always non-uniform and comprises particles with some variation in size within the group. Dr. Talapin is investigating how to eliminate this size variation and enable atomic precision in synthesis of nanoscale materials. Many practical applications, from flat-panel televisions to photodetectors and solar cells, will benefit from highly uniform, nearly atomically precise nanomaterials. Dr. Talapin is developing a technique called colloidal atomic layer deposition (c-ALD) to control the solution-based synthesis of nanomaterials using a sequence of two complementary self-limiting surface reactions. This concept is inspired by the success of gas-phase atomic layer deposition (ALD), which is widely used in microelectronics and other fields. Dr. Talapin's research has broader societal impact since it is directly relevant to the development of new technologically-relevant materials and has the potential to solve a fundamental problem that limits the pace of development for this broad class of materials. Dr. Talapin mentors undergraduate and high school students by helping them gain research experience. An important aspect of his outreach program focuses on education enrichment via science clubs and science nights for the local underrepresented African-American and Hispanic K-12 populations on Chicago's South Side. This project also supports the development and distribution of nanoscience educational resources accessible to the general public on the Talapin Lab website at the University of Chicago. \r\n\r\nDr. Talapin of the University of Chicago is supported by the Supramolecular and Nanochemistry (MSN) Program to develop colloidal atomic layer deposition (c-ALD) of nanoscaled materials with precise size dispersion. The project aims to eliminate inhomogeneous ensemble broadening by growing functional nanomaterials in a layer-by-layer fashion, starting from atomically defined clusters of different technologically important materials. The polydispersity of nanomaterials originates from a weak size dependence of the free energy related to the addition or removal of individual atoms to/from a nanoscale object. In this case, size distribution can only be controlled by kinetic factors. Both theoretical modeling and numerous experimental studies show that it would be difficult to improve homogeneity significantly by only kinetically controlling reaction products. Dr. Talapin is working on a paradigm-shifting approach for colloidal synthesis of nanomaterials with minimal, ideally no, size distribution. The goal is to establish means to thermodynamically control nanomaterials synthesis using a sequence of two complementary self-limiting surface reactions. This concept is inspired by the success of gas-phase atomic layer deposition (ALD) widely used in microelectronics and other fields. Preliminary studies show that the ALD concept can be implemented in solution and, when applied to colloidal nanomaterials, enables layer-by-layer growth of crystalline lattices with close to atomic precision. Eliminating polydispersity at the ensemble level is arguably one of the most important challenges in nanomaterial synthesis. One can draw an analogy between size distribution of nanomaterials and the polydispersity index (PDI) of polymers. The discovery of advanced living polymerization techniques, which nearly eliminate chain polydispersity, has been among the most important recent developments in macromolecular chemistry. Dr. Talapin incorporates activities with broader societal impact into his research program.  He actively trains undergraduate and high school students in his lab by giving them research experience opportunities. He also develops course modules and nanoscience educational resources applicable to K-12 students which are accessible to the general public on the Talapin Lab website at the University of Chicago. These hands-on labs and experiments are also used in outreach and education enrichment events for the local underrepresented African-American and Hispanic K-12 populations in on Chicago's South Side.",

In contrast to molecular systems, which are defined with atomic precision, nanomaterials generally show heterogeneity in size, shape, and composition. The sample inhomogeneity detrimentally affect practically every property of functional nanomaterials. The lack of atomistic control during nanomaterial synthesis also limits our ability to perform ?total-synthesis? of complex nano-heterostructures with precisely arranged multiple components and fine-tuned properties. To address these fundamental issues, the research team developed the c-ALD method with stationary reactant phases. This technique enables a significant reduction of inhomogeneity for nanomaterials without compromising their structural perfection.</p>\n<p>The scientific activities supported by this grant can be divided in four complimentary areas: (1) development of colloidal atomic layer deposition (c-ALD) with stationary reactant phases for precise chemicals synthesis of functional nanomaterials, (2) the use of new synthesis methods for preparation of previously inaccessible nano-heterostructures; (3) spectroscopic investigation of novel nanomaterials enabled by c-ALD methods; (4) development of direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials (DOLFIN) for precise positioning and patterning of functional nano-heterostructures.</p>\n<p>In the first area of research, we developed new methods for synthesis of nanomaterials with practically no compositional inhomogeneity (Figure 1). The team demonstrated epitaxial nano-heterostructures of unprecedented complexity, enabling bandgap and strain engineering in colloidal nanomaterials with near atomistic accuracy. The developed methodology has been applied to the synthesis of first atomically precise CdSe molecular wires, synthesis of novel family of atomically precise CdSe nanoplatelets with the electronic structure of quantum wells, synthesis of first colloidal CdSe quantum rings, and development of novel synthetic routes for semiconducting arsenide nanomaterials. These new materials have been systematically studied using state-of-the-art spectroscopic techniques and computational methods. The elimination of inhomogeneous spectral broadening through improved synthetic control enabled observation of previously unknown effects and correlations. For example, the research team observed nonmonotonic dependence of Auger recombination rate on shell thickness in quantum well nano-heterostructures. The team also observed and described, for the first time, the conduction band fine structure in colloidal monodisperse HgTe quantum dots.</p>\n<p>In parallel with improving synthetic methodology for nanomaterial synthesis, the research team developed the method for direct optical lithography of functional inorganic nanomaterials termed DOLFIN. This approach for high-resolution and high-fidelity additive patterning of solution-processed nanomaterials and quantum dots is critical for the transition from proof-of-concept individual devices to real-world, systems-level applications.

This NSF award supported the training of six graduate students, one postdoc, three undergraduate students, and resulted in four PhD theses.</p>\n<p>Under this award, the research group continued to organize activities to share enthusiasm for science with community members. We focus on classroom engagement, out-of-school time science activities, and help organize large-scale outreach special events in Chicago South Side public schools. To help foster classroom engagement, graduate students and postdocs hold weekly science clubs at Murray Language K?8 Academy and Carter G. Woodson South K?8 Elementary. We also run annual family science nights at Langston Hughes STEM K?8 Elementary and at Murray Language Academy (Figure 3). The goal has been to make science fairs more interactive and inclusive for all those participating and further engage older students to run their own hands-on activities and demonstrations. Besides the weekly science clubs and annual science nights, we have started to increase options for out-of-school-time activities, including weekend and summer break events when school science clubs or nights are not possible. We partnered with UChicago MRSEC to implement summer workshops intensively focused on topics relevant to the research funded by this grant. In Summer 2018, we ran a pilot workshop once a week for four weeks at UChicago on 3D modelling and printing for 15 students (grades 4?10, 100% underrepresented minorities) from Murray Language Academy and Woodson South. We then significantly expanded this workshop in Summer 2019 and were able to hold two week-long all-day sessions. Our ultimate goal is to introduce students to the interdisciplinary nature of chemistry and physics and expose underrepresented minorities and low-income youth to STEM fields at younger ages.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/04/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Dmitri&nbsp;V&nbsp;Talapin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1611331/1611331_10437257_1578113851653_Figure1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1611331/1611331_10437257_1578113851653_Figure1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Colloidal Atomic Layer Deposition\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1611331/1611331_10437257_1578113851653_Figure1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Colloidal Atomic Layer Deposition\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
