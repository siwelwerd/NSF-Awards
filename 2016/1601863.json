Riviere and Eugene B. Fabes by focusing on recent developments in analysis, especially in the field of partial differential equations. The 2016 program will feature four principal speakers (Andrea Bertozzi, Fanghua Lin, Jonathon Mattingly, and Roman Vershynin), each of whom will deliver a two-hour lecture. The program allows ample time for informal discussion among the participants.",
