 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Village of Hoosick Falls in New York recently discovered unsafe concentrations of Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) in its public water system.  Faculty members at Bennington College will offer a new course, \"Hoosick Falls Water Crisis,\" to provide undergraduate students with key analytic skills and field research experience in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields related to this real-time disaster.  The course will be co-taught by a social scientist, a chemist, and a geoscientist and will draw on methodologies and concepts within anthropology, chemistry, and geology to equip undergraduates to conduct urgent environmental research in times of crisis.  This project will also produce a dataset for the community of Hoosick Falls, NY.  Three wide-ranging broader impacts are anticipated.  First, the students and researchers will collect independent data on PFOA concentrations in residential wells, resulting in a dataset that will help characterize the origin, extent, and trajectory of PFOA.  Second, students will assist faculty members in preparing presentations of the findings to the community, which will not only serve to inform the public, but will also help strengthen students' communication skills and help them better connect their scientific knowledge to societal outcomes.  Finally, the faculty researchers plan to develop and distribute teaching and learning materials on PFOA for inclusion in postsecondary STEM curricula. \r\n\r\nUnderstanding the Hoosick Falls Water Crisis seeks to effect engaged student learning around the Hoosick Falls water crisis in order to provide students with robust training and experience in monitoring groundwater contamination and generate preliminary independent data that will help characterize the origin, extent, and trajectory of the PFOA groundwater plume around Hoosick Falls, NY.   The guiding educational research question is: How can environmental research on a local public crisis enhance the STEM curriculum for undergraduate students? Specifically, the researchers are studying how training students in environmental chemistry and hydrogeology and equipping them to apply those discipline-based skills to help produce key data on a local crisis will influence student enrollment and retention in STEM fields.  The researchers hypothesize that hands-on experience in meaningful environmental research will demonstrate the value of STEM fields in a liberal arts education and enhance student outcomes within STEM for both STEM and non-STEM majors. Evaluation will occur using (1) pre- and post-assessments that will measure student attitudes towards and aptitude in environmental chemistry and hydrology, (2) enrollment and course performance data, and (3) student reflections.",

This happened primarily through a new class we designed and offered entitled &ldquo;Understanding PFOA.&rdquo; This class, which was open to both concerned students and local residents, offered a primer on the chemical properties, environmental pathways, and social concerns of PFOA. Co-taught by an anthropologist, a chemist, and a geologist, this class was offered in the spring semester and fall semester of 2015. Beyond training students in the science of PFOA, this class also acted as a venue and vehicle for researching PFOA in our region and producing meaningful data on the trajectory and extent of the contamination. Extending learning from the classroom to the impacted region, we gathered questions from the community about PFOA and then equipped faculty and student research teams to research those questions and produce independent data on them. This project produced a unique environmental dataset on PFOA contamination that spoke directly to community concerns and helped clarify the problem for impacted residents. By so doing, this project not only trained students in the science of PFOA, it also demonstrated the civic value of science in times of environmental uncertainty. Although this was an exploratory project, our preliminary measures indicate this project succeeded greatly in generating new enthusiasm for and commitment to STEM training among undergraduates at a liberal arts college.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;The college students who enrolled in the project-supported course &ldquo;Understanding the PFOA Water Crisis&rdquo; during Spring 2016 and Fall 2016 regularly commented on the pivotal experience of seeing the real-world implications of their classroom learning. After learning about the chemistry and hydrogeology of PFOA in class and then traveling into Bennington, VT and Hoosick Falls, NY to collect samples, students routinely made comments like:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&ldquo;These trips brought the issue to life.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not talking about the problem, we&rsquo;re seeing the problem.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&ldquo;I understood the readings on PFOA in class, but now that we&rsquo;re in the community I understand why they matter.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re seeing the human side of the science. The human dimension changes how I understand the articles and textbooks we&rsquo;ve read.&rdquo;</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">&ldquo;I need to take more science classes.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Pre- and post- assessments of these students also indicated a noted uptick in students&rsquo; &ldquo;familiarity with&rdquo; and &ldquo;interest in&rdquo; chemistry and geology, both for their own educational goals and as potential vocations. Although more difficult to quantify, community interest in and media coverage of this project helped raise the profile of science education at Bennington College. In addition, citizens and state officials have praised the work of our students, giving them a new sense of pride and purpose in their own formative scientific work. The VT DEC Commissioner called the RAPID project &ldquo;a great resource&rdquo; and &ldquo;a very strong partner in helping us answer all the questions we have about PFOA.&rdquo; These encouraging early results indicate the need for further research on how equipping the science classroom as a civic resource may improve STEM learning and retention.</p>\n<p>In more concrete terms, this project trained over 40 undergraduate students from Bennington College and 12 local residents (including teachers, nurses, and journalists) in the chemical properties, environmental pathways, and policies considerations of PFOA. Those students were also trained in the research protocols required to produce data on PFOA in accordance with EPA methods and how to interpret that data in relation to different federal and state health guidance levels. PI and Co-PI&rsquo;s were invited regularly to report on their findings at public meetings on PFOA in NY and VT, met with state officials, and engaged local high schools as well. PI and Co-PI&rsquo;s were also featured extensively in news coverage of PFOA, often appearing in newspaper, radio, and television reports to translate the science of PFOA for public audiences. This project also enabled Bennington College to form a new network of collaboration with other colleges and universities in Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t
