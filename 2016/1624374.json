 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Introductory Physics for Life Science (IPLS) Portal will enhance the education of hundreds of thousands of life science students each year by providing engaging and effective IPLS instructional materials and helping IPLS instructors use these materials. This collaborative effort of the American Association of Physics Teachers and eight colleges and universities, including a community college and a Hispanic-serving institution, will create an open-source, peer-reviewed, and innovatively structured environment for IPLS content. Initially containing materials from multiple NSF-funded research and development projects, the Portal will become a development platform for IPLS curricula. The site will serve as both an archive and a dissemination tool, including a course-building interface for faculty. Instructors will be supported in creating innovative and individualized courses, mixing and matching from multiple sources tuned to their needs, offering a flexible and low-cost alternative to traditional textbooks.  \r\n\r\nMany of the objectives and features of the project are innovative.  Hence, the project also includes research components of four critical and interacting elements: IPLS content, IPLS pedagogy, the organizational structure of the site, including tagging and taxonomy of all elements for appropriate selection to meet the needs of individual users, and the user interface. Three overlapping research teams will carry out this work: the User-Centered Design team, the Instructional Content Design team, and the Community-Building and Professional-Development team. This project focuses on engaging and expanding three communities: (1) physics and biology education researchers, (2) IPLS contributors, and (3) IPLS adopters wanting to use and adapt existing IPLS materials.  Merging and expanding the efforts of these communities will occur through a combination of workshops, online support communities, and research to advance the understanding of faculty professional development for IPLS education. The IPLS-Portal infrastructure, once developed, could be used to provide a community-sourcing environment for other STEM disciplines.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Living Physics Portal, the product of a multi-institutional project, is a curated, dynamic, online repository of shared resources for teaching Introductory Physics for Life Science (IPLS) courses, with a community arm for pedagogical support and working groups.  Faculty can obtain curricular materials from and contribute to the Portal and share feedback from users.  An editorial board maintains quality oversight for categorization and inclusion in the contributed collections.\n\nThe Portal provides physics educators who may be less familiar with the life sciences with resources for teaching the physics of living processes and biomedical applications.   Life-oriented physics connections are typically absent from the traditional introductory physics course, but life science students are now the dominant population taking introductory physics courses.  Students preparing to go into biology or health fields need to see the relevance of physics to their future careers and interests.  The resources of the Portal will improve the teaching of life science students in terms of content, affect and pedagogical methods.  \n\nTo facilitate user adaptation of materials, contributions in editable formats are encouraged. Users are also encouraged to submit their adaptations back to the portal. Curricular materials can range from whole courses to a single lab or problem set.    All contributors are prompted to categorize their materials, to facilitate effective search by users.   The categories include physics topic, life science topic, and activity type (e.g., lab, homework, exam, in-class activity, etc.).   The site was seeded with physics for life science curricular materials from five institutions that have been productive in this area for many years, Mercy College among them.     \n\nThere are three tiers of collections of curricular resources called libraries: the Community, Vetted and Peer-Reviewed library respectively, in order of instructional support, access and editorial review.
