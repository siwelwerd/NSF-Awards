 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern Ocean plays a key role in modulating the global carbon cycle, but the size and even the sign of the global ocean flux terms of the atmospheric burden of man-made CO2 are still uncertain. This is in part due to the lack of measurements in this remote region of the world ocean.  This project continues a multi-year time series of shipboard chemical measurements in the Drake Passage to detect changes in the ocean carbon cycle and to improve the understanding of mechanisms driving natural variability and long-term change in the Southern Ocean.\r\n\r\nThis project is a continuation of collection of upper ocean measurements of the underway surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), using frequent ferry crossings of the Drake Passage by the RV/AS LMGould, the USAP supply ship. Overall, more than 200 transects over the past decade (since 2002) have now been accumulated of pCO2 profiles, along with discrete samples for other parameters of interest in studying the ocean carbonate system such as total CO2 (TCO2) values, isotopic (13C/12C and 14C/12C) ratios in surface TCO2.  The Drake Passage data are made readily available to the international science community and serve as both validation and constraints of remotely sensed observations and numerical coupled earth systems models.",

Despite its importance, the spatial and temporal variability of key biogeochemical fluxes remain poorly known partly due to a lack of surface ocean data. The Drake Passage is a 780 km gap between the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) and the southern tip of South America that represents one of the best-sampled regions of the Southern Ocean for marine biogeochemistry thanks to underway sampling from the Antarctic Research Supply Vessel (ARSV) Laurence M. Gould. The focus of this study was both to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of marine biogeochemical parameters and improve understanding of mechanisms driving natural variability and long-term change of these parameters within the Southern Ocean. Several major contributions of this study during the grant period from September 1, 2016 to August 31, 2022 are described below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More than 190,000 measurements of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in surface water (pCO<sub>2surf</sub>) were made from the ARSV Gould over the grant period. Of these pCO<sub>2surf</sub> observations, over 52,000 were made during the cold season months of May through October when conditions in the Southern Ocean are harsh and pCO<sub>2surf</sub> observations within global databases are limited. pCO<sub>2surf</sub> observations made from the ARSV Gould were quality-controlled and submitted annually to the Surface Ocean CO<sub>2</sub> Atlas (SOCAT). pCO<sub>2surf</sub> data were also included in the observation-based estimates of global air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> flux published annually by the Global Carbon Project. Discrete surface water samples for macronutrients, total CO<sub>2</sub> (TCO<sub>2</sub>), and the stable carbon isotopic composition of TCO<sub>2</sub> (T<sup>13</sup>CO<sub>2</sub>) were collected on approximately one quarter of all Drake Passage transits over the grant period. These discrete measurements fully characterize the carbonate system and allow estimation of important carbon fluxes within the surface ocean.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An important aspect of ship-based pCO<sub>2surf</sub> sampling like that from the ARSV Gould is that these observations are irregularly distributed in space and time but are commonly used to make estimates of surface fluxes at the ocean basin scale on a monthly basis. In this case, it is important to investigate how representative a subregion like the Drake Passage is of the broader Southern Ocean especially given the unique physical ocean circulation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) through this narrow constriction. Fay et al. (2018) analyzed the Drake Passage pCO<sub>2surf</sub> observations together with pCO<sub>2surf</sub> observations from other ocean regions within the Southern Ocean and found that the Drake Passage is representative of the broader region both in terms of seasonality and long-term trends.

Brown et al. (2019) used these observations together discrete water samples collected during the annual Palmer Long-Term Ecologcial Research (LTER) cruise to study long-term change in air-sea CO<sub>2</sub> flux and mechanisms driving this change. This analysis found a fivefold increase in CO<sub>2</sub> uptake in summer over the past 25 years linked to dramatic changes in mixed layer depth, biological production and species composition of phytoplankton blooms. This study also found a strong north-south gradient in both CO<sub>2</sub> uptake and biological production with the most profound change observed in the southern LTER grid. Improved understanding of the mechanisms driving CO<sub>2</sub> uptake may help predict future change in the marginal sea ice zone surrounding Antarctica.</p>\n<!-- @font-face \t{font-family:\"MS Mincho\"; \tpanose-1:2 2 6 9 4 2 5 8 3 4; \tmso-font-alt:\"&#65325;&#65331; &#26126;&#26397;\"; \tmso-font-charset:78; \tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Cambria; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Times; \tpanose-1:0 0 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1342185562 0 0 415 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Cambria\",serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\"; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}p \t{mso-style-priority:99; \tmso-margin-top-alt:auto; \tmargin-right:0in; \tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; \tmargin-left:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:10.0pt; \tfont-family:Times; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\"; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Cambria\",serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\"; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} --><!-- @font-face \t{font-family:\"MS Mincho\"; \tpanose-1:2 2 6 9 4 2 5 8 3 4; \tmso-font-alt:\"&#65325;&#65331; &#26126;&#26397;\"; \tmso-font-charset:78; \tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1791491579 18 0 131231 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:\"Cambria Math\"; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:3 0 0 0 1 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Cambria; \tpanose-1:2 4 5 3 5 4 6 3 2 4; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:roman; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1073743103 0 0 415 0;}@font-face \t{font-family:Times; \tpanose-1:0 0 5 0 0 0 0 2 0 0; \tmso-font-charset:0; \tmso-generic-font-family:auto; \tmso-font-pitch:variable; \tmso-font-signature:-536870145 1342185562 0 0 415 0;}p.MsoNormal, li.MsoNormal, div.MsoNormal \t{mso-style-unhide:no; \tmso-style-qformat:yes; \tmso-style-parent:\"\"; \tmargin:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:12.0pt; \tfont-family:\"Cambria\",serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\"; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}p \t{mso-style-priority:99; \tmso-margin-top-alt:auto; \tmargin-right:0in; \tmso-margin-bottom-alt:auto; \tmargin-left:0in; \tmso-pagination:widow-orphan; \tfont-size:10.0pt; \tfont-family:Times; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\"; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\";}.MsoChpDefault \t{mso-style-type:export-only; \tmso-default-props:yes; \tfont-family:\"Cambria\",serif; \tmso-ascii-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-ascii-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-fareast-font-family:\"MS Mincho\"; \tmso-fareast-theme-font:minor-fareast; \tmso-hansi-font-family:Cambria; \tmso-hansi-theme-font:minor-latin; \tmso-bidi-font-family:\"Times New Roman\"; \tmso-bidi-theme-font:minor-bidi;}div.WordSection1 \t{page:WordSection1;} --><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/12/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;R&nbsp;Munro</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
