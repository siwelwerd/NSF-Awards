 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cascading outages are complicated series of dependent failures that progressively weaken the large-scale electric power grid that transmits and distributes electric power to the nation. These cascading outages happen occasionally and can cause widespread blackouts, with up to tens of millions of people affected. The risk of cascading blackouts is present and could even increase because of the aging of power system infrastructure, severe weather events, increased variability due to the integration of renewable energy sources, and new threats such as cyber and physical attacks. Given the tremendous economic and societal impacts of blackouts, it is imperative to model and monitor the interactions and propagation of cascading outages, as well as develop effective mitigation techniques to reduce the risk of their occurrence. The causes of cascading outages are diverse and very complicated. However, the large amount of historical outage data collected by electric utilities provides an opportunity for new analysis of cascading outages. This project will use this data to understand the propagation and interactions of cascading outages, advance the monitoring of high-risk operating conditions, and provide engineering principles to reduce outage propagation. The research contributes to the grand national challenge of improving resilience of critical infrastructure systems by enhancing the resilience of power transmission and distribution grids against cascading blackouts. The project provides unique multi-disciplinary training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students that combine research work and education.\r\n\r\nThe project will pioneer data-based approaches for extracting insights and actionable information from the considerable data already available to utilities. The outage data will be clustered using big data learning techniques to reveal patterns of similar outages. New models will characterize key aspects of complicated outage interactions. For example, how outages affect one another will be expressed as a network of interactions between power grid components. Data will be used to identify observable correlates of high-risk cascading conditions from the historical data, so that mitigation schemes for cascading events can be applied only when needed. Finally, the new models and data will be used to develop a framework for effective monitoring and mitigation. Since large transmission blackouts are high risk due to their catastrophic impact on society, and the smaller distribution blackouts are frequent, the research team will analyze outage dependencies and cascading using recorded data from both the transmission and distribution power grids. Prototype software will be developed for processing data, identifying model parameters and key metrics, and performing risk-based and data-driven analysis of cascading outages. The project integrates engineering and science approaches from data analysis, risk analysis, complex networks, and power systems engineering to mitigate blackout risk.",

We also studied how line outages propagate to further line outages in the utility data. We described these interactions statistically to get a new Markovian influence graph that encodes the probabilities of transitions between line outages. The influence graph can be mathematically analyzed to predict the critical lines that are most involved in large blackouts. The influence graph has the key advantage of allowing the effect of upgrading the critical lines to be analyzed and readily tested, which is not available from the observed data. Indeed, after upgrading the critical lines, influence graph suggested that these upgrades could mitigate large blackouts by reducing the probability of large cascades. (2)&nbsp;It is challenging to simulate the cascading line outages that can follow initial damage to the electric power transmission system from extreme events such as earthquakes or extreme weather. Instead of model-based simulation, we propose using the new Markovian influence graph driven by historical utility data to sample the cascades. The sampling method encompasses the rare, large cascades that contribute greatly to the blackout risk. This suggested new approach contributes a high-level simulation of cascading line outages that is driven by standard utility data. (3) Individual transmission line outage rates are used for many reliability calculations, but in historical data the counts of outages for the more reliable lines are low and the corresponding estimated outage rates are highly uncertain. We applied Bayesian hierarchical model methods to get better estimates of outage rates by exploiting the various ways different lines are partially similar. This is useful to detect increases in line outage rates over time in lines requiring maintenance, quantify the effect of bad weather on outage rates, and show the effect of outage rate uncertainty on basic reliability calculations. (4) It is useful to be able to quantify electrical distribution system resilience based on historical performance. We analyzed 6 years of outage data from a distribution utility company, containing over thirty thousand outages. We are quantifying the system resilience by statistically modeling the system outaging and restoration processes as separate processes that overlap in time so that resilience metrics can be extracted from real data. One application is to provide restoration times to customers with a degree of certainty to allow utilities to offer better advice to their customers about blackout duration. (5) We proposed stochastic optimization approaches to enhance distribution grid?s resilience against climatic hazards, better prepare grids for upcoming events, and quickly restore electricity service after large-scale outages caused by extreme weather events. The above advances in understanding and analyzing power system data can help build a stronger power system that supplies more reliable electricity to millions of Americans and supports a prosperous US economy.</p>\n<p>In addition, the project generated three main impacts on education: (1) Four graduate students have been supported by this project, including three females and one African American female student. (2) The PIs developed new graduate courses in power distribution system analysis and resilient network analysis. The distribution system course materials are publicly available at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wzy.ece.iastate.edu/Teaching.html\">http://wzy.ece.iastate.edu/Teaching.html</a>&nbsp;(3) The PI organized a tutorial entitled ?Power System Resilience: Fundamentals, Analytical and Planning Tools, and Industry Practices? at the 2019 Innovative Smart Grid North American conference to introduce basics, research advances and industry practice in power system resilience, which was attended by more than 50 people from academia and industry.
