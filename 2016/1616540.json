 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Milky Way Galaxy is our home in the universe.  The Milky Way is our most important reference for understanding the hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe around us. It is the only galaxy where we can observe individual stars, like our sun, in detail. However, there remain fundamental unanswered questions about the Milky Way and the structure we see today. We still do not know the mass of our Galaxy to within a factor of two. The most accepted model for how galaxies form is that galaxies grow by merging with smaller satellite galaxies.  The investigators will check this model by optical observations of ancient stars in the outer parts of the Milky Way, called the Halo. Using optical spectra, the investigators will measure the abundance of elements in these stars, which can tell us about the original, smaller, galaxies in which those old stars were born. When combined with other observations of these stars, the investigators will be able to answer basic questions about the history of our own Milky Way galaxy.\r\n\r\nThe deep spectroscopy of stars in the galactic halo add line-of-sight velocity, chemical abundance information and improved distance estimates to the proper motions for these stars.   The investigators' observations will determine the three components of the velocity, three components of each star's position in the Galaxy and a critical seventh dimension elemental abundances of the star. The spectroscopy and proper motions will be measured for main sequence stars as distant as 90 kpc. In total, this program will obtain spectra for 450 main sequence halo stars over 11 different lines of sight in the halo. These data contain unique information about the growth of the Milky Way's stellar halo and accretion of satellites, which will be used to reconstruct the mass accretion history of our Galaxy. Furthermore, the full phase-space information will be used to measure the total mass of the Milky Way; an important, yet poorly constrained, astrophysical quantity. \r\n\r\nThe transverse velocity information from the investigator's proper motion data will be used to measure the velocity anisotropy of distant halo stars. The velocity anisotropy is a major source of systematic uncertainty in our knowledge of the total mass of the Milky Way. The investigators will search the multi-dimensional data for substructure in the distant halo, especially substructure from low luminosity satellites. The tidal remnants of these dwarf galaxies have been hidden from previous searches. Measuring the number of low-luminosity halo progenitors will test models for the connection between dark matter sub-halos and dwarf satellite galaxies. This is an important consistency test of the predictions of cosmological galaxy formation models. From the three dimensions of velocity, the investigators will measure the orbits of the progenitor systems that were accreted into the halo. From the metallicities, the luminosities of the progenitors can be estimated. The abundances of the alpha-elements will be measured for the brighter stars in the sample and used to estimate the accretion times of the satellites. The distributions of orbits, accretion times and luminosities of the progenitors defines the accretion history of our Galaxy's halo. \r\n\r\nTheir outreach plan includes bringing in high school students via the UC Santa Cruz Science Internship Program (SIP).  High school SIP interns work with their mentors on research projects, and past interns have presented papers at Astronomical Society meetings and have been co-authors on refereed publications. The two graduate students will mentor the students in collaboration with the investigators.  This will give the graduate students experience in non-classroom teaching. Graduate students will develop a Python-based research methods module for high school students that draws from the research program. The investigators will work to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields through their participation in programs like SIP, Research Methods, the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science and the Project for Inmate Education in the Santa Cruz county jail.",

The depth of our sample and accuracy of the proper motions of our faint targets make our sample unique even with the availability of data from the Gaia mission.\n\n\nIn order to measure accurate line of sight velocities for our halo stars we created a hierarchical Bayesian model to account for the calibration uncertainties of the many individual observations required for our faint targets.   The UC Santa Cruz graduate students supported by this grant mentored high school students on research project related to the HALO7D observational program as part of the UCSC Summer Internship Program (SIP).   The student projects were on measuring the quality of the spectroscopic data, comparing the performance of different data reduction packages and designing an optimized spectroscopic observing program. The goal of the program is to introduce students to research as a path to continuing on in STEM fields in college. \n\n\nAnalysis of the kinematics of the Milk Way halo show that all our lines of sight are dominated by a kinematically \"hot\" halo, with no detection of kinematic clustering of stars accreted from a dwarf satellite of our Galaxy and not yet completely mixed into the halo.  Furthermore, using just the line of sight information the kinematic properties of the halo appear homogeneous across our four lines of sight.  Analysis of the three-dimensional kinematics, however, is more revealing.  The combination of proper motions and line of sight velocities in our HALO7D sample allow us to measure the velocity anisotropy, the ratio of radial to tangential motion of stars in the halo.  The velocity anisotropy is shaped by the number, orbits and times that satellites were accreted by the Milky Way to create its stellar halo.  Analyzing the velocity anisotropy together for all four our our lines of sight, we do not find any change with distance. But we do find that the anisotropy varies significantly between our four lines of sight, suggesting that the halo is not well mixed at the average distance of our sample.  This is the signature of the satellite accretion events that happened late enough in our Galaxy's formation that they are not yet disolved into the homogeneous, smooth halo.  Our comparisons with the stellar halos of two simulated galaxies like the Milky Way reveals similar variation in the anisotropy across the sky, demonstrating that the anisotropy can be used to characterize the accretion history of our Galaxy. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/08/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Constance M Rockosi"
