The analysis will address questions of the relative contribution of energy and momentum transfer from different sources. A long-term database of wind profiles will be developed and made available to the community to be used for testing of complex models.\r\n\r\nThis study will advance the understanding of ion-neutral coupling and energy, mass and momentum transfer between the magnetosphere, thermosphere, and atmosphere, and will investigate auroral effects on lower thermospheric winds. Case studies will be used to examine events of strong atmospheric or auroral forcing. The long-term data base will provide information about trends in lower thermospheric winds and which forcing mechanisms are most responsible for long-term variability.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Poker Flat radar in Alaska has been operating routinely for more than a decade.  The radar measurements of the electron densities and ion motions therefore cover more than a full eleven-year solar cycle.  Although the measurements are of the charged particle motions, the motion of the uncharged neutral background atmosphere can be calculated from those measurements in the altitude range between 90 and 120 km with good height resolution.  The latter altitude range is particularly interesting because it covers the transition height where forcing driven by electric fields from the magnetosphere start to become important, particularly during active auroral conditions.  The primary goal of the study was to analyze the average inferred neutral flow velocities measured by the Poker Flat radar as a function of height.  We focused on the month of June for each year in the solar cycle since the long period of daylight in that month enhances the electron densities and improves the signal-to-noise for the measurements.  The resulting average 24-hour flow variation for each year showed a notable repeatable pattern from one year to the next.  In addition, the flows above 110 km showed a dominant vortical component, which is a characteristic of the acceleration associated with the magnetospheric electric fields that have a rotational pattern.  Below 110 km the flows showed a mixture of divergent and rotational flow, which is the expected characteristic for a flow dominated by atmospheric tides.  The results suggest that there is a transition in the dynamics and a change in the forces primarily responsible for the characteristics of the flow across the lower E region of the ionosphere, even in the average flow that includes a range of auroral activity levels.  Some simple comparisons between the observed flows and those predicted by numerical models were carried out and indicated the usefulness of such comparisons as a means of understanding the dynamics of that critical altitude range in more detail.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/28/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Miguel F Larsen"
