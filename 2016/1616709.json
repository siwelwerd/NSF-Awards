 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this program is to measure the signal of hydrogen (HI) 21cm wavelength emission originating during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and redshifted to very low radio frequencies (about 70 MHz).  The EoR was a period when new stars and black holes transformed the universe from being largely neutral to being largely ionized, and is one of the last frontiers in the history of the universe yet to be explored. Broader impacts include training of graduate students and postdocs in astronomical instrumentation.  In addition, he team will develop open-source, online, active-learning tools using the new technology of Jupyter notebooks served from the Cloud. This will enable presentation of interactive mixed text and graphical materials that execute in browser windows.  The technology is potentially applicable to all STEM fields.\r\n\r\nThe investigators will use their own instrument, the Large Aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Age (LEDA), to attempt to detect the HI sky-averaged absorption spectrum from the EoR at redshifts near 20. LEDA is part of a larger instrument called the Owens Valley Long Wavelength Array, located at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory in central California.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nScience. Following the Big Bang, the universe comprised a vast \"sea\" of dark matter and ordinary matter (chiefly Hydrogen), and radiation of all wavelengths, which streamed away leaving the matter behind. Over the first tens of millions of years of cosmological expansion and cooling, initially small fluctuations in density grew under the action of gravity. After about 40 million years, a mere third of a percent of the current age of the universe, simulations predict that the first stars formed within some of the densest and coldest clouds of gas. The name \"Cosmic Dawn\" refers to the epoch when starlight from early stars, which were quite hot, bathed the universe in diffuse ultraviolet radiation.\n\nTheoretical models of Cosmic Dawn are virtually unconstrained by observations because these stars are too dim to detect individually and luminous conglomerations, such as galaxies, had not formed.  When stars\nbegin to form?  How did they differ from stars known in the nearby universe today?  Most importantly, were there unexpected sources of heating in the universe before stars and what exotic physics could be responsible?  These questions are fundamental and represent a grand challenge in cosmology &ndash; to characterize with hard data the universe before galaxy formation and repeating cycles of star birth and death reshaped the \"landscape.\"\n\nAstronomers are working to detect distortions in the relic radiation of the Big Bang caused by the diffuse hydrogen between early stars. These signatures are anticipated to arise at frequencies associated with television and FM radio broadcasting.  This requires development of new generations of antennas and arrays of antennas grouped to form monolithic telescopes (a.k.a. interferometers).\n\nMerit.  The funded project (AST/1616709) sought to test how well a new low frequency antenna array, built ca. 2013 by the PI's group and Caltech radio astronomers, would perform in attempts to constrain models of Cosmic Dawn based on the inevitable patchiness of star formation on the sky.  In general, radio arrays are well suited to detection of brightness fluctuations on the sky, as functions of position and frequency.  However, in the case of Cosmic Dawn, these are predicted to be about one million times fainter than foreground radio emission, including that from the Milky Way galaxy. For that reason, sources of systematic error must be controlled to very high degree, which at low frequencies is very difficult.\n\nThe completed project sought to test how well an interferometer designed to make high dynamic range images of the sky (i.e., the foreground Milky Way) would function as a detector of the background cosmological signal if the data are transformed so as to differentiate between the intrinsically patchy fluctuations caused by star formation that should be statistically the same in any given volume of the universe for a given age in contrast to the position-specific structure of foregrounds (e.g., the Milky Way).\n\nImpact.  The project contributed to the training of two postdoctoral fellows who have moved on to more advanced international fellowships in the UK and Switzerland.  Through direct support for one of these postdoctoral fellows, the project enabled extended operation of the real-time signal processing system built by the PI's group for the joint array.  Multiple graduate student projects at Caltech were supported during the extension, concerning cosmic ray air showers and gravitational wave detection. \n\nOutcome.  Complete separation of foreground and background signals could not be achieved because of residual systematic errors likely tied to antenna calibration, incomplete understanding of  the instrument, and a priori assumptions regarding bright foreground structure in the sky.  However, were these errors to average down with integration time as more data are added (which was not proven), detection might be possible with the array that was used after about 3000 hours.\n\nSupplemental effort to test a claimed detection reported in the literature of an all-sky or sky-averaged background signal, achieved a senstivity (1:1,000) within 1-2 orders of magnitude of what would have been necessary.  The effort was limited by uncharacterized, time-dependent variation in interaction between antennas and moisture in the soil, and possibly by incompleteness in the calibration model employed for the radio receiver electronics.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/23/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Lincoln J Greenhill"
