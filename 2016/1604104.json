 "awd_abstract_narration": "Rechargeable lithium ion batteries help to enable sustainable energy systems by storing electricity generated by intermittent renewable resources such as wind and solar energy, or by powering zero-emission electric vehicles charged by electricity from renewable resources.  The two key performance measures of lithium ion batteries are capacity and recharge rate, which determine how much energy a battery can store and how long it takes to fully recharge. One approach to significantly improve capacity is to replace conventional graphite anodes with alloy-type anode materials that include the elements silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), and tin (Sn).  However, these alloy materials swell up after charging, which promotes mechanical failure. This project will address this issue by adding the element selenium (Se) to alloy-type anodes made from micrometer sized particles.  The resulting Se-doped microparticles may be able to reduce swelling of the anode.  Advanced imaging and computational studies will gain a fundamental scientific understanding of these processes, with the long-term goal of developing commercially affordable, high-performance anode materials for better batteries. The research will be a collaborative effort between researchers at three universities - Indiana University, Mississippi State University, and the University of Texas at Austin.  Furthermore, the educational activities associated with this project will be coordinated between these three institutions, and will include integration of the research into undergraduate and graduate course lectures, involvement of undergraduate students and K-12 teachers in research, and outreach to pre-college students through development of short, energy-related animated videos.\r\n\r\nThe overall goal of the research is to develop a fundamental understanding of the electrochemical, material phase, and morphological dynamics of Se-doped Ge and Sn microparticles during lithiation and de-lithiation reactions with lithium ion battery alloy-type anodes.  The research plan has two objectives. The first objective is to investigate the dynamics of Se-doped materials during lithiation and de-lithiation, focusing on in situ measurement of phase and morphology change via in situ X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM).   Concurrently, the composition of the Se-containing inactive phase will be identified and its ionic conductivity will be determined. Furthermore, the effect of the active/inactive mixed phases on cycling performance for both Ge- and Sn-based electrodes will be studied.  The second objective is to develop correlations between lithium ion battery cell performance and changes in Se-Ge and Se-Sn electrode microstructure through the afore-mentioned experiments and theoretical modeling.  A phase field model that integrates the processes of electrochemical reaction, species diffusion, interfacial effects, as well as large elastoplastic deformation will be developed to simulate the concurrent evolution of phases, morphologies and stress within a Ge-Se or Sn-Se particle during lithiation and de-lithiation.  Since it is likely that future high-capacity electrode materials will have large volume changes, the outcomes from the research may enable development of these new battery systems.",

From the experimental side, in-situ imaging and material characterization technologies, e.g., in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), in-situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and in-situ nano-computed tomography (nano-CT) are used to characterize the dynamic morphology and phase change of (Se)-doped high capacity anode particles.&nbsp; From the computational side, a computational model integrating reaction-diffusion kinetics and large elasto-plastic deformation has been developed to explore the underlying mechanism with respect to how the mechanical stress affects the dynamic morphology and phase change of electrode particles.</p>\n<p>For intellectual merits, we have experimentally observed a self-forming active/inactive phase structure in a micrometer (um)-sized Se-doped Ge particle, where a network of active Ge inclusions amidst an amorphous Se-containing inactive phase. The XRD and XAS results have confirmd that the inactive phase is the Li-Se-Ge that is formed as a network at the early stage of lithiation for Ge<sub>0.9</sub>Se<sub>0.1</sub> electrode particles. The Li-Se-Ge network also can suppress the formation of crystalline Li<sub>15</sub>Ge<sub>4</sub> phase (see Fig.1).</p>\n<p>The key outcome of the computational work from the MSU team is a reaction-diffusion phase-field model (PFM), motivated by the experimental observed network of active/inactive-phase structure in the um-sized electrode particles where both the diffusion and reaction control may occurs, which is in contrast to the nm-sized particles where reaction control is dominated. The developed PFM model allows determination of the condition which leads to a diffusion and/or reaction controlled lithiation process (see Fig.2). This is facilitated by defining two sets of phase-field order parameters accounting for two states of Li, one for the mobile Li atoms that diffuse in the electrode and the other for the immobilized Li transformed from the mobile Li by chemical reaction and stored in the lithiated alloy, so that we can combine Butler-Volmer electrochemical reaction kinetics and Li diffusion.&nbsp; This PFM model is then coupled with large elasto-plastic deformation, and applied to study the stress evolution in the Ge electrode coated by the inactive Li-Ge-Se layer upon lithiation. &nbsp;The soft Li-Ge-Se coating was found to reduce the compressive mean stress at the reaction front, thus alleviating the stress retardation effect on the lithiation kinetics (see Fig.3). Further, the suppressed tensile hoop stress at the surface of the particles was observed, which well explains the physical underpinnings of the surface fracture-free behavior of the lithiated Se-doped Ge electrode. The developed PFM was then used to investigate the stress and phase evolution for a network structure of active Ge inclusions amidst an amorphous Li-Ge-Se inactive phase. The results indicate a higher compressive stress at the reaction front toward the contact radial direction, which impedes the mobile Li insertion when considering the stress effect. Moreover, the small particle lost more capacity than the large one at same lithiation time due to a higher buildup stress induced by lithiation than the large one. It was also found that the large shear stress generated between a large particle and a small particle, which might lead to fracture or debonding of inactive matrix during lithiation (see Fig.4)</p>\n<p>For broader impacts, the acquired research findings can advance the understanding of the dynamics of Se-doped high capacity anode materials. The knowledge gained can guide the design and fabrication of high capacity electrode materials with performance and cost exceeding those of the currently available Li-ion batteries (LIBs). The advanced LIB technology developed from the output of this study can facilitate the mass deployment of hybrid electric, plug-in hybrid, and electric vehicles, which can eventually decrease harmful emissions, achieve better fuel economy, reduce our reliance on foreign petroleum sources, and have a significant impact on the economy. More broadly, the advanced LIB technologies can also benefit a wide range of applications including electric utility industries, medical electronics, consumer electronics, and military and defense systems. The reaction-diffusion PFM model developed within this project are applicable to other similar problems that involve multiple co-existing physiochemical processes, including mass diffusion, chemical reaction, mechanical deformation, and interfacial charge transfer.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In addition, the results of this project have been published in five peer-reviewed journal articles, one Ph.D. thesis at Mississippi State University, and seminars and presentations, including poster and oral presentations at national science conferences, e.g., ECS meeting.
