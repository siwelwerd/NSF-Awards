 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by The Division of Chemistry Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Program, Professors Timothy Long and Susan Duncan at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University lead a summer research program to train future scientists and engineers in innovations at the nexus of food, energy, and water systems (INFEWS). This interdisciplinary interface demands fundamental studies and developments in the chemistry of materials. The scientific broader impacts address the challenges that are rapidly emerging as our global population reaches 9 billion. Technologies ranging from \"smart farming\" to water management and energy utility demand multiphase materials with tailored structure at the nanoscale. The program has specific recruitment goals for community college students, students from underrepresented minorities, and female students. Training students to excel within a global scientific community occurs in partnership with the University of Trento in Italy.\r\n\r\nThis research program produces enabling polymeric materials for food distribution, water-efficient crop production, real-time monitoring devices, and advanced manufacturing to print the next generation of membranes for water purification and novel synthetic methods to understand predictable transport and diffusion through materials. Fundamental understanding of the molecular basis for diffusion and transport of diverse molecules through nanostructured polymeric membranes and packaging remains paramount. The team investigates the preparation of multiphase morphologies wherein charged groups are located in a low glass transition phase in a co-continuous fashion with a mechanically-durable high glass transition phase to ensure material ductility in combination with enhanced transport in energy, water, and food applications. The REU faculty team collectively hypothesizes that the precise tailoring of macromolecular structure and morphology at the nanoscale enables the predictability of physical properties and performance of technologies that influence future availability of sufficient food, energy, and water.  Undergraduate students from Norfolk State University and the University of Trento are actively involved in these research projects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Research Experience for Undergraduates entitled Materials Innovation at the Intersection of Food-Energy-Water Systems (REU-INFEWS) is the culmination of over forty-five students developing their potential by conducting research, spending time in the lab, and cultivating professional relationships and connections while studying with the world?s leading researchers at Virginia Tech over a three year period (2016-2018).  Tasked with addressing the need to find sustainable solutions that will continue to power the planet in the twenty-first century, these students focused on innovative and creative proposals to challenges that have ultimately contributed to years of global warming and ultimately climate change.  The outcome of which has led to the filing of a provisional patent, numerous publications, students presenting their findings at workshops and conferences, and the continued study of polymeric materials.\n\nThe REU-INFEWS project was created to study the effects of diminishing food, energy, and water supplies with the intent to invent sustainable resolutions through technologically advanced and practical mechanisms.  Finding solutions for economical energy sources while addressing depleting water reserves is the next frontier for agribusiness, developing countries, and the larger global economy.\n\nGlobal food production is dependent on a number of outdated systems.  Scientists warn that new and sustainable agricultural practices are critical to continue supplying growing urban communities in addition to maintaining rural communities struggling with competitive international markets.  As climate variability threatens the global food supply, finding new and innovative solutions to address polluted water systems, sustainable energy, and finding nutrient-dense soil proves critical.  What has emerged is the likelihood of sustainability of the earth given its constraints.  The proposals the students developed addressed what sustainability would look like through a number of scientific lens including better batteries, more efficient crop irrigation, better nutrient and fertilizer delivery to soils, and a host of projects targeted at improving growing environmental challenges. \n\nProject outcomes revealed numerous factors need to be considered including industry practices that have contributed to the current state of available resources as well as societal norms that impact our ability to manage and conserve remaining natural resources.  Population growth continues to plague the limited number of natural resources available to adequately feed and fuel our ecosystem.  Industrialization adds another layer of increased pressure on the environment.  The student?s research suggests adaptive behavioral changes in combination with advances in research provide a tactical approach to addressing the global food, energy, and water crisis.  Maximizing outputs such as capturing water in the air, reducing industrial waste, and using solar and wind to minimize reliance on non-renewable fossil fuels and similar sources of energy were a few of the project outcomes discovered as a result of the research conducted by the students.  Developing better soil management techniques as well as smart irrigation systems were among suggested solutions.  Delivering timed fertilizer in an effort to add nutrient value back into the soil for future agricultural use was also among the research efforts conducted over the summer.\n\nStudents participated in research in the following areas:\n\nRenewable water supplies\nEnergy supplies\nEnvironmental performance\nIndustry production and waste\nLand degradation\nClimate\nFood science\nSoil quality\nFertilizer delivery\nEnvironmental vulnerability\nBattery sustainability\n\n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Timothy E Long"
