The theme of the conference is Catalysis: From Theory to Commercialization, reflecting the diversity of the field which requires fundamental knowledge of chemistry, chemical engineering and materials science. The conference will bring together a diverse group of speakers, promote cross-disciplinary fertilization of ideas in catalysis, and create a sense of community by promoting interactions of young scientists, underrepresented minority scientists, and junior faculty with prominent senior investigators in the field.\r\n\r\nCatalysis continues to play a key technological role for improving the quality of human life, for reducing the adverse impact of human activities on the environment, and for securing the nation's energy supply. Catalysis also has a major economic impact on the nation's role in manufacturing.  The 2016 GRC on Catalysis will continue the tradition of bringing together leading researchers from around the world to discuss their latest, most exciting work in catalysis and future directions for the field. The conference is organized into session topics on Paraffin Upgrading, Organometallic Routes to Heterogeneous Catalysis, Model Catalyst Systems, New Catalysts for Biomass Feedstocks, Elucidating Catalytic Mechanisms, Non-Traditional Catalyst Supports, New Materials for Catalysis, and Surface Chemistry of Catalytic Systems. The meeting will tap into the broad experience level of a wide variety of scientists to explore how surface science and reaction chemistry combine to create new catalytic materials that can be used by industry to save energy, lower emissions, and reduce waste in chemical processes. Specifically, the 2016 GRC in Catalysis will emphasize frontier research in the areas of catalyst synthesis, in situ catalyst characterization, and modeling of catalytic reactions. The Catalysis GRC plays an important role in enhancing the development of researchers in early stages of their careers.  Among the various opportunities for participants to interact with colleagues, the 2016 Catalysis GRC will introduce a new initiative to increase gender diversity in the field of catalysis.  To this end, a new Monday afternoon session, titled \"Power Hour: Committed to inclusion and the professional development of women in science,\" will provide the female members of the conference with a forum to discuss how to improve both their numbers and effectiveness in the catalysis field.",
