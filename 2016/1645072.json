In response to the Dear Colleague Letter NSF 15-078, \"Stimulating Research on Effective Strategies in Undergraduate STEM Education at Two-Year Hispanic Serving Institutions\", the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign will conduct an exploratory research study on the impact of two-year Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) on the persistence and success of Latino(a) students in STEM. \r\n\r\nThe study will be conducted in two phases using a dominant-less dominant mixed methods research design. In Phase 1, the quantitative phase of the study, two national data sets will be coupled and then mined to determine the STEM transfer pathways for Hispanic students at two-year HSIs. Based on the results of Phase 1, Phase 2, the qualitative phase of the study, will involve case studies of five HSIs to enable a deeper dive to probe in detail the practices of Hispanic-serving community colleges that facilitate the successful matriculation, graduation, and transfer of Latino(a) students in STEM programs. The results of the research study will contribute to the knowledge base by increasing understanding about which STEM majors and which two-year HSIs have the greatest production of Hispanic student transfers and completers of four-year STEM degrees. The methodology employed is novel and may yield new methods for using data mining techniques to explore data for other types of institutions. The outcomes could inform two-year HSIs (and other community colleges) about those strategies they could implement to facilitate successful STEM pathways for Latino(a) students.",

The vast majority of HSCCs are in these regions, all of which have significant Latinx populations. For instance, California, Texas, and Florida together accounted for 65.7% of HSCCs in the data. Each research brief included comprehensive descriptive analyses to identify patterns or trends regarding issues or contexts of STEM degree attainment at HSCCs. This environmental scan highlighted the critical role of HSCCs in awarding STEM degrees to Latinx students, other students of color, and women of color. The top contributing STEM fields identified were interdisciplinary studies (20,292; 37.84%), computer and information sciences (10,745; 20.04%), and engineering technologies (9,187; 17.13%) among 11 STEM fields designated by the NSF Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation. There are evident race and gender gaps in STEM fields nationwide. Among 427,081 degrees conferred at community colleges, STEM degrees account for 12.56% (52,929). Whites earned 44.13% of STEM degrees, followed by Latinxs at 28%, Asians at 10.27% and Blacks at 8.10%. In terms of gender, there is a substantial gap. Although women earned most of the total degrees (60.64%), they lag behind men in earning STEM credentials (38.74%).

In sum, Hispanic-serving community colleges are pivotal in supporting Hispanic students and racially minoritized students in STEM fields, offering access and support necessary for students to succeed. With continued investment and targeted programs, HSCCs are poised to increase the number of STEM degrees awarded to Hispanic students in the coming years.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 09/19/2024<br>\nModified by: Eboni&nbsp;Zamani-Gallaher</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1645072/1645072_10462179_1697852506042_HSCC-infographic--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1645072/1645072_10462179_1697852506042_HSCC-infographic--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Hispanic-Serving Community Colleges in the United States\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1645072/1645072_10462179_1697852506042_HSCC-infographic--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Hispanic-Serving Community Colleges in the United States\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">HSCC and Emerging HSCC Demographics in the United States</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Fox, H.F., Yeo, H.T., Samet, M., Velez, A., Zamani-Gallaher, E.M.
