 "awd_abstract_narration": "Climate change projections indicate increasing magnitude and intensity of tropical storms, hurricanes, heat waves, and droughts. The events could have significant consequences for aquatic ecosystems with potential for large changes in ecosystem processes, response and functions. Such changes could also impair the important services that these ecosystems provide and thus affect the well-being of our environment and society. This five day workshop will focus on strategies for monitoring and mitigating the effects of extreme climate events. Scientists from diverse backgrounds (including women and under-represented groups) and at various stages (early career to senior) in their career will participate at the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe main workshop topics will be: water-driven exports of Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus (C, N, P) in particulate, dissolved, and gaseous forms from terrestrial to aquatic ecosystems; changes in biogeochemical cycles of C, N, and P in aquatic ecosystems following extreme climate events; and changes in aquatic ecosystem functions and services as a result of extreme events. The full spectrum of challenges will be covered, from defining extreme climate events and monitoring them, determining the exports of nutrients through the fluvial network, long-term impacts and recovery, changes in structure, functions and services of aquatic ecosystems, differences across land uses, and management practices and restoration strategies to mitigate extreme event impacts.",
