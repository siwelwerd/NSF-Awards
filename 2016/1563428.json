 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urban areas are experiencing significant increase in construction of tall buildings to meet the demands of their rapidly increasing population. It is projected that 70 percent of the world's population will live in urban areas by 2050. The resiliency of tall buildings during and after a natural hazard event plays a vital role in maintaining economic and social stability of an urban region. In the case of earthquake hazard, current design methodologies for tall buildings focus only on preventing loss of human lives and building collapse, whereas damage-impaired losses are not being considered nor limited through the design. Recent earthquakes in Chile, Japan, and New Zealand highlighted that due to the great number of building occupants, seismic impacts would not be constrained within tall building footprints, but would also affect the community as a whole. To alleviate such earthquake consequences, this research will investigate an integrated system-level framework and metrics essential for understanding and modeling the earthquake-resilient design of tall buildings (e.g., repair losses, downtime, resiliency index, and expected annual loss). The research will focus on the development, validation, and integration of novel simulation tools and loss/recovery models that will envelope interaction between soil, foundation, structural, and nonstructural building components to provide a methodology for identifying engineering design requirements that will enable resiliency. Given the diverse student body of the participating universities, this project will enhance student experiences, particularly those of underrepresented groups, by active participation in a multi-campus interdisciplinary research project and collaborations with researchers and engineers in the U.S and globally. \r\n\r\nThis research will focus on tall buildings that utilize reinforced concrete core walls as the lateral load-resisting system, as it is currently the preferred system in construction of tall buildings. To develop the system-level framework, the research program will target four major areas that are essential to addressing the critical gaps in current simulation, assessment, and damage/loss/recovery estimation capabilities: 1) development and validation of a novel, three-dimensional, analytical model for reinforced concrete structural walls that integrates shear-flexural interaction and failure mechanisms, 2) evaluation of available soil models for simulating soil behavior and soil-foundation-structure interaction effects of tall buildings, 3) development of functionality limit states, downtime, and recovery models for tall buildings, and 4) integration of all framework components into a robust innovative tool for resilient-based design. The framework components will be validated based on test data available in the literature and archived in the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure data repository or in other data bases, and on data collected through earthquake reconnaissance reports and interviews with engineers, public officials, contractors, owners, and insurers. The framework will be demonstrated on a tall reinforced concrete core wall building located in an urban region with high seismicity. The framework will be applicable to all types of lateral-load resisting systems for tall buildings, including new and existing construction. The developed framework components will tackle the aforementioned critical gaps and provide valuable data sets to advance the natural hazard mitigation of civil infrastructure. This project will contribute to research and engineering communities by implementing the framework components into widely available computational platforms, disseminating research results using web-based tools, involving professionals and researchers in earthquake engineering during the project, and disseminating educational materials.",

The focus of the project was on buildings that utilize reinforced concrete (RC) core walls as an earthquake-load resisting system as it is currently the most widespread system in the construction of tall buildings in the U.S. The overarching goal of this research was the development and validation of all framework components and their integration into a robust methodology to achieve desired lifetime building-level performance under seismic actions. The research has targeted three major areas that are essential to addressing the critical gaps in our current simulation and assessment of a building's resilience including: 1) development of a functional recovery model for buildings, 2) development and validation of a novel three-dimensional analytical models for RC structural walls that integrates shear-flexural interaction and failure mechanisms, and 3) evaluation and improvement of available soil models for simulating soil behavior and soil-structure interaction (SSI) effects in tall buildings.</p>\n<p>One of the major developments of this research is a probabilistic, building-level framework for modeling and evaluation of the entire post-earthquake recovery process, expressed by the duration and speed of functional recovery. The proposed framework is in line with the probabilistic Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering methodology and utilizes FEMA P-58 damage assessment results. The three integral moduli of the framework, developed through this research, are model for evaluation of post-earthquake functionality, repair time model, and mobilization time model.&nbsp; The proposed framework has a modular structure that allows easy addition of new components and has the following capabilities: 1) it explicitly evaluates the post-earthquake functionality limit state, 2) it evaluates post-earthquake detailed inspection limit state and utilizes it to estimate time allocations for different mobilization activities, 3) it accommodates any repair schedule, and 4) it allows for resource scheduling that meets resource limitations that can come either from labor congestions or from a surge in demand following a disaster, 5) it generates a recovery curve, providing the opportunity for explicit calculation of the resiliency index for a building, and 6) it isolates the building components that dominate the recovery process. The framework is demonstrated in two case studies: a prototype 42-story building and an existing 13-story building (built in 1956). The case studies showed that the outcomes of the recovery evaluation can be effectively used as a guide for the development of earthquake mitigation strategies and design/retrofit solutions to improve seismic performance.</p>\n<p>Another major development of the research project relates to the development and validation of three new models for nonlinear analysis of RC walls, including: 1) a three-dimensional macroscopic model for the analysis of flexure-dominated RC walls, 2) a three-dimensional macroscopic model that captures the interaction between axial/flexural and shear behavior in RC walls, and 3) finite-element model for nonlinear analysis of RC walls. All three models are extensively validated against detailed experimental results obtained from tests on rectangular walls subjected to in-plane cyclic loading and non-rectangular walls tested under complex multidirectional loading protocols. All models showed to be effective and accurate (within the range of assumptions made in their development) and provide new analytical tools for researchers and engineers for nonlinear analysis of RC wall buildings. The developed models have been implemented in the open-source analysis software OpenSees and are will be publicly available in the near future. Analytical models developed are used to achieve the objectives of the proposed research project in terms of development, implementation, and demonstration of the proposed framework for the resilient-based design of tall buildings.</p>\n<p>Finally, the research has evaluated available soil models for SSI effects in tall buildings. Fixed-base building models and sub-structure SSI models were analyzed and compared with SSI models that utilized direct continuum modeling approaches with the pressure-dependent multi-yield model. Sub-structure approaches generally produced larger inter-story drift demands when compared to building models using direct approaches which resulted in a more realistic response of the SSI system, leading to larger participation of higher vibration modes in the seismic response of tall buildings. Flexible ground supports in the modeling framework, lengthened the first natural vibration period, resulting in a modification in the magnitude and distribution of the engineering demands. The dynamic soil response was found to be oversimplified by considering lumped spring-dashpot systems to model strength and stiffness reduction and damping evolution characteristics of most soils. Coupled SSI models that use robust constitutive soil formulations showed the potential to overcome those deficiencies at a reasonable computational cost.</p>\n<p>The findings have been disseminated broadly through journal papers and conference presentations. The border impacts of the research also included comprehensive research training for diverse, mostly underrepresented students, including 3 undergraduate and 9 graduate students that resulted in Master Thesis. Undergraduate and graduate student experiences have also been enriched through active participation in a multi-campus interdisciplinary research project and the collaboration of the participating universities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/29/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Vesna&nbsp;Terzic</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563428/1563428_10417207_1601400191212_Framework--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563428/1563428_10417207_1601400191212_Framework--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Framework for earthquake-resilient design of tall buildings\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563428/1563428_10417207_1601400191212_Framework--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Framework for earthquake-resilient design of tall buildings\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Chart showing the major developments of this research.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vesna Terzic</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vesna&nbsp;Terzic</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Framework for earthquake-resilient design of tall buildings</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563428/1563428_10417207_1601399651922_Outcomes_report_figres_KK_09252020--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563428/1563428_10417207_1601399651922_Outcomes_report_figres_KK_09252020--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"New models for nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete walls\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563428/1563428_10417207_1601399651922_Outcomes_report_figres_KK_09252020--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"New models for nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete walls\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sample results that demonstrate validation of the developed models</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kristijan Kolozvari</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vesna&nbsp;Terzic</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">New models for nonlinear analysis of reinforced concrete walls</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563428/1563428_10417207_1601050479576_SSI--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563428/1563428_10417207_1601050479576_SSI--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Evaluation of SSI effects on the tall building using different modeling approaches\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563428/1563428_10417207_1601050479576_SSI--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Evaluation of SSI effects on the tall building using different modeling approaches\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sample results</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Luis Arboleda</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vesna&nbsp;Terzic</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Evaluation of SSI effects on the tall building using different modeling approaches</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563428/1563428_10417207_1601400301543_RecoveryFramework--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563428/1563428_10417207_1601400301543_RecoveryFramework--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Framework for Functional Recovery\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1563428/1563428_10417207_1601400301543_RecoveryFramework--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Framework for Functional Recovery\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Sample of recovery curves for a tall building</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Vesna Terzic</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Vesna&nbsp;Terzic</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Framework for Functional Recovery</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
