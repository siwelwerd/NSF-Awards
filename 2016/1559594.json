 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project addresses the structural engineering of buildings by constructing engineering concepts through topology optimization. Structural topology relates to geometric configurations of components that fit in to the structural system of the building. The goal is to tailor topology optimization techniques to building systems and to use this technology as a means to connect architects and engineers in design of buildings. To achieve this goal, the challenges are to move away from traditional ?box-like? building shapes by exploring innovative bio-inspired and natural artistic designs as well as to enable a formal linkage between structural engineering and architecture. \r\n\r\nThe proposed techniques for tailored building design will be a novel addition to the realm of topology optimization. This research will explore natural load path topology optimization of tall buildings; will provide integration of structural engineering and architecture design optimization through the final design of buildings; will achieve new advances in lateral bracing systems; and will develop high-fidelity computational models. The computational framework will be formulated to provide both architects and engineers freedom to design innovative buildings that are artistic and yet with pragmatic consideration of economy. The Co-PI, a principal in a consulting engineering company, has background in design of super-tall buildings. The students working in the project will intern in the consulting company and the inter-disciplinary research team will work in close collaboration in all stages of the project.",

For the elastic formulation, which typically requires a post-processing cutoff, a novel scheme to filter &ldquo;real&rdquo; structures out of ground structures was developed. This filter feature with explicit control on the member areas allows the users to play with alternatives prior to selecting a specific structural configuration. As a result, multiple-choice designs can be obtained, providing flexibility to designers and fostering the relationship between architects and engineers. In addition, an adaptive filtering strategy, maximum filter, was developed that leads to many design perspectives for a single problem and allows for increased user control over the complexity of the final design. To account for practical aspects in real-world designs, a filtering scheme with reduced-order modeling was done for truss topology optimization considering multiple load cases and nonlinear material behaviors. &nbsp;This scheme accounts for proper load levels, yields the displacement field without artificial stiffness, and reduces the problem sizes within a few iterations, leading to drastically improved computational performance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Development of&nbsp;multi-material topology optimization formulations</strong></p>\n<p>Practical engineering designs, such as buildings and aircraft consist of multiple material types.

This framework handles an arbitrary number of candidate materials with flexible properties. To handle arbitrary volume constraints efficiently, a novel update scheme, ZPR (Zhang-Paulino-Ramos Jr.) update scheme, has been proposed to perform robust updates of the design variables.

The traditional approach minimizes a weighted average of the compliances of all load cases and requires the solution of many large finite element problems in each optimization step, leading to an enormous computational effort. To overcome this issue, a randomized optimization method with stochastic sampling was developed to solve the deterministic optimization problem with many right-hand sides. The developed method significantly improves the computational efficiency by requiring the solution of only a few (e.g., 5 or 6) finite element problems per optimization step while obtaining similar designs to those of standard algorithms. An effective damping scheme for the randomized method was developed based on simulated annealing and leads to rapid convergence of the proposed algorithm.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Research findings and knowledge acquired under this award were disseminated through peer-reviewed journal publications, conference presentations and meetings, and many related educational activities and software dissemination (see annual project reports).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/06/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Glaucio&nbsp;Paulino</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559594/1559594_10265790_1497656479409_GRAND3_LotteTower--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559594/1559594_10265790_1497656479409_GRAND3_LotteTower--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Application of GRAND3 to Lotte tower\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1559594/1559594_10265790_1497656479409_GRAND3_LotteTower--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Application of GRAND3 to Lotte tower\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Lotte tower: Problem definitions for a) laterally loaded tower, and b) torsionally loaded tower.
