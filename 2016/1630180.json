One of the anticipated outcomes will be the development of parallel strategic partnerships for research collaborations and student and postdoctoral exchange opportunities.  \r\n\r\nThe workshop will be held March 18-20, 2016 at the India Institute of Technology in Mumbai, India. Approximately 30 senior researchers with expertise in the fields of systems and synthetic biology from the US and India will be in attendance in addition to researchers from select Asian countries.  The outcomes of this workshop is to develop strategic collaborative and educational opportunities in addition to creating an infrastructure that will be necessary to realize the overarching goals of this workshop.",
