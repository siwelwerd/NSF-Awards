 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to revitalize and transfer a large culture collection of plant-associated bacteria from the Pacific Bacterial Collection, which is currently located in Hawaii to an established laboratory on the U.S. mainland where the bacteria can be safely stored, re-cultured and distributed to scientists nationwide. The collection consists of more than 6,000 bacterial strains collected over a 40 year period from worldwide origins and habitats and represents a national treasure for microbiologists, educators, and professionals in agricultural and food industry.  Historically valuable microbial germplasm will be documented and preserved. The collection is a national resource for scientists in diverse disciplines and supports collaborative contemporary research on taxonomy, genomics, detection technology and forensic epidemiology. The collection's size, novelty, and diversity permits data analysis of well-characterized reference strains on a scale not previously possible.  This will be a valuable resource for identifying and characterizing microbes associated with diseased/compromised trade goods and will enhance educational and training opportunities for aspiring microbial taxonomists. Access to this large collection of strains from a centrally-located laboratory serves the national interest by enabling both industry and the non-profit biological research community to access selected strains at a minimal cost.\r\n\r\nBacterial strains will be revitalized, annotated and prepared for transfer to designated staff at Agdia, Inc., located in Indiana.  Purity of each culture will be confirmed, duplicates will be eliminated and data for each strain will be added to a unified and modernized database. The focus of this project will be on the transfer of strains that represent genetic bacterial diversity as determined by DNA sequence analysis of multiple bacterial genes, development of molecular diagnostic tests, and strains originally used in Hawaii to screen hybridoma cell lines for production of pathogen-specific monoclonal antibodies.  Publications describing genetic characteristics and population diversity will be referenced in the database. Remaining strains will be organized, validated and documented over a three year period allowing total transfer of up to 6,000 strains. Creation of a modernized unified database, which includes relevant data for individual strains is a major undertaking that will enable researchers, students and regulatory personnel to make informed selections before requesting a culture. User fees for culturing, shipping and compliance with federal and state regulations will result in sustained support. The back-up storage of reference strains will ensure the long-term integrity of the collection and will serve as a valuable scientific resource. Characteristics of each strain are currently being organized into a database maintained at the University of Hawaii.  After the project is completed the data accompanying each culture will be transferred to Agdia, Inc. enabling public access (www.agdia.com).",

The bacterial strains represented agriculturally and ecologically important plant pathogenic bacteria from multiple plant hosts on five continents, representing tropical, subtropical, and temperate agricultural production zones. Strains had been characterized using traditional bacteriological methods, including serology and DNA-based identification methods. Without support from the National Science Foundation, all the cultures in would have been destroyed in 2015 upon retirement of the principal bacteriologist. The project allowed transfer of the collection to Agdia, Inc., an established agricultural diagnostic laboratory on the US mainland, with their agreement to maintain a curated collection of reference strains as a resource for further distribution to interested scientists nationwide. Strains were cultured, checked for purity, and mailed to the Agdia facilities. Metadata from multiple spreadsheets were combined into a single, online database to facilitate dissemination. During the second year of the project, a new plant and environmental bacteriologist was hired at the University of Hawaii, and&nbsp;this enabled reclassification of multiple strains using cutting-edge molecular methods and reclassification of strains based on updated taxonomic groups. Many of our previously classified strains were assigned to new taxonomic groups and phylogenetic trees were developed using the relevant software. All available data, plus any new and/or missing data for strain was added to the PBC database and a searchable PBC website was developed to access information for each strain. From the initial 6000 strains, data for 4916 strains has been currently uploaded to the website. A potential user may access the data, select strains, and assemble into a collection cart and transfer the selection using various formats to Agdia, Inc. where strains may be accessed for further studies. The high cost of culturing, analyzing, reclassifying, maintaining, and shipping strains will necessitate a fee structure that will be established by Agdia, Inc. An unexpected outcome and benefit to this project was the increased interest in the collection as curation was underway. As the newly hired bacteriologist, Dr. Mohammad Arif, began to undertake numerous phylogenetic studies on selected groups of strains in the PBC, graduate and undergraduate students, high school students and international trainees joined the research group and collectively participated in various projects. Diagnostic tests were developed for rapid identification of specific groups of bacteria and state-of-the-art field deployable assays were developed. These studies resulted in 22 publications in peer-reviewed journals (each with multiple authors) and presentation of 30 abstracts for posters and oral presentations at national meetings. <span>Publications relevant to the strains in the PBC may be accessed on two additional websites (BacteriologyHawaii.com and PlantBacteriology.com), which are maintained and updated by the researchers.&nbsp;</span>A significant outcome of this project has been the continuing positive impact on students who were excited about participating in state-of-the art molecular methods for bacterial taxonomy and classification. Their participation led to the discovery and publication of new species. Also of interest were the genomic studies that enabled us to determine the genealogy and theoretical origins of the bacterial strains. Our students are now well prepared for research and publication of results in peer-reviewed journals and their excitement and interest in bacteriology has been sustained. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/12/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Anne&nbsp;M&nbsp;Alvarez</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561663/1561663_10458489_1636754875078_D-04-evolutionaryrelationships--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561663/1561663_10458489_1636754875078_D-04-evolutionaryrelationships--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Genealogical Analysis of Bacterial Strains\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561663/1561663_10458489_1636754875078_D-04-evolutionaryrelationships--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Genealogical Analysis of Bacterial Strains\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Relationships among bacteria were analyzed based on concatenated 5-gene sequences of bacterial strains in the collection.
