The main foci of the 2016 event are the following: deformation/rigidity theory; noncommutative geometry; subfactor theory; operator algebras and geometric group theory. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work. More details about the conference will be available at http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~ncgoa/conferences.html.",
