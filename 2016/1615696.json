 "awd_abstract_narration": "The threat of malicious insiders is a top concern for governmental agencies and corporations. In general, malicious insiders are typically disgruntled employees who encounter a negative experience, or stressor, as a triggering event. Criminology research has long associated certain stressors with malicious behavior. Recent neuroscience and cognitive psychology research has unequivocally demonstrated that linkages exist between cognitive processing (e.g., cognitive conflict, emotion, arousal, etc.) and hand movements. In a human-computer interaction context, growing support has found that emotions influence mouse cursor movements. Importantly, this work has demonstrated that negative emotions associated with stressors influence users? mouse cursor movements.  Building on this foundation, this work will answer critical questions regarding the identification of mouse curser data features that may indicate negative emotions induced by stressors. Specifically, year 1 will focus on understanding the efficacy of this approach when users know they are being monitored and trying to avoid being detected. And, for year 2, understand the efficacy of the approach for predicting the likelihood of whether a person will engage in a malicious online activity in real time.\r\n\r\nThis two-year program of research will answer critical questions regarding the identification of mouse curser data features that may indicate negative emotions induced by stressors. The test environment for this work will be a multi-round, fair vs. unfair, serious game or testing scenario (e.g., intelligence test). In all studies, participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatments a fair (no manipulation) or unfair (negative emotion induced) experience (as well as other experimental manipulations depending on a particular study's objectives). In the treatment condition, the instructions will explain that the task will be timed, and that their score will be computed based on how many objectives they can complete correctly within the allotted time. To induce negative emotion, the task will appear to have technical problems loading the stimuli, will ask very difficult questions, and give participants a very short period of time to complete the tasks. Because of these \"unfair\" disadvantages, the system will attribute a low score to the participants, resulting in feelings of unfairness, frustration, and anger. Participants will also be told that because of their slow response time and incorrect answers, their score indicates a lower intelligence level than that of most people who have taken the test. As their score is outside of their control (resulting from the system being too slow and not giving them enough time to answer), the prior literature suggests that participants will have a negative emotional response from being judged unfairly. In the baseline condition, the instructions will explain to participants that they will complete a task and that their score will be computed based on how many tasks they complete correctly. The delivery of the stimuli in this condition will be similar to the negative-emotion condition, except that we will not implement the negative-emotion-inducing mechanisms (i.e., the task will not be timed; the loading signs will not be shown; the questions can easily be answered; and, at the conclusion, the system will congratulate participants for answering the questions correctly). Thus, negative emotion would likely not be induced in the task. After completing each round of the task, participants in both treatments will complete an identical goal-directed task, during which we will record and analyze mouse cursor movements. By using an identical follow-up task, we can attribute the difference in mouse cursor movements to negative emotion from the primary task. Different follow-up tasks will be used in Year 1 vs Year 2, as the goals of each year are different. After all experiments, participants will be debriefed, told the true purpose of the test, and given maximum payment regardless of their performance or behavior on the study.",

Crime and terror threats are never far from the top of mind, and the enhanced security measures put in place in reaction to these events negatively impact us all on almost a daily basis. Above and beyond questions of law enforcement, safety, and security, the economic costs of malfeasance can be staggering. Most organizations realize that insider threats have a detrimental financial impact and implement different preventative measures to mitigate the risks. However, such preventative measures (e.g., Code of Conduct) often require strong institutional support to function effectively. Typically, preventative measures that organizations employ rely heavily on self-report or whistleblowers.</p>\n<p>This project was an attempt to learn how the use of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) devices can be used to identify potentially malicious insiders. One of those critical questions that have arisen as a part of this research is: What happens when subjects know that their computer interaction is being tracked as well as analyzed? To understand how the knowledge of tracking influences the movement behaviors, we conducted an experiment with an opportunity for participants to cheat to benefit themselves (e.g., extra payout). In other words, we wanted to know if the knowledge of tracking would change the user?s device usage pattern in a way that would suppress the detectable movement behaviors.</p>\n<p>We conducted the study for two separate types of HCI devices (computer mice and mobile ?touch? devices) to see if our results can be generalized across different device types. Furthermore, we used two different outcome measures (i.e., an intelligence test [Figure 1 ? an impossible question] score and a 20-round card game [Figure 2]) with opportunities to cheat in order to gain a more holistic view of users? malicious behavior on different computer-based platforms (i.e., desktop / notebook versus mobile device). The intelligence test contained both easy and impossible questions to answer correctly. To gain a winning score in order to obtain a bonus payout (a score of 90% or greater), a participant needed to answer at least 4 of the 5 ?impossible questions? correctly (a combined probability that ranged from .06 to .01% for correctly guessing). Cheating websites (Figure 3) were created so that participants could quickly and easily use a search engine to find correct answers to the impossible questions. The card game, the Joker Game where a player loses when a Joker randomly appears, allowed participants to falsely report a ?win? (to increase their payout) when they actually had a ?loss? (a reduction in their payout balance). We learned that the movement characteristics s for individuals performing malicious acts (i.e., cheating) are significantly different from those that complied with the survey instructions. Though the knowledge of tracking suppressed the detectable movements to a certain extent, the classification model still had enough predictive power to detect individuals with malicious intent. Listed below are key points uncovered in this project that will help both industry and research organizations in detecting deception:</p>\n<p>1. The analysis from a larger dataset (N = 2500) suggests that all mouse movement metrics that we captured Area Under the Curve, Maximum Deviation, Additional Distance, and Overall Speed) were useful features in distinguishing individuals with malicious behavior (Figure 4).</p>\n<p>2. Giving more information about the countermeasures (Figure 5 shows examples of how to move the mouse to avoid detection on key questions) suppressed the detectable movement behaviors for certain movement metrics (Area Under the Curve, Maximum Deviation, Additional Distance).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;3. Regardless of the knowledge of tracking, there is a substantial difference in the mouse movement speed between individuals engaging in malicious acts and the individuals who complied (see Figure 6 ? movements speed across conditions).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;4. Though the knowledge of tracking suppresses detectible device movements, its effect on the classification model is marginal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;5. The analysis results of the mobile data have shown that model metrics, specifically touch movements, can be used to classify and detect people with deceptive behaviors.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Joseph&nbsp;Valacich</p>\n</div>\n<div
