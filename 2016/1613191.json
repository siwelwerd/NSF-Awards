HotMobile, sponsored by ACM SIGMOBILE, will be held in February, 2016 in St. Augustine, FL. HotMobile 2016 is an important workshop targeting mobile computing and system integration fields and attending this event will benefit the scientific progress of the student's research. The exposure to the technical content of HotMobile 2016 will inspire students to address the tough problems in their respective fields, with a long-term benefit of scientific advances in these types of networks. \r\n\r\nPriority will be given to students who will benefit from attending this workshop, but are unlikely to attend due to the unavailability of travel funding. In addition, applications from female and underrepresented groups in networking research will be strongly encouraged. Up to fourteen students will receive travel grants from this award to attend HotMobile 2016.",
