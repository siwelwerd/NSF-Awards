 "awd_abstract_narration": "With this award from the Major Research Instrumentation Program (MRI) and support from the Chemistry Research Instrumentation (CRIF) and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities-Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) as well as the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), Professor Terry Watt from Xavier University of Louisiana and collaborators have acquired a matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer). In general, mass spectrometry (MS) is one of the key analytical methods used to identify and characterize small quantities of chemical species embedded in complex matrices. In a MALDI instrument, a laser striking on the unreactive supporting material embedded with the sample, vaporizes the sample and causes it to form charged particles (ions). The ions pass into the mass spectrometer where the masses of the parent ion and its fragment ions are measured. In a time-of-flight instrument the ions are accelerated by an electric field to allow further characterization. MALDI TOF combines gentle ionization (ideal for producing intact ions of peptides, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, synthetic polymers, and other similarly sized species) with a detection mode that offers an excellent balance between sensitivity and accuracy across a wide mass range. The collision-induced dissociation enables the molecular ions to break into pieces in the gas phase. This highly sensitive technique allows identification and determination of the structure of molecules in a complex mixture. This acquisition strengthens the research infrastructure at the University and regional area. The instrument broadens participation by involving diverse students in research and research training with this modern analytical technique.  The instrument is shared with students at Tulane University. \r\n\r\nThe award is aimed at enhancing research and education at all levels at this HBCU, especially in areas such as (a) characterizing enzyme-substrate interactions of lysine deacetylases; (b) developing aptamers for small molecule detection coupled to glucose oxidase as a biosensor; (c) developing hydrogels using modified nucleobases; (d) using modified nucleobase hydrogels and dendrimers with precisely defined ligand content for targeted and controlled drug release; and (e) identifying transcription factor binding sites and binding partners.",
