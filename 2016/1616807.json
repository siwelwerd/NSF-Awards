 "awd_abstract_narration": "The investigators study the elements produced in stars in our galaxy.  All stars generate energy in their cores by fusing light elements into heavier ones. When the core of a star runs out of light elements to fuse, its contracts under its own weight. The collapse reheats the outer layers, turning the star into a red giant.  This phase is unstable and ends with the outer layers being thrown off entirely. These elements are released from the stars at the end of their life cycle.  The investigators will use optical telescopes to measure the element abundances.  The elements are visible in planetary nebulae, which are beautiful ionized gaseous shells ejected by such stars.  Undergraduate students will help with the research.  The students will be introduced to the techniques of scientific and engineering research.\r\n\r\nFrom images of the elements created by the stars, the investigators learn the types of nuclear reactions that went on in these stars.   From the reactions, the investigator learns how massive the stars were and how long they lived.  Some elements pass through the star's nuclear fires unchanged.   By matching these elements, they can trace the type of molecular clouds where the stars were born. \r\n\r\nUsing new methods combining high-precision optical and infrared spectra of planetary nebulae with newer, more accurate distance measurements, they will examine the history of star formation and chemical enrichment throughout our Galaxy.  Undergraduate students at Western Kentucky University will take active roles in all aspects of this work.  The students will become better prepared for careers in scientific and technical fields.  The investigator is working in a region of the country where such jobs are most needed.",
