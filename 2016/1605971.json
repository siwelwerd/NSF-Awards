 "awd_abstract_narration": "CBET - 1605971\r\nPI: Nieh, Mu-Ping\r\n\r\nLipid nanocarriers containing solid nanoparticles are a promising platform for drug delivery and imaging in biomedical applications. The entrapped solid nanoparticles can be imaging contrast agents, which enhance the signal obtained in various medical imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, X-ray computerized tomography, and photoacoustic tomography. Placing the nanoparticles inside the lipid nanocarriers increases their solubility and stability, and provides a significant enhancement in luminescence due to nanoparticle aggregation. The nanoparticle-complex can also be used to enhance local heating in photothermal therapy, which uses infrared electromagnetic radiation to treat tumors and other disorders. Aggregated gold nanoparticles can enhance signals by several orders of magnitude, which is promising for high-sensitivity imaging and sensing. The goal of this project is to develop well-defined lipid nanodiscs (bicelles) that can serve as carriers for nanoparticles and investigate their performance in imaging applications. A combination of experiments and computer simulation will be used to determine the key parameters that affect arrangements of nanoparticles in bicelles and then optimize lipid composition and nanodisc formulation to achieve encapsulated clusters of nanoparticles with strong fluorescence properties. The project will provide opportunities for students at various academic levels to participate in research. Grade 5-12 STEM teachers who participate in UCONN's da Vinci Project will be introduced to research projects related to nanoparticle self-assembly. \r\n\r\nThe combination of experiments and molecular dynamics simulations will provide fundamental understanding of the interactions between lipid molecules and hydrophobically-modified solid nanoparticles such as monolayer protected gold clusters and hydrophobic quantum dots. Factors that affect solid nanoparticle solubilization and clustering inside discoidal bicelles, including lipid and hydrophobic tether chain lengths, nanoparticle size, and charge density of the lipids or nanoparticle, will be examined.  In addition, the relationships between local nanoparticle concentration inside the bicelles, the distance between nanoparticles, and the size of nanoparticle clusters trapped in the lipid structure and their photo-physical properties will be investigated. The joint experimental and computer modeling effort will help predict the range of desired lipid/nanoparticle composition to optimize nanoparticle encapsulation, clustering and retention. This new strategy of nanoparticle encapsulation by lipid nanocarriers will provide a fast, robust, size-controllable and environmentally friendly platform that can be easily adapted for manufacturing.",

The basic lipid components of NANO<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;are a mixture of long- and short-chain lipids (Fig 1). All the final products are obtained through homogeneous mixing of all species in an organic solvent followed by a drying process and then re-dispersion in an aqueous solution. Many unique properties have been discovered in different types of NANO<sup>2</sup>. For example, the NANO<sup>2</sup>-AuNC (Fig 2),&nbsp;NANO<sup>2</sup>-QD (Fig 3) and&nbsp;NANO<sup>2</sup>-MSM (Fig 4) show aggregation-enhanced emission, a desirable property for bioimaging and biodiagnosis. The&nbsp;NANO<sup>2</sup>-THPC (Fig 5) illustrates high-quantity tumor accumulation and high photodynamic efficiency, suitable for the application as cancer treating therapeutics. The NANO<sup>2</sup>-PNA (Fig 6) platform provides an efficacious gene-therapy platform to&nbsp;reduce the levels of miRNA expression via an antisense mechanism, leading to a recent patent filed. The research team not only successfully formulates different types of NANO<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;but also identifies the location of the entrapped species through advanced analysis of small angle X-ray and neutron scattering as well as the molecular dynamic simulations. All the outcomes indicate that the hydrophobic species are preferably located at the rim of nanodiscs. The advantages of NANO<sup>2</sup> include robustness in preparation, high structural stability, biocompatibility and enhanced cellular uptake, making it an ideal platform for various biomedical applications. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Mu-Ping&nbsp;Nieh</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1605971/1605971_10431045_1632917447677_NSFOutcomeFig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1605971/1605971_10431045_1632917447677_NSFOutcomeFig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1605971/1605971_10431045_1632917447677_NSFOutcomeFig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The TEM micrograph of pristine bicelles, self-assemblies of long- and short- chain lipids</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mu-Ping Nieh</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mu-Ping&nbsp;Nieh</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1605971/1605971_10431045_1632917969282_NSFOutcomeFig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1605971/1605971_10431045_1632917969282_NSFOutcomeFig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1605971/1605971_10431045_1632917969282_NSFOutcomeFig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The TEM micrograph of NANO^2-QD with enhanced emission, indicating that QD aggregates at the rim of the lipid discs.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mu-Ping Nieh</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mu-Ping&nbsp;Nieh</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1605971/1605971_10431045_1632918131822_NSFOutcomeFig4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1605971/1605971_10431045_1632918131822_NSFOutcomeFig4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1605971/1605971_10431045_1632918131822_NSFOutcomeFig4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The TEM micrograph of NANO^2-MSM where the rim of the discs shows high electron density of MSM.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Mu-Ping Nieh</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Mu-Ping&nbsp;Nieh</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1605971/1605971_10431045_1632918484451_NSFOutcomeFig5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1605971/1605971_10431045_1632918484451_NSFOutcomeFig5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 5\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1605971/1605971_10431045_1632918484451_NSFOutcomeFig5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 5\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The NANO^2-THPC shows size reduction of the in-vivo tumor after the photodynamic treatment, while the free THPC indicate serious skin burnt after the treatment.
