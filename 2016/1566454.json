 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Chemical Structure, Dynamics, and Mechanisms program supports the collaborative research projects of Professor Leah O'Brien at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and Professor James O'Brien at the University of Missouri, St. Louis.  They investigate the spectroscopy of diatomic metal containing molecules that also contain nitrogen or halogen atoms (for example fluorine or chlorine). The work is enabling a deeper understanding of these molecules' chemical bonding and electronic structure. Participants record high resolution spectra in the visible and infrared wavelength region with light-absorption and/or emission spectroscopic methods. This project continues an inter-institutional collaboration of faculty and students at a primarily undergraduate institution and a major research university.  It enhances the research infrastructure at both Universities, and develops students and faculty with skills in contemporary spectroscopy and instrument development.  The project also contains an outreach program that allows talented high school students to participate in the research.\r\n\r\nThe O'Brien groups use intracavity laser absorption spectroscopy combined with high resolution Fourier transform detection (ILS-FTS).  The plasma discharge techniques to produce the molecules of interest employ radio frequency (RF) and direct current (DC) plasma generators as used in industry. The spectra are rotationally analyzed to obtain new and/or improved molecular constants (e.g., transition energy, rotational and vibrational constants, and angular momentum coupling constants). These constants are used to develop energy level diagrams and potential energy curves for molecules, which enable comparison of the experimental results with computational results for these small molecules. This work enhances our understanding of metal-ligand interactions, periodic trends in for metal-ligand binding, and provides insight on metal-catalyzed reactions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant supported collaborative research on diatomic and triatomic metal-containing molarular radicals.  Our experiments involved creating these radicals in vitu in a hollow cathode sputter source, recording spectra using an ultra-sensitive intracavity laser absorption (ILS) technique, and analyzing the spectra to produce molecular constants that describe the electronic structure of that molecule.  This work has applications in understanding metal-ligand interactions and provides insight on metal-catalyzed reactions.  Moreover, our new work on 5d metal sulfides provide gold-standard measurements of electronic transitions in these molecules are used as benchmarks by theoreticians developing new models for interacting electronic states.  For many of the species to be investigated, the extreme relativistic effects of 5d metals dominate the electronic structure, and spectroscopic data on the halides, oxides and sulfides allow comparison with relativistic electronic structure calculations provided by theoreticians.  \n\n1.  Insrument Development.  Our original ILS equipment utilized a 2-m grating spectrometer for data collection, which produced spectra with an effective spectral resolution of about 0.04 cm-1.  This is adequate for lighter molecules, such as CuO and GeH, which have a similar Doppler line width.  As as research brought us to 5d transition metals, many with multiple isotopoes, superior resolution was required.  As part of this grant, we successfully integrated our intracavity laser spectrometer with a Fourier transform detection system (i.e., ILS-FTS).  Compared with traditional ILS, the new ILS-FTS system provides a number of advantages including increased spectral range per spectrum (cf. only ~5 cm-1 per scan with traditional ILS), smaller resolution element, and more accurate frequency calibration.  The ILS-FTS system has enhanced our research capabilities for the fundamental research program in spectroscopy.  A schematic of our ILS-FTS system is provided in Figure 1.\n \n\nThe ILS-FTS  method led to an enormous improvement in that isotopic features are now fully or partially resolved even for a (0,0) vibrational band.  Figure 2 shows a portion of the (0,0) band of the A &Omega;=1 &#8210; X &Omega;=0+ transition [15.8+x]&#8239;&Omega;=5/2&#8239;- B 2&Delta;5/2 transition of PtF, where the black spectrum is the original ILS configuration, and the red spectrum is the ILS-FTS spectum with enhanced spectral resolution.  The isotopologue structure of PtF is clearly resolved in the red trace.    \n\n2.  Spectral Acquisition of Molecular Radicals and Analysis.  We have recorded and anzlyed spectra of NiF, GeH, PtF, PtCl, CuOH, CuOD, CuO, PtS, TaF, and WS.  Twelve peer-reviewed papers stemming from our research have appeared in the Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy (9), the Journal of Chemical Physics (2), and the Journal of Molecular Structure (1).  A few of the projects are described below. \n\nPtF.  Using the ILS-FTS approach, spectra of several electronic transitions of PtF were obtained.  With the superior spectral resolution, the PtF isotopologue structure (e.g., 194PtF, 195PtF, and 196PtF) is clearly resolved as shown in Figure 3.  An enhanced analysis was performed (mass-independent Dunham fit with electronic field-shift effects) leading to interesting results.  The field shift constants allow comparison to high level ab initio calculations that include multi-configurational excited electronic states and electron densities at the nucleus.  \n\nCuOH and CuOD.  As shown in Figure 4, we recorded ILS spectra several electronic transitions of CuOH and CuOD.  Although the bandhead positions of these transitions were previously reported, two had eluded spectral analysis until our work.\n\nPtS.  We analyzed several electronic transitions of PtS.  Nine vibrational bands of the [15.9]&#8239;B &Omega;=0+ ?&#8239;X 3&Sigma;&#8210; &Omega;=0+ transition were identified.  The A &Omega;=1 ? X 3&Sigma;&#8210; &Omega;=0+ transition was also recorded and analyzed.  This PtS transition was particularly interesting as the Q-branch was perturbed.  Additionally, hyperfine structure was observed for 195PtS in the Q-branch only (see Figure 5).  Through careful examination, we concluded that an &Omega;=0&#8210; state was perturbing the [15.9]&#8239;B &Omega;=0+ state, and a deperturbation analysis was performed.\n\n3.  Work Force Development.  Over the past five years, our work has strengthen a successful inter-institutional collaboration of faculty and students, and further developed students and faculty with skills in spectroscopy, interpretation of molecular constants, and instrument development.  Because Fourier transform spectroscopy is now utilized in many facets of instrumental analysis, we saw an increase in student participation in our research programs at both locations:  seven graduate students and five undergraduate students have worked on these projects, participating in every aspect of the proposed work.  Additionally, since Summer 2016 we have mentored eight high school students associated with the St. Louis area STARS program, which offered a well-organized summer research experience.  Eleven of our twelve publications include at least one student co-author.  Of the 20 participants (2 PIs, 7 grad students, 5 undergrad students, and 8 high school students), 7 have been women and 3 have been underrepresented minority students.          \n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/30/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Leah C O'brien"
