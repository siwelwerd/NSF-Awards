 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program supports new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This project will meet this goal through rigorous research and the broad implementation of an environmental science literacy professional development and learning program for informal educators and youth engaged in outdoor science programs (OSP). With growing support from the literature and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), much attention has been placed on creating and leveraging interdisciplinary science learning opportunities beyond science classrooms. As such, an estimated 300 residential OSPs currently exist in the United States. Unfortunately, the informal educators often charged with facilitating these deep and impactful science learning experiences often lack robust formal training in evidenced-based, age-appropriate environmental science content knowledge and pedagogy specific for the youth in their programs. This issue is often more pronounced in under-resourced and under-served programs and communities. This project will directly address these pervasive challenges in the field by not only providing much needed science focused professional development and resources to informal educators but also by specifically targeting and training informal leaders and educators serving youth in predominately rural areas, low-income communities, and underrepresented communities. \r\n\r\nApproximately 200 OSP leaders at 100 OSPs around the country will participate in a week-long, intensive training in the professional development model at one of five regional residential leadership institutes. OSP leaders will then redeliver the training to the approximately 1,500 OSP educators/field instructors in their home institutions. The OSP educators/field instructors will then use what they learn through the professional development to facilitate the environmental science learning program (i.e., curriculum, field experiences, resources, pedagogy) to over 1 million youth (grades 3-8) enrolled in their residential outdoor science programs.  In addition, a rigorous implementation study, efficacy study and evaluation will be conducted. The implementation study will investigate: (a) Which of the professional learning model practices were implemented and (b) What successes and challenges the programs faced implementing the model. The mixed methods efficacy study will explore: (a) if outdoor science programs contribute to the development of science learning activation and environmental literacy? and (b) what are the features of these experiences that are correlated with increases in science learning activation and environmental literacy. Approximately 25-35 youth will be randomly selected from each of 50 randomly selected sites to participate in the efficacy study. The data and findings from the research and evaluation produced by this project will contribute to a relatively sparse knowledge and research base specific to youth efficacy and implementation processes and practices across nearly 1/3 of the estimated 300 existing residential outdoor science programs in the United States.",

This NSF grant supported the broad implementation of the BEETLES professional learning system. The project resulted in five weeklong, intensive, residential BEETLES Leadership Institutes. These Institutes reached over 200 organization leaders (leadership teams of two from each organization) in over 100 organizations around the United States and several other countries, representing a substantial percentage, perhaps half, of all the organizations in the country delivering residential outdoor learning programs. Our evaluation study showed that organizations participating in these intensive events demonstrated a high degree of uptake and implementation of the resources shared with them.

Many of these &ldquo;emerging leaders&rdquo; have gone on to assume positions of leadership in the field. Over the course of the project, we revised many BEETLES resources to more directly address the significant issues related to equity and justice that challenge the mostly White-led field. We substantially improved the Organization Leaders Guide, several professional learning sessions, and several student activities to demonstrate strategies, approaches and mindsets for overcoming racism and unconscious bias in teaching practices and organizational systems. The Emerging Leaders Program and the revisions of our materials to emphasize equity and justice resulted in a subsequent NSF AISL grant, Working Toward Equitable Organizations. The project also supported two research studies. An Implementation Study explored how organizations go about improving their practices, taking up new resources and building their own organizational capacity for improvement. An Efficacy Study, interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, sought to understand the impact on learners of participating in high quality residential outdoor learning programs. This study produced important indications that Students of Color benefit more from these memorable experiences than do White students, and that girls benefit more than boys. We are seeking additional funding to explore those findings in a larger study. All publications resulting from this grant, including practitioner resources, research and practice briefs, and research findings are available through beetlesproject.org.</span></span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Craig&nbsp;Strang</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
