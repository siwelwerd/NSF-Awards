 "awd_abstract_narration": "Chemical reaction networks lie at the heart of biological processes at the cellular level such as signal transduction, development, gene expression and metabolism.  Cells need to be sensitive to environmental signals, while being robust to unwanted cell-to-cell and environmental variability.  This research will characterize the chemical reaction networks that are absolutely robust with respect to some proteins in the system (background noise and variability) but not to others (molecular signals).  While there are many mechanisms for implementing robustness, the proposed framework relies on intrinsic structural properties of the network. Key downstream proteins are activated and deactivated, so that at steady state the active form has exactly the same concentration in all cells, while inactive forms act as buffers to absorb excess protein.  The goals include: (1) generalizing existing results on absolute robustness to allow for robustness with respect to some proteins but not others, and applying these results to bacterial two-component models; (2) determining the viability of ultrasensitivity, specificity and other signal processing mechanisms in absolutely robust networks; (3) calculating the mean and variance of stochastic absolutely robust systems, and implementing the results to better understand systems of cellular differentiation.\r\n\r\nModern techniques to make measurements inside individual cells are increasingly demonstrating that protein concentrations routinely vary several fold from one cell to the next in cellular tissues.  An important question is to understand how cells handle such variability and perform in a consistent manner.  This question is relevant for many medical issues including abnormal cellular signaling and development.  It could also underlie problems of inconsistent cellular responses to drugs such as chemotherapies.  This grant will develop mathematical methods that are grounded in experimental data, which can help discover new molecular design principles for robustness to total protein concentrations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nA powerful concept in the field of chemical reaction modeling is that of an absolutely robust chemical reaction network.  This phenomenon is observed when one of the species in the network has the same concentration at steady state, regardless of the total amount of any species in the system.  As it turns out, this property can often be verified by inspection of the network topology, regardless of the values of the kinetic parameters, which makes it a particularly appealing property when modeling biochemical reaction networks.  \n\nIn the course of this grant, my lab and collaborators helped develop a comprehensive theory for absolutely robust signal transduction systems.  First, a series of papers generalized the concept of absolute robustness to the stochastic case, showing that in a certain limit the stationary distribution of the absolutely robust variable approximates a Poisson distribution.  In order to fully specify this result, several theoretical bounds were established for this system.   We also developed, in joint work with the lab of Suzanne Sindi at UC Merced, the concept of slack variables which can streamline the solution of the chemical master equation in stochastic chemical reaction networks.  \n\nOne of the most intriguing results was the use of so-called \"absolutely robust controllers\", which are small sets of reactions that can be added to confer absolute concentration robustness to many reaction networks that are not by themselves robust.  These controllers have been shown to work in both deterministic as well as stochastic contexts, and their efficacy was also demonstrated computationally as well as analytically.  Much can be still said in the future about these systems, including which controllers work best, and which families of networks they can stabilize.  \n\nMore generally, work in this grant studied the robustness behavior of several signal trasduction networks, even in more practical systems where no absolute robustness was explicitly defined.  This allowed to establish collaborations with experimental groups such as that of Lee Bardwell (UCI) and that of Alex Hoffmann (UCLA), and to explore from a modeling point of view the potential of these systems to properly carry out communication between cells or implement ultrasensitive responses.  \n\nWe hope that this work will be the beginning of a more extensive study in the community, exploring the range of behaviors that absolute robustness and other signaling systems can observe while maintaining the strict constraints necessary for cellular biochemical processes.  \n\nRegarding the broader impacts of this grant, we supported the Math CEO outreach program for Middle School students in Santa Ana and other diverse communities in Orange County.
