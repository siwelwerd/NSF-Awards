 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, from Jackson State University Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship, establishes an I-Corps Site. Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\nThe Jackson State University Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship (JSU Center) strengthens their culture of entrepreneurship by supporting the translation of research from lab to market through training for faculty, students, and staff in the areas of academic entrepreneurship and innovation. The JSU Site:\r\n-Offers entrepreneurial training and development opportunities for faculty and student teams in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines to prepare them for participation in the NSF I-Corps Teams Program or for further commercialization; \r\n-Broadens the participation of underrepresented, specifically African American, faculty and students in STEM and entrepreneurial training and development; and \r\n-Builds the capacity of faculty and students to explore the translation of academic research into tools, products, services, etc. that are favorable candidates for commercialization. \r\nThese objectives are carried out through three major activities: \r\n-Twelve weeks of training for 30 STEM teams per year that emphasizes the role of customer discovery and the business model canvas in the journey toward commercialization.\r\n-A year-long series of academic entrepreneurship workshops offered to the teams as well as to the campus community\r\n-An end of the year Academic Entrepreneurship Networking and Engagement Session, hosted annually in conjunction with Mississippi Innovation Month and Global Entrepreneurship Week.\r\n\r\nWhile progress has been made in understanding how to support scholars in the transition of research and innovations from lab to market, little attention has been directed to the ways in which faculty and students at minority serving institutions may require different levels of support or engagement to be successful in their entrepreneurial efforts. Teaching-loads, service requirements, and limited resources may hinder faculty of color at minority serving institutions from venturing into entrepreneurship. Lack of exposure to STEM professionals and limited access to information regarding entrepreneurship may limit African American students? opportunities to participate in research based academic entrepreneurship. Situating an I-Corps Site within the JSU institutional contributes to greater understanding of the best practices for overcoming the obstacles that hinder people of color and women in STEM from participating in innovation and commercialization activities.\r\n\r\nThrough teaching and learning activities for faculty and students in STEM, and by actively engaging faculty and students of color in academic entrepreneurship, start-up, and commercialization training and customer discovery, the JSU Entrepreneurship Center/I-Corps Site plays a major role in broadening the participation of underrepresented populations in STEM related entrepreneurial activities. The increased participation of faculty of color impacts society and the community in particular by bringing to market the products, process, services, and/or tools that are the result of research from a diverse pool of scholars and thinkers. The pairing of underrepresented students with STEM faculty and successful entrepreneurs also impacts the community by providing important networking, mentorship, and research opportunities - all of which are essential parts of recruiting and retaining students and promoting career advancement for faculty.",
