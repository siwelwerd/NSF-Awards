 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project is a collaborative effort between Arizona State University, Central Arizona College, Cochise College, Eastern Arizona College, Estrella Mountain Community College, Glendale Community College, Mesa Community College, Mohave Community College, Phoenix College, and Yavapai College. The program will provide scholarships for talented, low-income students with demonstrated financial need who are pursuing degrees in engineering or computer science. In addition to scholarships, the program will provide academic and other support to increase the persistence of these academically talented, low-income students.  The project design includes an academic success and professional development course along with project-based activities.  Faculty and industrial mentors help students to envision the potential career opportunities and benefits available in engineering and computer science. Nine of the ten collaborating schools are classified as Hispanic Serving Institutions. Scholarships and support for low-income and academically talented students, who may not otherwise be able to obtain engineering or computer science degrees will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic well being of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to address the need to expand the engineering and computer science workforce by increasing the success of Arizona State University students including students that transfer from community colleges. The program combines a network of engineering mentors with a successful student-centered and mentor-driven academic success and professional development course to significantly increase the number of community college students that consider, choose, continue and graduate with a bachelor of science in engineering or computer science.  At the center of the proposed initiative is a commitment to involving students in career-shaping projects that will permit them to discover, nurture, and fully develop their technical interests. Guided by grounded theory and social cognitive career theory, the project will also study the factors most central to maintaining effectiveness while scaling up a successful student-centered and mentor-intensive transfer student support system to encompass a larger group of collaborating institutions. Community colleges will play an increasingly important role in educating the nation's engineers. This statewide project will serve as a collaborative model for four-year and two-year schools across the nation. This research will provide knowledge helpful in establishing a transfer student support program in Arizona and will inform other university and community college networks in other parts of the United States. The findings from the program will be disseminated widely to the engineering and computer science education community.",

Project goals included providing scholarships for students majoring in engineering, collaborating with other rural community colleges to strengthen engineering programs at each institution, promoting engineering as a viable course of study, planning and participating in community outreach events, and providing educational support for current engineering students.</p>\n<p>The S-STEM grant was able to continue the momentum of a prior NSF STEP grant. We awarded forty-two (42) scholarships over the 6-year span of the grant. Twenty-six of those scholars graduated with an associate's degree in engineering and/or transferred to a university majoring in engineering. Three students should graduate in May 2023.</p>\n<p>Scholarships provided through the grant have been instrumental in encouraging students to pursue engineering. In Fall 2017, EAC awarded sixteen S-STEM scholarships ranging between $500 and $1000. We noted that small scholarships, while helpful, were not enough to keep students from having to work to support their education. As we progressed through the grant, we focused on students that were really committed to an engineering career, providing them enough funds to really make a financial difference. During the last year of the grant, only one of the S-STEM scholars worked during the semester. The higher scholarship amounts, which were increased from $500 to $3500, allowed students to focus on their college courses without the burden of working. While we had to reduce the number of scholarships that we awarded to students, we were able to make a larger impact on the more highly motivated engineering students.</p>\n<p>EAC experienced struggles over the span of the grant. During Fall 2018, EAC's engineering instructor elected to resign to take a job as the Town Engineer. Relying on connections with other rural community colleges, EAC was able to collaborate with Mohave Community College where their instructor taught an engineering course simultaneously via Zoom to both EAC and Mohave Community College students. Thanks to EAC's relationship with FreePort McMoRan, we were able to hire one of their engineers to teach Introduction to Engineering and Thermodynamics.</p>\n<p>In Fall 2018, EAC hired a new engineering instructor. Dr. Attard brought undergraduate research opportunities to our engineering students. Engineering students worked with Dr. Attard on a research project on curing of decorative concrete. Unfortunately, Dr. Attard left after one year.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>EAC hired an enthusiastic engineering instructor to take over the program. Mr.&nbsp; Udall has brought an added level of excitement to the engineering program. He regularly visits local high schools to promote engineering. He created a video, featuring his students talking about the engineering program at EAC and describing the various opportunities for engineers.</p>\n<p>Over the span of the grant, EAC students have traveled to ASU and the University of Arizona to tour facilities and meet with engineering faculty. Getting students onto the campus of a university was a catalyst in helping them transfer and pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Engineering.</p>\n<p>The STEM Club has been a vital addition to EAC. In 2019, ten STEM club students toured the Mt. Graham International Observatory. STEM Club students designed Arduino sensors and mounts for the biology department drones. Students were involved with devising and implementing new ideas for the Gila Valley Heath and STEAM festival.&nbsp;They built a Foucault pendulum, designed activities using the small engineering trebuchets, demonstrated the large trebuchet, made a hovercraft and made pin-hole cameras.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Gila Valley Health and STEAM Festival and Engineering Day, along with other outreach efforts were conducted to increase awareness of career opportunities in engineering and the transfer pathways available. Participation in Engineering Day increased from 145 in 2015 to a high of 245 in 2022.</p>\n<p>EAC saw additional impacts. The Engineering Program Advisory Committee meets annually with representatives from the local mining community, a high school math/engineering teacher, the County Engineer, and a local civil engineering firm principal. An Engineering Department website was created to increase the exposure of students to engineering as well as provide information about transferring to a university. The grant has been a catalyst in the educational community, strengthening the Eastern Arizona Science Initiative (EASI), a group of K-14 teachers that meet on&nbsp;a monthly basis to discuss STEM education in our community. This group has organized summer science camps, weekend STEM lectures, and provided science workshops for teachers.</p>\n<p>Many wonderful relationships have been built with faculty from other community colleges and universities. The engineering program has become strong and vibrant and there is a sense of excitement about engineering in the community. We are grateful to NSF for their support in helping make this happen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/28/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Phil&nbsp;Mcbride</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564872/1564872_10463956_1674934036553_NSFS-STEMPoster--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564872/1564872_10463956_1674934036553_NSFS-STEMPoster--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"S-STEM Scholars\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564872/1564872_10463956_1674934036553_NSFS-STEMPoster--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"S-STEM Scholars\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The NSF S-STEM grant made a difference at Eastern Arizona College.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Phil McBride</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Phil&nbsp;Mcbride</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">S-STEM Scholars</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564872/1564872_10463956_1674934969950_SciTechFestival--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564872/1564872_10463956_1674934969950_SciTechFestival--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Gila Valley Health and STEAM Festival\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564872/1564872_10463956_1674934969950_SciTechFestival--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Gila Valley Health and STEAM Festival\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Engineering Students help with community outreach to showcase STEM.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Phil McBride</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Phil&nbsp;Mcbride</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Gila Valley Health and STEAM Festival</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564872/1564872_10463956_1674935125418_EACandCCatASU--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564872/1564872_10463956_1674935125418_EACandCCatASU--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"EAC and CC students at ASU\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564872/1564872_10463956_1674935125418_EACandCCatASU--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"EAC and CC students at ASU\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Eastern Arizona College and Cochise College students network at ASU Drone Lab.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Phil McBride</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Phil&nbsp;Mcbride</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">EAC and CC students at ASU</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564872/1564872_10463956_1674935280790_PXL_20220303_173851788--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564872/1564872_10463956_1674935280790_PXL_20220303_173851788--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Mousetrap Boats\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564872/1564872_10463956_1674935280790_PXL_20220303_173851788--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Mousetrap Boats\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">High school students test their mousetrap boats at the annual Engineering Day at Eastern Arizona College</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Spencer Udall</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Phil&nbsp;Mcbride</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Mousetrap Boats</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564872/1564872_10463956_1674935441590_Tower2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564872/1564872_10463956_1674935441590_Tower2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Engineering Day\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1564872/1564872_10463956_1674935441590_Tower2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Engineering Day\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">High school students compete at Engineering Day</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Spencer Udall</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Phil&nbsp;Mcbride</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Engineering Day</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
