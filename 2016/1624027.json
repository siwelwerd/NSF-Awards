 "awd_abstract_narration": "With partial funding from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program, this project supports the Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar on Colloidal Semiconductor Nanocrystals, specifically facilitating the participation of students, postdocs, and early career scientists. The Conference program is inclusive of diverse participants as presenters and discussion leaders, including an emphasis on women, underrepresented minorities, and early career researchers. The Gordon Research Seminar, to be held on this topic for the first time, is organized by graduate student co-chairs with presenters and discussion leaders also being graduate students, postdocs, and early career scientists. This topical area holds great relevance for the advancement of knowledge that can enhance or even revolutionize energy storage, conversion, and conservation technologies, elevating the importance of the scientific discussion and especially the education of a new generation of researchers in this area.\r\n\r\nColloidal nanocrystals are chemically synthesized in organic media and their surfaces are passivated with organic surfactants that solubilize the nanocrystals in solvent dispersion, and perform a range of functions, including electronic passivation of surface states, mediation of chemical interactions with other materials, and electronic exchange with the environment. Recently, it has become clear that controlling the chemistry of the surfaces of the nanocrystals is critical to observing the special properties promised by quantum confinement. The goals of this Gordon Research Conference are to explore the photophysical and materials properties of colloidal nanocrystals in terms of the chemical structure of both the core and the surface. The Conference program highlights: (i) synthetic methods to tune the composition, shape, and surface chemistry of nanocrystals, (ii) new analytical methods to quantitatively characterize the core and surface chemistry of the nanocrystals, (iii) photophysical studies of nanocrystals that relate activity in chemical and electronic systems, (iv) doping and plasmonic behavior in semiconductor nanocrystals, (v) the bio-compatibility and bio-applications of nanocrystals, and (vi) methods to form and properties of assemblies of nanocrystals. The program also features a session on emerging nanocrystal materials, specifically pnictides and halides. The value of this conference, with respect to pushing forward fundamental work in this field, lies in its compilation of advancements in these diverse topics into a single program addressed to a single interdisciplinary audience.",
