 "awd_abstract_narration": "The principle of energy conservation dictates that the total energy of any closed system does not change with time. For most highly complex interacting systems, energy is the only such conserved quantity, but there are exceptions to this rule. In rare situations, even quite complex systems may have additional invariant quantities whose existence constrains the possible physical configurations of the system. These extra invariants generally arise when the system possesses some degree of symmetry. The resulting constraints---the so-called conservation laws---are responsible, for example, for the clock-like regularity of the motion of Newton's cradle, for the existence of perfectly straight stable ocean-shore waves, and for the simplicity of the shape of the planetary orbits. The goal of this project is to learn to employ such non-standard conservation laws as a tool to stabilize atom interferometers; quantum mechanical devices used in ultra-sensitive detectors of gravitational and other fields. In addition, the project may shed light on the manner by which complex systems, once disturbed, return to equilibrium, and the time-scale required for that relaxation. This work involves exciting certain highly stable modes, so-called \"atomic breathers\", of an atom interferometer, and then studying the relaxation of these modes as they encounter a potential barrier. The high degree of sensitivity of the interferometer provides an opportunity for much more careful scrutiny of non-equilibrium processes than has been possible previously. \r\n \r\nThere are three major components of the proposal: a study of the relaxation dynamics of the breathers, including effects of symmetry-breaking; the development of an experimental protocol for the creation of highly-stable breathers; and an assessment of the stability of the breathers against dissociation and decay. The group of four principal investigators possess combine unique skill sets ideally suited for these tasks: it includes experimental techniques for manipulating bosonic solitons (breathers made of bosonic atoms), theoretical quantum, mean-field, and classical nonequilibrium dynamics, Inverse Scattering Transform and nonlinear perturbation theory, and applications of the Bethe ansatz. The tight coupling of theory and experiment is a crucial aspect of this project and will be essential for its success.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur work focuses on objects known as solitons.  Solitons, which have been known for over 150 years, are localized waves that may propagate long distances without significantly spreading out or diminishing in size.  One well-known example are rogue waves in the deep ocean; these rogue waves are enormous in size and they may propagate for hundreds of miles over the open ocean.\n\nWe exploit the wave-particle duality, one of the defining features of the quantum world, to create solitons of matter, specifically the waves of atoms cooled to barely above absolute zero in temperature.  Quantum theory generally governs the behavior of microscopic particles, like electrons or very cold atoms, while the classical laws of nature apply to larger objects.  The rules governing the classical and quantum worlds are sometimes shockingly different.  For example, quantum theory allows an object to be in two different locations simultaneously, while such an idea applied to our macro-world leads to bizarre, and obviously wrong predictions.  One of the most famous is that of the Schrodinger cat, where the cat may be both dead and alive at the same time.  While we are aware that the rules are different in the two regimes, we know little about the transition between the quantum and classical worlds.  Our work directly aims at exploring this boundary, so that we may better understand it.\n\nThe solitons that we make in the laboratory consist of hundreds to thousands of atoms in a wave-like state known as a Bose-Einstein condensate.  With just a few atoms, the solitons live firmly in the quantum world where they may be split by interaction with a partially transparent barrier, known as a beam-splitter.  By increasing the number of atoms we aim to produce a \"cat-like\" state where the soliton has both fully transmitted through the barrier and reflected from it.  We will make quantitative measurements of how long the cat-state can survive and what influences the decay of this quantum mechanical entanglement.  The knowledge that we learn may be used to help build quantum computers or other engineered quantum devices, such as an interferometer.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Randall G Hulet"
