 "awd_abstract_narration": "This collaborative proposal aims to combine advances in ice core sampling technology, knowledge of Andean storm event meteorology, cyberinfrastructure, and climate modeling and analysis to fresh snow, snowpits and ice core data to be recovered from ice caps in Peru and Bolivia.\r\n\r\nThe specific goals of the project are to investigate South American atmospheric circulation features (e.g. El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a (ENSO), South American Low-level Jet, Southern Hemisphere trades and westerlies), tropical-mid-latitude-polar teleconnections, and the significance of key global-scale forcing functions that control atmospheric circulation (e.g. solar variability, volcanic activity, dusts, and greenhouse gases) and have significant relevance to moisture and heat transport over South America.\r\n\r\nThe regional retreat of alpine glaciers coupled with increased population, industry, and agriculture activities are generating future demands on water resources. Declines in water resources may magnify the regional impacts of ENSO.  Instrumental records of climate and environmental variability over the region are sparse yet ice cores from Central Andean glaciers provide a source of high resolution records of past climate dynamics and chemistry of the atmosphere extending back centuries to millennia.  \r\n\r\nClimate reconstructions from ice cores could provide added temporal and spatial context to existing multi-proxy reconstructions in order to assess the impact of natural and human-induced physical and chemical climate change at the storm-scales that impact day to day and season to season events, and in the process, develop analogs for predicting future change.\r\n\r\nThis project builds on the researchers' recent W.M. Keck Foundation and NSF-supported transformative laser sampling of ice cores and the newly released, NSF-supported cyberinfrastructure and climate analysis tools.  It also involves supporting an early career post-doctoral scholar, development and testing of new analytical tools, and strong collaboration with South American scientists.",
