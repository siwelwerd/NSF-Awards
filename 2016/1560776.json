 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study, by anthropologists Dr. Eric C. Jones (University of Texas Health Science Center, Houston) and Dr. Arthur D. Murphy (University of North Carolina, Greensboro), investigates the effects of community networks on individual and family responses to mass trauma and extreme events. Mass trauma events, such as public venue shootings and bombings, linger in people's lives long after the events themselves. They also tie together former strangers and do so in ways that significantly affect the recovery process for both individuals and communities. The goal of the research is to understand how different networked groups develop, how they change over time, and how those changes affect and are affected by their reaction to the events and their aftermath. Because this is a dynamic process that begins right after an event takes place and unfolds over years, Jones and Murphy have taken a  longitudinal approach: a sustained, focused, long-term investigation of how social groups emerge, coalesce, and divide, as well as how they affect and are affected by their contexts and memberships, during the recovery process.  Their focal event is a 2009 fire that broke out in a Hermasillo, Mexico, day care center and killed 49 young children while also injuring many more. This award supports a third round of data collection and analysis.\r\n\r\nThe researchers will map out the formal named groups of local residents and affected families and the informal sub-networks (calculated with hierarchical clustering) among parents and caretakers. They also will conduct in-depth interviews and participant observation (such as attending marches, meetings, commemorations) to understand how the different subgroups generate diverse meanings and pathways to recovery over time. The network data will be analyzed with formal network modeling measures of embeddedness and bridging. The interview data will be coded for analysis with text analysis software. Preliminary findings suggest that while participation in a network of people who shared and understood their experience sometimes afforded a support advantage, this was not always true. Jones and Murphy will explore the sources of disagreement and conflict, how these affect recovery, and what produces exceptions where these conflicts and individual problems like guilt, depression, fear and helplessness are overcome. This project builds new links between the fields of community psychology and anthropology in disaster and trauma studies. It also brings insights on impact and recovery to a broader audience of political scientists interested in extreme events and governance, geographers who study hazards and vulnerability, and sociologists  concentrating on disasters and social organization. Better knowledge of social aspects of coping in mass trauma events is important for counselors, as well as public officials and policy makers who must help those who struggle to find meaning and justice post-trauma.",

Following similar research in 2010 and 2011, we mapped out formal named groups created by affected families&mdash;as well as mapped out the informal subnetworks among parents/caretakers&mdash;that had developed by seven years after the disaster. We found that social media played an important part in both the formal groups and in maintaining the informal networks. Before the fire, only 1/3 of the ties at year 1 had existed or, in other words, the amount of ties/relationships tripled in that first year. We interviewed 167 people at year 7, or about 80% of the people we had interviewed at year 2. Of the ties between parents, at year 7, around 90% of those ties involved agreement on what needed to be done to achieve social justice, 3/4 involved mutual emotional support, 2/3 involved mutual informational support, and 1/5 involved mutual material support, suggesting that the network was a grieving network but also one in which social justice seeking and information sharing was important. In terms of wellbeing, posttraumatic stress stunningly increased from year 2 to year 7, with 1/3 having 12-17 symptoms (out of 17) while only 1/5 had that amount at year 2; moderate levels of symptoms were unchanged with half having 6-11 symptoms at both year 2 and year 7. People who were part of formal groups had higher levels of postraumatic stress symptoms, suggesting that they got involved politically because of greater distress and that maybe staying in these groups can maintain their stress. Also, people who maintained no ties to other parents/caretakers typically had much lower levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms.
