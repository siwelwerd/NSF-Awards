This project, then, has three aims: first, to provide a quantitative overview of jail for child support nonpayment using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCW); second, to understand the processes by which courts decide whom to jail for child support nonpayment; third, to understand how families experience punitive child support enforcement and what the consequences of this enforcement tactic might be.\r\n\r\nUsing a mixed methods design, this project explores the frequency, distribution, process, and consequences of jail for child support nonpayment.  The researchers will perform court observation in two Texas counties and conduct in-depth interviews with custodial and noncustodial parents. This approach will explain how interpersonal and jurisdictional-level factors interact with individual characteristics to shape an individual's risk of being jailed.",

Jailing for child support nonpayment is one of many possible mechanisms of child support enforcement, but little is known about how frequently this tactic is used, against whom, and what the consequences are. Using a mixed methods design, this project explores the frequency, process, and consequences of jail for child support nonpayment. This dissertation is divided into four substantive chapters. In Chapter 1, I use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCW) to explore the prevalence of jail for child support debt in a national context, finding that about 14% of debtors go to jail for this debt by the time their child is nine years old. I propose two conceptual pathways into jail, and find that debt load and family complexity are major predictors of incarceration. In Chapter 2, I map the legal process of finding a parent in contempt and committing the parent to jail, focusing on the role of judicial discretion at three crucial decision points in the life of a case. Focusing on my field work in Riley County, Chapter 3 argues that child support officials police the work and family choices of nonresident parents in ways conceptually similar to how welfare policy controls recipients&rsquo; behavior. Chapter 4 identifies how interpersonal gendered disputes translate into legal action in the child support enforcement process. This project has the potential to contribute to the national conversation about legal debt, family change, and criminal justice reform, as well as to inform laws and policies concerning child support, criminal justice, and the family. This project also has implications for the study of inequality.
