 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Chemistry of Life Processes (CLP) program supports work by Professor Andrew H. Marcus at the University of Oregon to determine the local conformations of DNA bases and backbones at replication fork junctions. These junctions are potential binding sites for proteins that manipulate genes. There are currently few techniques available that can provide detailed structural information about protein-DNA complexes, particularly those near DNA fork junctions. This project is developing methods that combine two fluorescence measurements, to specifically investigate DNA-protein structural dynamics at fork junctions. The methods are potentially of general use in understanding many processes of DNA biochemistry. In addition, such methods could potentially help to identify defects in the function of DNA replication, repair and cell cycle control complexes involved in human diseases. The tools are made readily available to the scientific community. The undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students are benefitting from cross-disciplinary training and interactions with researchers that have a variety of scientific backgrounds.   \r\n\r\nThe research project uses two-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy (2DFS) to investigate the local DNA base and backbone conformations and conformational dynamics at pre-selected sites within model DNA replication forks, and functional replication protein-DNA complexes. The experiments determine key structural end-states and DNA-protein binding recognition motifs important for the formation of replication complexes. The approaches employ DNA constructs containing two adjacently positioned fluorescent base analogue probes. In separate experiments, cyanine chromophores which absorb in a spectral region where DNA and proteins are transparent, are incorporated into the sugar-phosphate backbone. Coupling between the electronic states of the dimer probe residues produces signature spectral features that are used to infer local nucleic acid base or backbone conformation. The acquired information on dynamics is central to understanding mechanisms by which protein-DNA complexes assemble to carry out their specialized functions. A second goal of the project is to begin to develop single-molecule 2DFS to monitor local DNA conformational dynamics with sub-second time resolution.\r\n\r\nThis project is jointly funded by the Chemistry of Life Processes Program in the Division of Chemistry and the Molecular Biophysics Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.",
