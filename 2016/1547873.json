 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, from Washington State University (WSU) creates an I-Corps Site at this institution.\r\n\r\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. \r\n\r\nThe WSU Site serves as mechanism for collaboration across campus, acting as a structure for providing experiential learning opportunities for students and faculty. By expanding the connectivity between related programs on and off campus, the Site realizes benefits that transcend the individual efforts and enhance WSU's contribution to the national innovation ecosystem as well as the geographical region around WSU.\r\n\r\nThe goal of WSU's I-Corps Site is to enhance and broaden access to existing entrepreneurship programs within their experiential entrepreneurship ecosystem. To accomplish this goal, 30 to 40 I-Corps Teams per year are supported, expanding startup generation activities to include an 8-week training and idea development process. Each supported Team produces a draft business model for a university technology or Site-generated business idea. Those Teams emerge ready to pursue funding or partnership opportunities through the Site network and national I-Corps Network. Ultimately, WSU will provide a core blueprint for student/faculty collaborative experiential entrepreneurship training which will provide additional pathways for STEM students to engage with faculty in the business assessment of new technology ideas. Bringing WSU into the I-Corps national network allows Site Leaders to accelerate the positive startup culture velocity achieved in the last few years.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAlthough our participation was down this year in the two regular  I-Corps cohorts, we believe due to COVID burnout and all campus  activities remaining mostly remote for the first half of 2022, we did  have a second positive initial engagement with an interdisciplinary  course of PHD students: MPS574: Protein Biotechnology in Fall  semester.   This course is an NIH funded course specifically designed to  bring PhD students from various subject areas together to  explorebiotechnology opportunities from various interdisciplinary  perspectives.\n\nFor this course specifically, we were able to initially identify 15  current disclosed technologies by faculty to the university that were  randomly assigned to 10 total teams within the protein biotech course.   Bi-weekly, the students were exposed to the I-Corps content in the same  way it would have been disseminated in a typical cohort.  Student teams  were initially assigned 2 technologies each and then asked to select the  one technology they thought had the most commercial potential.  They  then engaged in the customer discovery process as teams and reported to  the class every other week their progress on their chosen technology and  insights gained from the customer discovery process.   This project  culminated in a \"report out\" final presentation in which  entrepreneurship students also attended and were allowed to ask  questions of the teams as they presented. \n\nThis project was a great success with the students very engaged in  the process.  We plan to continue this project in 2022 with the same  course and are beginning to investigate the possibility of offering a 1  credit I-Corps like course for all graduate students through the Center  For Entrepreneurship.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/06/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian Kraft"
