 "awd_abstract_narration": "The city of Seoul is the 6th most densely populated city in the world, and has a growing metropolitan area. The increasing density has enhanced the urban heat island (UHI) effect over the last four decades. This UHI along with projected warming over the coming century will cause heightened energy use and heat stress. Changes to the built environment can provide heat adaptation strategies and improve urban sustainability, helping human health and the economy of the city.  Quantifying the complex urban environment at human scales of exposures with mobile and place-based measurements is needed to address these issues and guide climate adaptation in large, growing cities.  The goal of this project is thus to quantify intra-urban air and surface temperatures on days of extreme heat, and map these and other meteorological variables to identify, at a fine-scale, the locations of increased risk of heat stress and hazards that will impact human health.  This research will be conducted at Seoul National University in collaboration with Dr. Joon Kim and Dr. Kyu Rang Kim of the National Institute of Meteorological Sciences, both noted experts in urban microclimate processes.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will determine the locations of the highest surface temperatures in the neighborhood of Gangnam in Seoul, Korea, and link urban surface characteristics with measured ambient variables of radiation, surface temperature, and air temperature.  Within these hot urban microclimates, the human energy budget will be modeled using the COMFA energy budget model to predict heat stress, and fine-scale heat stress hazards will be identified and mapped.  In major metropolitan areas, such as Seoul, pinpointing the zones where an individual is at escalated risks of heat-related illnesses or surface burn hazard provides important information to focus mitigation and adapting strategies to lessen energy use and protect human health. Such multi-scale modeling of urban and neighborhood ambient environments is one of the major frontiers of mathematical geosciences and the interdisciplinary perspectives will advance the fundamental knowledge of fine-scale urban surface micrometeorology. \r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the National Research Foundation of Korea.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe city of Seoul is the 6th most densely populated city in the world, and has a growing metropolitan area. The increasing density of heat-absorbing buildings and surfaces has enhanced the urban heat island (UHI) effect over the last four decades. This UHI along with projected warming over the coming century will cause heightened energy use and human heat stress.  Changes to the built environment can provide heat adaptation strategies and improve urban sustainability, helping human health and the economy of the city.  High surface and air temperatures that impact humans are commonly found at very fine scales, from the touch scale of ~1cm, to a human scale of ~1m.  Quantifying the complex urban environment at human scales of exposures with mobile and place-based measurements is needed to generate a new evidence-base to guide climate adaptation in large, growing cities.  Seoul?s restoration of the Cheonggye stream in the city center in 2005 provides such an opportunity using natural surfaces such as vegetation and soil, and open water.  The current study collected fine-scale intra-urban surface and air temperatures (Ta), radiant heat load, wind speed, and relative humidity along transect routes both directly adjacent to the lowered stream and on the upper streets, as well as extending into the city, during hot days in the summer of 2016 in the city.  Five bioclimatically distinct microclimates were also analyzed in a stationary fashion along the stream.  Human thermal comfort (TC) was modeled using the COMFA energy budget (EB) model and the Wet Bulb Globe Thermometer (WBGT) Index.  Results demonstrate an average increase of 1.1&deg;C in Ta when moving away from the stream to the inner-city, with human EBs and overall heat stress being more closely correlated to incoming solar radiation than to Ta.  An average EB and WBGT difference of 83.1 Wm-2 and 0.9&deg;C, respectively, is found between the lower and upper transect routes.  Additionally, of the five distinct environments, the environment in full sun with vegetation had the highest average Ta (33.1&deg;C) and was the least thermally comfortable (EB = 166.6 Wm-2, WBGT = 29.0&deg;C), with the full shade environment providing the greatest comfort.  Shade also played a large role in decreasing the surface temperatures and WBGT.  As metropolitan areas expand and air temperatures are projected to continue to rise, the importance of understanding how to mitigate the impact of heat on human health is emergent.  A growing number of studies, this study included, have found that manmade and natural open water bodies influence the microclimate of urban areas through both evaporative cooling and the support of urban green space.  However, the Cheonggye stream, characterized as a small stream with low-lying vegetation, had only a small effect in lowering the Ta, with shade (whether along the street or stream) playing a larger role in comfort and Ta reduction on hot, humid days.  Results in dry climates are expected to have greater Ta and human heat stress reductions due to water.  As the Cheonggye Stream Renewal Project was completed in 2005, the stream?s support of urban green space is relatively new and may influence greater cooling in the future as vegetation along the stream continues to grow and provide further shading.  Thus, when implementing a manmade water body within a major city, urban planners should consider a co-implementation of trees and plants along the water body that provide shade.  Overall, this study provides evidence for bioclimatic design recommendations for landscape architects and urban planners, which can be applied in densely populated cities around the world for human-scale heat stress mitigation as a form of climate change adaptation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/29/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alexandria J Herdt"
