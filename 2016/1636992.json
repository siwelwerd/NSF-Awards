 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project involves an innovation that supports full upper-body representation in Virtual Reality systems.\r\n\r\nVirtual Reality (VR) in its current form lacks products for upper body haptic feedback and tracking. The need for haptic feedback when contacting virtual objects and environments is recognized as an unmet void. This project's \"NullSpace\" VR system is a full upper body haptic feedback suit for virtual reality, using a built-in tracking system and programmable vibrating pads placed on muscle groups around the body and on the hands and fingers. When a user enters a VR experience, the tracking system accurately maps motions into the virtual space; then, as the user interacts with virtual objects and obstacles, the vibrating pads activate to provide a sense of touch.\r\n\r\nNullSpace is appropriate for users of both Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) in simulation and gaming scenarios including researchers and medical professionals seeking ways to make PTSD Immersion Therapy and phobia treatment more effective, or projects requiring accurate simulation for training purposes, such as astronaut task training, flight simulation, and medical procedure training. Another potential user population of the NullSpace system are gamers who are interested in interactive virtual reality and desire additional control and feedback capability in their virtual experiences. Virtual reality games using standard headset hardware cannot track the arms and body and represent them as a player avatar, creating a disorienting visual effect of being limbless and incorporeal while in the virtual space.\r\n\r\nA prototype of the haptic system has been developed, and has been demonstrated to users at private display events, but the suit will require significant user need finding and testing to focus on the commercialization space.  For the duration of the I-Corps program, the team plans to focus on need finding through market-oriented interviews.",

Start 11/01/2016</p>\n<p><br />Nullspace VR, a startup spun out of the undergraduate robotics club at the University of Rochester participated in the I-Corps Teams Program out of the Atlanta Site in the spring of 2016. The product being developed is an immersive haptic suit and gloves that allows the user to touch and feel virtual reality through vibration motors embedded into the fabric. The plan was to initially market the suit to the gaming community since it accounts for the majority consumer-level VR sales.<br /><br />The I-Corps experience was immensely valuable to the group. In the course of 100+ interviews with potential customers, we learned that the suit could be successfully marketed only if there were games that used it and a software development kit (SDK) that made it easy for game developers to incorporate the suit into their games. This caused us to refocus our efforts on forging relationships with independent game developers.<br /><br />After the I-Corps experience, using seed funding from an early angel investor, the team moved startup headquarters to an incubator in Seattle WA The Seattle area is also home to a vibrant game development community. In February 2017, the Team launched a Kickstarter campaign for its first product, the Hardlight VR suit, with the goal of raising $80,000 for an initial build.
