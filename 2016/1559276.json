 "awd_abstract_narration": "Volatile halogenated hydrocarbon gases, in this case halomethanes, are produced naturally by organisms in the ocean; which then serves as a source of these biogenic gases to the atmosphere. Their chemical reactions in the atmosphere are very similar to those of anthropogenic chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). While CFCs are well-studied because they consume the ozone in the upper atmosphere that shields the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation, halomethanes have been largely neglected, even though they currently account for 25% of the ozone depletion.  As anthropogenic CFC levels steadily decline, however, halomethanes are predicted to account for 50% of ozone depletion by 2050.  Based on limited study thus far, marine halomethane production has been ascribed mainly to phytoplankton and macro algae. This project will build on new and compelling data that suggests marine heterotrophic bacteria could also be major producers of halomethanes.  The data produced here will provide the critical evaluation required to address discrepancies in global halomethane budgets which currently are out of balance due to an unknown source to the atmosphere, evaluating the hypothesis that marine heterotrophic bacteria can supply this missing source. Concerns over the stability of the earth's stratospheric ozone layer make this valuable and necessary research with added value of providing support for engaged undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral education at the University of Southern California.\r\n\r\nPast research on the production of marine halomethanes has focused on phytoplankton and macro algae, while potential bacterial contributions to the processe have been neglected. This research proposes to study the role of marine heterotrophic bacteria on the production of halomethanes. It has been noted in past studies that there are discrepancies in the global atmospheric halomethane budget, and it is possible this is due to a large missing bacterial source. Additionally, this research will evaluate the potential importance of vitamin B12, methionine, and vanadium cofactors on the synthesis of halomethanes in bacteria. A large portion of marine bacteria cannot synthesize methylation co-enzymes, and therefore, would require available B12, methionine, and vanadium from external sources to complete the methylation step. This study will also measure concentrations of halomethanes, B12, methionine, and vanadium in upwelling regions as well as at a long-term time series site in order to put constraints on the variability of halomethanes concentrations for use in global linked air-sea models.",
