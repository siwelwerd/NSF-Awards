 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), along with the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, are responsible for securing Internet transactions such as banking, email, and e-commerce; they provide users with the ability to verify with whom they are communicating online, and enable encryption of those communications.  While the use of the PKI is mostly automated, there is a surprising amount of human intervention in management tasks that are crucial to its proper operation.  As a result, there have been numerous instances where mismanagement of the PKI has harmed the security of end users.  This project is developing techniques to better understand and improve the management of the PKI, helping to better secure the Internet.\r\n\r\nThis project has four research foci, each examining the management challenges faced by different players in the PKI: Content Distribution Network (CDN) administrators, Certificate Authorities (CAs), end-users, and non-Web protocols.  First, the project is conducting measurements to better understand the frequency of sharing private keys between sites and their CDNs, and to improve the security of this practice.  Second, the project is developing new incentives for CAs to ensure information about their revoked certificates reach end users.  Third, the project is aiming to better understand how the PKI will evolve as the Internet of Things (IoT) grows and the PKI is forced to quickly scale up.  Fourth, the project will expand existing measurement approaches to understand the difficulties of PKI management in non-Web protocols (e.g., IMAPS), which have traditionally been less-well maintained.",

Unfortunately, the management of these PKIs is often difficult, error-prone, and a common vector for attacks.  In this project, we endeavoured to better understand the management of the SSL PKI (as well as other PKIs).  We used a combination of large-scale measurement and the development of new approaches and techniques to reveal the weaknesses in the current PKIs and to improve upon these weaknesses where possible.\n\n \n\nWe extensively studied the web\u2019s PKI (TLS), demonstrating the large aggregation of SSL/TLS keys at third parties such as CDNs and hosting providers, quantifying how (in)frequently clients verify that certificates are not revoked, and proposing a new certificate revocation dissemination system (CRLite) that is vastly more efficient and broad than existing mechanisms.  CRLite is now in the final stages of being incorporated into Firefox.\n\n\nWe also extensively studied the PKI used within the DNS system (DNSSEC), quantifying for the first time the pervasive mismanagement of the DNSSEC infrastructure.  For example, we find nearly one-third of the domains that try to deploy DNSSEC fail to do so correctly; as a result, they cannot be validated due to missing or incorrect records.  When investigating why so many domains fail to successfully deploy DNSSEC, we demonstrated that DNS registrar support for DNSSEC varies widely, with a significant lack of DNSSEC support by registrars being a key challenge for many domain operators.\n\n\nWe examined the PKI used within the internet\u2019s routing infrastructure (RPKI).  We examined over 8 years of its evolution, and found that while the RPKI did still have some management issues, measurements of today's deployments indicate that mismanagement is increasingly rare, and thus in many cases routers can enforce route origin security by dropping invalid routes with minimal disruption. \n\n\nFinally, we investigated the code-signing PKI.
