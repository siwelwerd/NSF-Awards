 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is to enable Dr. Pockalney to participate as a mentor in an Early Career Science Cruise (ECS) aboard R/V Sikuliaq. This ECS will enable MGG students and early career scientists to spend time at sea, collecting, processing and interpreting data to earn their degrees. While this is a critical component of their preparation, it is an incomplete introduction to the process of doing science at sea. Most students are unfamiliar with the proposal process and the role of being chief scientist aboard a research vessel. Many students spend their time at sea performing assigned tasks without responsibility or participation in cruise planning and execution. This award is designed to complete their introduction to seagoing science by giving the students the opportunity \r\nto plan and execute a science cruise based on existing data. In the future, this will provide an enhanced understanding of how to fully utilize expensive research vessels to the greatest extend possible. \r\n\r\nThe students will do this by defining a hypothesis, planning a survey and executing the data collection to test the hypothesis. The project will address all of the scientific process through the combination of classroom instruction and experiential learning. The survey will be subject to the time constraints imposed by the ship schedule and the physical constraints imposed by the ship's equipment. \r\nThe educational process will begin with applicants responding to a request for proposals (RFP), which will provide a framework for the scientific possibilities for the cruise. The participants will meet in Dutch Harbor for two days prior to boarding the ship to refine a testable hypothesis and develop the cruise plan. During this time, the students will briefly present their responses to the RFP. The PIs will provide guidance on proposal writing, accessing existing data, and shipboard capabilities. \r\nThe participants will board the ship early on the mobilization day. During this day there will be presentations on life at sea, safety and the initial introduction to the equipment on RV Sikuliaq. The students will be divided into two 12-hour watches. Once underway, each student will have the opportunity to be \"chief scientist for the day,\" making decisions about the execution of the cruise and directing participants. The other students will be assigned a particular instrument for their watch. They will be responsible for monitoring this instrument, documenting that it operates correctly and reporting significant observations to the chief scientist. Students \r\nwill cycle through the instruments, so each one encounters each piece of underway gear at least once during their time at sea. \r\nThe PIs will supplement the watch-standing and chief scientist experiences with presentations about the operational principles of the instruments, data reduction and interpretation, and the geology of the seabed as we transit it. These lectures will occur daily during a change of watch. The second change of watch will consist of a review of the data collected during the previous 24 hours. \r\nAs the ship approached Honolulu, the process of preparing the cruise report will begin. Each student will have a writing assignment, which contributes to the final product from the cruise, the preliminary results of their survey, and the cruise assessment.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOur project goals were to provide 22 early career scientists with training to become a chief scientist on a research cruise with a primary focus on Marine Geology and Geophysics.  We used a combination of a 2-day pre-cruise workshop, a 15-day research cruise aboard the RV Sikuliaq, and various post-cruise activities to provide students with a variety of chief scientist duties: proposal development, cruise planning, at-sea responsibilities, data archival, and post-cruise reporting.\n\nOur pre-cruise workshop activities focused on cruise planning and preparation.  During the first day we discussed ship capabilities and various aspects about life at sea.  The second day we reviewed the general geologic setting of our likely cruise transect and described the various types of data available at data archival sites (e.g., NCEI &amp; MGDS).  We then challenged the participants to identify/propose research questions they would like to pursue during the cruise.  This last activity proved very fruitful and students organized into groups to fine-tune and generate proposals for using our time at sea.\n\nThe research cruise began in Honolulu, HI on 2 December 2017 and finished in San Diego, CA on 17 December 2008 and focused on at-sea responsibilities, ongoing proposal development and data collection/archiving and cruise reports.  Our initial research task though was a visit to the HOTS time-series station to collect water samples for a colleague from UC Santa Barbara.  Once underway again, participants rotated responsibilities between being the chief scientist, a watch leader, and a watch stander at the various stations (e.g., multibeam, sub-bottom, ADCP, gravity).  We had daily meetings shortly after lunch to discuss the NSF proposal process, proposal development, and UNOLS.  Students presented their research proposals, which were critiqued/ranked by their fellow shipmates.  Fortunately, we had enough time and equipment on board to undertake each proposed project.  The participants were then responsible to contribute material for the final cruise report with a focus on their individual research projects and/or a data collection system.  The participants also self-organized to create a cruise blog about ship activities or related scientific questions.\n\n \n\nOur post-cruise activities included an end-of-cruise dinner in San Diego and discussion of potential publications and presentations resulting from the cruise.  A significant portion of the participants came together to submit an article to EOS (Yanchilina, A. G., et al., 2017), which was published online in late 21 December 2017.  Two presentations resulting from the training cruise were given at the Fall 2017 AGU in New Orleans, LA (Coakley and Pockalny, 2017; Blackburn et al., 2017).  In addition, we were able to support 10 cruise participants to attend either the Fall 2017 AGU or the 2018 Ocean Sciences meetings.\n\n \n\nReferences\n\nCoakley, B., Pockalny, R.A.
