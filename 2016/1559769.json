 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies, located in Millbrook, NY, will support the training of 10 students for 12 weeks during the summers of 2016-2020. Students join the unique Cary community of 100 scientists and staff to gain first-hand experience in ecological research with a focus on Translational Ecology. The program interweaves: 1) Cutting Edge Independent Research - working closely with a mentor scientist students identify questions, design and carry out research, and then analyze and present results. 2) Reflective Practice and Training - students attend Scientific Writing and Statistics/R Workshops, as well as a course in Responsible Conduct of Research training. 3) Translation -- students participate in a Communication Workshop, and write \"elevator speeches\" and lay-friendly research summaries. The Forum on Translational Ecology showcases a diversity of careers and approaches to applying and translating ecology. In the Sharing Science Program, students teach ecology to youngsters and reflect on translation through education. Undergraduate freshmen, sophomores, juniors or first semester seniors apply on-line, and are selected by project directors with input from the mentor of their preferred project. Preference is given to students who stand to benefit most from participation. \r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 50 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained in the program over the 5-year period. Cary REU students contribute to the field of ecology through publications, presentations, and bringing new insights to the field. The program has significant impact on students' education and career. Nearly three quarters of past participants attended graduate school and 90% now work in science, education or an environment-related job.\r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the training program. Students complete other program surveys and respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system, and alumni are contacted every year to document longer-term outcomes.

The 2016-2022 program theme was Translational Ecology for the Undergraduate. It was directed by Alan Berkowitz (PI) and co-directed by Shannon LaDeau (co-PI), Stuart Findlay, Felicia Keesing and Sarah Batterman, with 48 mentors and co-mentors, and 63 students participating. The intensive 12-week summer program from 2016-2020 immersed 8-13 students (Figure 1) each summer in the highly interactive Cary research environment. The 2021 program engaged 5 students for 10 weeks, and 1 student participated in 2022. Both the 2020 and 2021 programs were fully virtual due to the Covid19 pandemic (Figure 2).</p>\n<p>Working closely with mentor scientists (Figure 3) and each other (Figure 4), students delineated a question, designed and implemented projects, analyzed data, and gave presentations in a formal symposium. Students reflected on what it means to be a scientist, and learned about how ecology is translated through communication, application and education. Activities included discussions, seminars, field trips, a communications workshop, the Sharing Science program where the REU students taught youngsters from Poughkeepsie (Figure 5), a local Case Study, writing and data inquiry workshops, and a full-day career forum.</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #158155; font-size: 16px;\">The program contributed to the field of ecology, with 76 peer-reviewed publications, 43 with REU student lead authors. This includes 7 papers during the reporting period, 5 with REU student lead authors. In addition, final research papers from nearly all of the students were published by Cary Institute in 7 Undergraduate Research Reports (1988-2001) or asonline Undergraduate Ecology Research Reports (2002-on, </span><a style=\"font-size: 16px;\" href=\"http://www.caryinstitute.org/publications/\">http://www.caryinstitute.org/publications/</a><span style=\"color: #158155; font-size: 16px;\">).</span></p>\n<p>Exemplary projects show the diversity, depth and excitement of the students&rsquo; contributions to ecology:</p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sabrina Volponi (2018, Bridgewater&nbsp; College), mentored by Kathie Weathers and Dave Richardson, did an elegant study of nitrogen additions in lakes, published in Limnology and Oceanography (Volponi et al. 2023).<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"> </span></p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Emma Castiblanco (2020, Haverford College), mentored by Peter Groffman, analyzed long-term data for nitrogen and chloride levels in an exurban stream published in the journal, Urban Ecosystems (Castiblano et al. 2023).</p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyKenna Zettle (2020, University of Pittsburg Bradford), by Shannon LaDeau, studied mosquito ecology along an urban gradient, published in the Journal of Medical Entomology (Zettle et al. 2022).</p>\n<p>We shared our innovative approaches to education with the field at REU PI meetings, conferences, workshops and seminars, and through leadership of the UWIN Undergraduate Research Program, the UFERN RCN, and the Critical Zone Collaborative Network REU Program.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts.</strong></p>\n<p>The program received 1781 applications from 2016-2022: 42% from students at schools with limited research opportunities, 17% from underrepresented minorities and 63% from women. The 63 students that participated 2016-2022 were represented by 51% underrepresented minorities, 73% female, 48% from schools with limited research opportunities, and over 20% first-generation college students. Cary REU students have gone on to diverse post-undergraduate pursuits (Figure 6). We have information about students&rsquo; post-program status for at least 4 years from participation for all but 11 of our 346 alumni. A full 90% of the employed alumni were in science or related jobs (53% in academia, 8% in consulting or industry, 16% in education; and 12% in health or veterinary sciences). At the time of our most recent alumni survey (2020), 63% had completed or were in graduate school and another 8% indicated their intention to pursue a graduate degree.</p>\n<p>To probe for lasting legacies from participating in the IES/Cary REU program we asked alumni, <em>What, if anything, about your current knowledge, skills, attitudes or activities is a legacy of your participation in the IES/Cary REU program? </em>Among the legacies mentioned by 105 respondents were:</p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 75 mentioned science practices, e.g., &ldquo;<em>I liked the way the Cary REU program fostered development of a scientific research project from start to finish. The project wasn't so successful, but that didn't really matter since I gained a much better understanding of the scientific method that I've carried with me since</em>&rdquo;. <em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These included mentions of the program theme, translational ecology, e.g., &ldquo;<em>I also think that the program's focus on the importance of translational ecology and clear science communication is something I continue to strive for and often reflect upon&rdquo;</em>. <em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 34 mentioned attitudes, especially confidence, e.g., &ldquo;<em>I didn't feel confident or validated as a science student or researcher before Cary, but I most certainly did afterwards&rdquo;</em>.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>&#9679;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 27 mentioned career impacts such as building a professional network and clarifying career paths, e.g., <em>Literaly everything in my career is a result of having had access to this opportunity 20 years ago...I'm now tenured at an R1 and still work with some of the same collaborators I met as an undergrad (and later postdoc) at IES/Cary&rdquo;.</em> <em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>A new alumni survey will provide additional insights into the broader impacts of the Cary REU Program.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n Last Modified: 11/20/2023<br>\nModified by: Alan&nbsp;R&nbsp;Berkowitz</p></div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"\n><div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1559769/1559769_10411519_1700519480610_Figure_5___Cary_REU_2016___sharing_science--rgov-214x142.JPG\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1559769/1559769_10411519_1700519480610_Figure_5___Cary_REU_2016___sharing_science--rgov-800width.JPG\" title=\"Cary REU Student Sharing Science\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1559769/1559769_10411519_1700519480610_Figure_5___Cary_REU_2016___sharing_science--rgov-66x44.JPG\" alt=\"Cary REU Student Sharing Science\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">5.\tEach year, Cary REU students engage youngsters from nearby Poughkeepsie in ecological discovery in the Sharing Science program on the Cary campus.

Activities included discussions, seminars, field trips, a communications workshop, the Sharing Science program where the REU students taught youngsters from Poughkeepsie (Figure 5), a local Case Study, writing and data inquiry workshops, and a full-day career forum.\n\n\nIntellectual Merit\n\n\nThe program contributed to the field of ecology, with 76 peer-reviewed publications, 43 with REU student lead authors. This includes 7 papers during the reporting period, 5 with REU student lead authors. In addition, final research papers from nearly all of the students were published by Cary Institute in 7 Undergraduate Research Reports (1988-2001) or asonline Undergraduate Ecology Research Reports (2002-on, http://www.caryinstitute.org/publications/).\n\n\nExemplary projects show the diversity, depth and excitement of the students contributions to ecology:\n\n\n&#9679; Sabrina Volponi (2018, Bridgewater College), mentored by Kathie Weathers and Dave Richardson, did an elegant study of nitrogen additions in lakes, published in Limnology and Oceanography (Volponi et al. 2023). \n\n\n&#9679; Emma Castiblanco (2020, Haverford College), mentored by Peter Groffman, analyzed long-term data for nitrogen and chloride levels in an exurban stream published in the journal, Urban Ecosystems (Castiblano et al. 2023).\n\n\n&#9679; MyKenna Zettle (2020, University of Pittsburg Bradford), by Shannon LaDeau, studied mosquito ecology along an urban gradient, published in the Journal of Medical Entomology (Zettle et al. 2022).\n\n\nWe shared our innovative approaches to education with the field at REU PI meetings, conferences, workshops and seminars, and through leadership of the UWIN Undergraduate Research Program, the UFERN RCN, and the Critical Zone Collaborative Network REU Program.\n\n\nBroader Impacts.\n\n\nThe program received 1781 applications from 2016-2022: 42% from students at schools with limited research opportunities, 17% from underrepresented minorities and 63% from women. The 63 students that participated 2016-2022 were represented by 51% underrepresented minorities, 73% female, 48% from schools with limited research opportunities, and over 20% first-generation college students. Cary REU students have gone on to diverse post-undergraduate pursuits (Figure 6). We have information about students post-program status for at least 4 years from participation for all but 11 of our 346 alumni. A full 90% of the employed alumni were in science or related jobs (53% in academia, 8% in consulting or industry, 16% in education; and 12% in health or veterinary sciences). At the time of our most recent alumni survey (2020), 63% had completed or were in graduate school and another 8% indicated their intention to pursue a graduate degree.\n\n\nTo probe for lasting legacies from participating in the IES/Cary REU program we asked alumni, What, if anything, about your current knowledge, skills, attitudes or activities is a legacy of your participation in the IES/Cary REU program? Among the legacies mentioned by 105 respondents were:\n\n\n&#9679; 75 mentioned science practices, e.g., I liked the way the Cary REU program fostered development of a scientific research project from start to finish. The project wasn't so successful, but that didn't really matter since I gained a much better understanding of the scientific method that I've carried with me since. \n\n\n&#9679; These included mentions of the program theme, translational ecology, e.g., I also think that the program's focus on the importance of translational ecology and clear science communication is something I continue to strive for and often reflect upon. \n\n\n&#9679; 34 mentioned attitudes, especially confidence, e.g., I didn't feel confident or validated as a science student or researcher before Cary, but I most certainly did afterwards.\n\n\n&#9679; 27 mentioned career impacts such as building a professional network and clarifying career paths, e.g., Literaly everything in my career is a result of having had access to this opportunity 20 years ago...I'm now tenured at an R1 and still work with some of the same collaborators I met as an undergrad (and later postdoc) at IES/Cary. \n\n\nA new alumni survey will provide additional insights into the broader impacts of the Cary REU Program.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/20/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: AlanRBerkowitz\n"
