 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Summary:\r\n\r\nNext-generation electronic devices using plastics and other flexible materials have the potential for revolutionary societal benefits in medicine, sustainable energy and information technology. Development of reliable, widely applicable methods to apply metals to heat-sensitive materials such as organic and polymer thin films will be an important step in the production of these devices.  This project is developing methods to use light as an energy source to drive placement of metal contacts on heat-sensitive materials.  Because the metal can be applied in patterns, the method could eventually be used to print circuits on flexible electronics. Participation in this research provides graduate students with technical and collaborative skills valuable in either academic or industrial careers.  Undergraduate researchers contribute significantly to the proposed work, which encourages them to pursue graduate education in the physical sciences and engineering.  To communicate the excitement of science to the general public, participants in the project are involved in public outreach on chemistry and chemistry-based nanotechnology.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary:\r\n\r\nThis project is developing photolytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD) processes for the selective deposition of metals onto thermally sensitive materials, such as organic thin films. The reliable formation of stable metallic contacts to organic thin films is critical to many technologies from energy harvesting to sensing to organic/molecular electronics.  The development of photoassisted low temperature CVD will advance the state-of-the-art in organic electronics by enabling the integration of molecular assemblies into complex devices.  In this collaborative project, design and synthesis of ruthenium, platinum and gold complexes as photosensitive CVD precursors is followed by a screening process involving identification of the primary photoprocess, determination of the quantum yield for ligand loss, elucidation of thermal decomposition steps, and modeling reactivity with functional groups on the substrate surface.  Promising precursor complexes are subjected to photolytic chemical vapor deposition experiments with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) as model substrate systems.  SAMs are used as the substrates because they have highly organized structures with a uniform density of terminal organic functional groups that will allow the quantitative investigation of the precursor-molecule interactions. Further, SAMs can be easily patterned to produce multifunctional surfaces, which are used to determine the selectivity of the deposition reactions.",

In addition, organic substrates with patterned surfaces could be metallized as a strategy for area selective deposition in device manufacturing.  We have developed methods for the low temperature deposition of ruthenium and platinum on self assembled monolayers (SAMs) of functionalized alkanethiolates as a model system for metallization of thermally sensitive materials. \n\nFor ruthenium, the metal-containing precursors are the complexes (&#414;3-allyl)Ru(CO)3X (X = Cl, Br, I), which lose carbonyl ligands upon exposure to light, enabling reaction with the SAM.  Photoassisted chemical vapor deposition (PACVD) studies demonstrated that with (&#414;3-allyl)Ru(CO)3Br under UV light, Ru(0) and RuOx are deposited on ?CH3 and?OH terminated SAMs. In contrast, for ?COOH terminated SAMs, little or no Ru is deposited which is attributed to the formation of Ru-carboxylate complexes. These effects can be understood by determining the efficiency of carbonyl loss upon absorption of light, and elucidating the reactions of the resulting reactive intermediate.  Continued exposure of the precursor to light ultimately results in formation of colloidal particles of metallic ruthenium.  Together these experiments demonstrated that PACVD can be employed for low-temperature area selective deposition of ruthenium on thermally sensitive substrates.\n\nFor platinum, the metal-containing precursors are the complexes (COD)PtMexCl1-x where x = 1-2, which undergo loss of a methyl radical upon exposure to light.  Preliminary studies demonstrated that only small amounts of Pt were deposited on -OH and -COOH terminated SAMs using PACVD.  Further it was shown that more Pt was deposited on -COOH terminated SAMs, indicating that acid-base reactions are more effective, in agreement with our demonstration of area selective deposition using (&#414;3-allyl)Ru(CO)3X precursors.
