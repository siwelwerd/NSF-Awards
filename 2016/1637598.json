 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will tackle the algorithmic challenges underlying the transformation of the power grid.  Society is at the cusp of a historic transformation of our energy systems, driven by sustainability. Daunting challenges arise in the stable, reliable, secure, and efficient operation of the future grid that will be much more distributed, dynamic, and open. This project will push the boundaries of control, optimization, and learning to develop practical solutions to some of these difficulties.  It will advance state of the art in both the science of general cyber-physical systems and its application to smart grids.  It will support education and diversity through a tight integration of the research with educational courses and the training of female and minority students. \r\n\r\nThe theory and algorithms to be developed in this project will contribute directly towards the historic transformation of energy systems to a more sustainable future. Specifically, the project will focus on three core algorithmic challenges facing cyber-physical networks such as a smart grid: control, optimization, and learning. First, this project will develop an optimization-based approach to the design of feedback controllers for cyber-physical systems so that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable, and every equilibrium point of the closed-loop system is an optimal solution of a given optimization problem.  Second, this project will develop a new hierarchy of convex relaxations for exponential programs based on relative entropy optimization. This will immediately yield a fundamentally new approach for solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, which underlie numerous power system applications and are non-convex and NP-hard in general.  Third, this project will develop methods to learn a policy that is near-optimal efficiently, despite not having access to the objective function at run time. This will allow power systems to \"learn to optimize\" in real time, addressing one of the biggest challenges in power systems -- that data about the system is too expensive or impossible to obtain in real time.",

It is nonconvex and NP-hard.  We have developed practical distributed solutions based on its semidefinite relaxation with performance guarantees. We have proved several results around the structure of OPF problems that help explain extensive empirical experience in the power systems community that even though OPF is hard in theory, it seems easy in practice in that relaxations often turn out to be exact and local algorithms often attain global optimal.  \n\nOPF is polynomial optimization.  One of the ubiquitous problems in polynomial optimization is the certification of function nonnegativity.  We have developed a novel solution method based on the Sums-of-AM/GM-Exponentials (SAGE) decomposition whcih can be verified by solving a tractable convex relative entropy program. Our results represent the broadest-known class of nonconvex signomial optimization problems that can be solved efficiently via convex relaxation. Signomials are sometimes thought of as generalized polynomials over the positive orthant and they have many applications in chemical engineering, aeronautics, circuit design, and communications network optimization.  \n\n We have developed Neural-Swarm2, a learning-based method for motion planning and control that allows heterogeneous multirotors in a swarm to safely fly in close proximity.  Such operation for drones is challenging due to complex aerodynamic interaction forces. We have designed techniques to accurately predict the aerodynamic interactions between heterogeneous multirotors. Experimental results demonstrate that Neural-Swarm2 is able to generalize to larger swarms beyond training cases and significantly outperforms a baseline nonlinear tracking controller with up to three times reduction in worst-case tracking errors. We have also developed methods for control synthesis for large-scale network systems that require safety-critical control.
