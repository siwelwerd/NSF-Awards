 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project is to provide a usable stranded and associated gas collection capacity for oil & gas exploration companies. During drilling operations, valuable gas is lost through intentional venting and flaring, causing losses in natural gas delivered to the power plant or city gate. With the sector's expansion into more remote low-volume sites, these losses are increasing dramatically. Through this project's proposed novel Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) based storage technology, this project seeks to deliver a re-usable and transport ready intermodal container, to store gas at low pressure, eliminating the need to use expensive gas capture, purification and multi-stage compression systems. An economically feasible unprocessed natural gas storage technology would provide a useful tool for the domestic oil & gas industry in capturing what would be flared or vented and delivering it to the American economy. Taking the proposed novel MOF technology to the bench and pilot scale will show the feasibility of a flexible, transportable, low-cost infrastructure to abate flaring and venting. Successful developments in this project will help develop the knowledge for scale-up to large-scale vehicular tanks to allow for commercial implementation.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of this Phase II research project are the development of stable and low-cost Metal-Organic framework (MOF) based storage technologies for the collection of usable stranded associated gas during drilling operations. In order to harness point source emissions, before being vented or flared, the project will develop a nano-engineered, MOF based sorbent for low-pressure capture and storage of unprocessed natural gas. The project will seek to develop a robust and scalable method to synthesize new MOFs containing other high-valence transition metal ions such as Al3+, Fe3+ and Cr3+. Furthermore, the project will screen a range of organic ligands for improving MOFs' surface property and storage capacity. Finally, by following alternative synthesis routes with low cost catalysts, the project will identify sorbent synthesis cost reduction strategies. The sorbent material will be tested with simulated vent/flare-gas compositions in a cyclic pressure range and the sorbent stability will be verified by an assortment of X-ray, spectroscopy, and microscopy methods. Following sorbent development, an ANG tank will be built and flare gas slipstream testing will be conducted in shale gas sites.",

By maximizing the capture and storage of unprocessed gas streams at the wellhead, <em>framergy</em> has developed a technology, which helps prevent venting/flaring gas streams both intermittently and continuously. Similarly, capturing tail gas streams, after valuable NGLs recovery, can help power up equipment in the field via fuel generators reducing operational costs and carbon footprint of natural gas treatment. Finally, by maximizing the storage capacity of processed natural gas, Adsorbed Natural Gas (ANG) will become the cheaper, safer and greener alternative to Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) storage via delivering the same storage capacity at 1/7<sup>th</sup> the pressure, eliminating the need for energy-intensive multi-stage compression in gas fueling. As a continuation to this effort, with 3<sup>rd</sup> party investment and NSF?s Phase IIB supplement, we have demonstrated the recovery of fugitive natural gas components, as well as the separation of the Natural Gas (methane) from the Natural Gas Liquids (NGLs) using the ANG technology developed during the Phase II period.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this project, <em>framergy</em> has successfully demonstrated the feasibility of multi-kilogram scale production of its leading candidate MOF, PCN-250.

In a source gas stream with 26% ethane and 5% propane, the dual PSA system upgraded the ethane concentration by 272% to 71% and delivered 251% higher propane concentration at 12.6%.
