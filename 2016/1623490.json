 "awd_abstract_narration": "Real-world problem solving through Making is a new and popular way to engage youth in STEM education. Since it is often difficult to infuse Maker curriculum into students' schedules, this frequently occurs in after-school programs. Unfortunately, not all youth are able to participate in after-school activities due to financial pressures and may instead take jobs in non-technical fields such as food service or retail. These non-technical jobs take time away from Making, designing, and tinkering, which can leave them behind their peers who are honing skills for a technical career path. We propose to create a living laboratory \"print shop\" at the Digital Harbor Foundation (DHF) Tech Center in Baltimore to study the impact of Maker employment with inner city youth. Research will be conducted to understand how their experiences in the print shop maintain their engagement with STEM. The result of the project will be a new model to keep underserved youth on a pathway towards a STEM career.\r\n \r\nWhile integrating Making in formal and informal learning is an active research topic, little is known about how to support Making in youth employment. This research will answer questions crucial to deepening youth engagement in Making such as: 1) How do youths' perceptions of STEM careers and STEM education change with a Maker job? 2) How does real-world client work impact youths' interest in Making and their \"design thinking\"? 3) What impact does a youth-run 3D print shop have in the local community? 4) What are the generalizable recommendations for designing and teaching digital fabrication software to individuals with diverse skills? \r\nWe will answer these questions by conducting interviews, observations, and workshops, with DHF youth, support staff, and the print shop's customers. All software, training tools, and supporting technology will be evaluated through longitudinal deployments in the print shop. We will track youth's engagement in the print shop and measure how their attitudes towards technical employment, STEM fields, and Making change through the research. We will share our experiences, tools, training materials, and strategies to continue to diversify Making and provide novel employment opportunities with the Maker and academic community.",

Furthermore, we need to better understand how young employees navigate ever-evolving workplace technologies, what challenges they face when doing so, and how they can be prepared better to face them. Furthermore, given the need to broaden participation in STEM fields, more research needs to investigate how to use emerging rapid prototyping and fabrication technologies, such as 3D printing, 3D scanning, and laser cutting, to create exciting opportunities for community engagement and the inclusion of diverse stakeholders in technology design and development. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>To study these questions, we established a living laboratory print shop at the Digital Harbor Foundation (DHF) in Baltimore City. Over three years, the print shop provided maker employment experiences to youth employees from diverse backgrounds across multiple cohorts. Printshop employees worked on several hundred jobs during this time, manufacturing thousands of unique items using laser cutting, 3D printing, 3D scanning, and design work. Using interviews, focus groups, observations, and participatory design sessions, we studied the impact of the work experience on youth and investigated their attitudes towards different communication and coordination tools and factors that contributed to their successful or unsuccessful appropriation.

These impacts also improved communication and teamwork skills, patience when dealing with others, an increased emphasis on paying attention to details, and improved time and financial management skills. Additionally, despite their prior experience with digital communication tools outside of the workplace, the youth needed further support and training for effectively adopting and using various workplace communication tools and protocols. Furthermore, we found that being exposed to the print shop positively impacted other youth attending DHF?s learning programs and encouraged them to consider STEM careers and entrepreneurial goals. Finally, we successfully leveraged the print shop as a community resource to enable several inclusive initiatives to serve the broader Baltimore City community and involve youth employees in socially engaged activities. These projects included designing customized assistive technologies for adults with disabilities, creating an accessible audio playback interface for children with cognitive disabilities, and making a distributed multimodal activities book for children with or without disabilities that combined storytelling with tangible and audio elements.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/12/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Foad&nbsp;Hamidi</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1623490/1623490_10430812_1634066362933_3DPrintshop1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1623490/1623490_10430812_1634066362933_3DPrintshop1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Youth Employees at the Printshop\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1623490/1623490_10430812_1634066362933_3DPrintshop1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Youth Employees at the Printshop\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Youth Employees at the Printshop</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Digital Harbor Foundation</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Foad&nbsp;Hamidi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Youth Employees at the Printshop</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1623490/1623490_10430812_1634066448499_3DPrintshop2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1623490/1623490_10430812_1634066448499_3DPrintshop2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Youth Employees and Researchers Discussing 3D scanning\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1623490/1623490_10430812_1634066448499_3DPrintshop2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Youth Employees and Researchers Discussing 3D scanning\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This image shows two youth employees and a member of the research team discussing a 3D scanning process.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Digital Harbor Foundation</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Foad&nbsp;Hamidi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Youth Employees and Researchers Discussing 3D scanning</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1623490/1623490_10430812_1634066549580_3DPrintshop3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1623490/1623490_10430812_1634066549580_3DPrintshop3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Youth Employees and their Creations\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1623490/1623490_10430812_1634066549580_3DPrintshop3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Youth Employees and their Creations\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Three youth employees are shown in front of a range of objects that they 3D printed as part of their after school employment experience</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Digital Harbor Foundation</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyright owner is an institution with an existing agreement allowing use by NSF</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Foad&nbsp;Hamidi</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Youth Employees and their Creations</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
