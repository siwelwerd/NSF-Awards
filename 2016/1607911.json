 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract:\r\nNon-Technical:\r\nNext generation electronics require advances in both materials and device designs.  One promising direction is utilizing atomically thin materials because of their flexibility and high electron mobility.  Graphene was the first such material identified in this new area of two-dimensional (2D) materials.  Unfortunately, graphene is not a semiconductor, but a semimetal and is therefore not suitable for the digital logic circuits widely used today in electronics.  Transition metal dichalcogenides are a family of 2D materials which share many of the promising aspects of graphene such as being atomically thin.  In addition, they exhibit a wider variety of electronic and optoelectronic properties compared to graphene including many being semiconducting or metallic.  This wide range of transition metal dichalcogenides allows one to select a material or a combination of materials best suited for a particular application.  Indeed, by combining different 2D materials together in vertical heterostructures an even wider range of new device functionalities can be enabled.  This collaborative research program will create new educational and research opportunities at both the University of Arizona, and the University of Texas at Austin.  The program will strongly emphasize the training of graduate and undergraduate students from underserved groups, thus preparing them for industrial or academic careers. This workforce training, along with the expected research output, will boost the efforts to make our nation more competitive.\r\nTechnical:\r\nThe goal of this collaborative research program is to study layered two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenide materials and heterostructures for device applications, using a combination of controlled heterostructure fabrication techniques, scanning probe microscopy, and electrical transport measurements.  Similar to graphene, the most widely studied two-dimensional material, transition metal dichalcogenides represent a larger class of layered materials with varying electronic properties, from semiconducting to superconducting. The diverse set of electronic properties in these materials makes them suitable for applications ranging from transistors to chemical sensors or photodetectors. Key to an understanding of their fundamental electronic properties is the role of the disorder potential, interfaces, and edges in individual layers, and of the band and rotational alignment in heterostructures.  Specifically, the proposed effort will (1) measure band-alignment in transition metal dichalcogenide based heterostructures, (2) realize heterostructures of two-dimensional materials with controlled rotational alignment, (3) explore the impact of rotational alignment on the electronic properties of two-dimensional material heterostructures, and using these ingredients (4) design and fabricate novel heterostructure tunneling devices.  This program builds on the PIs existing collaborative research and recent preliminary data on the fabrication and characterization of these heterostructures.  The outcomes of this research program will include uncovering fundamental electronic properties of transition metal dichalcogenide-based heterostructures, new methods to create heterostructures, and novel devices for future electronics applications.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis research project examined ways to create devices using heterostructures of layered low-dimensional materials.  Graphene is the most widely studied two-dimensional material but there are a large number of other layered materials with varying electronic properties that have been explored in this project.  The heterostructures were formed by the precise and sequential assembly of atomically thin layers.  By precisely controlling the interactions between the various layers a wide variety of heterostructures were formed during the research.  In particular, by using the twist angle degree of freedom between the atomic lattices, the electronic properties of a heterostructure can be controlled. This development has opened the way to exploring a new class of devices where twist angle determines their properties known as twistronics.\n\n \n\nWhen two atomic lattices are placed on top of each other, if they have different lengths or there is a twist angle between them, a moir&eacute; pattern emerges.  This periodic modulation of the stacking between the two materials causes changes in the electronic properties as there is now a longer scale periodicity in the material.  This project used this long wavelength periodic potential to engineer new electronic properties in several different systems as discussed below.\n\n \n\nThe first set of results from this project, explored the electronic states that develop when two layers of graphene are stacked with a small twist angle between them.  A moir&eacute; pattern develops whose wavelength is inversely proportional to the twist angle.  Below about two degrees, the electrons in graphene become localized on a particular stacking configuration.  At these twist angles, the localized nature of the electrons leads to enhanced interactions and the emergence of correlated electronic states.\n\n \n\nWhen the twist angle between two graphene layers approaches zero, the electronic properties of the system fundamentally change.  The system goes from a metal to a semiconductor whose band gap can be controlled by a vertical electric field.  When the twist angle is small enough, the bulk of the material becomes insulating when a field is applied.  However, channels develop along edges of the moir&eacute; unit cell which are topologically protected and continue to carry current without loss.  Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, this project provided experimental confirmation of these unique topological states in twisted bilayer graphene.\n\n \n\nSemiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides can also be used to form twisted bilayer structures.  However, unlike in graphene where correlated electronic effects only occur over a small range of twist angles, these effects occur over a much larger range of twist angles.  In addition, because of the crystal symmetry of the materials there are two inequivalent ways of creating the same wavelength of moir&eacute; pattern.  In this project, scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements have shown that flat bands emerge for long wavelength moir&eacute; patterns for both stacking configurations.  However, the localized nature of the wave functions differs between the two configurations.  These results open the way to a new class of materials and devices where correlated electronic properties will emerge with twist angle.\n\n \n\nThe broader impacts of the research include the development of new electronic materials and devices that may be used future applications.  The grant also provided education and training for graduate and undergraduate students.  There have been several undergraduate students working on the project who have graduated with science majors.  The graduate student supported at the beginning of the project took an industrial research position after graduation.  A second graduate student began working near the end of the project and is continuing to pursue her PhD in physics. It is expected that all of the people who worked on the research will continue into careers in science related fields.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/26/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian J Leroy"
