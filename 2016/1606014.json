 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a one-year pilot study of a project classified as \"high risk - high reward\".  The project will study hemispheric differences in the onset times of individual substorms and other auroral events observed simultaneously in the northern and southern auroral regions.  Magnetic substorms (as they are called) reshape the Earth's magnetotail far out in Geospace.  This process explosively releases energy powering an immediate intensification of currents and energetic charge particle precipitation closer to Earth in the ionosphere at the foot points of the affected field lines, and an intensification of auroral emissions.  The investigation will take advantage of recently completed pairings of magnetometer stations located at the two Earthward ends of magnetic field lines that thread through the Earth's magnetotail where substorms are initiated.  Differences in timing as well as the sequence of auroral features that precede the onset in each hemisphere will provide new information about, and place additional constraints on, controversial and still intensely debated theories about the underlying physical process(es) responsible for these extremely dynamic events.  Significant closure risk is introduced in this project (which has never before been attempted) by the need to separate out the difference in timing due to the substorm process itself in the magnetosphere from other sources of timing offsets, for example, due to slight inter-hemispheric differences in the propagation path of a substorm onset signature into the magnetometer field of view.  Whether these additional sources of timing differences can be removed using auroral images or other information, and the true substorm-related timing differences extracted, is the primary focus of this pilot study.  The high reward of this technique, if proven feasible, is a new view into a long standing Geospace puzzle that continues to hinder progress in understanding severe space weather in the Earth's vicinity.  Progress is important because in the hazardous radiation environment in near-Earth space, astronauts carry human enterprises into space and satellites that are key to important societal infrastructures orbit.  The intense abrupt changes in the magnetic field associated with these explosive events induce currents in the solid Earth threatening long-term damage and shorter-term (potentially dangerous) disruptions in the operation of electric power grids.  This pilot study will provide an educational experience to an undergraduate and a graduate student, contributing to the development of the future scientific workforce. \r\n\r\nThe project is a statistical study that aims to identify significant difference between the hemispheres in the onset time for individual substorms as measured by signatures of the onset in ground-based magnetometers.  Given this information, it may be possible to determine which of two prominent substorm models are more consistent with the timing observations.  The second phase of the project will look to identify causes of the differences by examining the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field, solar wind conditions, and the Universal Time during the substorm onset.  A smaller study will compare onset differences with those observed in a pair of conjugate all-sky imagers, when available.",

These differences in the onset time appear to be controlled by several elements. The first factor appears to be the interplanetary magnetic field By component. The By component shifts the magnetically mapped foot point of the opposite hemisphere either to the west to the east. As a result of this shift combined with the speed of the westward surge of auroral activity during substorms a difference in onset time on the order of 30 s can appear in the magnetometer data. This result has been known for years, but has not been shown with ground based magnetometers. We also observe a difference in onset time associated with magnetic field line length. The length of the magnetic field line from the magnetometer station to the plasma sheet in the magnetotail where substorms and other geomagnetic activity begin can be of different lengths between the opposite hemispheres because of warping of the Earth&rsquo;s magnetic field by the solar wind and tilt of the Earth magnetic field. The resulting difference in onset time appears to be on the order of 60 to 90 s at most for extreme differences in the magnetic field line length. This result has also been known for years, but has not been shown with ground based magnetometers. We used two methods to study the effects of interplanetary magnetic field By component and difference in magnetic field line length. Both methods do not always produce clear results and the scatter in the data points is sometimes large. The final result we obtained (using three different methods) is that the difference in onset time is controlled by the seasons/ionospheric conductivity. Specifically, we show that the onset of geomagnetic activity can occur about 23 s earlier in the unlit hemisphere. We believe this finding is because the conductivity in the sunlight hemisphere limits how soon the geomagnetic activity begins in the same way the resistors in an inductor circuit control how quickly the current increases. We believe our results are important because they could potentially be used as earlier indicators of geomagnetic activity and provide a warning tens of second before the onset of geomagnetic activity during the northern hemisphere summer.
