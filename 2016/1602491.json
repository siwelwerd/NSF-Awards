 "awd_abstract_narration": "NON-TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Nitride thin films are used in a wide variety of applications. An example is the hard coating that is put on a tool bit to extend its lifetime. Such coatings are made by depositing atoms on the tool's surface from a vapor, referred to as physical vapor deposition. The resulting films often have large stress because the process of deposition does not allow the atoms time to get into their ideal positions. Consequently, this stress can lead to failure of the film either by cracking or delaminating. The goal of this research is to reduce the stress through understanding how the stress is related to the underlying physical processes. Through the use of a mathematical model of the processes affecting stress, it is possible to predict it for different processing conditions.  \r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DETAILS: The focus of this work is to understand and control the stress in transition metal nitride thin films. Stress can be strongly affected by the processing conditions such as the energy of the deposited species or rate of film growth, but there is not a fundamental understanding of how stress reduction occurs. In this project, measurements of the stress are made during the nitride deposition using a real-time technique (based on the curvature induced in the wafer substrate). These measurements enable the stress to be quantitatively related to the processing parameters such as the growth rate and gas pressure. After growth, the film's microstructure is characterized by making a cross-section with a focused ion beam and measuring the grain structure with electron microscopy.  This characterization enables the dependence of the stress on the film's grain size and microstructural evolution to be determined. The experimental results are used to refine and validate a model that relates the stress to the underlying processes in the film. This new model incorporates the kinetics of the deposited atoms and the defects that have not been included in previous models. This approach enables a deeper understanding of the origins of stress that can be used by thin film growers to predict the stress under various conditions for different materials systems. The model is made available to interested users on the researcher's website. A short course for industrial and academic professionals describes the mechanisms that control stress evolution.  Students (at both the undergraduate and graduate level) participate in this research to develop skills in state-of-the-art experimental and modeling techniques.  Students from underrepresented groups are recruited to participate in this research and promote their ability to develop careers in science and engineering.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Intellectual merit of this program is based on understanding the origin of stress in metal-nitride thin films that are often used as hard coatings.  The work was performed as an integrated program of measurements and modeling.  The measurements focused on quantifying the stress while the film was growing.  This was done using an apparatus that monitored the curvature in the substrate as the film grew.   Well-known mechanics equations relate the resulting curvature to the stress in the film.  A comprehensive series of studies were performed in order to determine the dependence of the stress on the processing conditions (growth rate, temperature, pressure) and the grain structure of the film.  The symbols in figure 1 show results for ZrN films grown at different growth rates and gas pressures.  For sputter-deposited films, the pressure affects the energy of the deposited particles so that at lower pressure the particles have larger energy. For each growth rate, the higher energy makes the film more compressive at lower pressure.  Similarly, at low pressure (high particle energy), the stress becomes more compressive at higher growth rates.  \n\n To understand these measurements, we developed a model that relates the stress to the processing conditions.  One mechanism in the model considers the processes that occur at the grain boundaries as the film grows.  Other mechanisms consider the effect of energetic particles on creating stress in the grain boundary and in the bulk of the film.  These mechanisms are used to derive equations for the stress evolution under different conditions.  The solid lines in figure 1 are the result of adjusting the parameters in the model to get the best agreement with the measurements (called fitting the data).  The good agreement shows that the model's mechanisms are able to account for the measured dependence on the processing conditions.  The kinetic parameters determined from the modeling allow us to identify the processes that control the stress evolution and determine the best processing  conditions for obtaining  a desired stress state.\n\nThe work described above constituted the primary effort of the program.  Other work used computer simulations (molecular dynamics and kinetic Monte Carlo) to better understand the mechanisms in the model. The model was also extended to include the effects of grain growth and used to analyze multiple stress measurements of metals in the literature.\n\nThe broader impact of this work focused on turning the program for modelling into a web-based application that will be a tool for the large community of thin film growers interested in stress.  The program was given a user-friendly interface and a website is being developed from which others can download it as well as documentation on how to use it.   The user can analyze wafer curvature measurements to determine the kinetic parameters that explain the  data.  These parameters can be used to predict stress under different conditions or to optimize the growth conditions.  Development of this program was done through the efforts of graduate students and undergraduates who learned techniques of data analysis and web-development.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric Chason"
