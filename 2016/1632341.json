 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is its potential to revolutionize human-machine interfaces, with possible applications in computer-aided design (CAD); military, maintenance, and pilot training interfaces; industrial and construction operator interfaces; robotic and laparoscopic surgery; physical therapy, rehabilitation, and swing training; education; telerobotics; automotive navigation and safety systems; and video games. While haptic interactions in these applications can already be portrayed with desktop robotic force feedback devices, the developed haptic technology could provide realistic haptic feedback at a much lower price point (required for consumer devices) and unlike current force feedback devices, the developed haptic devices can be used to naturally interact in large workspace applications like motion-input video games or VR experiences. The proposed research will enhance the scientific understanding of human-haptic and multi-modal interactions in virtual environments, and will create a model for this technology to migrate into adjacent fields.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase 2 project seeks to meet the market demand for intuitive, immersive, and inexpensive haptic technologies in the emerging field of consumer virtual reality (VR). Multiple companies are now making inexpensive 3D head-mounted displays (HMDs) for VR, but current haptic interfaces are either too expensive, have limited range of motion, or are too crude to portray realistic haptic interactions in VR. The company has created an ungrounded haptic motion controller that utilizes a new form of touch feedback that applies in-hand shear forces to create compelling physical feedback at a price that is viable for consumer markets. The proposed research objectives are based on feedback from key stakeholders and VR enthusiasts who have tried the company?s current high-end haptic controllers. Their feedback suggests improving the overall user experience of the controllers through reducing device size, mass, and system latency, while improving device ergonomics and reducing cost. The Phase II research builds on the findings of Phase I, which showed that even simpler implementations of the newly developed haptic technology were still found to be more compelling than traditional vibration feedback. The project will result in a reference design that can be mass produced.",

The company's initial focus is  to fill the gap missing from virtual reality (VR) -- a richer  sense of touch. The company's haptic technology can be built into the  handle of a video game motion controller (e.g., Nintendo Wii-mote or  Oculus Touch controllers) and despite not being a grounded haptic  interface (i.e., cannot apply external forces on the user), is capable  of emulating force/torque sensations. Actuated sliding plates (tactors)  on the surface of the handle of this device present the user's hand with  tangential shear forces that mimic the friction and shear forces  naturally experienced when interacting with objects, and can create a  great sense of physical interaction with simulated (e.g., video games)  or remote (e.g., telerobotic) environments. The shear feedback within  the handle of the game controller is directly driven by simulated  interaction forces from a standard gaming physics engine. The created  tactile illusions create a powerful, immersive haptic experience that  connects the user to the virtual (VR) or remote environment. <br /><br />This  SBIR research has produced a two related products, which are simplified  versions of the company's prior controller design.&nbsp; The prior company's  prior design was more complex, having 3 or 4 sliding tactors, and was  not robust or durable.&nbsp; This SBIR research showed that a simpler  controller design with only 2 sliding plates (2 tactors) could be just  as compelling as our prior, more complex design, while allowing us to  create a more durable, robust, responsive, and quiet design. The first  product is a modular haptic controller that is a result of the work in  the Phase IIB project to make a more commercially viable version of the  Phase II 2-tactor controller design. This modular design includes  accessory brackets. The addition of magnet sockets and tracking  accessory brackets to this modular controller allows it to be used as a  gamepad or machine gun gaming peripheral and to be used with multiple VR  systems.&nbsp; The second product was an adaptation of a Phase IIB task to  make a lower-cost controller design for the toy industry, and resulted  in the cylindrical SaberGrip&trade; design that has garnered the interest of  VR arcades since it \"looks like a light saber.\" <br /><br />This project  also refined a means to form new game peripherals in-game through the  use of a set of magnet sockets, which we call Multi-Pose&trade; Magnet  Sockets. The magnet sockets facilitate going from using controllers  independently to combining them to form a steering wheel, handle bars,  or a machine gun quickly and intuitively on-the-fly while remaining in  the VR environment.&nbsp; These sockets can also be used to represent  fixtures in a training environment, such as training for an orthopedic  or neurosurgery procedure.<br /><br /><strong>Intellectual Merit: &nbsp;</strong>This  Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project has developed an  intuitive, compact, wireless haptic device to meet the demand of VR  market, which has been driven by the availability of inexpensive 3D  head-mounted displays (HMD) by Oculus VR, HTC, Sony, HP, etc. Current  haptic interfaces are either too expensive and have limited range of  motion or are too crude to realistically portray force/torque  interactions. The company has created an ungrounded haptic motion  controller that can provide compelling force/torque-like feedback that  will first be used in VR arcades and enterprise training, and as the  technology is scaled, will become viable for consumer markets. <br /><br /><strong>Broader/Commercial Impact:</strong>&nbsp;  The innovation and the associated scientific and technological  understanding developed herein can be used in human-machine interfaces  and has applications in computer-aided design (CAD); military,  maintenance, and pilot training interfaces; industrial and construction  operator interfaces; medical training; robotic and laparoscopic surgery;  physical therapy, rehabilitation, and swing training; education;  telerobotics; automotive interfaces;&nbsp; and video games. While haptic  interactions in these applications can already be portrayed with desktop  interfaces like SensAble's Phantom Omni, our technology can do this at a  lower price point&nbsp; and unlike the Phantom Omni, can be used in large  workspace applications like moiton-input video games or VR experiences.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 03/22/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: William&nbsp;Provancher</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1632341/1632341_10450934_1584867349709_TacticalHaptics_SaberGrip--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1632341/1632341_10450934_1584867349709_TacticalHaptics_SaberGrip--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tactical Haptics SaberGrip Controller\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1632341/1632341_10450934_1584867349709_TacticalHaptics_SaberGrip--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tactical Haptics SaberGrip Controller\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">SaberGrip is a simplified lower-cost variant of the Tactical Haptics modular controller design.
