Cyberlearning CAP projects build capacity for research and development in the field of cyberlearning by improving technical infrastructure, human capital, and in other ways. The Symposium on Educational Advances in Artificial Intelligence, affiliated with the AAAI (Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence) conference in San Francisco in February 2017 is a premier venue for sharing knowledge about how to use AI in education and how to teach about AI. This grant helps support participation of US students and teachers in the conference, as well as early career faculty and organizers of REU (Research Experiences for Undergraduates) sites. \r\n\r\nThe symposium includes a variety of activities that advance the field and train the next generation of AI researchers and investigators. Peer reviewed papers and keynote addresses are complemented by sessions on model classroom assignments in teaching AI, and a competition for undergrads to create innovative tasks for students learning robotics. A discussion group will share best practices among REU site coordinators. Tracks will consider outreach and ethics in teaching AI. Broader impacts beyond the participants at the symposium are supported by the materials produced and shared among the community, such as the database of open educational materials, and the outputs of the student competition.",
