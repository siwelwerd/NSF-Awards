The scientific program of the conference will focus on strangeness and heavy quark production in nuclear collisions; Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase structure; strangeness in astrophysics; and open questions and new development. Participation of students and post-docs at this meeting will provide them with opportunities for interaction across the scientific community.",
