 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project creates an I-Corps Site at the University of Arizona (UA).\r\n\r\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. \r\n\r\nI-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\nThe University of Arizona (UA) is home to Tech Launch Arizona(TLA), a technology commercialization unit. The TLA I-Corps Site broadens awareness and relevance with respect to commercialization  for pre-tenured faculty, postdoctoral researchers and student entrepreneurs. This focus aligns well with UA faculty now having the import of patent and commercialization work in their promotion and tenure cases. \r\n\r\nThe UA I-Corps Site emphasizes services for pre-tenured faculty, students and postdoctoral researchers, all typically under-resourced in commercialization efforts, to support their entrepreneurship. The UA program positions financial, network and intellectual resources to pursue game-changing innovations. Students and postdoctoral researchers are provided with the opportunity to engage in innovative use-inspired research and have access to resources used in assessing and developing new technologies. Program metrics and assessment allow the further development and expansion of practices for entrepreneurship education and commercialization and particularly the impact of I-Teams on the inclusion of underrepresented participants from the targeted populations. At UA, 40% of postdoctoral researchers are women. Additionally, UA is an Emerging Hispanic-Serving Institution with a Hispanic student population approaching 25% of total enrollment. Positioning an I-Corps Site at UA with a focus on pre-tenured faculty, postdoctoral researchers and student entrepreneurs strengthens entrepreneurial opportunities for women and minorities and allows the UA to develop models that successfully engage underserved innovators.",
