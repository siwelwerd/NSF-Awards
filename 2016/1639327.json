 "awd_abstract_narration": "The resilience of U.S. agriculture is significantly impacted by increasing climate extremes, growing population demands, and evolving land use. This project will develop, evaluate, and apply a model of the coupled Food, Energy, and Water (FEW) systems across the Corn and Cotton Belts of the Midwest, Southeast and Great Plains. The study will evaluate food crops currently grown in these Belts as well as the potential for growing bioenergy crops on marginal land. The project will: (1) develop a FEW model framework that represents the coupled nature of food and bioenergy production and water and its responses to environmental forcings and human interventions; (2) enhance understanding of key feedback mechanisms within FEW systems; (3) determine potential thresholds in FEW systems that would indicate damage to the resilience of U.S. agriculture and water resources.  The project will provide training for PhD students and postdoctoral researchers in transdisciplinary research where cross-fertilization of ideas is central. Building upon existing partnerships with Minority-Serving Institutions, the project will also involve minority students through summer internships. \r\n\r\nThis project will integrate state-of-the-art knowledge and modeling across the climate, hydrologic, agronomic, biogeochemical, engineering, and economic sciences. The project will use this integrated model to evaluate the coupled nature of food and bioenergy production, water quantity and quality, and climate and hydrologic processes in response to environmental forcings and human interventions. This activity will advance the transdisciplinary science by building diverse systems knowledge to address critical issues of vulnerability, resilience and sustainability. Specifically, the project will develop a scale-dependent approach for coupling, predicting and applying the interactive water, carbon, and nitrogen cycle processes with agriculture, water resources, the biofuels industry and economic practices.  This will enable the larger-scale impacts of external forcings (e.g., increasing climate extremes and population demands) to be directly coupled to the impacts of human interventions (e.g., infrastructure and management) and decision level information. It will improve the scientific basis for decisions in sustainable agricultural food and bioenergy practices, water resources management and pollution assessment, hydroengineering design, and adaptation and mitigation strategies.",

We worked to understand regional feedback mechanisms, quantify teleconnections through which events in one area affected outcomes in others, determine thresholds at which particular systems become vulnerable, and discover sustainable pathways to produce food and bioenergy and manage water.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our interdisciplinary team developed a Modeling framework to couple Food, Energy, and Water (MFEW), consisting of models for regional climate (CWRF), hydrology (watershed SWAT, groundwater MODFLOW), crop growth (DSSAT, BioCro), and economic assessment (FASOM-GHG, HPSIM). We further developed these models to address emerging scientific questions, adding features to improve soil carbon and nitrogen simulation, groundwater flow dynamics, irrigation and farming practices, vegetation growth processes, and new crop varieties. Model coupling used a mixed approach with full, partial, and soft linkages. The core climate-crop models were fully coupled with two-way interactions to represent system dynamics and feedback processes. This core represents feedbacks with terrestrial hydrology and predicts the coupled climate, hydrology, and crop dynamic variations that drive the hydrological models&rsquo; simulation of watershed and groundwater responses. The climate-agrohydrosystem output then feeds the economic assessment, which generates land-use scenarios under existing and anticipated U.S. economic policies.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>MFEW was applied to evaluate potential pathways for sustainable agriculture development in the changing climate of the Corn and Cotton Belts. We explored how expanding cellulosic biofuels production for energy would affect existing climate, food, and water systems, and the sensitivity of each system to the other connected systems. These findings, along with the creation, improvement, and validation of the modeling system, are described in 30 peer-reviewed articles (additional articles forthcoming). Key highlights include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marginal lands may support cellulosic biofuels without impacting current capacities for food and feed production, while improving climate conditions for staple crop growth (Fig. 1). Cultivating marginal lands with regionally-optimized biofuel crops (miscanthus, switchgrass, energycane, Fig. 2) would benefit both climate and hydrology through feedbacks such as reduced regional temperatures and increased precipitation (Fig. 3). The resulting mesoscale circulation would increase summer rainfall by ~15% and reduce water vapor pressure deficit by ~9%, lowering potential crop transpiration and potentially benefit existing food crops, increasing corn and soybean yields in the Midwest by 12%. Similar but weaker effects were simulated in the Southeast through teleconnections.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Perennial grasses can reduce soil erosion, restore carbon stocks, and provide feedstocks for biofuels and bioproducts.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would not only offset carbon emissions and provide renewable products, but also ameliorate adverse climate changes anticipated from global warming. It offers a feasible solution for the U.S. to contribute to global net-zero CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;emissions with effective climate change mitigation and agricultural adaptation without threatening food security.</li>\n<li>Policy mandates like carbon pricing or the Renewable Fuel Standard could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing fossil fuels in power plants with biomass from energy crops and crop residues. However, while&nbsp;the use of marginal land expands the overall emissions reduction potential, without limiting ethanol provisions from staple crops like corn, such policies could still cause land use competition with both row crops on current farmland and with forest land, increasing water use and nutrient loading from expanding agricultural production, and&nbsp;in water-limited areas like the&nbsp;Great Plains could accelerate aquifer depletion due to increased irrigation.</li>\n<li>Climate&nbsp;and land use change could substantially impact U.S. hydrological processes, water quality, and agricultural productivity. In agriculturally-intensive regions like the Upper Mississippi River Basin, climate change alone is projected to reduce&nbsp;streamflow by 30% and growing season soil water content by 19% in 2071-2100 under a high emissions scenario.&nbsp;Combining climate and land use changes would increase water loss through evapotranspiration and decrease water yield. This indicates high potential risks of water scarcity in the future.&nbsp;Furthermore,&nbsp;the U.S. agricultural FEW systems growing staple crops on the present cultivated croplands and perennial grasses on marginal lands can remain productive under projected climate changes.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Beyond these scientific findings, this project trained early career scientists in interdisciplinary research.
