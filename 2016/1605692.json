 "awd_abstract_narration": "1605692 \r\nChen, Hailong\r\n\r\nOwing to high energy density and long cycling life, Li-ion batteries (LIB) are becoming one of the most popular rechargeable batteries used as power sources in a variety of devices and tools, such as in sensors, smart phones, electric and hybrid electric vehicles. However, many of the electrode materials of LIBs are toxic and potentially environmentally hazardous. Additionally, LIB electrode constituents Co, Ni, and Li are also relatively precious metals relying on geologically limited sources from outside of the U.S. Therefore, from the viewpoint of environmental, sustainability, as well as national security considerations, it is critically important to have good strategies to recycle spent LIBs. However, it is scientifically and practically challenging to develop a highly efficient and economically justifiable recycling method, owing to the complex chemistries in LIB systems. The LIB recycling industry is only at the starting stage compared to the mature and fast growing LIB manufacturing industry. Current LIB recycling technologies are either energy costly or environmentally unfriendly. In this project, a novel low cost method to recycle Co, Ni, and Li metals from spent LIBs will be explored.\r\n\r\nSystematic investigation will be applied on each and every step of the recycling process to achieve a fundamental understanding on (1) how to best handle spent LIBs, (2) how to effectively and efficiently extract and separate the valuable elements from the electrode materials, and (3) how to make the method robust for a wide variety of LIB chemistries. Advanced in situ characterization methods, such as synchrotron based in situ X-ray diffraction, will be used to study the reaction mechanisms of the electrode materials in the recycling reactions. Findings from this project may greatly advance knowledge on the chemical reactions of metal oxides and the nucleation and crystal growth of nanoclusters in solution. The development and optimization of this novel recycling method may significantly reduce the potential environmental hazards from spent LIBs, lower the cost of LIB production, and increase the sustainability of LIB industry by turning it from a current open-loop model to a close-loop model. A new course on Energy Technology and Environmental Challenges will be organized at Georgia Tech focusing on the interdisciplinary research opportunities that are highlighted in the research. If this technology is proved to be effective and scalable for commercialization, it can be a game changing factor to current Li-ion battery industry and can bring revolutionary changes to the transportation industry as it would significantly change the cost-production relationship and sustainability aspects of these industries.",
