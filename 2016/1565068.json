 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Southern Illinois Energy Scholarships program at Southern Illinois University Carbondale (SIUC) will matriculate talented community college students with demonstrated financial need to SIUC who will major in one of nine energy-related STEM disciplines. The goal of the project will be to provide the infrastructure and experiences necessary for scholars to complete a baccalaureate degree and enter the energy workforce or a STEM graduate program.  Scholars will engage in hands-on activities led by faculty and work-force professionals.  The project will increase the number of students entering the energy workforce, which has been identified as one of the areas critical to the economic development of the state.\r\n \r\nTo identify what strategies and activities are successful in helping low income community college transfer students succeed, the research team will identify a transfer student peer group from within STEM disciplines representative of race/ethnicity, gender, related program of study, and prior academic attainment.  The investigators will longitudinally follow both the Energy Scholars and the peer comparison group semester-by-semester collecting hours attempted, hours earned, course performance, grade point average, retention and graduation indicators.  The team will measure and compare academic attainment, retention and graduation across the Energy Scholars and the peer comparison group.",

This program supported transfer students with financial need and an interest in the energy field to complete a STEM baccalaureate degree at SIUC and enter the energy workforce.The need for energy scholarships for transfer students to SIUC is stark: 79% of community college students with SIUC Service Centers receive Pell grants, and the average poverty rate in the districts served is 17.3%.&nbsp;Objectives of this program included providing scholarships of up to $10,000 per year for 2 years (maximum 4) to support a total of 43 scholars, developing a mentoring and support network, and providing enrichment activities and educational experiences related to energy systems and challenges.SIUC is recognized for a longstanding commitment to serving a diverse student population while valuing and welcoming the contribution of all members of our community.</p>\n<p>In the scholarship program, 21% of the students were underrepresented minorities and all needed financial assistance. The scholars came from eleven undergraduate degree programs in the energy area. They were enrolled in common courses that develop professional skills and focus on collaboration and innovation. Scholars experienced learning in accredited programs, and had opportunities to participate in service learning, faculty research, professional societies, or green fund projects. Scholars liked all the activities and liked best the service learning project related to learning about and helping to install solar panels on a Habitat for Humanity house as well as tours of energy facilities. Students had a multifaceted mentoring network of peers, faculty, professionals and staff to ensure that academic and professional goals were met. Networking opportunities focused on building mentoring relationships and placement in co-ops, internships, research laboratories, entry level employment and graduate school. Because of the support and quality activities provided by the Energy Scholarship program, 87% of our Scholars continued at SIU after their first year (exceeding the expected 80%) and graduated or are in good progress to graduate (exceeding the expected 70%). Scholars were 50% women (exceeding the expected 30%). [See image 1 on General Comparison.] As a part of a learning community, Scholars were engaged in brainstorming, designing and implementing several hands-on activities. They developed communication, design and research skills all focused on making contributions to the body of knowledge in STEM, and in particular in energy design and systems. As seniors, scholars participated in research/capstone course, that provided the opportunity for Scholars to apply their knowledge and innovate in their fields leading with one published finding.&nbsp;The management team conducted research on Energy Scholars outcomes in an attempt to answer two research questions related to the effectiveness of the program.</p>\n<p>The first question was: Do Energy Scholars achieve academically and professionally at a higher level than comparable, non-participating students? The answer regarding this first research question found that the energy scholars have on average achieved and participated more in all activities (internship, writing proposals, research, presentation, publication, mentoring and tutoring) except mentoring and tutoring. A higher percentage of energy scholars were part of an internship, wrote and submitted proposals for project funding, successfully conducted research under the supervision of a mentor and professionally presented their work both orally to an audience of their peers and mentors and written than the non-scholars comparison group. [See images 2 and 3 on both Accomplishments and Ratings of Available Resources by scholars versus non-scholars.]</p>\n<p>The second research question was: What program elements (internships, research experience, RSO, scholarship activities, professional society) do Scholars identify as important in completing the baccalaureate, securing an energy-related job or continuing in graduate school? It is found that both the scholars and the comparison group agree that internships rate highest as an activity that advanced their careers. [See image 4 on Activity Rating.] The energy scholars followed this by scholarship activities indicating that the program was making a difference and that this was a factor that non-scholars missed. Conducting research is rated next followed by joining an RSO and a professional society.The gathered results from these studies have been presented at a conference/symposium. Most significantly, these diverse students had financial need which the scholarship helped to meet and most of them are graduated and already started working in a STEM field in industry or graduate school. Among 44 scholars, 6 had left the program most due to personal reasons. Among 35 graduated scholars, only two were looking for a job and two were unknown and thirty-one are involved in STEM jobs or in further education in graduate school.
