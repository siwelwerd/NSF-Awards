 "awd_abstract_narration": "The immense ecological success of insects makes them extremely important agricultural pests, disease vectors, and food web components. Despite the importance of insects, only a minimal understanding of many aspects of their basic physiology still exists. Blood and air flow are critical for the transport of nutrients, hormones, and gases within an insect's body, but a comprehensive understanding of the biomechanical processes that drive fluid flow is lacking. This project tests a new hypothesis that some insects use an abdominal pump linked functionally to a \"gut piston\" to generate the principal forces driving air and blood flow. This research is motivated by three questions: 1) How does the abdominal pump help to create airflow and mixing in the insect gas exchange and transport system? 2) How are pressure differences created within the main body cavity? 3) How important is the abdominal pump for circulation? A variety of experimental and computational methods will be used to test for linkages between these systems. This research will clarify how insects pump fluids, and contribute to a broader understanding of mechanically coupled systems, with potential applications in vertebrate (including human) physiology and mechanical engineering. Mechanically-coupled physiological systems have been relatively well-studied in vertebrates, but rarely at the small sizes of insects. This research will provide, therefore, new insights into the physical basis of flow production in the most diverse group of animals on the planet. This project also includes initiatives to involve individuals from diverse backgrounds in research, and to share this research with the local and broader public. This effort includes a new program that will bring Chicago Public School students to Argonne National Laboratory to experience how synchrotron X-rays are used to image insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project proposes that the tenebrionid beetle Zophobas morio, and perhaps many insect species, utilizes a linked abdominal pump and \"gut piston\" to drive the majority of air and blood flow. A new hypothesis posits that 1) the abdominal pump raises hemolymph pressure and displaces a large amount of body volume, inducing airflows and hemolymph flows, and 2) a synchronous \"gut piston\" pressurizes the thoracic and head compartments, compressing tracheae within them, and thereby further augments pressures that drive air and blood flow within these regions. To test these hypotheses, a combination of newly developed and established techniques to measure abdominal pump volume, cardiac output, hemolymph pressures, hemolymph mixing, and tracheal airflow will be used. Specifically, this project will determine the following: how hemolymph pressures induce compression and airflow in the tracheal system; how differential pressures are created within the coelom and dorsal vessel; and how these components integrate to produce blood flows in the body. To test for linkages between abdominal pumping, hemolymph pressures, gut piston function, hemolymph mixing, and tracheal collapse, correlational approaches will be combined with experimental procedures to directly test the effects of changes in heart and abdominal pump function on airflow and blood circulation. An adaptive and parallelized immersed boundary method will also be used to solve for the flows and mixing patterns generated by the deformations of elastic and/or poroelastic models of the heart, tracheal tubes, and abdomen. Experimental measurements from the beetle will be used to validate the model, and the model will be used to address hypotheses that are difficult to probe experimentally.",

Despite the importance of insects, scientists still have a minimal understanding of many aspects of their basic physiology in regard to how fluids are moved within the body. This project used experimental techniques to study how insects use movements of major organ systems to cause bloodflow in the circulatory system and airflow in the respiratory system. More than thirteen scientific papers will be published from this project, and multiple undergraduate and graduate students, high school teachers, and high school students received new training. Below are presented some of the major scientific and outreach advancements of this project. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The insect circulatory system contains an open cavity called a hemocoel. As a continuous fluidic structure, this cavity should exhibit pressure changes that propagate quickly. Narrow-waisted insects create sustained pressure differences across segments, but their constricted waist provides an evident mechanism for compartmentalization. Insects with no obvious constrictions between segments may be capable of functionally compartmentalizing the body, which could explain complex hemolymph flows. The research team tested the hypothesis of functional compartmentalization by measuring fluid pressures in the beetle and recording abdominal movements. Pressure is indeed uniform within the abdomen and thorax, congruent with the predicted behavior of an open system. However, during some abdominal movements, pressures were on average 62% higher in the abdomen than in the thorax, suggesting that functional compartmentalization creates a gradient within the hemocoel. Synchrotron tomography, a high-resolution tool to create 3D anatomy images, and dissection revealed that a specific internal membrane and thoracic muscles likely contribute to this dynamic pressurization. Analysis of volume change suggests that the gut may play an important role in regulating pressure by translating between body segments. Overall, this study suggests that functional compartmentalization may provide an explanation for how fluid flows are managed in an open circulatory system in insects.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Complementing this work is the first-ever measurement of the viscosity of hemolymph, the insect's 'blood'.&nbsp; Viscosity is an important characteristic of any fluid because it helps to govern flow patterns and energetic requirements for producing them. New measurements suggest that as environmental temperatures decrease, insects experience dramatic changes in hemolymph viscosity, leading to altered circulatory flows or increased energetic input to maintain similar flows. Such physical effects represent a previously unrecognized factor in the thermal biology of insects.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Perhaps the largest accomplishment from this grant is the publication of work on understanding how the insect circulatory system interacts with the tracheal system in relation to body orientation. While it has long been known that vertebrates rely on compensatory responses to gravity with changing body orientation, this topic has not been previously studied in invertebrates. Using synchrotron X-ray imaging and radiotracing, the research team discovered that body orientation has dramatic effects on blood and air distribution in grasshoppers, and that grasshoppers exhibit similar physiological responses to gravity as vertebrates. These findings suggest that gravity-driven cardiovascular responses may be ancient and widely shared among animals, opening the door for invertebrates as model systems for investigation of cellular and systemic mechanisms of gravity responses. This work attracted attention from media around the world, increasing the reach of the findings to the broader public.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Overall, this research has helped to expand understanding of insect flow systems from a mechanical perspective, lending insight into the physical basis of air and blood flow production in the most largest group of animals on earth.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>Beyond scientific discoveries, this project yielded multiple outreach efforts.

Students first received a tour and orientation to the Advanced Photon Source, and then moved to Sector 32 to learn insect anatomy by dissect hissing cockroaches and handling live ones. After the anatomy lesson, students were given an overview of the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique, and examined tracheal structures and movements in live cockroaches at the 32-ID-B beamline. These students thus experienced an integrative physics/biology project and engaged in hands-on learning, providing new exposure to science and engineering.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast

Students first received a tour and orientation to the Advanced Photon Source, and then moved to Sector 32 to learn insect anatomy by dissect hissing cockroaches and handling live ones. After the anatomy lesson, students were given an overview of the synchrotron X-ray imaging technique, and examined tracheal structures and movements in live cockroaches at the 32-ID-B beamline. These students thus experienced an integrative physics/biology project and engaged in hands-on learning, providing new exposure to science and engineering.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/25/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: John Socha"
