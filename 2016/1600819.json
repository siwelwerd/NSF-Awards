The main foci of the  2016 event, which will not be held in Nashville but will be integrated into a trimester program on von Neumann algebras at the Hausdorff Institute in Bonn, are deformation/rigidity theory, free probability theory, and subfactors. The conference program provides ample opportunity for graduate students, postdocs, and other young scientists to present their work.
