 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award provides travel funds for U.S. graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to attend the 4th Heidelberg Laureate Forum (HLF) in Heidelberg, Germany from September 18-23, 2016. The HLF brings together Laureates of the most prestigious awards in mathematics and computer science (the Abel Prize, the Fields Medal, the Turing Award, and the Rolf Nevanlinna Prize) to spend a week interacting with 200 early career researchers. In addition to the scientific exchanges with the Laureates and each other, participants at the Forum gain a valuable global perspective on computer and mathematical sciences.  Modeled on the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings, the HLF provides graduate students and postdoctoral researchers with extraordinary access to a group of scientific role models through lectures, small group discussions, and casual conversations. Such experiences can have a profound impact on the development of an early career researcher. For more information about the Forum, please see www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org \r\n\r\nOak Ridge Associated Universities (ORAU) will recruit a highly qualified and diverse applicant pool for the Forum. There are many exceptionally promising early career researchers who have little or no opportunity to interact with the Laureates of the major prizes in the computer and mathematical sciences. The HLF is a unique opportunity for these individuals, one that can energize and steer future research. The recruitment and selection of participants will emphasize the potential benefits of the opportunity for the researchers, as well as the overall goal of ensuring a broadly inclusive group of participants. ORAU will provide logistical support both prior to and during the forum and also continue to perform an assessment of participant experiences to document the impact of the Forum.
