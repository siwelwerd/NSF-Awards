 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project, features in the Earth's ionosphere called traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) will be studied by analyzing ground- and satellite-based measurements. The ground-based measurements include total electron current (TEC) measurements collected by a few hundred ground-based GPS receivers distributed across South and Central America and the Caribbean region in the LISN network (Low-Latitude ionospheric sensor network). It also includes ionosondes, Fabry-Perot Interferometers, and the incoherent scatter radars at Jicamarca and Arecibo. The outcomes of this research will be a better understanding of the variability and characteristics of medium-scale TIDs (MSTIDs) and TEC depletions during different ionospheric and thermospheric conditions. The study also aims to resolve whether there exists a link between tropical storms and the formation of MSTIDs. The occurrence of plasma irregularities poses a prominent natural hazard to communication, navigation and high precision pointing systems.\r\n\r\nThe conjugate properties of MSTIDs and plasma structures seen at mid-latitudes under a variety of different ionosphere and thermosphere conditions and for magnetically quiet and active conditions will be investigated. Specifically, the following questions will be addressed: What is the control that the latitudinal variability of the plasma conductivity and the propagation direction of atmospheric gravity waves exert on the MSTIDs? What is the initiation mechanism of mid latitude depletions? Do MSTIDs map to conjugate locations during disturbed conditions? Can MSTIDs or TIDs influence the latitudinal (and then altitude) extension of equatorial plasma bubbles? During special events, such as large magnetic storms, TEC values collected by the majority of GPS receivers that exist in North America will be also be used to study poleward expansions of TEC depletions and MSTIDs. Electric fields and density observations gathered with several instruments on-board C/NOFS, DMSP and SWARM satellites will complement the observations.",
