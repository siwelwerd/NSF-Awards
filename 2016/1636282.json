The latest developments in the membrane field from leading academic, governmental, and industrial research labs are presented for the first time for evaluation by the membrane community. \r\n\r\nThe meeting will have 18 separate technical sessions covering all aspects of membrane science and technology. An extensive student program has been developed for the meeting, including the three poster sessions, Young Membrane Scientist Forum, and lunch programming. Four technical workshops will also be offered. These workshops are excellent venues for students to learn about fundamentals and advanced research topics in key areas such as Polymer Ion-Exchange Membranes for Electrochemical Applications; Measurements; Membranes for Water Treatment; and Polymeric and Inorganic Membranes.\r\n\r\nThe organizers anticipate a total of approximately 500 membrane researchers from all over the world representing industry, government, and academia. In addition to the development of human resources, the support provided by this proposal will allow presentation of the latest research results from the most innovative academic laboratories around the country. This showcase of new materials and technologies attracts significant industrial participation as it provides a unique environment to evaluate the commercialization potential of the research. The economic growth associated with such commercialization benefits the entire country.\r\n",
