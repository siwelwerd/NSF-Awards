 "awd_abstract_narration": "The team will use the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to search for time-variable sources associated with massive stars.  Such flickering sources at radio wavelengths suggest that the stars accrete gas in fits and starts.  This surprising behavior was predicted from simulations.  The expected changes in the radio signals are too small to measure from year to year.  But they are big enough to measure from decade to decade.  The longevity of the VLA means that the predictions can now be tested.  The team will compare their new VLA measurements with those from two decades ago.  Recent technical upgrades to this NSF facility will also let the team study the motions of the accreted gas.  Undergraduates from underrepresented groups will be heavily involved in the research.  The PI and his undergraduates will produce educational posters for middle-school students.  They will also lecture at public events at the local campus observatory.  The observatory is the well-known center of a scaled model of our Solar System spread throughout Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe team will use the VLA's exquisite spatial resolution and longevity to study W49A, a massive star-forming complex in our Galaxy.  Their goals are to (1) search for variations in the size and flux density of its continuum sources of ionized (HII) gas; (2) test the predictions of the simulations; (3) characterize the properties of the spectral lines from the ionized gas; and (4) look for kinematic signatures of continuum flickering.",

In our ongoing work studying the W49A Galactic massive star forming region, we have detected a small subset of sources that vary in flux density on short timescales (10-20 years) as predicted by hydrodynamic simulations (Peters et al, 2010, ApJ, 711, 1017). These varying flux densities are thought to be related to the accretion and early evolution processes. During this grant, we first reported on the flux density changes detected at 3.6 cm (De Pree et al 2018, ApJ, 863, L9), and later on changes in radio recombination linewidths at both 3.6 cm and 7 mm (De Pree et al 2020, AJ, 160, 234). These high spatial and spectral resolution studies have revealed complex source morphologies and a number of previously undetected sources. These new data have also been used in a study of a massive young runaway star in W49 (Rodriguez et al, 2020, ApJ, 89, 165).&nbsp;We plan to continue our work at high spatial and spectral resolution in the W49A region using newly acquired ALMA data.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The course of these studies have allowed us to involve seven undergraduate students in radio astronomy research and outreach over the life of the grant. These students have gone on to a variety of post-graduate careers, but a quick review reveals that of these 7 students, 4 have gone on to graduate studies in astronomy, physics or engineering, one has gone on to graduate work in STEM teaching, and two have gone into STEM-related professional work. Through the support of this grant, we have been able to increase the ethnic diversity of students doing research in our Department. We have also produced a set of PDF-format posters on high mass star formation as studied by the Very Large Array (attached to this Outcomes report). These posters were developed for students at the high school level, and have been shared for distribution with the Georgia Space Grant Consortium as well as the National Radio Astronomy Observatory.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 04/14/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christopher&nbsp;G&nbsp;De Pree</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615311/1615311_10458833_1618415304764_NSF-Outcomes-Image-2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615311/1615311_10458833_1618415304764_NSF-Outcomes-Image-2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Outreach Poster - Flickering Regions\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1615311/1615311_10458833_1618415304764_NSF-Outcomes-Image-2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Outreach Poster - Flickering Regions\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This poster, developed for high school students, shows the 3.6 cm VLA image of W49A and describes \"flickering\" of sources.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">C.
