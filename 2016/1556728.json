 "awd_abstract_narration": "Throughout the natural world, one can find pairs of species living together and providing services for one another to their mutual benefit. These species interactions are called mutualisms, and they are thought to maintain much of the world's biodiversity. Mutualisms are also the basis for important ecosystem services like seed dispersal, pollination, and nutrient cycling. But what happens when an invasive species displaces one of the species partners in a mutualism? That is the question this project will address in the savannas of Kenya, where an invasive ant species is displacing the native ants that live on acacia trees. Native ants aggressively defend trees by attacking elephants and other herbivores that eat trees; in exchange, trees provide food (sugary nectar) and shelter (swollen thorns) for the ants. In contrast, an invasive species, big-headed ants, kill native ants but do not defend trees. Without their native bodyguards, trees are being eaten and killed by elephants more frequently. This project will assess the rate and extent of tree loss associated with the big-headed ant species invasion. Because many species of wild herbivores, including endangered black rhinos, rely on trees in one way or another, this project also aims to understand how tree loss affects habitat for wildlife. This research provides a unique opportunity to assess the domino effects of a critical species mutualism breakdown in a landscape with an abundance of elephants, giraffes, and other iconic species of large mammals. \r\n\r\nThis project will test the hypothesis that the cascading effects of the invasive ant species P. megacephala on the foundational mutualism between Acacia drepanolobium and native ants are context-dependent. In savannas invaded by P. megacephala, elephants are expected to reduce tree cover, thereby lowering soil and plant nitrogen (N) and negatively affecting forage and habitat quality for wildlife (since A. drepanolobium is an N-fixer). In contrast, where elephants are absent, P. megacephala invasion should accelerate tree growth, as P. megacephala does not induce nectar production and thus may reduce metabolic costs to host plants. Over the long-term, this mutualism breakdown is predicted to lead to higher tree cover and soil N in invaded areas. This project will (1) quantify the effects of native versus invasive ants on growth, N-fixation, reproduction and biomass of trees in the presence and absence of wild herbivores, especially elephants; (2) use demographic models to project tree population growth rates; (3) use remote sensing to assess the rate of spread of the P. megacephala invasion in both wildlife-present and wildlife-extirpated areas; and (4) assess the effects of P. megacephala invasion on availability of soil and plant nutrients and resulting habitat use by wild herbivores.",

The tree <em>Acacia drepanolobium</em> covers large parts of the region and is a foundational species that provides critical habitat and forage for a diversity of large mammalian wildlife. The big-headed ant, however, is disrupting the mutualism between <em>A. drepanolobium</em> and native <em>Crematogaster</em> ants that typically live on the trees and protect them against mammalian herbivores, including elephants. In this study, conducted on Ol Pejeta Conservancy in central Kenya, we experimentally tested the separate and interacting effects of big-headed ant invasion and herbivory (using fence-out herbivory exclosures in invaded and uninvaded areas to simulate the prevailing land management scenarios of presence vs. absence of wildlife) on <em>A. drepanolobium</em> tree growth and demography and assessed some of the cascading impacts of the invasion on wildlife.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While we predicted that the big-headed ant invasion and herbivory would have a strong interactive effect on tree demography, our demographic models based on 4 years of field data showed that herbivory is the overwhelming factor predicted to cause steep declines in tree numbers over the next 10 years. However, the presence of big-headed ants is predicted to cause additional decline in tree numbers relative to uninvaded areas. Trees in uninvaded areas had reproductive values 2-3 times higher than trees in uninvaded areas. At these rates of decline in tree numbers, areas such as Ol Pejeta Conservancy are at serious risk of losing their <em>A. drepanolobium</em> trees due to high herbivory and the exacerbating effects of the big-headed ant invasion. This would have strongly negative consequences for browsing wildlife such as black rhino, giraffes, elephants, and a variety of antelope species. Short-term protection of trees from herbivory, on the other hand, allowed even invaded trees to grow rapidly and may need to be incorporated into the management of wildlife-present properties and parks to maintain some trees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also found that trees in invaded areas, when exposed to herbivory, were photosynthesizing at a lower rate than trees in uninvaded areas. Invaded trees exposed to herbivory are visibly sickly, and our observations suggest that big-headed ants impact tree root health perhaps by nesting in the root system. When protected from herbivory, the trees appear to cope with this impact, but with the added stress of herbivory they are not doing well. We also found that invaded trees were fixing significantly less nitrogen from the atmosphere, likely because of the impacts of big-headed ants on tree roots and energy stores. Acacia trees play an important role in the savanna system&rsquo;s nitrogen cycle, and the long-term effects of fewer trees fixing less nitrogen could be profound for grazing wildlife and livestock, since grasses benefit greatly from the nitrogen fixed by trees.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>At present, however, the big-headed ant invasion is benefiting some grazing wildlife, especially plains zebra. Using survey counts and camera traps, we found that zebras prefer to be in invaded areas, likely because they feel safer in areas with higher visibility (fewer trees and less grass). We collaborated with Ol Pejeta Conservancy to fit GPS collars on X lions of different prides, and we used collar data to locate 147 kill sites. We found that zebras were less likely to be killed in areas invaded by big-headed ants, largely because of the effect of the invasive ants on habitat visibility. Thus, the ant invasion is having cascading effects through the ecosystem that alter even the behavior of top predators and their primary prey.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We did find one optimistic twist to the story of the big-headed ant invasion. While these ants extirpate the dominant native ants (<em>Crematogaster mimosae</em> and <em>C. nigriceps</em>), a third species of native ant (<em>Tetraponera penzigi</em>) manages to persist and co-occupy trees with big-headed ants thanks to its non-aggressive behavior. This species is normally only present on a small fraction of trees, but in invaded areas we found it present on 12 times more trees. This ant species provides the tree with some protection from elephant herbivory, which may serve to reduce rates of tree decline within invaded landscapes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally, with the help of NSF funding, we trained one postdoc, one Fulbright scholar, one Kenyan MSc student, one Kenyan research associate, and four Kenyan field technicians. All participants received training in insect and plant ID, and the design and implementation of large-scale ecological experiments.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/01/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jacob&nbsp;R&nbsp;Goheen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1556728/1556728_10418003_1630543010850_ElephantsNavigateaPost-InvasionLandscape,2018--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1556728/1556728_10418003_1630543010850_ElephantsNavigateaPost-InvasionLandscape,2018--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"An elephant in a post-invasion landscape\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1556728/1556728_10418003_1630543010850_ElephantsNavigateaPost-InvasionLandscape,2018--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"An elephant in a post-invasion landscape\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Invasion by the big-headed ant kills native ants that protect trees, thus rendering trees defenseless against elephants.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Brandon Hays</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jacob&nbsp;R&nbsp;Goheen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">An elephant in a post-invasion landscape</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1556728/1556728_10418003_1630543168119_thumbnail_bhaattackingRRB--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1556728/1556728_10418003_1630543168119_thumbnail_bhaattackingRRB--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Big-headed ant attack\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1556728/1556728_10418003_1630543168119_thumbnail_bhaattackingRRB--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Big-headed ant attack\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Big-headed ants attack mutualist ants, Crematogaster mimosae</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Todd Palmer</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jacob&nbsp;R&nbsp;Goheen</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Big-headed ant attack</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1556728/1556728_10418003_1630543514199_thumbnail_experiment--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1556728/1556728_10418003_1630543514199_thumbnail_experiment--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Study plots at Ol Pejeta Conservancy\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1556728/1556728_10418003_1630543514199_thumbnail_experiment--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Study plots at Ol Pejeta Conservancy\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">An experimental plot (foreground), fenced to exclude elephants, giraffe, and other wild ungulates.
