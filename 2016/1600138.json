 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will perform the exploratory work needed to develop millisecond imaging technologies as a viable tool for ultra-high contrast astronomy. The direct application of this work is to the development and utilization of the next generation of extremely large telescopes, currently under construction, that will be involved in  direct imaging and characterization of extra-solar planets. The discovery, classification, and characterization of extra-solar planets has stirred the imagination of lay people and professional astronomers alike. The discovery and characterization of an earth like planet, with atmospheric chemical signatures of life processes, would  have a profound impact on humanity.\r\n\r\nAdaptive Optics (AO) systems have made significant improvements in both the imaging spatial resolution and contrast available to ground-based telescopes. Although an AO system attempts to fully correct for atmospheric-induced wavefront distortions, a real-world AO system does an imperfect job, resulting in the \"AO residual\", a set of speckles in the image plane that appear and disappear at millisecond time-scales. It has been shown that these speckles are a major limitation to high-contrast imaging, such as that involved in directly imaging exoplanets. In the proposed formulation, the science camera operates synchronously with the wavefront sensor (WFS), so that the science camera records a speckle pattern that corresponds to the wavefront measured by the WFS. The resulting millisecond exposures provide an information-rich dataset containing a random AO residual, measured by the WFS, that effectively interrogates the optical system and provides new information about the \"non-common path aberrations\", which, when corrected, can significantly improve ultra-high contract astronomical imaging.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \n\n \nNote that this Project Report only covers the final month, 5/1-5/31 2023, not the entire history of the grant.  While the PI\u2019s regression methods for direct imaging of exoplanets have shown considerable promise in theory and simulation studies, on-sky implementation requires calibrated instrument models that accurately predict the intensity measured by the detectors. In order to move towards on-sky implementation, the PI has been working with the MagAO-X team in Tucson.\nLike all coronagraphs for exoplanet imaging, MaAO-X  measures speckles that have not been explained by any instrument model thus far.  These speckles are caused by surface errors on the optical components.  Despite the fact that these surface errors exist throughout the optical system, an instrument model can account for them with a phase and amplitude screen (PAS) in the coronagraph entrance pupil.  Note that the correct PAS will work for any beam incident on the coronagraph entrance pupil.  \n\nIn the final month of the project, the PI has improved the method for representing the PAS in terms of cubic B-spline functions as well as the optimization procedure for finding the PAS.  The net  result is ~ 30% improvement in reproducing the measured speckles.  The PI also made plans with the MagAO-X team for continued progress on the instrument model.\n\n \n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Richard Frazin"
