The proposed R&D activity will facilitate the development of a dual-capsule epoxy self-healing system for epoxy protective coatings. The incorporation of such a system into the design of protective and marine epoxy coatings will improve the corrosion resistance of these coatings leading to longer maintenance cycles for these assets along with a decrease in the loss of productivity, energy consumed and volatile organic compounds associated with maintenance, repair and overhaul activities. The product developed will also find utility as a specialty additive for adhesives and sealants spanning multiple consumer and industrial applications. Finally, successful development of this technology will enable the development of novel one-pack epoxy coating and adhesives curable at ambient conditions, curing agents for powder coatings and novel corrosion inhibiting formulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will result in the development of an approach for the microencapsulation of amine curing agents for epoxy resins en route to the development of a dual capsule epoxy-based self-healing system. Due to their amphiphilic properties, curing agents for epoxies, (typically amines and amides) are difficult to encapsulate since they tend to reside at the interface between the oil and the water phases in oil-in-water emulsions that are a prerequisite for most encapsulation procedures. As such, self-healing systems demonstrated even at an academic level have been based other chemistries even in cases in which the matrix is an epoxy. We will approach this problem on two fronts. The first will be the systematic evaluation and selection of an amine curing agent with a degree of hydrophobicity that will permit its encapsulation. Upon successful encapsulation of the amine, the second front will identify an appropriate process for reinforcing the properties of the shell wall to improve its robustness. Following the achievement of adequately stable amine microcapsules, the efficacy of the dual capsule self-healing system combining these capsules with complementary microcapsules containing an epoxy resin, will be assessed in prototype coating and adhesive formulations.",

(AMI) has been at the forefront of efforts aimed at realizing the potential of self-healing technology in advanced materials. AMI&rsquo;s self-healing technologies bring a crucial, but currently missing, element to the design of protective coatings, which is the ability to maintain the coating&rsquo;s protective capabilities after damage causes exposure of the substrate. The company has developed a range of products, which are currently at various stages of commercial development with some of the world&rsquo;s largest coating manufacturers. When coating formulations containing AMI&rsquo;s products are mechanically damaged, the microcapsules that constitute the product are ruptured, releasing their contents into the site of damage. Once in the site of the damage, the contents, which include polymeric material precursors and corrosion inhibitors, cross-link, restoring the coating&rsquo;s protective capabilities at the site of damage.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project was to design dual-capsule epoxy-amine self-healing chemistries targeted at epoxy coating applications. For these applications, epoxy resin-based formulations and amine-based formulations would be compartmentalized within an epoxy coating in separate microcapsules such that damage to the coating would rupture both varieties of microcapsules releasing their contents into the site of damage thereby initiating a cross-linking reaction between the epoxy resin-based and amine-based formulations (Figure 1). While the microencapsulation of epoxy-based formulations for self-healing applications has been previously achieved,<sup>1</sup> the encapsulation of amine-based formulations present a more significant challenge due to their amphiphilic nature which renders them more difficult to stabilize in an oil-in-water emulsion, an essential step in microencapsulation.</p>\n<p><strong>Results &amp; Discussion</strong></p>\n<p>Upon systematic evaluation of a range of amines prior to the start of the project, we identified a class of primary amines that were significantly more hydrophobic than typical epoxy curing agents while maintaining adequate reactivity with epoxy resins. The focus on hydrophobicity stems from the need to facilitate stabilization of the amine and the more hydrophobic the amine, the more facile the stabilization process. A set of 3 hydrophobic amines was evaluated to assess their intrinsic corrosiveness as well as the barrier properties and corrosion resistance of the epoxy-amine polymers they form. A set of 2 out of the 3 was selected for further evaluation in a range of microencapsulation trials.</p>\n<p>Multiple encapsulation trials were performed using in-situ encapsulation processes including urea-formaldehyde and melamine-formaldeyde chemistries, interfacial processes employing various combinations of acrylate monomers and solvent evaporation methods using various thermplastics. Although viable microcapsules were made for all the approaches outlined above, the most robust microencapsulation process was achieved via a melamine-formaldehyde microencapsulation process based on a commercially available methylated melamine-formaldehyde reactive prepolymer. Images of two iterations of microcapsules prepared using this process are provided in Figure 2. Although microcapsules obtained from preliminary trials exhibited shell walls that were too thick to rupture as efficiently as would be required during a healing event (Figure 2a), subsequent trials produced capsules with more optimal shell wall thicknesses (Figure 2b).</p>\n<p>The ability of the resulting capsules to be ruptured during a healing event and for the hydrophobic amine present within the capsules to be released into the site of damage to cross-link an epoxy resin also present in the site of damage was evaluated in controlled experiments referred to as self-activated control experiments by Brown et al.<sup>2</sup> Self-activated experiments test the performance of each component of a self-healing system within the context of optimal delivery of the other components.
