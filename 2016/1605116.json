 "awd_abstract_narration": "ABSTRACT\r\nPerelman, Lev; 1605116\r\n\r\nThe clinical management of patients with liver disease is a major challenge due to the absence of accurate non-invasive clinical tests. Some medications have shown promise for reversing liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, however there is a large barrier in testing these medications in people because treatment evaluation requires either invasive liver biopsy or post-mortem evaluation. This project will develop an optical spectroscopic system for non-invasive liver monitoring and will have a broad impact in hepatology. The project will provide Ph.D. thesis projects for Biological and Biomedical Sciences (BBS) Program students at Harvard Medical School and also the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST) students. The PI will augment courses at Harvard to introduce the principles of diffuse optical spectroscopy. Portions of instrument development and design will be made available by the PI for student projects within the biomedical engineering senior design course instructed at BU. \r\n\r\nThe PI has shown that optical spectroscopy can obtain liver diagnostic information in mice by quantifying scattering and absorption properties due to hemoglobin, cytochromes, fat, and collagen. In order to proceed to human use the project will develop non-invasive optical spectroscopic methods for correlating alterations in these properties with liver disease, with the goal of providing an accurate diagnostic method appropriate for humans. First techniques for animal use will allow studying diagnostic parameters in all the applicable models of liver disease. Then they will develop a non-invasive clinical optical spectroscopy system and will test it in vivo in human subjects. This involves development of a non-invasive fiber based probe for liver disease by measuring spectroscopic parameters related to portal hypertension. Numerical modeling will use Monte Carlo techniques to model light propagation through media layers. Experimental measurements on multilayered phantoms will be used to validate the models. Specific tasks include: (1) Instrumentation Development and Testing in Tissue Phantoms; (2) Physical Model and Algorithm for Non-Invasive in Vivo Measurements; and (3) Animal and Human Experiments.",

Liver damage causes liver stellate cells to be over active and triggers extra cellular matrix synthesis, which results in the formation of collagenous fibrotic scar tissue. The final stage of liver fibrosis is called cirrhosis, in which, the liver's structure is damaged enough to decrease functionality to a minimal level. Liver cirrhosis is then divided into two categories called compensated cirrhosis and decompensated cirrhosis. Patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis need to be hospitalized and are either undergoing life-threatening complications of liver disease or do not have the minimally sustainable level of liver function. It is estimated that up to 1% of the United States population has liver cirrhosis, resulting in over 28,000 annual deaths due to liver disease. This number is estimated to increase in the coming years. Thus, it is extremely important to develop antifibrotic strategies that are applicable to liver fibrosis. Unfortunately, highly invasive liver biopsy which is the gold standard in liver assessment carries the risk of mortality of approximately 0.05-0.1% and most importantly is unreliable as its small sample size, around 1/50,000 of hepatic parenchymal by mass, does not represent the major liver pathology. The combination of the risk and imperfect accuracy makes the liver biopsy an unattractive tool for liver disease management. Blood chemical measurements can also provide a referential diagnostic marker of liver function, however they cannot detect fibrosis, can fluctuate drastically over time, and only become accurate in advanced cirrhosis stages. Portal hypertension ? an increase in the pressure within the portal vein, which carries blood from the digestive organs to the liver ? is another indication of fibrosis. In fibrosis, portal hypertension is caused by increased vascular resistance in the liver, combined with increased blood flow arriving to the liver from the mesenteric circulation system. Currently, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement is the best available method to evaluate the presence and severity of portal hypertension, which is done with a transjugular balloon catheter. However, the transjugular measurement of HVPG has a procedure-related mortality rate of approximately 0.5% and a complication rate of up to 20%. Due to these risks, the procedure is only performed on very sick patients with advanced liver disease, despite HVPG being the most effective treatment endpoint. Optical spectroscopy methods have demonstrable ability in assessing microscopic changes in tissue structure. The unique spectral characteristics of the liver combined with the non-invasive capabilities of diffuse transmission spectroscopy in sampling large tissue volumes makes the technique an ideal tool for assessing the condition of the liver over a large sampling area. Additionally, optical methods can quantify parameters such as the tissue oxygenation and hemoglobin content. Over the course of this project we have been developing a non-invasive, optics-based liver assessment method to detect and diagnose liver fibrosis and cirrhosis which can be translated to humans. Our in vivo diffuse transmission spectroscopy studies in the mouse model of liver fibrosis demonstrated that optical spectroscopy can indeed differentiate fibrotic and normal liver. Moreover we established that similar measurements are also feasible in human subjects and can lead to the development of entirely non-invasive tool for assessing the condition of the human liver.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/29/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lev&nbsp;T&nbsp;Perelman</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
