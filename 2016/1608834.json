 "awd_abstract_narration": "During the past 20 years, astronomers have discovered thousands of planets around other stars.   It is extremely hard to study these so-called \"exoplanets,\" because the glare of light from their parent stars hides them.  Turbulence in Earth's atmosphere greatly complicates studies using large ground-based telescopes.  To counteract this effect, most large telescopes now employ a technique called \"adaptive optics,\" or AO, to stabilize the image of a star.  With the image stabilized, astronomers can use other devices to suppress most of the starlight, enabling them to study the much fainter exoplanets around them.  Many of the giant exoplanets radiate at thermal infrared wavelengths.  Capitalizing on this fact, the Investigators will develop a spectrograph to operate at these wavelengths for installation on the Large Binocular Telescope, or LBT.  The LBT, located on a mountaintop in Arizona, consists of twin 8.4-meter-diameter telescopes that already use AO.  A prototype of the new spectrograph is already in operation on the LBT.  This project serves the national interest by developing a state-of-the-art instrument that will be used to promote our knowledge  of the composition of exoplanets. The Intellectual Merit of the project comes from the ability of the new spectrograph to carry out studies of exoplanets, disks around young stars, and bodies in our Solar System.  The Broader Impacts involve the training of graduate students who will become the next generation of instrument developers.\r\n\r\nThe Investigators will develop the world's first adaptive-optics-fed, integral-field spectrograph for the thermal infrared and integrate it into the twin 8.4-meter Large Binocular Telescope.  A prototype of the instrument, dubbed \"ALES,\" developed by the same team, is already in operation and producing high-contrast imaging and spectroscopy.  The modular aspect of the instrument, which is afforded by filter wheels that contain a variety of optical components, is a novel and flexible feature.  The Intellectual Merit of the project derives from its potential to obtain spectra of gas-giant exoplanets and other astronomical objects that radiate in the thermal infrared, pointing the way to interesting science observations in the future.  The Broader Impacts are focused on developing graduate students with the skills necessary to design the next generation of astronomical instrumentation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project resulted in a new instrument on the Large Binocular Telescope (Mt. Graham, Arizona), which can take pictures of extrasolar planets at 35 wavelengths simultaneously.  The instrument, named Arizona Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (ALES), is an integral field spectrograph (sometimes called a hyper-spectral imager in non-astronomy fields) that operates at a wavelength of 3-5 microns.  Integral field spectrographs take a spectrum of every pixel, or conversely, an image at every wavelength.  When searching for extrasolar planets, this means that it is possible to distinguish between the planet's light and the glare of its host star.  If the location of the exoplanet is not known, it is possible to find the exoplanet and obtain a spectrum simultaneously.  Many exoplanet imaging instruments use integral field spectroscopy, but ALES is the first one to operate in the thermal infrared (3-5 microns) where self-luminous gas-giants peak in brightness.\n\n\nALES includes custom optics installed into a pre-existing instrument (Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer and its L/M Infrared Camera; LBTI/LMIRcam).  The optics are (1) a set of diamond-turned magnifiers, manufactured by University of Arizona, (2) a lenslet array where individual lenslets have different lens prescriptions, manufactured by Jenoptik Optical Systems in Alabama, and (3) ZnSe and Sapphire prisms where the ZnSe has a cylinder polished on one surface, manufactured by Rocky Mountain Instrument in Colorado.  These optics have improved our ability to fabricate and incorporate free-form optics into astronomical instruments.  \n\n\nThe instrument is now under regular use and has obtained spectra of several exoplanets in a wavelength range where this had not previously been possible.  This is allowing astronomers to study the chemical compositions, condensates and weather of extrasolar planets.  Highlights include the first 3-4 micron spectrum of an exoplanet, the first 3-4 micron spectra of the HR 8799 multi-planet system, and an experiment that determined ALES is the best instrument in the world for obtaining variability measurements of exoplanets at sub-arcsecond separations.  An image showing the HR 8799 exoplanets as imaged by ALES is attached.\n\n\nThe production of trained instrumentalists is a fundamental need of the U.S. astronomical community.  This project trained a graduate student, who earned a PhD, and is currently working on exoplanet mission planning at NASA.  The student is now an expert in simulating and analyzing integral field spectroscopy data, and has written papers analyzing the properties of exoplanets using ALES.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/03/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew Skemer"
