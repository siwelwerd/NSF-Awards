 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to create a technology to assist in 1) fish lure selection, 2) lure development and sales, and 3) ecological management.  The initial focus is on largemouth bass, the most popular sportfish in the United States (an estimated 12-18 million anglers).  The underlying technology, however, will be applicable to many other fish species and aquatic animals.  For the angler (user base #1), lure selection is critical to success and enjoyment.  Because fish see quite differently than humans, and their visual perception varies dramatically depending on lighting environments and habitat, the human eye cannot predict how bass will perceive a lure.  To improve the fishing experience, this I-Corps team will create an application that allows anglers to estimate how a given lure appears to bass in a given environment, and estimates the maximum distance at which a bass can see the lure.  For the lure manufacturer (user base #2), the technology can be used to develop lures with known levels of perception targeted for specific habitats?not only increasing the success of the lures but also adding significant marketing advantages.  In the field of animal management and conservation (user base #3), the technology ultimately promises a greater understanding of perception among a variety of species, leading to better decisions and practices to preserve and enhance ecosystems.\r\n\r\nRecreational angling is a multi-billion dollar industry, and largemouth bass are the most popular target for anglers. An estimated $6.1 billion is spent annually just on rods, reels, tackle boxes, etc. Another $100 million is spent on fishing magazines, books, and DVDs. 11.2 million people fish for black bass annually, and another 7.3 million fish for related sunfish species. At this time the team is not aware of any product on the market that take a scientific approach to estimating how bass perceive objects in their environment, or that use the knowledge base of fish vision capabilities to make effective lures. Participation in the I-Corps program will enable the team to investigate the market from many viewpoints. The team will learn what channels lures and fish attraction products take from manufacture to user in the recreational market area. The team also needs to connect with all types of recreational anglers, as well as commercial fisherman. If fish can be caught by specific lures based on the knowledge of their visual systems, it could mean that using fish specific lure systems in a commercial setting could eliminate the gathering of non-target species of all kinds, called the by-catch, preventing the situation in which fish other than those desired are collected via the fishing methods used, and then discarded as waste. At the end of the project, the team will decide if a SBIR would be useful to obtain, and also gain insight into what business entity or license strategy to use for commercial market entry.",

Second, lure makers are keen to develop relationships with the youth market in order to foster brand loyalty.  The reason for this is that anglers develop brand loyalty in their youth, but they do not ?pay off? for lure makers until later. Third, the recreational fishing industry is nervous about developing the next generation of anglers.  Their fear is that the industry is becoming too ?pale, male, and stale?.  The fishing industry wants to develop youth anglers and wants to increase the number of women and other groups of people who are currently under-represented among anglers.
