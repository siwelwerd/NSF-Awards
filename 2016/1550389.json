 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will develop, formalize, and improve documentation and functionality for a set of codes\r\nused for research and education in geophysics but of potential application in other fields. The project\r\nwill continue algorithmic development and documentation of software for geophysical analysis using\r\nwavelets, vector spherical harmonics and Slepian functions. Examples are: in geodynamics, the description of deformation in and of the Earth; in geomagnetics, the lithospheric magnetic field; in geodesy, models of terrestrial and planetary gravity; and any directional spherical processes that are vectorial in nature in other fields of science and engineering.  The codes support (or will support) decomposition of fields, harmonic analysis, power spectral estimation, inversion parameterization, vector\r\nfield analysis, and satellite data. The project will also develop software for analysis of Ground Penetrating\r\nRadar data. The work will involve students and course work between two very different institutions in\r\ncontinual use, testing, and input to the development of the codes. \r\n\r\nAnalyses in vector-spherical harmonics are well established, but only legacy code, mostly in Fortran, exists to date. Matlab or Octave software archives are much needed, especially in the light of modern-day mathematical methods which consist in forming optimized linear combinations of vector harmonics into bandlimited, geographically localized functions: the so-called Slepian basis. Designing algorithms, and programming them well, in a robust and reproducible manner, is demanding but not often considered a scientific objective per se. The society at large, and the scientific community, are best served when all research-grade and educational code is fully documented and available, ready to run by novice or expert alike. Matlab and Octave are portable, low-threshold scripting languages that blend low-level flexibility, intermediate complexity and high-performance.",

We believe this mind-set to be a vital ingredient in making science collaborative, and in establishing and maintaining public trust. Such a philosophy requires a sustained commitment that is hardly ever funded explicitly by any agency. In our case, we were fortunate to be able to count on the support of the National Science Foundation to make great strides in completing and extending our code archive, by organizing and posting it onto the Web, and by bringing it under version control on the widely used sharing platform GitHub. Over the lifetime of the grant we have made thousands of new \"commits\" to the GitHub database, which now contains hundreds of individual routines devoted to geophysical data analysis. The principal science goals revolved around enabling the analysis of planetary geophysical fields - the three main branches of global geophysics, in our definition, involving [1] global and exploration seismology (what are the wave-speeds in the interior of the Earth, and what do they reveal about its temperature, composition, and the presence of hydrocarbons?), [2] gravity and its time-dependence (what are the densities in the interior of the Earth, and on its surface, and how are mass fluxes, especially those related to the melting of polar ice caps and mountain glaciers, mapped from satellite gravity missions?), and [3] magnetism (what is the lateral and vertical extent of magnetized regions on the terrestrial planets, and what does that tell us about their tectonic evolution?) These are geophysical questions that solicit statistical approaches for data analysis that require mathematical tools that are, ultimately, extremely general. What we develop in terms of software to answer questions ultimately centered on geophysics, when it is boiled down to the essential mathematics, carries over to related fields such as physics, chemistry, engineering, and medical data analysis. By continuing to program in MATLAB, which itself may require a license to run, but whose main routines remain open for everyone to see, or which themselves go back to open-source libraries, we guarantee a low-threshold entry for novice users, while relatively effortlessly scaling up to the demands of professional researchers. All of our codes remain \"live\", commits are being made almost daily, and an active user base of \"takers\" and \"givers\" has sprouted up around them. One of the essential components of the grant as funded included the training of undergraduate researchers into becoming active geophysical programmers and GitHub repository owners, and the PIs, one at a small private university and the other at a large public college, met in person for three summers in a row, bringing together undergraduate interns from both institutions for intensive training and collaboration. Of all the accomplishments of this, our grant, we should be most proud.
