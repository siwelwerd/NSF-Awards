 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will improve our understanding of coupled natural-human systems and advance the frontiers of natural and social sciences, integrating them through a focus on model systems comprising four well-studied islands before and after a millennium of human occupation. The project team will develop and test conceptual and quantitative theory that emphasizes feedbacks between humans and the complex ecological systems that support them. The project applies archaeological and paleo-ecological methods to increase understanding of the relationships between initial conditions and subsequent developmental trajectories in the four study socio-ecosystems. This understanding will be used to develop and constrain computational models which will be used to test theories regarding long-term human-ecology feedbacks. The project seeks in particular to integrate the dual roles of humans as subsistence consumers of resources and as market-driven exploiters of resources. The understanding and integrated models will be used to explore the sustainability of people's extraction of biomass (e.g., fish, fiber, fuel, and timber) from complex ecosystems in the context of ecosystem services and environmental change. This work includes three activities: 1) Build a comprehensive network theory of dynamic coupled natural-human systems including their robustness and resilience to external and internal change; 2) apply the theory to, and test it against, the introduction, persistence, and dynamics of Polynesians on four Pacific Islands; and 3) explore how the development and application of the theory might support further advances in our understanding of diversity and complexity and their interactions with ecosystem management.\r\n\r\nThis project will help us to understand how and why humans succeed or fail to live sustainably within their environment. The research examines four French Polynesian islands where humans arrived about one thousand years ago and lived sustainably on some islands but not on others. Historical and current data will be used to help develop a clearer picture of the social and ecological changes that have taken place since the islands were first occupied. The project team will build and test sophisticated computer models of humans interacting with wild and managed ecosystems. The data and models will help more fully describe and explain fundamental properties such as the resources required by human populations and the ability of ecosystems to provide food and shelter for humans over hundreds of years. They will also highlight interactions between ecosystem services and the human use and exploitation of the islands' resources. Such knowledge is critical to understanding the role of humans with respect to ecosystems and environments well beyond these islands. The project will provide fundamental knowledge about how humans can interact more sustainably and beneficially with a wide variety of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This work will also demonstrate how environmental and social sciences such as ecology, hydrology, oceanography, archaeology, demography and economics can be integrated to push forward the frontiers of interdisciplinary science. Such advances are vital for addressing critical problems at the intersection of social and natural sciences including resource overconsumption, climate disruption and the collapse of civilizations.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project advanced scientific understanding of humans interacting with nature most specifically on islands but also humans interacting with ecosystems in general.   Key aspects of these interactions that were studied include which plant and animal species lived on four Pacific islands and which species humans consumed as well as the intensity of their consumption prior to contact by Europeans.   This work initiated a much broader collaboration among scientists that are studying which species humans interact with in many locations around the globe.   Beyond such structure of these human-natural interactions, the changes over time resulting from these interactions were also studied.   More specifically, rises and falls of human populations on the four islands were estimated from the abundance of agricultural and marine resources available on the islands.   This research helped fill a gap in ecological understanding regarding the effects of mutualisms where species engage in interactions where both species benefit.   Such mutualisms include humans interacting with their crops and livestock as well as plant-pollinator interactions and interactions between the photosynthetic and animal species that build healthy coral reefs.   Our research illustrated how the architecture of these networks of mutualistic interactions and the amount of food provided by photosynthetic partners can stabilize the dynamics of the species participating in the interactions such that the mutualist species and the many species depending on the mutualists (e.g., humans, coral reef fishes, etc.) were able to persist and avoid extinction over long periods of time.   Our study of human-natural interactions also advanced our understanding of economically driven consumption such as that occurring within fisheries.   For example, we elucidated how fishing can destabilize fished populations and degrade the ecosystems supporting the fisheries.   We also showed how market mechanisms such as how quickly the economic demand for fish may fall as the price of fish increases can sustain productive fisheries or drive fished species to extinction.   Overall, this project contributed much data and improved theory to help scientifically understand how human-natural systems operate generally and, more specifically, how human consumption of ecosystem services on islands occurred in the past and may be sustained in the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Neo D Martinez"
