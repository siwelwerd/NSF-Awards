The funds would help to support making available in print and online thousands of Einstein documents and Einstein-related material accompanied by in-depth scholarly research. The volumes are an indispensable resource for 20th century science and technology studies, scientists, historians and philosophers of science, but also for the study of European and American history, network and scientific communications, education, science policy, the relation of science, technology, and government and many other areas of inquiry.\r\n\r\nTechnical Summary \r\n\r\nOver the grant period, the editors will prepare 2 documentary volumes and 2 English translation volumes covering the years 1925 through 1929, as part of a series that is projected to reach thirty volumes and ultimately contain more than 30,000 documents and their scholarly annotation. The two volumes will contain approximately 150-200 writings (articles, drafts, lectures) by Einstein as annotated full-text, 800 letters by and to Einstein as annotated full-text, 1,500 letters by and to Einstein in English-language abstracts, references to 1,000 third party primary documents a bibliography of several hundred secondary sources. This work will complement and enhance digital humanities and science initiatives.",
