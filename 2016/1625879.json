 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will support the planning and building of an initial testbed application for evaluating material models that describe how light is reflected  from surfaces in computer graphics research.  After talking with interested researchers in the community, the lead investigator will build an application that allows anyone to submit and download three important types of data for doing this research: (1) reference implementations of material models, (2) measures of how well the predicted light reflections of a model match real examples, and (3) examples of measured reflections from physical materials to compare against.  When people submit new material model implementations, the application will automatically run all of the models it contains using all of the measures and measured examples available.  This is an important advance because currently there is no good way for researchers to compare their work against others', which slows down progress in both research and graphics applications; the testbed will make it much easier to compare new ideas to old ones, as well as to understand which models work best in which situations.  This will advance research in a number of areas related to computer graphics, as well as directly benefiting society through improving graphics in real applications including virtual reality, animation, and data visualization. \r\n\r\nTo do this, the lead investigator will create a repository with an initial set of reference algorithms, datasets, fitting functions, and evaluation metrics based on existing research around bidirectional reflectance distribution functions (BRDFs).  Other researchers will be able to contribute to the repository through an Application Programming Interface (API) that allows for easy addition of new items; it will then dynamically report on run all-against-all comparisons with existing items in the repository.  During this planning grant the lead investigator will develop the initial infrastructure both to demonstrate a proof-of-concept and to present a concrete artifact that can jump start the discussion of how to make the repository more useful to the broader research community.  Although starting with researchers most directly involved with BRDFs, the community will eventually include people from a number of related research areas, including non-linear optimization, human perception, rendering, photorealistic visualization, and computer vision.",

A BRDF is a 4D function that describes the reflectance behavior of physical materials, and it  determines whether the surfaces appear matte, plastic, metallic, mirror-like, etc. Hence,BRDFs are an essential component in any rendering application. To mimic the wide variety and complex visual richness of physical materials, numerous analytical BRDF models, with varying degrees of accuracy, flexibility, and efficiency have been proposed in the past decades. Due to a lack of an exhaustive comparison and/or generally accepted methodology, newly developed BRDF models are often only compared to the \"best\" competing model. However, what is considered the \"best\" competing model is heavily colored by what individual researchers perceive as the \"best\" model and by the preferred quality of the BRDF. The result is a fractured landscape of competing models and goals, where it is not always clear what the limitations of each model are given some specified criteria.   The envisioned dynamic BRDF benchmark aims to address this issue.\n\nIn this award, we explored the development of such a dynamic BRDF benchmarking infrastructure that will contain 1) reference implementations of BRDF models, fitting strategies, fitting metrics, and quality assessment metrics. 2) a unified interface for reading the different formats of measured BRDF data, as well as a library of fitted BRDF model parameters that best mimic the appearance of the measured materials based on the implemented fitting strategies and fitting metrics. 3) an online of offline analysis tool.  \n\nConcretely, prototype proof-of-concept implementations and APIs have been developed for each component that helps us better assess the issues expected in the development of the full BRDF benchmark. Furthermore, feedback on the envisioned BRDF Benchmark has been collected from the relevant research communities and integrated in the final plan for the envisioned BRDF Benchmark.\n\nAdvances in appearance and BRDF modeling directly impacts related domains such as rendering, virtual reality, cultural heritage preservation, computational fabrication, etc. The envisioned BRDF benchmark lowers the threshold for researchers from other domains to apply their expertise to appearance modeling.
