 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry program of the NSF Division of Chemistry, Professor Berryman of the University of Montana, conducts research to gain a better fundamental understanding of the interactions between molecules and to provide insights for developing novel approaches to accelerate chemical reactions.  This research aims to develop a new class of catalysts for more efficient synthesis of sulfur containing compounds.  Considering the wide range of useful sulfur containing pharmaceuticals, this research has the potential to help advance drug development and benefit society.  Additionally, educational and outreach activities are designed to inspire students and broaden participation in science fields. Specifically, 3D printed models of crystal structures are used as an interactive learning tool at the spectrUM science museum and on Native American reservations.  3D printed models are also used to facilitate the teaching of X-ray crystallography in university courses and help high school students understand the concepts of molecular recognition and shape selectivity.\r\n\r\nThe Berryman group performs studies to obtain a fundamental understanding of the strength, structure and nature of halogen bonding interactions between organic donors and soft chalcogen and pnictogen Lewis bases.  His group further investigates whether multidentate halogen bonding receptors can selectively bind and catalyze the reactions of soft substrates. An important goal of this research is to address the question of whether halogen bonding interactions can be developed into a new genre of organocatalysis.  The goal of the broader impacts is to develop hands-on methods to teach X-ray crystallography and inspire underrepresented students to explore science education. A tactile approach improves students? basic understanding of structure and appreciation of chemistry. 3D printing technology is exploited to translate crystal structure coordinates into tangible models that can be visualized, held and manipulated.",
