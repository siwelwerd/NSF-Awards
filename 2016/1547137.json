 "awd_abstract_narration": "El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events affect weather and climate worldwide, with El Nino impacts over the United States including flooding in California, mild winters in Alaska and the northern tier, and drier conditions in the Ohio valley, with largely opposite conditions during La Nina, or cold phase ENSO, events. The predictability of ENSO is a matter of both practical and scientific interest, and there have been many efforts to identify precursor patters in sea surface temperature (SST), sea level pressure (SLP), and other variables so that the onset of ENSO events can be anticipated several months to seasons in advance. The PIs have proposed a novel mechanism through which changes in surface wind over the North Pacific associated with the North Pacific Oscillation (NPO, a prominent mode of Northern Hemisphere climate variability) can lead to ENSO events 9 to 12 months later. The mechanism, dubbed trade-wind charging (TWC), involves the southward transport of relatively warm subsurface waters from the central subtropical North Pacific, driven by the curl of the surface wind stress anomalies associated with the NPO (a Sverdrup transport). The southward heat transport warms the ocean thermocline in the central equatorial Pacific, thus creating favorable conditions for the development of an El Nina event (a similar chain of events can promote a La Nina event starting from the opposite phase of the NPO). The examination of the TWC mechanism involves testing three related hypotheses: 1) Positive and negative trade wind charging (TWC) of the equatorial Pacific heat content in isolation is sufficient to generate warm and cold boreal winter ENSO events, respectively; 2) Positive and negative TWC enhances the efficacy of initial subsurface ocean conditions in generating warm and cold boreal winter ENSO events; and 3) Positive TWC enhances the efficacy of Meridional Mode (MM) dynamics in generating warm boreal winter ENSO events. The research is performed through experiments with a climate model, the Coupled Model version 2.5 developed at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. In one set of experiments, the ocean component model is integrated subject to surface atmospheric conditions taken from reanalysis products, so that the ocean state bears the imprint of an observed NPO event, after which the ocean is coupled to the atmospheric component model and the fully coupled climate model is integrated for several additional months to track the development (or lack thereof) of a TWC-induced ENSO event. \r\n\r\nThe work has broader impacts due to the societal value of better long-lead predictions of ENSO events, as noted above. More specifically, the research offers specific targets for the evaluation of operational forecast model used for ENSO prediction, and the PIs plan to develop an index that can be used to monitor TWC behavior relevant to ENSO prediction. In addition, the project supports a graduate student and a postdoctoral research associate, thereby providing future workforce development in this research area.",

Dynamically, the variation of strength in the north Pacific trade winds accumulates warm water in the off-equatorial central Pacific which in turn warms the equatorial Pacific. This mechanism is known as \"trade wind charging.\"  In addition, the variation of strength in the trade winds also modifies the north-south temperature difference between the equatorial and tropical North Pacific, which in turn can alter the strength of the winds over the equatorial Pacific.  This thermodynamical influence of trade-wind variations on ENSO development is known as the \"meridional mode\" mechanism.\n\n \n\nFrom the model experiments, we show that trade wind charging consistently builds upper ocean heat content in the equatorial central Pacific in the spring through equatorward transport of warm water. This warm water is later transported eastward and upward along the sloped equatorial thermocline (a water layer in which water temperature decreases rapidly with increasing depth) and emerges in the summer as a warm surface temperature signal in the eastern equatorial Pacific. This surface warming is amplified by air-sea feedbacks, resulting in an El Ni&ntilde;o event in the winter.  By contrast, the meridional mode mechanism generates only a weak, short-lived central Pacific El Ni&ntilde;o in the fall that quickly dissipates by winter.   These experiments confirmed that while both thermodynamic and dynamic mechanisms can trigger an El Ni&ntilde;o, the strength and persistence of the warming depends on the subsurface heat content buildup in the equatorial Pacific generated by the trade wind charging mechanism.\n\n \n\nIn parallel with the numerical model experiments, we examined the historical evolution of tropical Pacific oceanic and atmospheric variations to determine the robustness of the links between boreal winter trade-wind variability and changes in the state of the tropical Pacific Ocean one year later.  Much to our surprise, we found these linkages can appear and disappear over the course of 40-50 years.  When these linkages are strong, for instance during the periods 1871-1920 and 1961-Present, we find that the year-to-year variations in the warming and cooling of the equatorial Pacific are relatively large.  By comparison, when the linkages are weak, for instance during the period 1921-1960, the year-to-year variations tend to be smaller.  However, because trade-wind variability influences the initiation of ENSO events during the first and last periods, the predictability of ENSO events is limited to less than a year.  By contrast, during the intervening period, in the absence of the trade-wind influence, the transition of the equatorial Pacific from a warm state to a cold state becomes more regular and longer-lived, resulting in predictability of ENSO\u2019s evolution over the span of 3 or more years.  We subsequently confirmed these surprising results by analyzing the links between boreal winter trade-wind variability and changes in the state of the tropical Pacific Ocean within a suite of state-of-the-art Earth System models.  Finally, our research shows that historically this transition from periods when the linkages are strong to those when they are weak accompanies long-lived transitions in the general circulation of the tropical Pacific itself.  As such, by monitoring the state of the tropical Pacific it may be possible to determine whether year-to-year variations in the equatorial Pacific will tend to be fairly regular (but weak), or fairly random (but strong). \n\n \n\nThe results of this project are important because they shed light on how ocean dynamics driven by trade wind charging can serve as a potential predictor of ENSO up to one year in advance.
