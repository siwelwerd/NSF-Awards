 "awd_abstract_narration": "Time-Sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS) is a platform for conducting survey experiments fielded on probability-based samples of United States adults.  TESS capitalizes on the economies of scale to enable scholars from across the social sciences, on a competitive basis, to conduct ground-breaking research on issues of broad theoretical and practical importance.  The intellectual merit of TESS is closely connected to its successes in enabling social scientists collection original population-based experimental data in a timely manner; promoting better understanding of fundamental social, political, and economic questions; maximizing financial efficiency by pooling expenses for otherwise separate studies; and offering mentoring and educational resources.   The broader impacts of TESS are wide-ranging.  TESS has allowed a wide variety of scholars to undertake survey experiments that because of cost to single researchers would not be possible.  It has also allowed for these scholar's work to be improved by a rigorous review process and mentoring where needed.  In addition, all the data collected under the TESS framework is made available on a timely basis in a single archive.\r\n\r\nThe current iteration of TESS also includes running experiments on M-TURK as well as probability-based samples in Europe.  Using M-TURK will allow scholars to examine the usefulness of that data collection system as compared to the probability-based samples currently used.  It will allow investigators to examine for biases in the data collection processes in the former, which while inexpensive may be severely flawed for some purposes.  Examining the results of probability-based analysis in Europe as compared to the United States will allow investigators to study how robust results derived from United States data are.  This is especially true of experiments dealing with non-political cases.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nSince 2001, Time-sharing Experiments for the Social Sciences (TESS) has capitalized on economies of scale to enable scholars from across the social sciences, on a competitive basis, to conduct groundbreaking social research on important issues. TESS is a vehicle for population-based survey experiments: studies that combine the power of experiments to establish cause-and-effect relationships with the power of population-based surveys to describe how well patterns generalize to the broader population.  \n\nHow TESS works: we solicit proposals from social scientists for novel survey experiments; we coordinates expert review of these proposals; and then we field the experiments from the best proposals on behalf of investigators using a high-quality online Internet panel. Over our history, TESS has conducted well over 500 experiments&mdash; more than 70 in this grant--for investigators spanning the social sciences.  Two-thirds of investigators in the current grant were either graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, or assistant professors, and for many TESS is their first opportunity to test their ideas using nationally-representative data.\n\nTo collect data, TESS uses the AmeriSpeak panel run by NORC at the University of Chicago.  AmeriSpeak has the best performance of any probability-based panel of US adults on multiple metrics.  Because TESS is able to commit to NORC to fielding many experiments over years, we are able to field individual studies more efficiently and at a lower cost than if each investigator was working on their own.  \n\nTESS currently offers three distinct mechanisms to investigators, as a way of expanding the range of projects our platform can support.  First, our regular mechanism accepts, reviews, and fields proposals on a rolling basis.  Second, our \"Short Study\" mechanism allows for brief proposals for shorter and lower-cost experiments than those permitted by our regular mechanism, for which we use a streamlined, typically internal, review process to maximize rapid response.  Third, we conduct occasional special competitions (e.g., for early-stage investigators) in which prevailing studies are allowed the opportunity to be fielded on a much larger sample than what our regular mechanism allows.  \n\nInvestigators have one year of exclusive use to data from their TESS proposal.  After that, we make all data we collect publicly available to maximize potential use by the research community.  To our knowledge, TESS provides the largest archive of experimental data for which all data are publicly available regardless of whether the experiment \"worked\" or not.  As a result, in addition to our primary use for the findings that TESS experiments provide, we have a secondary use as a resource for investigators looking to interrogate the methodological properties of experimental data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/14/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jeremy Freese"
