 "awd_abstract_narration": "Exemplary teaching in STEM fields encourages students from diverse backgrounds to pursue further education and careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  Improving teaching, however, first requires an understanding of the current landscape of STEM instruction.  The 2018 National Survey of Science and Mathematics Education (NSSME+) will explore the extent to which such instruction currently models effective, evidence-based, teaching practices, and also will investigate the factors that influence teachers? decisions about content and pedagogy.  This will mark the sixth in a series of the national surveys monitoring the status of science and mathematics education conducted by Horizon Research Inc. with assistance from Westat. This iteration will add a focus on computer science and engineering education. The 2018 data will attend to factors that contribute to the underrepresentation of some groups in STEM, further adding to general knowledge about ways to broaden participation. The project is funded by the EHR Core Research program, which supports fundamental research that advances the research literature on STEM learning, and has implications for education in both formal and informal settings.\r\n \r\nThe 2018 NSSME study will yield accurate, up-to-date measures of key elements of the STEM education system, and identify trends in these areas over time. The study will collect data on teacher characteristics, including teacher content background and demographics; course offerings and enrollments; textbook/program usage; instructional strategies; formative assessment; and the influences of particular policies (e.g., the Every Student Succeeds Act). In addition to national estimates, the study will provide results disaggregated by type of community and characteristics of the student body.  The investigators will invite the Principal Investigators of the NSF Indicator projects to offer input on the 2018 NSSME+ instruments, with an eye towards identifying how the work of their projects could be infused or adapted into a large-scale survey.  All analyses will be conducted using weighted data, with school, teacher, and class weights calculated to reflect the sample design selection probabilities.\r\n\r\nThe Promoting Research and Innovation in Methodologies for Evaluation (PRIME) program seeks to support research on evaluation with special emphasis on: (1) exploring innovative approaches for determining the impacts and usefulness of STEM education projects and programs; (2) building on and expanding the theoretical foundations for evaluating STEM education and workforce development initiatives, including translating and adapting approaches from other fields; and (3) growing the capacity and infrastructure of the evaluation field. Three types of proposals will be supported by the program: Exploratory Projects that include proof-of-concept and feasibility studies; more extensive Full-Scale Projects; and workshops and conferences. This proposal meets the requirements of category 1 above.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn response to numerous requests for information regarding the status of K-12 STEM education in the United States, Horizon Research, Inc. conducted the 2018 National Survey of Science and Mathematics Education (NSSME+).  The plus symbol reflects the study's added emphasis on computer science and engineering, two disciplines that are increasingly prominent in discussions about K-12 STEM education and college and career readiness.  The study was the sixth in a series of surveys dating back to a 1977 study commissioned by the National Science Foundation.  The 2018 NSSME+ gathered information about a diverse set of topics, including science, mathematics, and computer science courses offered to students; teacher background and preparation; professional development opportunities; classroom instruction; and resources available for instruction.  Data were collected from a nationally representative sample of over 7,600 teachers from more than 1,200 schools, and disaggregated in several ways, including by: subject, grade band (K-5, 6-8, 9-12), poverty level, school size, and community type (rural, suburban, urban), as well as characteristics of the classes of students such as prior achievement level and percentage of students from race/ethnicity groups historically underrepresented in STEM. \n\n \n\nAlthough the study identified a number of strengths of the STEM education system, it also found a number of areas in which improvement is needed.  For example, the typical elementary school class spends about 20 minutes a day on science instruction, compared to 60 minutes on mathematics and 90 minutes on reading/language arts.  Almost all elementary classes spend time on mathematics instruction every school day; in contrast, only 1 in 3 classes in grades 4-6 and 1 in 5 classes in grades K-3 receive science instruction every school day.\n\n \n\nIn terms of high school course offerings, the vast majority of schools offer biology, chemistry, and college preparatory mathematics courses.  However, only about half of high schools in the country offer at least one computer science course.  In high school science, about half of the students in biology, chemistry, and physics classes are female, although students in advanced science courses are more likely to be female than male.  The proportion of female and male students in college preparatory mathematics classes is about equal.  Students from historically underrepresented race/ethnicity groups make up about 45 percent of the enrollment in grades K-12 across the US, but at the high school level, the proportion of students from these groups decreases as the level of science and mathematics increases.  Female students and students from race/ethnicity groups historically underrepresented in STEM each make up fewer than a third of the students in high school computer science classes.\n\n \n\nAbout three-fourths of elementary teachers describe themselves as very well prepared to teach mathematics, but less than one-third feel similarly confident about teaching science.  In part, this result may be due to elementary teachers also having less extensive college coursework in science/mathematics than their middle grades counterparts, who in turn have had less science/mathematics coursework than their high school counterparts.  High school computer science teachers have had little college coursework in their field, with only about one-quarter having a degree in the subject.  In addition, few science teachers, at any grade level, feel well prepared to teach engineering, a key element of the Next Generation Science Standards.  The 2018 NSSME+ also found that well-prepared teachers are not necessarily equitably distributed.  Classes with high proportions of students eligible for free/reduced-price lunch are more likely than classes in more affluent schools to be taught by new teachers.\n\n \n\nProducts from the study, including the main technical report, a large number of more targeted reports, presentations, journal articles, and de-identified data sets available for secondary analysis have been widely disseminated and are available on the project's website:  http://www.horizon-research.com/NSSME/.  The website has been visited more than 19,000 times since the report release, with visitors from more than 100 countries.  According to Google Scholar, the Report of the 2018 NSSME+ has been cited over 100 times already in scholarly work since its release in December 2018.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/26/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Eric R Banilower"
