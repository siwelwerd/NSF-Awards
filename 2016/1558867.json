 "awd_abstract_narration": "As part of the \"ring of fire,\" the western coast of South America is subject to frequent large earthquakes.  This is because the oceanic plate is being thrust under (subducted) beneath the continent of South America.  The high level of activity along the Chile margin makes it an excellent place to study how geologic structure can influence earthquake behavior, knowledge that can be transferred to other subduction zones around the world.  The portion of the Chile margin that ruptured in 1960 seems to produce similar great earthquakes every 100 to 150 years whereas to the north the historical pattern is less regular, with several smaller earthquakes interspersed with occasional larger earthquakes. The goal of this project is to use seismic imaging tools available on the research vessel Langseth to look deep into this margin (up to ~15 km in depth) to characterize the physical properties of the boundary between the oceanic and continental plates that may control how it ruptures. The results will have broad societal impact by informing efforts to evaluate seismic hazards globally. This setting is a good analog to the Cascadia subduction zone off the westcoast of the US, and a better understanding of the Chilean megathrust should lead to more informed hazard forecasts and mitigation plans for Cascadia (and margins around the globe).  The science team for the research cruise will include professors and students from the US and Chile (and possibly other countries) and provide hands-on training in seismic reflection data acquisition and processing. The research cruise will also be an opportunity to reach out both virtually (through student-led blogs) and in person (through ship tours in port) with school children and the general public.  \r\n\r\nThe south-central Chile subduction zone (34-47 degrees S) experienced the largest instrumentally-recorded earthquake (Mw 9.5) in 1960 and the sixth largest (Mw 8.8) in 2010 on an adjacent, overlapping segment to the north. The segment that ruptured during the 1960 event has a history of regular rupture of this entire 1000-km long segment, while the 500-km long segment that ruptured during the 2010 event usually ruptures in smaller (100 km) patches and at irregular intervals.  Good slip models are available for both events as well as a model for interplate coupling leading up to the 2010 event.  Because of the long earthquake history coupled with extensive modern constraints on interplate slip and interseismic coupling, this region is an excellent place to compare the along-strike differences in forearc geologic structure and determine their role in controlling these major along-strike differences in megathrust earthquake behavior.  Several observations and hypotheses have been presented in recent years to explain the different slip behaviors observed in subduction zones globally. Foremost among these is the observation that the largest historic earthquakes (e.g. south-central Chile, Alaska, Sumatra and Cascadia) tend to be in thickly-sedimented subduction zones, possibly because a thick sediment cover leads to a smooth, homogeneous plate-boundary.  This project will obtain seismic reflection data to image the detailed structure of the plate boundary at depth and determine how sediment on the incoming plate interacts with basement topography and whether sediment thickness controls the interaction between the upper and lower plates that leads to great earthquakes.",
