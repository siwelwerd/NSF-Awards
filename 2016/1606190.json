 "awd_abstract_narration": "1606190\r\nGriffith\r\n\r\nGlobally, wastewater can be a significant source of carbon, nutrients, and contaminants to surface waters. Endocrine disrupting chemicals such as steroidal estrogens, which have adverse effects on aquatic vertebrates at low concentrations, are among the compounds which can be in the wastewater. This study will be accomplished through a combination of laboratory, field, and modeling experiments, and will take advantage of previously optimized analytical techniques in the PIs laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe overarching goal of this study is to improve the understanding of the fundamental processes that control wastewater derived sources and the environmental fate of estrogens and halogenated estrogens in aquatic systems. This study has the potential to transform our understanding of estrogen flux from typical wastewater treatment plants that utilize activated sludge secondary treatment and hypochlorite-based disinfection. The objectives of this project use a combination of laboratory, field, and modeling experiments to address: 1) halogenated estrogen formation and distribution in wastewater treatment plant effluent, 2) photolysis and biodegradation at environmentally relevant concentrations, and, 3) fate of halogenated estrogens in a sewage-impacted rivers. The data collected during this project will provide direct numerical inputs into simple mass balance and transport models that will be used to predict estrogen concentrations in the Willamette River, which is representative of many rivers that receive combined inputs from wastewater and storm water. This project will generate kinetic data and transformation product information for a range of estrogen structures that can be used to develop quantitative structure-activity relationships in the future, parameterize existing fate models, and determine the impact on the formation and fate of similar pharmaceuticals and organic contaminants in wastewater and natural waters. The PI and media experts at Mind Open Media will produce and distribute podcasts focused on the concepts and applications of wastewater treatment, and, the fate of chemicals in the environment. The PI will provide the research findings to state entities with a vested interest in wastewater treatment technologies and the health of river systems. Lastly, the project also funds undergraduate students to conduct research at a larger institution where they will be able to utilize the mass spectrometry facilities.",
