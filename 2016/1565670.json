 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the fourth Midwest Women in Mathematics Symposium (WIMS), held April 2, 2016 at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The symposium aims to: (1) recognize and advocate collective achievements by female mathematicians in the Midwest, and (2) stimulate collaborations, networking, and mentoring relations. The meeting builds upon the success of previous symposia to establish the WIMS as an annual event rotating among colleges and universities in the Midwest. The symposium will attract female mathematicians in the Midwest at all stages of their careers; it is expected to draw about 100 participants, in particular, graduate students, early-career researchers, and faculty at small institutions who have limited access to resources enabling them to attend conferences. \r\n\r\nThe symposium will feature two plenary lectures by distinguished senior researchers and eight shorter ones by promising junior researchers. The speakers are chosen to reflect the variety of institutions in the Midwest. Collectively, they will discuss a broad spectrum of cutting edge research. Lectures will be accompanied by open problem sessions, where the participants will work in small groups to discuss field-specific problems and develop new collaborations. Students and recent PhDs will contribute to the intellectual activity of the symposium by making poster presentations. This workshop is jointly funded by eight programs within the NSF Division of Mathematical Sciences: Algebra & Number Theory, Analysis, Applied Math, Infrastructure, Mathematical Biology, Topology & Geometric Analysis, Foundations, and Probability.  More information about the conference can be found at http://www.math.illinois.edu/wims/.",
