 "awd_abstract_narration": "Modern search systems work well when looking for specific information, but do little to support exploratory searches that extend across multiple search sessions and have investigation and learning as primary goals. Current search systems provide few ways for users to capture, re-use, and resume their search efforts, little support for discovering structural information about a topic, and few methods for coordination and knowledge sharing among searchers. As a result, users often begin searches isolated from knowledge about the domain and effective search processes that others have already discovered, and groups working collaboratively on a search must invest considerable manual effort to communicate and coordinate their efforts using channels outside the search system. This research will develop and evaluate novel techniques and interfaces to allow users to capture, save, share, and re-use structured information about search tasks, search processes, and domain information. A central innovation in this research will be the integration of template structures (including lists, hierarchies, two-dimensional grids, and concept maps) into the user interface and underlying search system in order help users save and organize the information they discover. This structured information will then be used by the system to help support the future searches of individuals and groups of users working collaboratively.\r\n\r\nThis research will answer questions about how search systems can incorporate methods to capture, share, and re-use knowledge developed during searches to help improve the future search activities of individuals, collaborating groups, and other searchers working on similar tasks. The research will explore new search algorithms and interfaces that leverage structured information about the search to help users with task resumption, coordination of collaborative efforts, discovery of topic structures, and knowledge sharing. The results will provide insights about users' needs for exploratory searches and how systems can best support them. Specifically, five objectives will be addressed. (1) User studies will be conducted to understand how information structures are naturally created and used in different types of search tasks. (2) An experimental search system will be designed and implemented to support the creation, capture, and use of structured search information to help users with exploratory search tasks. (3) Using the experimental search system, studies will be conducted to understand the benefits of different types of template structures for the purpose of saving information for different types of search tasks (e.g., learning, planning, decision-making, collecting). (4) Additional studies will be conducted to understand how existing structured search information can be used to help support individual users in task resumption, collaborating groups of users in coordinating their efforts, and as a form of search assistance for users working on similar tasks. (5) The final objective of this work will investigate methods for identifying and ranking searches that are related to the current search based on the structured search information and other search interaction data. This research will significantly improve the tools and methods for exploratory and collaborative search, and will provide empirical results to guide future search user interfaces and system development. The outcomes of this project will have substantial transformative impact in helping users to discover new information and topic structures, make sense of the information they find, and build from the prior search efforts of others. Results and software developed as part of the project will be disseminated through papers published in top-tier conferences and journals, and will be made available on the project website (http://ils.unc.edu/searchstructures/).",

Specifically, the project had five objectives: (1) gain insights about how task characteristics influence search behaviors, outcomes, and user engagement; (2) investigate how people organize and structure information they find when doing complex search tasks; (3) design novel search tools to support users working on complex search tasks; (4) evaluate the usefulness of novel search tools; (5) investigate how to support users doing complex tasks that require searching across multiple sessions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we conducted a series of studies to investigate how characteristics of search tasks influence search behaviors, outcomes, and user engagement. We focused on tasks that involved comparing a set of items across a set of dimensions. Our results found that specifying dimensions tended to make a task more difficult and open-ended tasks led to more satisficing. Participants reported higher engagement with open-ended tasks, possibly because they were freer to explore their own interests.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we studied how people organize and structure information they find when doing a complex search task. We identified five common categories of notes that participants made: background information, dimensions of the topic, specific details, information sources, and information to help them resume the task. We observed that people used linear and grouping strategies to organize information and often created lists and hierarchical structures.\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on these results, we developed two prototype tools to assist users with complex search tasks. The first tool, called the Matrix, was designed to support tasks that involved making comparisons. The Matrix tool allows users to organize information in a grid based on items and dimensions of interest (e.g., comparing different cars based on fuel efficiency, price, reliability). To assist users, we developed and evaluated algorithms to recommend information to complete cells in a partially filled matrix. Our results showed that both row and column-based features provided valuable evidence for recommending information. A second tool, called the OrgBox, was designed to support open-ended search tasks that involve learning and understanding (e.g., learn about the effects of Hurricane Katrina). The OrgBox allows users to create user-defined boxes in which they can drag-and-drop (and re-arrange) information they find during their searches. Results of our studies indicated that the OrgBox provided significant support for cognitive and metacognitive activities during the search process as compared to a baseline system that simply allowed participants to take notes in a text document. The OrgBox helped users plan and initiate their search and also helped users organize and synthesize information. The visual display of information in the boxes was beneficial for monitoring task progress.\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we conducted studies to investigate users needs when stopping and resuming searches across multiple sessions. Our research identified real-world reasons for stopping and resuming searches. For example, information found during the search may create new subtasks; or the information found may change the users understanding of the original task. Identifying these stopping and resumption reasons suggest tools and interface features to help users with their multi-session searches.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project made several broader impacts. The results of this project have relevance to the fields of information retrieval, information science, human-computer interaction, and can help inform the design of search systems to help users working on complex tasks. Results from this project have been disseminated through articles published at conferences and journals. Code for the Matrix and OrgBox tools have been made available on the project website. Research methods and techniques developed for this project contribute to the broader understanding of how to investigate and evaluate search tools. The project has also impacted workforce development by training PhD students, post-doctoral researchers, and undergraduate students.
