 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this Noyce Teacher Scholarship and Stipend project is to increase the pool of highly qualified STEM teachers in central Maryland.  Faculty from Montgomery College's STEM divisions as well as the School of Education will work with Montgomery County Public Schools to support two strands of development: the first will include the recruitment and support of 39 STEM professionals as they transition into STEM teaching positions, the second will expand outreach to encourage undergraduate STEM majors to transfer to STEM teacher preparation programs at regional four-year institutions.  The alternative teacher preparation program for career changers involves intensive pre-service training and a teaching internship flowed by a year-long residency.  The project will integrate a variety of elements to address challenges faced by students enrolled in this rigorous course of study, including (a) orientation materials that address the time commitment, (b) increased assessment and feedback to students designed to bolster their self-efficacy and personal confidence, and (c) assignment to field placements with peer partners. \r\n\r\nThe key aspects of the project are designed to respond to an analysis of barriers for transfer students' enrollment in STEM majors after leaving Montgomery College and the retention of career changers in their alternative teacher preparation program, which was supported by a Noyce Capacity Building award.   For community college transfers, a comprehensive plan has been designed to align coursework between Montgomery College and regional 4-year institutions; a strategy meant to strengthen the pool of STEM majors who will be attracted to teaching.  For the scholarship recipients (career changers) everything from the selection process, during which applicants will be pre-screened using results of the Haberman Star Teacher Pre-Screener Assessment to determine if their mindsets are compatible with teaching in high-needs schools, to the training activities are designed to graduate STEM teachers who are both confident and resilient.  Formative and summative evaluation will include the results of assessment of the surveys of program participants, internship supervisors, and mentor teachers and principals as well as teacher performance during the resident year.  Surveys and interviews will also be used to assess self-efficacy of the participants and to identify their best-perceived supports.  Program activities and outcomes will be disseminated through the meetings of the National Association of Community College Teacher Education Programs and the National Center for Education Information, among others.  Manuscripts will be submitted to the Journal of STEM Education and the Journal of the National Association for Alternative Certification.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The overall goal for the Montgomery College Noyce: Excellent Teachers for STEM (MC NEXT STEM) grant program (NSF ID 1555634) was to increase the number and diversity of highly qualified STEM teachers going into the secondary classroom. This Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarships and Stipends Phase I project supported two strands of STEM teacher preparation and recruitment at Montgomery College (MC), a multi-campus, diverse community college in the Washington, DC suburbs of Maryland. The principal investigator for this project was Professor Debra Poese, professor of mathematics and Director of Teacher Education Partnerships at Montgomery College.</p>\n<p>The first strand for this project was designed to broaden and improve the alternative certification pathway at Montgomery College. A primary feature of the grant was to provide $16,000 stipends to STEM professionals who had a baccalaureate or post-baccalaureate STEM degree and were accepted for enrollment in the Alternative Certification for Effective Teachers (ACET) program, a partnership with Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) through the MC Workforce Development &amp; Continuing Education division. The program includes a three-month Teaching Institute and an eight-week internship, followed by a one-year teaching residency in MCPS with full pay and benefits. Following a successful residency year, candidates receive full Maryland teacher certification and continue teaching in MCPS.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Even during the pandemic of 2020 and beyond, the program continued as both our training and the local school system classrooms transitioned to a fully online format. Candidates who had been prepared in face-to-face classrooms now found themselves teaching online, and incoming candidates were trained online with the understanding that face-to-face and hybrid classrooms would be a part of their future as well. The support systems in place and the creativity of program faculty provided an ongoing contribution to the teacher preparation pipeline, particularly in STEM areas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sixteen Noyce Scholars completed their pre-service training and are teaching in MCPS classrooms, providing an ongoing impact on the teaching of mathematics and science courses in our local school system. Each of them brings a wealth of experiences to their students as they have transitioned into the grades 7-12 classrooms they lead. Although the grant funding for stipends will no longer be available, the certification program continues to recruit and train STEM professionals for the classroom.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A key element developed with the support of the Noyce grant project was the inclusion of current classroom teachers as coaches for the new candidates during their initial coursework and pedagogy development. Many of the coaches also are graduates of our alternative certification program and provide both a collaborative support system for the candidates and a realistic window into the classrooms they will lead in the future. Co-principal investigator Dr. Glenda Hernandez Tittle, professor in the School of Education and ACET program coordinator, developed and administers this ongoing coaching program.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second strand for this Noyce grant focused on enhancing pathways into K-12 mathematics and science teaching careers for current Montgomery College students. The primary outcome of this area of the project was the expansion and development of the STEM Learning Assistant (LA) program. Our work in engaging undergraduates in support of STEM learning of both K-12 students and peer undergraduates provides triple benefits: students get support in their learning; the learning assistants develop an appreciation for the impact, joy, and demands of teaching; and the faculty mentors become partners in the work of recruiting STEM teachers.</p>\n<p>Under the leadership of Dr. Carolyn Schick, adjunct professor of chemistry and project manager for this Noyce project, the STEM LA program grew from a dozen to more than 40 participants per semester, across all STEM areas at Montgomery College. At least four LAs have been identified as transferring to Noyce-funded programs to complete their teacher preparation, with two former LAs currently teaching in Montgomery County Public Schools (one in mathematics, one in chemistry.) In addition, multiple LAs have been hired as peer leaders, STEM tutors, transfer ambassadors or in other leadership positions immediately upon transfer based on the skills the program has helped them to develop. These opportunities also serve to stabilize their transfer experience and academic success, increasing completion potential in STEM majors whether in education or not.</p>\n<p>The LA program continues to affect a diverse population of students, both in terms of the LAs and the training they are receiving as they participate in the program, and the nearly 1500 students in STEM classrooms at Montgomery College who are affected by the support of LAs each semester.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/20/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Debra&nbsp;Poese</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1555634/1555634_10414890_1671583648163_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1555634/1555634_10414890_1671583648163_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Scholar at Noyce Poster Session\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1555634/1555634_10414890_1671583648163_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Scholar at Noyce Poster Session\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Scholar Swikrit Manandhar presents on MC NEXT STEM project at Noyce Regional Summit</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Debra Poese</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Debra&nbsp;Poese</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Scholar at Noyce Poster Session</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1555634/1555634_10414890_1671583803732_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1555634/1555634_10414890_1671583803732_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Zoom Course Meeting for Scholars\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1555634/1555634_10414890_1671583803732_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Zoom Course Meeting for Scholars\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">After all face-to-face programming was ended temporarily in 2020, this Noyce project pivoted to online remote instruction as did so many others--the need for teachers was too great to delay.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Debra Poese</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Debra&nbsp;Poese</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Zoom Course Meeting for Scholars</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1555634/1555634_10414890_1671583918349_Picture6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1555634/1555634_10414890_1671583918349_Picture6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"LA Tutoring Session\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1555634/1555634_10414890_1671583918349_Picture6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"LA Tutoring Session\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">LA Jessica (center) offers support for students in a calculus I class as part of her course duties.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carolyn Schick</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Debra&nbsp;Poese</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LA Tutoring Session</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1555634/1555634_10414890_1671584029261_Picture5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1555634/1555634_10414890_1671584029261_Picture5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"LAs at Pedagogy Seminar\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1555634/1555634_10414890_1671584029261_Picture5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"LAs at Pedagogy Seminar\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Learning Assistants at Montgomery College gathered for regular pedagogy seminars to develop their skills and learn about learning.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Carolyn Schick</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Debra&nbsp;Poese</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">LAs at Pedagogy Seminar</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
