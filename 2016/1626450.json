 "awd_abstract_narration": "Recent investigations have shown that spectrally resolved fluorescence microscopy, in conjunction with Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer Spectrometry (or FRET Spectrometry), is an effective technique for uncovering the quaternary structure of membrane protein complexes in living cells. To realize the full potential of this approach and determine the supramolecular structures of protein complexes, as well as their relative concentrations, dynamics and spatial distributions Inside a cell or tissue, one must obtain three pieces of critical information at image pixel level: the concentrations of donor and acceptor molecules, and the FRET efficiency occurring between the two. Acquiring this information necessitates exciting the sample at two distinct wavelengths. Existing laser-scanning microscopes (including confocal, two-photon, and FLIM microscopes) perform two-wavelength excitation scans in a serial fashion. This leads to a long time delay (10-100 s) between the two successive scans on a pixel level. As membrane proteins can diffuse in and out of a pixel within 0.100 s, the two excitations are scanning different molecules, thereby compromising the molecular-level resolution. Furthermore, reducing the number of molecules per pixel requires increased spatial resolution, which is not available using current FLIM, confocal, or two-photon microscope technologies.  Availability of this cutting-edge technology will open up a new avenue of research in cell signaling and provide an untapped source of pharmacological targets, which in turn may improve public health. The design of the instrument will be made available to other researchers, while the instrument itself will be made available for use by interested research groups. We will also partner with US companies to bring this instrument to the market. Besides to impacting the research programs of investigators around the nation and abroad, the proposed instrument will provide exquisite training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate trainees in interdisciplinary research across the boundaries between biology, biochemistry, pharmacology and physics. This instrument also will be used for new education initiatives developed by the PI, which bring practical applications of physical and mathematical concepts to elementary and high school students as well as college freshmen, including underrepresented minorities.\r\n\r\nIn this proposed instrument development project, we will design and construct a two-photon optical micro-spectroscope capable of quasi-parallel excitation of tens of focal spots spread in one or two dimensions, and rapid switching between two different excitation wavelengths. This instrument will present several advantages over existing ones: (1) The parallel excitation of multiple sample voxels will lead to dramatically increased signal-to-noise ratio of 20X to 100X compared with single point-scan microscopes. (2) Spectrally resolved fluorescence will be collected at two excitation wavelengths separated by 10 ms; this switching time is 100-1000X faster than existing technology and will enable the currently unattainable determination of the localization of differently sized oligomeric species together with their size distribution (e.g., monomers, dimers, tetramers) on a pixel level. (3) Finally, this instrument will present both reduced out-of-focus blur and increased axial resolution (by about 2X) compared to existing two-photon microscopes. The dramatic improvement in temporal and spatial resolution as well as data accuracy will provide biologists with a means to determine how protein oligomerization and function affect one another. The multidisciplinary team assembled by the PI is ideally suited to develop and validate this technology, since it combines exquisite technical expertise, facilities, experience with developing and running an imaging facility, and close collaborations between physicists, biologists and other life scientists.",

This instrument joins its predecessor located in the same imaging facility [1] and built by the PI also with NSF funds (Division of Physics, Physics of Living Systems). Some of the key features of the new instrument are: <em>(i) </em>Acquisition of fluorescence spectra at image-pixel level for quantitative analysis of protein-protein interactions using a process of energy transfer between an optically excited and an unexcited fluorescent tag. <em>(ii)</em> The possibility to select between single- and multi-line/spots excitation modes provides acquisition speeds and sensitivity compatible with several fluorescence-based spectroscopies<em>.</em> <em>(iii)</em> Rapid alternation between two pre-selected excitation wavelengths of light (provided by two lasers) on a 10-ms timescale enables full quantitative determination of critical physical and chemical parameters (such as the efficiency of energy transfer between fluorescent tags and molecular concentrations) at pixel level. These features represent orders-of-magnitude improvement in temporal and spatial resolution (i.e., single pixels vs. averages over regions of interest) compared to other instruments either commercially available or developed in other labs.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact.</strong>&nbsp;Over the past few months, and while the construction and testing of the new microspectroscope had been finalized, the facility has been used extensively by several research groups, including that of the PI (Dr. Raicu) and one of the co-PIs (Dr. Popa), as well as faculty from the Departments of Biological Sciences, and Psychology. We expect that the current instrument will not only absorb all the overtime use of the older instrument but will also attract new users interested in its unique capabilities, as it already has. Over the duration of this award, the PI and co-PIs have trained 4 postdoctoral researchers/associate scientists, 14 graduate students, 22 undergraduate students, and 20 high-school students on the use of this technology. Over 25 of these trainees and students are female and underrepresented minorities. In addition, over the past three years, the Down-to-Earth Experimental Physics (DEEP) program introduced eight years ago by the PI together with Mrs. Georgeta Raicu has involved over 40 elementary school students in hands-on physics and biology experiments involving mechanical and electromagnetic waves, both at their schools and at UWM (in the Biophysical Microspectroscopy Facility and the Physics Planetarium).</p>\n<p><strong>R</strong><strong>esearch Products and their Availability. </strong>A user-friendly and rugged version of the instrument and software for its control have been finalized and tested. A photograph of the new instrument at its permanent location is attached to this report. This instrument has already provided us with useful results, which have been incorporated in our published work. We have also produced and tested polyprotein constructs consisting of covalently-bound fluorescent proteins for testing the sensitivity of the instrument and ability to derive the number of molecules in a molecular complex using two different fluorescence-based techniques developed and published by our team [2]. One book chapter [3] and nine peer-reviewed articles [2, 4-11] have been published, while others are in different stages of preparation. One of the published articles [2] has already presented some of the novel design features of the microscope.
