This collaborative study will illuminate the decision making processes in the evolving field of gender-based asylum law. It is especially timely because the legal refugee definition does not explicitly designate gender as a ground for protection, gender-based claims are fraught. \r\n\r\nThe researchers will undertake a study of the largest known repository of immigration court asylum decisions from around the country (more than 760 decisions) housed at the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies of UC Hastings and supplement those with decisions obtained through FOIA requests. They will create an original data set to systematically examine how factors such as case facts patterns and legal precedent affect legal outcomes. This unique study will examine a level of immigration bureaucracy never before studied in this regard.",
