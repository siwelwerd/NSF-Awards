 "awd_abstract_narration": "The workshop will examine the environmental controls on kidney disease in Sri Lanka and posit hypotheses on how these factors interact in the specific hydrologic, geochemical and social environmental settings to produce the current disease crisis. The workshop will take a multidisciplinary team of scientists from the US to Sri Lanka for a week long site field visit to the affected areas in the north central parts of Sri Lanka and gather firsthand information on the epidemic and its environmental context. They will meet with local researchers in universities and other governmental and non-governmental agencies to study and assess the problem. They will conduct two workshops with local experts. The team members will be selected to represent multiple areas of expertise including environmental sciences and engineering, surface and subsurface hydrology, soil science, geochemistry, behavioral sciences and environmental psychology,  geographic information systems, medicine and public health,. The primary goal is to provide expertise on the assessment of the factors that contribute to the epidemic. Having assessed the problem from a broad perspective and discussed the various environmental interactions that could lead to the present set of conditions, the various disciplines will then be well posed to posit research project to multiple agencies to address those parts of the problems amenable to each agency.  This project is jointly funded by GEO/EAR, ENG/CBET and OD/OISE.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will examine the complex environmental processes of hydrology, engineering and agricultural production of Sri Lanka that appear to contribute to the occurrence of widespread kidney disease. There is the consensus that this is a multi-factorial disease related to chronic exposure to arsenic, cadmium and nephrotoxic pesticides. Additional risk factors such as drinking water contamination in shallow wells and the use of pesticides and contaminated triple phosphate fertilizer have also been identified.",

CKDu has been identified as a global health issue in more than a dozen countries in Asia, South America, and the Middle-East. It has been reported that out of these countries, Sri Lanka is the most affected with the highest cases of CKDu patients and mortality rates. The occupations of the affected population vary from country to country, that includes agriculture and port workers, and cattle farming. In Sri Lanka, the disease is primarily affecting male paddy (rice) farmers from low socioeconomic levels. Another common factor in the affected countries is warm climates. Funded through received travel grants from the National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Hydrologic Science Program and the National Institute of Health through National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIHES) the PI travelled to Sri Lanka in 2016 with&nbsp; a team of scientists from US, El Salvador, Cuba, and Belgium with multidisciplinary backgrounds to conduct a set of fact-finding workshops. This 2016 visit included a site visit to an affected community to in the Northern Central Province (NCP) of Sri Lanka to meet with patients and community leaders. The workshops had two primary goals: (1) to gather information from Sri Lankan scientists who are active both in the field and laboratory studies, and (2) to synthesize the gathered knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and explore ideas to develop a research framework to address the epidemic. The PI also visited Sri Lanka with small groups of US scientists in 2017 to meet with University researchers and water scientists from the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), focusing on water as an exposure pathway.&nbsp; The PI also organized a major symposium and a workshop on CKDu at the 17th International Conference of the Pacific Basin held in New Delhi, India in November 2017. The workshop was attended by CKDu researchers from the US, India, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.</p>\n<p>A preliminary set of recommendations are made to address the findings and research questions developed based on the information gathered. A key finding was that the causes of the epidemic are multifactorial with the poor quality of water playing a key role. The drinking water for the CKDu affected farming communities comes from the irrigation canals, shallow regolith water table aquifers recharged by canal seepage and precipitation and from deep-bored wells.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many contributing factors and hypotheses have been presented and discussed in the literature on CKDu in Sri Lanka. These include but are not limited to: arsenic (As) in groundwater from impurities in agrochemicals, cadmium (Cd) from triple superphosphate, fluoride in the groundwater reacting with other ionic constituents in water such as Ca, Na and Mg, genetic links, effect of agrochemicals in hard water, Cd in food, Cyanobacterial toxins, pesticide and pesticide residues, overuse, misuse and abuse of agrochemicals, and dehydration. The suspected environmental exposure pathways are through water (potable water and food) and air (unprotected pesticide spraying).&nbsp; Even though extensive data on water quality have been collected to develop, test and support hypotheses on the role of water on the disease, no systematic investigations have been conducted to identify, study and analyze how pathways develop through the water storage and distribution systems from sources to the receptors where human exposure occurs. The recommendations cover issues related to water,&nbsp; research infrastructure, and new modeling-based methods. The possibility of using a systems-based approach is proposed. This approach allows to understand and identify the most significant causal factors to eliminate them or reduce their impact, how the system as a whole behaves in reducing CKDu risk through various decisions, choices, behavioral and management strategies could be determined. The use of numerical models of the intergraded surface and subsurface systems with the ability to simulate the fate and transport of naturally occurring toxins and agrichemicals and their geo-bio-chemical transformation products is presented. The modeling tools should be designed to incorporate characterization parameters of the surface water storage and distribution system and hydrogeologic data for both the shallow and deep aquifers, water quality data, epidemiological data, and climate drivers in a geographical information system (GIS) framework.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/11/2018<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Tissa&nbsp;H&nbsp;Illangasekare</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImage\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls onePhoto\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation onePhoto\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1638851/1638851_10423752_1536698055758_CommunitymeetingPadaviya--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1638851/1638851_10423752_1536698055758_CommunitymeetingPadaviya--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Meeting with an community affected by CKDu\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2018/1638851/1638851_10423752_1536698055758_CommunitymeetingPadaviya--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Meeting with an community affected by CKDu\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Padaviya, is a village located in Anuradhapura District, in the NCP.
