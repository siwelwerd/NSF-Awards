The Integers conferences serve to bring together mathematicians and students interested in combinatorics and number theory; this will be the seventh such conference. The 2016 Integers conference will place a particular emphasis on the recruitment of undergraduate students, graduate students,  and early-career mathematicians.\r\n\r\nThe conference will include talks on such topics as additive number theory, multiplicative number theory, combinatorial games, Ramsey theory, elementary number theory, and sequences. It will feature three plenary speakers and about sixty additional speakers. In addition to the plenary speakers, a major portion of the funding will support a number of recent REU students, graduate students, and younger faculty. The conference plans to include at least twelve student research talks. It will promote interaction among research mathematicians at all career stages from the talented undergraduate to the internationally distinguished researcher. The proceedings of the conference will be published as a special volume of the journal Integers.",
