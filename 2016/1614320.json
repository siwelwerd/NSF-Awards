 "awd_abstract_narration": "New \"integral field spectrographs\" (IFS) allow astronomers to get spectra of exoplanets, or planets found around other stars. Until now, these spectra have covered wavelengths in the near infrared at 1 - 2 microns. Most gas-giant exoplanets generate their own power that peaks in energy in the thermal infrared at longer wavelengths. This research group has built the world's first thermal infrared IFS. The Arizona Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (ALES) is installed on the 2x8.4m Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. This project will use the ALES to obtain 3 - 4 micron spectra of 10 gas-giant exoplanets. The spectra will be combined with near-infrared spectra in order to compare and contrast the properties of the gas-giant exoplanets, including temperature, the properties of clouds, and different chemistry. This project serves the national interest by significantly advancing our scientific knowledge of the properties of gas-giant exoplanets. The investigators will teach two math classes each year at the Santa Cruz County Jail, so that each year, nine students will get college credit for a college algebra class. They will also talk about their science to the public.\r\n\r\nAdaptive optics integral field spectrographs (IFS) have enabled spectroscopic characterization of directly-imaged exoplanets. These instruments have, however, been limited to near-infrared wavelengths (1 - 2 microns), while the spectral energy distributions of gas giant exoplanets that generate their own spectral signal peak in the thermal infrared (>3 microns). As a result, most directly-imaged exoplanets already have near-infrared spectra, but none has a thermal infrared spectrum. Spectroscopic characterization over a broad wavelength range is critical for determining the bulk properties of extrasolar planets. This project will obtain 3 - 4 micron spectra of a large number of exoplanets, and, in the process, develop a cohesive sample of exoplanet spectra that can be used for comparative planetology. This research group has built the world's first thermal infrared IFS. The Arizona Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy (ALES) is installed on the 2x8.4m Large Binocular Telescope. It provides integral field spectroscopy from 3 - 4 microns at the spectral resolution, sensitivity and contrast levels required to characterize directly-imaged exoplanets. Using ALES, the investigators will obtain 3 - 4 micron spectra of 10 exoplanets, which they will analyze in combination with existing near-infrared data. The broad wavelength coverage will allow them to refine exoplanet atmosphere models by breaking degeneracies between temperature, cloud properties, and non-equilibrium chemistry. The investigators will offer two math classes per year at the Santa Cruz County Jail, resulting in ~9 students receiving college credit for a college algebra class. They will also include public talks on their science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Self-luminous exoplanets and brown dwarfs emit the majority of their light in the thermal infrared (&gt;3 microns).  However, due to challenges of observing through the Earth's bright atmosphere, exoplanet imaging spectrographs tend to be optimized for shorter wavelengths.  We used the ALES exoplanet imaging spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope, along with the traditional spectrographs NIRSPEC and GNIRS at Keck Observatory and Gemini Observatory, to observe 13 exoplanets and brown dwarfs in the thermal infrared (specifically, 3-5 microns).  Our spectra provide a first reconnaissance of the physical and chemical properties of exoplanets in this wavelength range, and also provide empirical examples for planning observations with future thermal infrared facilities, such as the James Webb Space Telescope.  \nIn almost all of our observations, we found that dis-equilibrium chemistry shapes the thermal infrared spectra of exoplanets and brown dwarfs, specifically by decreasing methane and increasing carbon-monoxide compared to expectations for planets and brown dwarfs that are in chemical equilibrium.  We were able to use these dis-equilibrium measurements to calculate the strength of mixing between planet photospheres and deeper atmospheric layers.  Overall, this work paints a picture of gas-giant atmospheres as turbulent and dynamic environments, with a richness that we are just beginning to uncover.  \nA practical implication of our dis-equilibrium measurements is that exoplanets and brown dwarfs are only about 50% as bright as expected in the vicinity of the 4.7 micron CO feature.  For the James Webb Space Telescope this implies that observations that are searching for new exoplanets should avoid this wavelength range, or else they will be less sensitive to low-mass planets than expected. \nWhile ground-based thermal infrared observations are challenging, this work demonstrates that even temperate (~300K) objects are accessible to spectroscopy and high-contrast imaging techniques. Future instrument development projects can be assured that these observations are practical, opening up scientific opportunities to study temperate exoplanets from the ground at the wavelengths where they peak in brightness.\nAs a Broader Impact, the project supported the efforts of multiple graduate students, postdocs and faculty to teach at the Santa Cruz County Jail. 50 inmates participated in Pre-Algebra and College Algebra.  7 inmates received college credit from UC Santa Cruz Extension.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/15/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andrew Skemer"
