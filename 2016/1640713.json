 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports a NIST/NSF workshop focused on basic research associated with measurement science and polymer-based additive manufacturing. Additive manufacturing describes a collection of manufacturing processes that produce parts layer-by-layer, controlled by a computer, and without the use of expensive tools or dies. This manufacturing strategy has been an enabling technology for a large number of existing and emerging applications, and the approach has become widespread in recent years. Additive manufacturing is expected to fundamentally change the nature of advanced manufacturing and revolutionize many areas of research in the 21st Century. In recent years, significant materials research has been focused on additive manufacturing using metals or composites. However, polymers remain an essential material, with broad industry interest, applications, and ability to enable new research. The workshop will therefore address and help realize the full potential of polymer-based additive manufacturing. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will last 1.5 days, and will include thought leaders from industry, government and academe to characterize the current state of the art, summarize the existing roadmapping efforts, and identify technical gaps and basic research needs. Of particular interest is the application of measurement science to polymer-based additive manufacturing. Invited speakers will make presentations regarding the current state of polymer-based AM and existing roadmapping efforts. Breakout sessions will then take place to extract the research needs and future directions of polymer-based additive manufacturing from the participants. The objectives of the workshop are to: (1) review the state-of-the-art in basic research and the existing roadmap in polymer-based additive manufacturing; (2) examine future prospects of polymer-based additive manufacturing and sharing of perspectives on basic research needs; (3) identify  needs, gaps, and challenges, especially as relates to basic research and metrology; and (4) formulate recommendations for basic research initiatives.",

The roadmap addresses the priority challenges for each topic area as illustrated in Figure E-2.
