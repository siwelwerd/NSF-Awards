 "awd_abstract_narration": "SOBRE Mexico - Student Opportunities for Biological Research in Mexico \r\n\r\nThis program will partner students from Central Washington University (CWU) with top scientists from Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico (UNAM) to explore tropical dry forest ecology in a world-class biological field station in western Mexico. Each year, for three years, cohorts of 5 students will spend 8 weeks at Estaci\u00f3n de Biolog\u00eda, Chamela (EBCh) working alongside UNAM and CWU mentors on three general avenues of investigation: 1) interactions in the parasite-host system centered on the agents of Chagas disease (kissing bugs), 2) ecological responses of vertebrates to intense seasonality, and 3) current and future effects of a major coastal highway on ecological connectivity of vertebrates. The world-class facilities and pristine forests of EBCh attract leading scientists from M\u00e9xico and throughout the world to conduct cutting-edge research. This setting will provide an exceptional opportunity for students to develop academic relationships with Mexican scientists and their students, laying the foundation for future collaborations. This program will help build the next generation of internationally-literate scientists by guiding bilingual Hispanic-American students to conduct science, facilitating language and cultural literacy with their non-Spanish speaking peers, and developing the skills, connections, and confidence to pursue careers in the sciences. The program will also create opportunities for CWU faculty to develop collaborations with Mexican scientists and encourage Mexican scholars to visit CWU where they can share their insights, discoveries, and culture with our broader community. \r\n\r\nThe Chamela/Cuitzmala biosphere reserve in western Mexico is surrounded by some of the best examples of seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) remaining in the world. SDTF comprise almost half of the world's tropical forests, representing a larger fraction than rain forests. They provide a set of ecosystem services that rival wet forests, and they harbor a remarkable concentration of endemic species, many of which are threatened or endangered. Despite their importance, SDTFs are among the least studied and most threatened of the world's forested ecosystems and, as a result, are at greater risk than are wet forests. Students will work UNAM's Institute of Biology to investigate the relationships among blood-feeding triatomine insects, the parasite they carry, Trypanosoma cruzi, and the mammals the insects feed on. This work will aid in our understanding of which mammals in SDTF serve as reservoirs of Chagas disease. Other students will track reptiles and amphibians in the forest during the extreme transition from dry season to wet season in July. This research will contribute new insights into how vertebrate ectotherms manage strong seasonality, a defining feature of SDTF. Some students may investigate parrot ecology in SDTF, exploring variation in food and nesting resources for parrots and other cavity-nesting birds. Others will use remote cameras and transect surveys to monitor wildlife activity in the forest and along Mexican highway 200, which bisects the biosphere reserve. Results from this project will be used to guide decisions on how best to minimize habitat fragmentation associated with planned expansion of that highway. Students will be members of a cohesive team working together on ongoing research by our Mexican mentors to address relevant and important issues in the structure, functioning and conservation of SDTF.",

The Chamela/Cuitzmala biosphere reserve, where our program was based, is surrounded by some of the best examples of seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) remaining in the world. From January 2017 to December 2019, cohorts of 5-6 students/year spent 8 weeks/year at Estacion de Biologia, Chamela working alongside UNAM and CWU mentors on research questions related to the structure, functioning and conservation of seasonally dry tropical forests.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In October 2015, EBCh and the surrounding forest were struck directly by Patricia, the strongest hurricane ever measured in the western hemisphere. Our team built on a foundation of pre-hurricane data to assess how the forest responded to, and is recovering from, impacts of the storm. By falling trees and snapping limbs, Patricia's strong winds significantly opened the tree canopy cover and added large quantities of woody debris into the forest understory. We found that these impacts altered the structural and thermal landscape of the forest, a result that has broad implications for forest inhabitants. For instance, the buildup of woody debris on the forest floor and the more open forest canopy caused assemblages of ground-dwelling lizard species to become more homogenous throughout the forest after the hurricane. Wood turtles (<em>Rhinoclemmys rubida</em>) switched from primarily using leaf litter as refugia before Patricia to woody debris as shelters after the hurricane; cane toads (<em>Rhinella marina</em>) exploited the more humid micro-environments of fallen tree trunks as refugia during the dry season. Wood turtles followed more sinuous pathways during foraging to navigate around woody debris, their home ranges became smaller, and their activity times shifted to earlier in the morning. Woody debris also altered the way ephemeral streams collected summer rain and may, in turn, influence amphibians that breed in ephemeral pools that form during the wet season. Climate models predict tropical storms will grow stronger as global temperatures rise, yet our understanding of the impact of hurricanes on tropical forests is limited. Our results highlighted the impact of woody debris on microhabitat use and community structure of ectotherms that inhabit the forest, and will help scientists understand how tropical forests respond to, and recover from, the disturbance of increasingly stronger hurricanes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Student/mentor teams also explored impacts and interactions between people and tropical dry forest organisms, including kissing bugs (<em>Triatoma</em> sp., the carriers of the parasite that causes Chagas disease), golden-cheeked woodpeckers, and the recently discovered Jalisco mud turtle. Other projects included analyzing parasitic interactions among ticks (<em>Amblyomma cajennense</em>) and their vertebrate hosts, drought tolerance of tropical dry forest trees, perceptions by local citizens of research done by scientists at EBCh, and several other projects. IRES participants worked directly with local citizens in neighboring villages to collect data, share discoveries, and conduct outreach activities in local schools. These outreach efforts helped to improve local attitudes, public knowledge, perceptions about conservation of the surrounding tropical dry forests, and fostered greater local support for scientific research at the biological field station.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The world-class facilities and pristine forests of EBCh attract leading scientists from Mexico and throughout the world to conduct cutting-edge research. This setting provided an exceptional opportunity for students to develop academic relationships with Mexican scientists and their students, laying the foundation for future collaborations. By working together to gather, analyze and interpret data, American and Mexican researchers developed a strong spirit of cooperation and collaboration that enhanced the commitment and likelihood of future scientific and intercultural endeavors for both groups.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All of the 18 students who participated  in the SOBRE Mexico program authored or coauthored presentations at professional scientific conferences, many presented several times. Ten were Latinx or African American. Seven participants (so far) are in (or entering) medical or graduate school science programs, 6 (so far) have coauthored peer-reviewed scientific publications. Nearly every student stated that, while sometimes challenging, their time in Mexico was transformative and that their interactions with international scientists and students were a highlight. The overwhelming majority of student participants have maintained (and plan to continue) communication with international scholars with whom they worked in Mexico. Resources leveraged within both CWU and UNAM resulted in far broader participation (over 40 additional students, several faculty, and many local citizens) than the initial 15 CWU students and 4 CWU faculty budgeted within and funded by our NSF IRES grant. By using their Spanish skills to connect with Mexican scientists, and by helping their non-Spanish speaking peers develop stronger intercultural communication, Latinx students in the SOBRE Mexico IRES program were able to use language and culture as a gateway, rather than a barrier, to academic success.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/06/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Daniel&nbsp;Beck</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559447/1559447_10421001_1609565053983_Workingonprojects--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559447/1559447_10421001_1609565053983_Workingonprojects--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Working on projects\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559447/1559447_10421001_1609565053983_Workingonprojects--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Working on projects\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Clockwise from top left: IRES students radiotrack Cane toads; mentors and students develop amphibian pattern recognition system, survey woodpecker territories, and measure drought tolerance of tropical dry forest seedlings</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel Beck</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;Beck</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Working on projects</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559447/1559447_10421001_1609565190766_Workingwithmentors--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559447/1559447_10421001_1609565190766_Workingwithmentors--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Working with mentors\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559447/1559447_10421001_1609565190766_Workingwithmentors--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Working with mentors\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Working with mentors: Clockwise from top left: IRES students radiotrack wood turtles, outfit loggerhead turtle with transmitter, set up weather station; and band birds</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel Beck</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;Beck</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Working with mentors</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559447/1559447_10421001_1609565367894_Publicoutreach--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559447/1559447_10421001_1609565367894_Publicoutreach--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Public outreach\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559447/1559447_10421001_1609565367894_Publicoutreach--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Public outreach\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Public outreach: IRES SOBRE Mexico students work with local school in Francisco Villa to share tropical dry forest research organisms and discoveries, and to invite participation in gathering data.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel Beck</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;Beck</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Public outreach</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559447/1559447_10421001_1609565545715_Paintingmurals--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559447/1559447_10421001_1609565545715_Paintingmurals--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Painting murals\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559447/1559447_10421001_1609565545715_Paintingmurals--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Painting murals\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">IRES SOBRE Mexico program participants work with local schoolchildren to paint murals of tropical dry forest organisms in Francisco Villa, Jalisco</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Daniel Beck</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Daniel&nbsp;Beck</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Painting murals</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
