 "awd_abstract_narration": "The purpose of the Branching Interactive Graphic Stories for Cybersecurity Education (BIGSCE) project is to determine how a technology for creating branching (\"choose-your-own-adventure\") comic book stories, called Comic-BEE, can be used to teach middle school students about cybersecurity. BIGSCE is potentially transformative, informing the development of new approaches to teaching and learning cybersecurity: branching graphic stories can incorporate culturally relevant pedagogy, and therefore have the potential to reach a broader and more diverse body of students. The goal of BIGSCE is to explore how this innovative technology can enhance cybersecurity education, with the following aims. 1) Attract a broad and diverse workforce to the field of cybersecurity, starting in middle school. 2) Use expert-created comics to evaluate a learner's knowledge, skill, and ability in the area of cybersecurity. 3) Deepen students' understanding of cybersecurity challenges and consequences using a comic creation activity. BIGSCE will also contribute new understanding of how to effectively use branching graphic stories as a learning and assessment tool for middle school students.\r\n\r\nBIGSCE will be conducted at a community center in an economically-challenging district in New York state--New Cassel of Long Island. Over a 2-week period, students will read stories created by cybersecurity experts, and then create their own stories about cybersecurity using Comic-BEE, guided by instructors. Learning will be determined by observing students in the classroom, and evaluating the choices that they make in the stories, and the stories that they create. Students will also fill out pre- and post- questionnaires determining their sense of self-efficacy and interest in cybersecurity careers.",

The collaborative team (Stony Brook University and Secure Decisions) developed a 10-day out-of-school curriculum (90 minutes each day) in which students read stories, discussed issues with a cybersecurity expert, and then developed their own branching interactive graphic stories about how cybersecurity experts approach solving a real-world cybersecurity crisis. The process of iteratively developing, pilot testing, and revising this curriculum has advanced knowledge in two domains. First, within the field of cybersecurity, BIGSCE advanced our understanding of how to get middle school students thinking about cybersecurity as a future career. Second, with impact across different fields, BIGSCE advanced knowledge of how storytelling software can be taught to, and used by, middle school students to deepen their engagement and understanding of a subject. (Intellectual Merit)</p>\n<p>Storytelling in BIGSCE was made possible with Comic-BEE, a web application developed by Secure Decisions. This software provides the ability to create, read, and capture results of a branching interactive graphic story. Using Comic-BEE, a cybersecurity expert created a comic showing cyber professionals collaborating to solve a real-world crime. This comic taught the middle school students about various cybersecurity careers and gauged their understanding of cyber concepts. Students then used Comic-BEE to create their own comics showing how they would approach solving another type of cyber crime.</p>\n<p>This curriculum was delivered three different times at the Yes We Can Community Center in North Hempstead to students who are economically disadvantaged and under-represented in STEM. Roughly half of the participants were female, and less than 10% identified as being either White or Asian. Our analysis of the qualitative and quantitative data collected showed that, in general, 1) the students apparently learned something about cybersecurity and careers; and 2) the students showed an increased interest in learning about future careers for themselves, particularly in cybersecurity. In addition to directly benefiting these students, the curriculum developed for BIGSCE has the potential for reaching even more under-represented students.
