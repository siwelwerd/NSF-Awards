 "awd_abstract_narration": "Agricultural intensification is increasing the emissions of ammonia and nitrous oxide that are altering regional atmospheric chemistry and global climate, respectively. The US Corn Belt is one of the five major ammonia hotspot observed by satellites largely from the high density of large cattle and swine operations there.  The emitted ammonia can deposit on soils downwind and this can promote nitrous oxide production. The proposal will integrate measurements and modeling to quantify how ammonia fluxes amplify nitrous oxide emissions in the continental US.  The science will help develop best practices that are sustainable in the future.\r\n\r\nThe research focus on analysis of ammonia fluxes and nitrous oxide exchange at natural and agricultural systems improve the mechanistic understanding model representations of these processes. The proposal focuses on the following tasks: (1) High precision and near-continuous measurement of ammonia at the University of Minnesota Tall Tower Trace Gas Observatory and using the results for model validation of its source transport and deposition; (2) Perform intensive field campaigns to characterize the landscape in the context of bi-directional NH3 exchange. (3) Simulate high-resolution atmospheric Nr deposition using regional and global models for constraining the soil nitrogen cycling and nitrous emissions. The models will be evaluated against the high-density data sets prior to their use for high-resolution regional scale deposition and nitrous oxide emission modeling. The research will test hypotheses that ammonia deposition impacts regional nitrous oxide emissions and determine constrained emission factors for this volatization in regional (continental US) models.",

This synthetic N is subject to biotic and abiotic processes that transform it into a variety of forms that have a profound impact on the Earth-Atmosphere system. Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) is a potent greenhouse gas that also depletes the protective stratospheric ozone layer. Ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) is a chemical of environmental concern that is increasing over many of the world?s agricultural regions including the US Corn Belt. It is a primary precursor of atmospheric aerosols, which adversely affect human health, and is an important cause of premature deaths in the US. Dry and wet deposition of NH<sub>3</sub> downwind of agricultural sources degrade aquatic and natural ecosystem health and reduce plant biodiversity. In this study, we measured NH<sub>3</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>O from a 185 m (600 feet) tall tower at the University of Minnesota Tall Tower Trace Gas Observatory (TGO, see Figure 1) to improve our understanding of how these emissions vary in time and space and to determine how weather, climate, and human activities influence these emissions. We also applied regional modeling techniques combined with observations to estimate the total emissions of N<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3</sub> that are derived from agricultural activities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>How did we study the problem?</strong></p>\n<p>We made near-continuous hourly measurements of N<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3</sub> from multiple sample heights at TGO using laser spectroscopy techniques (see Figure 2). These hourly data were combined with regional models, including the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-CHEM) and the Stochastic Time Inverted Lagrangian (STILT) model, to help us interpret the temporal and spatial variability observed in the data. These techniques allowed us to pinpoint hot spot locations within the US Corn Belt and to help us estimate regional budgets for each gas species. This is a powerful approach as it uses both observations and best modeling practices to constrain the emissions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>What were the main findings and implications? </strong></p>\n<p>The results from our experiments indicate that N<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions are substantially underestimated by state-of-the-art emission inventories. This implies that we have a poor understanding of the processes controlling emissions at fine temporal and spatial scales. This lack of understanding is likely related to biases in key emission factors or the activity data that are used in current inventory estimates. Such large discrepancies between inventories and our atmospheric-based estimates limits our ability to identify and evaluate mitigation strategies. Further, our results highlight that N<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions are sensitive to climate. We found that warmer than normal spring and fall conditions significantly enhanced these reactive nitrogen emissions. This has important implications as it suggests a potential positive feedback link between a warming climate and enhanced reactive nitrogen emissions. Therefore, any mitigation strategy that aims to reduce N<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions from agricultural systems needs to consider the potential impact of warmer and/or wetter conditions on these processes. Our best estimates indicate that more than 20% of the new nitrogen that is added to the US Corn Belt each year is emitted into the atmosphere as N<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3</sub> (Figure 3). Given the global trends in synthetic nitrogen use, we are concerned that N<sub>2</sub>O and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions will continue to accelerate thereby affecting the greenhouse effect, stratospheric ozone depletion, and air quality.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/28/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Timothy&nbsp;J&nbsp;Griffis</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1640337/1640337_10458307_1643388666108_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1640337/1640337_10458307_1643388666108_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"University of Minnesota Tall Tower Trace Gas Observatory\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1640337/1640337_10458307_1643388666108_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"University of Minnesota Tall Tower Trace Gas Observatory\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 1.
