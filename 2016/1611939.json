 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebraic geometry is the study of solutions of polynomial equations. This is a central area of mathematics with a vast range of applications, a small sampling of which includes physics, cryptography, and computational complexity (the design of faster, more efficient computational algorithms). A powerful tool in the subject is Hodge theory, which associates a linear algebraic structure to a set of solutions of a system of polynomial equations. The advantage of this association is that the Hodge structure is often more amenable to computation and analysis than the original set of solutions, while at the same time retaining enough information to yield deep insights into the set of solutions (and the questions that one would like to answer about them). The principal objective of this research project is to develop Hodge theory so that it can be applied to a greater range of problems in algebraic geometry. \r\n\r\nThe project will address a collection of problems in complex geometry and Lie theory that are motivated by Hodge theory. In practice this means that many of the questions concern (generalized) flag manifolds and flag domains, a canonical system of geometric partial differential equations on these spaces (whose integrals are called horizontal submanifolds), and locally homogeneous spaces. In Hodge theory, flag domains arise as period domains, the classifying spaces for polarized Hodge structures; flag manifolds as compact duals of period domains; the canonical system of geometric PDE as the infinitesimal period relation, Griffiths' system of differential equations constraining variations of Hodge structure. The work will include: (1) a generalization of the Satake-Baily-Borel compactification and Borel's extension theorem for locally Hermitian symmetric spaces to a class of locally homogeneous spaces of Hodge theoretic interest; (2) investigation of a conjectural mixed Hodge structure on the characteristic cohomology of the infinitesimal period relation; and (3) initiation of a program to study the extent to which a variation of Hodge structure is determined by its characteristic varieties.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit:  Many familiar and important geometric objects arise as solution sets of polynomial equations.  (One dimensional examples include lines and circles.)  One is often interested in properties of these geometric objects in families.  (For example, one is interested in understanding not just a fixed line, but the family of all lines in the plane.)  Hodge theory associates to each family a \"period map\" that encodes certain invariants of the geometric objects.  This period map has been a powerful tool in the study of certain families.  The work in the project is motivated by the goal further develop Hodge theory to yield analogous applications to larger classes of families. The focus of the project was to understand asymptotic behavior/phenomenon.  (This is what happends \"at infinity.\")  The PI and collaborators made very good progress on this work - see the summary below.\n\nBroader Impacts:  The PI co-supervised (with Ingrid Daubechies) a 2021 PhD thesis work on \"Differential Geometry Tools for Data Analysis\", and began supervising the thesis work of a second PhD student.  The PI supervised a 2020 Bachelors thesis on \"Hodge representations and Calabi-Yau 3-folds\". As Director of Graduate Studies (January 2019 - June 2022) the PI led a ``deep dive'' into the Duke Mathematics PhD program, with particular emphasis on the mentoring and training of graduate students, especially for careers beyond academia. The PI is active in two university programs SPIRE (undergraduate) and UCEM (graduate) that work to recruit and train students from under-represented communities in STEM fields.\n\nTechnical summary: The funded work consists of a collection of projects in complex geometry and Lie theory that are motivated by Hodge theory, and its application to the study of moduli spaces of algebraic varieties.  Most of the applications of Hodge theory to moduli have focused on families of principally polarized abelian varieties and K3 surface; particular emphasis in this project is placed on developing Hodge theory so that it may be applied to study a to a broader class of moduli space, and their compactifications.\n\nSignificant outcomes obtained in the project include:\n\n1.  One of the more ambitious goals of the project is to generalize the Satake-Baily-Borel compactification to arbitrary period maps.  The desired generalization has been reduced to an extension problem of Ohsawa-Takegoshi-type (but without the need for L^2 bounds).  This reduction is made possible by a technical lemma which asserts (i) the existence of period matrix representations on neighborhoods over which the period map is proper, and (ii) strong constraints on the monodromy of the variation of Hodge structure over those neighborhoods.  This lemma is expected to be a powerful tool in future applications.  For example it is anticipated that it will play a key role in the proof (currently work in progress) that those neighborhoods are also pseudoconvex (a hypotheses of Ohsawa-Takegoshi-type extension theorems).  Joint work with Mark Green, Phillip Griffiths and Radu Laza.\n\n2. Classification of the Hodge representations of Calabi-Yau type, and enumeration the horizontal representations of CY 3-fold type. (The \"horizontal\" representations those with the property that corresponding domain satisfies the infinitesimal period relation, a.k.a. Griffiths' transversality, and is therefore hermitian.)  Joint work with Xiayimei Han.\n\n3.  Determination of the Looijenga--Lunts--Verbitsky decomposition of the cohomology for all known examples of compact hyper-K&auml;hler manifolds, and the formulation a general conjecture on the weights occurring in the decomposition, which in determines strong bounds on the second Betti number of hyper-K&auml;hler manifolds.  Joint work with Mark Green, Yoonjoo Kim and Radu Laza.\n\n4. Classification of horizontal SL(2)'s (an invariant associated to period maps at infinity), and the relations between them.  Joint with Matt Kerr and Gregory Pearlstein.  \n\n5. These relations have been applied to study the boundaries of KSBA compactifications of moduli spaces of algebraic varieties.
