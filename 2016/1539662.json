The WSU GeoAnalytical Laboratory is considered an important component of academic geoscience research and research training in North America through the analytical services it provides, most notably for the research community studying volcanic processes. Basic research in this field underpins applications to natural hazards. \r\n\r\nThe XRF facility at WSU is employed in a broad range of geological, environmental science, and archaeological research. Chemical composition is a necessary part of the description of igneous rocks, gives fundamental information about weathering and sedimentary processes, and is growing in application to geoarchaeology. Projects that use data from the instrument include studies of super-eruptions from calderas and large igneous provinces.  Additionally, chemical analysis of Earth surface materials such as sediments, paleosols and archaeological materials feeds the knowledge base for global change science, including past human impacts on the environment. Ensuring a steady supply of trained geochemists and skilled technicians into the national workforce is therefore essential to the future health of society.",
