 "awd_abstract_narration": "With funding from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics & Mechanisms B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Miguel A. Garcia-Garibay of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at the University of California-Los Angeles is establishing new synthetic strategies to transform simple chemicals into more complex, high value substances, by taking advantage of reactions that occur under the high order and rigidity of the crystalline state.  Their strategy relies on the selection of structures that are known to form highly reactive intermediates when activated by the absorption of ultraviolet light.  By executing those reactions in the crystalline state, instead of doing them in liquids, they are able to obtain nearly pure solid products with no need for solvents, catalysts or additional reagents. This project is in the SusChEM portfolio as the reactions do not use solvent and require no energy for the separation and removal of byproducts.  This project provides an excellent multidisciplinary training ground for several students.  Graduate students and summer undergraduates from three partnering Historically Black Colleges and Universities institutions: Howard University, Clark Atlanta University, and Spellman College, are involved.     \r\n\r\nHaving implemented robust strategies to engineer reactions in crystals by selecting stable molecules that generate highly reactive intermediates, this project addresses the solid state photodecarbonylation of hexasubstituted ketones and the photodenitrogenation of triazolines, pyrazolines, and selected aromatic azides.  Radical pairs, biradicals, and nitrenes are generated in the crystalline state in highly exothermic processes from the excited state of the reactants, and their product formation and kinetics are analyzed in detail. In the solid state, radical-radical combination reactions with retention of stereochemistry, and selective nitrene insertions occur.  Photochemical reactions are carried out in well-characterized crystalline phases and their transformations from the solid phase of the reactant to the solid phase of the product are analyzed by thermal analysis and spectroscopic means.  This characterization is done in order to determine the corresponding phase diagrams and the conditions required for clean and efficient reactions.  Detailed reaction mechanisms are explored by taking advantage of structural information available from single crystals X-ray diffraction and kinetic measurements obtained from laser flash photolysis measurements using nanocrystals suspended in water.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe term \"molecular information\" relates to fact that the structure of molecules determines their physical, chemical and biological properties.  For example, the way specific types of atoms are bonded in three-dimensional space defines whether a given molecule can be used as a medicine, a fertilizer, or as an OLED (organic light emitting diode) in an I-phone display.  Similarly, the arrangement of molecules (nucleotides) in DNA encodes information on whether a particular gene will express a healthy protein, or one that is damaged and will be responsible for a particular disease.  In a similar manner, molecular structure information determines the types of chemical reactions that a given molecule may undertake, and also how those molecules may self-organize to form a crystalline solid.  Taking advantage of that, this project relies on structures expected to undergo chemical transformations in their own crystalline state upon exposure to Ultra Violet (UV) light.  These molecules are able to transform from one chemical entity to another in a process that begins with a pure crystalline reactant and ends up with a pure crystalline product, generally going from a simple structure to one that is a more complex.  Reactions in crystals provide an ideal method for the production of complex chemicals under conditions that require no additional reagents, no solvents, no additives, and no purification, constituting an extremely promising platform for the development of a sustainable chemical industry for the production of specialty chemicals.  At the same time, some reactions known to be reversible can be used to change the physical properties of crystals, making them a valuable entry point for the development of functional materials and \"smart solids\". \n\nThe principal outcomes from this project include (a) the exploration of new chemical reactions that can make an impact in the sustainable synthesis of compounds known to be biologically active, (b) the development of a simple method to determine how these reactions occur by measuring their solid state kinetics, or reaction velocities, and (c) a method to carry out these reactions in relatively large scales by taking advantage of flow reactors.  In terms of new reactions in crystalline solids, a new method was selected for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing compounds named aziridines that are known to be part of numerous biologically active structures.  The three-step method relies on (1) a very efficient reaction in solution, (2) crystallization of the resulting substrate, and (3) a highly selective reaction in the crystalline state.  The key consideration in the third step is that the crystalline reactant must be able to brake and make chemical bonds after the absorption of UV light by releasing some of the excess energy at each of reaction step.  In order to understand the factors that determine the efficiency of reactions in crystals we implemented a new method to determine the speed of bond-breaking and bond-making reactions.  The method relies on the use of light in the form of very short lasers pulses to determine the changes that take place in the sample as a function of time, generally within a millionth of a second or less.  While this has been easy to do with liquid samples, it has been very difficult to measure the amount of light absorbed by solid samples because there are many complications due to optical processes, such as reflection, scattering and others.  To solve those challenges we take advantage of crystals that are about a tenth of a millionth of a meter in size and we suspend them in water with the help of a detergent.  Under these conditions, small crystals approach the size of large molecules and it becomes possible to carry out a quantitative analysis of light absorption and transmission.  The third part of this project takes advantage of the same nanocrystalline suspensions, but with a very high loading, to carry out reactions in crystals in very large scales by taking advantage of flow UV-light reactors. We have been able to show that these photochemical reactions are extremely selective and remarkably clean and can be carried out in very large scales. \n\nStudents and post-docs participating in this project became experts in organic synthesis, organic photochemistry, transient spectroscopy, single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction measurements and interpretation, solid state NMR, thermal analysis, and computational methods.  Our research team is very diverse in a supportive environment that fosters intellectual development and creativity.  Seven graduate students and two postdoctoral fellows participated in various aspects of the projects sponsored by this grant and contributed with outreach activities with local community colleges and nearby undergraduate institutions.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/10/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Miguel A Garcia-Garibay"
