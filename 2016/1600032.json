 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tensor triangular geometry, the theme of this research project, bridges a large class of specialized areas of mathematics, including stable homotopy theory, algebraic geometry, modular representation theory, motivic theory, and noncommutative topology.  Tensor triangular geometry promises to serve as an overarching theory that facilitates the transposition of techniques and methods from one specialized area to neighboring ones, providing conceptual unification among those fields. Moreover, it displays steadily expanding influence in mathematics. For instance, via tensor triangular geometry, the subject of \u00e9tale topology in modern algebraic geometry now bears new applications in modular representation theory, where it provides answers to longstanding problems about the relations between representations of finite groups of order a power of a prime number and representations of arbitrary general finite groups.  This research project aims to broaden and deepen understanding in the field of tensor triangular geometry.\r\n\r\nThis project studies the geometry of tensor-triangulated categories as they appear in several areas of mathematics. Tensor-triangulated categories are now in common use in algebraic geometry, in modular representation theory, stable homotopy theory, and its equivariant versions, in motivic theory, in equivariant noncommutative topology, and beyond. This project aims to develop new methods in tensor triangular geometry, in order to study those many different incarnations from a unified perspective. In recent years, much progress has been made in \u00e9tale extensions (i.e., separable and commutative extensions) of tensor-triangulated categories and on the related theory of descent. The present project builds on these and related results and aims to apply descent to connect the algebraic geometry of projective support varieties with the modular representation theory of finite groups. Some applications of these techniques can be spelled out in concrete terms without tensor-triangular technicalities. For instance, in work on endotrivial modules the investigator introduced \"weak homomorphisms.\" It appears that the very same weak homomorphisms are connected to complex line bundles on the Brown simplicial complex of p-subgroups. Further investigation of their role in algebraic geometry is part of the current project. Another general theme of the project is the computation of the \"spectrum\" of a tensor-triangulated category. A new general approach for such computations comes through filtering tensor-triangulated categories and understanding the successive strata via \u00e9tale extensions. An early prototype of this method has been applied to compute the spectrum of the equivariant stable homotopy category of a finite group. The project aims to transport those ideas to new examples.",
