 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program supports work by Professor Kristina H\u00e5kansson and her group at the University of Michigan to explore new approaches to characterizing biomolecules using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) - a powerful and sophisticated analytical tool.  Specifically, the team has developed \"negative ion electron capture dissociation (niECD),\" a new approach to probing the structure of molecules.  Their research aims to improve understanding of the fundamental mechanism of niECD, and to expand its applications to new classes of molecules that are difficult to characterize with conventional MS/MS approaches, with important implications for drug discovery and enhanced understanding of the molecular basis of living organisms.  The work is providing training of graduate students in an interdisciplinary environment as well as participation in a K-12 Summer Program \"Girls in Science and Engineering\" offered by the University of Michigan's Women in Science and Engineering Program.  The latter activities are aimed at boosting interest in the scientific method at a young age through the discovery that the contents of a box can be elucidated without opening it.  \r\n\r\nThis research seeks to explore the compatibility of niECD with a wider range of analytes that are difficult to characterize with conventional MS/MS approaches.  Goals include investigation of a proposed zwitterion mechanism for the counter-intuitive niECD process, which results in charge-increased rather than the typical charge-decreased species in other ion-electron reactions, as well as further optimization of niECD for compatibility with liquid chromatography.  Continued development of niECD will allow access to novel means for detailed structural characterization of important low-level acidic biomacromolecules such as phospho- and sulfopeptides, intact acidic proteins, cross-linked proteins, and RNA-small molecule complexes.  Educational activities are aimed at boosting interest in the scientific method at a young age among htose underrepresented in science and engineering.  The broader impact of the research includes introduction of novel technology for biomolecular structural characterization with important implications for drug discovery and an enhanced understanding of the molecular basis of living organisms.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award by the Chemical Measurement and Imaging (CMI) program supported work by Professor Kristina Hakansson at the University of Michigan to improve our ability to characterize the chemical structure of large biological molecules, e.g., proteins.  Such structural analysis is essential to help us understand the function (and malfunction) of molecules in complex samples, e.g., biofluids, cells, and tissues.  The Hakansson approach employs the attachment of electrons to gaseous anions (negatively charged molecules), inducing diagnostic fragmentation of the target molecule in a process termed negative ion electron capture dissociation (niECD).  Adding electrons (which bear a negative charge) to anions (which also are negatively charged) is challenging, due to charge repulsion.  Having developed this method, Dr. Hakansson worked to improve our understanding, improve the efficiency, and broaden the applicability and availability of niECD.  Students involved in the research gained exposure to highly interdisciplinary research.  Dr. Hakansson also worked to bring appreciation for these concepts and for broader STEM opportunities to middle school students in an effort to boost interest in the scientific method at a young age.\n\nBecause niECD occurs inside a mass spectrometer that operates in the gaseous phase, insights into the gaseous structures of molecules undergoing niECD is of great interest.  A notable result from the research is that niECD efficiency is higher for more compact structures.  The researchers explain this finding based on generation of a hydrogen radical when an added electron recombines with a positively charged (protonated) site in the overall negatively charged molecule.  This hydrogen radical can reach more sites in the molecule in a compact structure whereas a more open structure allows the hydrogen radical to leave and thus have no effect.  niECD is particularly valuable for molecules that do not readily form positively charged ions.  The researchers also explored the effectiveness of niECD for new classes of molecules, including sugars (carbohydrates) that often carry acidic groups that prefer to be negatively charged.  Contrary to previous preliminary results, niECD was found to be highly suitable for generating detailed structural information for carbohydrates, including unique fragmentation that is typically absent in other approaches.  \n\nThe niECD reaction requires highly specialized equipment, including a strong magnetic field provided by a superconducting magnet, which is expensive.  Thus, the researchers are working towards implementing niECD in more commonly available mass spectrometers.  While this work is ongoing, the team also sought to develop alternative approaches to using more straightforward electron irradiation of positively charged molecules, even for molecules that prefer to be negatively charged.  They showed that introduction of so called \"supercharging\" reagents was effective in this regard.  In another alternative approach for positively charged molecules, derivatization with a specific chemical group that can leave behind an unpaired electron upon fragmentation was also shown to be successful as long as the kind of positive charge (i.e., mobile proton vs. sequestered proton vs. metal ion) was carefully controlled.  Thus, the research provided several new approaches to biomolecular structural characterization with important implications for drug discovery and enhanced understanding of the molecular basis of living organisms. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/23/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kristina Hakansson"
