 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will create a community at Boise State University to germinate transformative research ideas and questions to address critical societal needs by Aligning Stakeholders and Structures to Enable Risk Taking (ASSERT). This community will germinate, cultivate, and celebrate transformative research ideas and questions among all academic ranks.  This will be achieved by improving the academic structures, addressing the cultural issues at the university that inhibit academic risk taking, and supporting the personal development of individual faculty to facilitate their readiness to conceive transformative research ideas. ASSERT will encourage and coach faculty to take risks in order to tackle large societal issues in their research. The plan includes three components aimed at creating an ASSERTive community: (a) create a learning framework for a cohort of faculty who are at various stages of their careers and who are in danger of not taking risks in their research strategies for a spectrum of reasons; (b) address the structural and cultural issues at the university in order to create a more nurturing environment that encourages faculty to take strategic intellectual risks in their research; and (c) work on a sustainability plan within Boise State that expands the program to other research teams while also creating guides for other universities. \r\n\r\nThis project will enable necessary conversations about university policies (such as tenure and promotion, funding of student research, and rewarding team science and intellectual risk taking) to the forefront at Boise State. It will have an immediate impact on the research environment and infrastructure on campus, at all levels.  Students will have access to projects that cross disciplines and will be led by intellectually vibrant mentors. This will create a pathway to a future of researchers who are excited and inspired about doing science. By addressing the culture within the academic departments and the personal development of the participants through retreats, workshops, and one-on-one coaching, this project will be creating a community of faculty who are willing to tackle large societal questions in their research portfolios.",

Throughout the award period, the cohort participants also kept a journal about what they learned and what their reactions were to the study. These journals helped us measure both individual and collective faculty trajectories throughout the award period, feeding into our pre- and post-assessment of the project. Upon completion of the award period, the experiences created and lessons learned from this grant have been shared, as well as picked-up by multiple academic units at Boise State University including the Department of Biological Sciences, Department of Geosciences, the Micron School of Materials Science &amp; Engineering, Department of Mechanical and Biomolecular Engineering, and the English Department. The result is that faculty and administrators alike are now piloting a Center for Transformative Research at Boise State University. As an extension of this award, the pilot Center is: (1) providing professional development for research-active faculty; (2) aligning university structures to support the germination of transformative research questions and ideas among the participants; and (3) beginning&nbsp;the longitudinal tracking of participants to measure the long-term impact of their program. In doing so, Boise State University is testing a scalable platform for supporting faculty to ask transformative research questions, and to better understand the current funding landscape for promoting bold ideas.
