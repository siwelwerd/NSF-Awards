The proposed research will enable scientific advances in understanding the key factors limiting the performance of an emerging class of electronics materials that is two-dimensional molybdenum disulfide. These materials may find applications in next-generation wearable electronics, which has far reaching applications from health monitoring to security. For these materials to become commercially viable, it is necessary to develop large-area growth techniques. Therefore, there has been an increased research activity to produce device-quality molybdenum disulfide. However, the electronic properties of those materials still need significant improvements. TMD-based technology will be transformative in the development of advanced wearable devices. The broader impacts of this proposal also include training of students in important scientific areas and providing them with expertise in device physics, nanofabrication, and analysis methods.  \r\nTechnical :\r\nThe overall goal of the proposed research is to enable an in-depth understanding of the interplay between the process parameters and the electrical characteristics of molybdenum disulfide materials and devices. We will systematically explore the origin of device performance degradation in molybdenum disulfide transistors due to the growth process and contacts using advanced material and device characterization techniques. Specifically, this research aims at advancing the field of two-dimensional materials toward their widespread deployment for large-area device applications by pursuing two research goals: (i) in-depth understanding of the effect of various growth parameters on the electronic properties of molybdenum disulfide, and (ii) systematic engineering of contacts in molybdenum disulfide devices to significantly enhance electron injection into the channel from the contacts.",
