 "awd_abstract_narration": "This INSPIRE project is jointly funded by the Experimental Nuclear Physics and the Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics programs in the Physics Division, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program in the Chemistry Division (both Divisions are in the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate of NSF), and the Office of Integrative Activities. The award supports the discovery and development of a technique to detect and uniquely identify one barium atom in five tons of liquid xenon using novel methods of laser spectroscopy.   The ultimate goal is the discovery of a rare radioactive decay, called neutrinoless double-beta decay, of the isotope 136Xe.  The proposed single-Ba detection technique would make the experimental search for this decay significantly more sensitive.  A discovery of this decay would show that neutrinos are the same as anti-neutrinos.  This would fundamentally change our view of the elementary components of matter and would potentially contribute to an understanding of why there is more matter than anti-matter in the universe.  Instruments and methods developed in this project may be relevant to the kinds of matrix isolation experiments used in chemistry.   The proposed work also has very important educational and outreach components, as it connects high school teachers to state-of-the-art research.  \r\n\r\n\r\nA major breakthrough in detecting barium atoms in solid xenon at the single atom level has recently been achieved. Continued interdisciplinary research will be supported in which individual atoms of Ba will be imaged by laser-induced fluorescence while trapped in a matrix of solid Xe grown first on a sapphire window and then at the end on an optically accessible probe.  Research on grabbing and detecting Ba atoms on a probe from liquid xenon is also planned.  The ultimate goal of the work is to capture and detect a single 136Ba daughter of neutrinoless double-beta decay of 136Xe, advancing what may be the ultimate background suppression method for ton-scale experiments. The possibility afforded by this technique is unique to 136Xe and, coupled to a second phase of the nEXO detector, could substantially improve its sensitivity beyond 10^28 year half life, allowing the exploration of part of the normal hierarchy regime of neutrino mass.  The observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay answers a grand challenge in nuclear physics, whether or not 2-component Majorana fermions exist in Nature.  This may shed some light on the puzzling fact that neutrinos have a finite mass and yet they are so much lighter than all other known particles. In addition the observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay would provide a measurement of the neutrino mass scale and demonstrate the first case of lepton number violation.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe search for a rare and yet undiscovered type of radioactive decay, neutrinoless double beta (0nbb) decay, probes a fundamental question about tiny neutral elementary particles called neutrinos: is the neutrino the same as its antiparticle, the antineutrino, or is it not.  The current model of elementary particles considers them to be distinct.  The discovery of 0nbb decay would indicate that they are the same particle.  To date, 0nbb decay has not been found at decay half lives up to 1026 years.  To probe 100x more sensitively, tons of isotopically enriched material is required, and in ~10 years of operation only a small number of candidate decays might be found.  In this research project major breakthroughs have been made in developing a novel technique to distinguish actual 0nbb decays of isotope 136Xe from false candidate events because each 0nbb decay produces a 136Ba daughter atom at the decay site.  This capability would expand the 0nbb decay sensitivity beyond the 1028 year half-life level.  The challenge that this project has addressed is finding a way to detect one Ba atom at a particular decay site in ~5 tons of liquid xenon.  The concept is to freeze the atom in solid xenon on a cryogenic probe window and then scan it to find the one Ba atom or ion located therein.\n\n \n\nSeveral major breakthroughs have been achieved.  For the first time ever, a single atom in a transparent noble gas solid has been imaged.  As a laser is scanned across a solid xenon layer with widely separated Ba atoms, there is little fluorescence until the laser hits a Ba atom and a large increase in fluorescence is observed.  A composite image of fluorescence vs. laser position allow one to count the number of fluorescing Ba atoms in a scan region.  This work demonstrates the fundamental principle of the ?Ba tagging? concept, imaging and counting single Ba atoms in solid Xe, and was published in Nature.  Interesting physical phenomena that these single Ba atoms display were also discovered: sudden fluorescence turnoff after 20-600+ seconds and, in some cases ?blinking? of the fluorescence.  These Ba atoms are in a single vacancy site in solid Xe.  Ba atoms in a 7-vacancy site have also been imaged.  Another breakthrough in this project is spectroscopy of Ba+ ions in solid xenon and fluorescence detection at the few ion level.  This sets the stage for single Ba+ ion imaging.  A very important discovery made in this work is that only the Ba atoms captured in the solid xenon produce a fluorescence signal.  There is no significant fluorescence from any stray Ba preexisting or remaining on the window from a previous deposit, even a large Ba deposit, that has been evaporated.\n\n \n\nMuch work on capturing Ba atoms and ions from liquid xenon into solid xenon on a cryoprobe has been done.  Experiments have been performed with three different generations of cryogenic probes, from an adapted medical cryoblation probe to a liquid-nitrogen cooled probe.  Raising of a collected solid xenon sample out of liquid xenon to a region where the solid xenon could be scanned has been demonstrated successfully.  Pressure changes that occur when the Xe gas volume above the liquid expands as the probe is raised have been studied and understood.  First spectra of Ba atoms captured from liquid Xe into solid Xe have been observed in the upper observation region.  These are important milestones toward the method of Ba daughter capture and identification.\n\n \n\nThe members of the Ba tagging group have participated in the EXO-200 and nEXO neutrinoless double beta decay collaborations.  This work included shifts operating the EXO-200 experiment at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico and an analysis of EXO-200 data to look for hypothesized triple nucleon decays.  In addition, the group members were co-authors of many EXO-200 and nEXO publications.\n\n \n\nThe broader impacts of this work in education and workforce development include training of five graduate students, two of which have completed PhD degrees and one a MS degree and have entered the workforce in industrial and academic positions, and practical professional experience for two high school teachers who worked summers in our laboratory.  Outside the neutrino physics field, strong interactions have been developed with experimental chemists and theoretical physicists and chemists who study and calculate the properties of atoms in noble gas matrices.  They have contributed complementary spectra and theoretical understanding of the local environment of Ba atoms in the solid xenon matrix.  Our group is unique in the world in the field of matrix isolation spectroscopy in that we are the only ones to date working at the single atom level.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/16/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William M Fairbank"
