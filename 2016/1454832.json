 "awd_abstract_narration": "In Einstein's theory of general relativity classical spacetime ends at the singularities. Examples include the Big Bang singularity in cosmological models and the central singularity of the black hole spacetimes. At these events the spacetime curvature and tidal forces become infinite. Classical evolution stops. It has been hoped that quantum gravitational effects will provide insights on resolution of this fundamental problem. This Faculty Early CAREER award supports research towards answering various questions related to quantum gravity and resolution of singularities in cosmological and black hole spacetimes. The research carried out in this project will use techniques of loop quantum gravity. A primary objective will be to establish generic properties of quantum spacetime in presence of anisotropies and inhomogenities, and extract reliable phenomenological and observational predictions. The educational and outreach objectives of this project are designed to address a wide audience. The project aims to enhance the scientific enrichment of K-12 students via a public lecture series and science exhibitions and demonstrations. Active engagement techniques will be used to revamp undergraduate and graduate courses. Undergraduate and graduate students will also receive training through research activities.\r\n\r\nDetailed implications of the singularity resolution on the physics in different models will be explored. The project aims to significantly broaden and advance our current understanding of the physics of quantum gravity. Research explorations will include (i) systematically investigating the quantization and resulting physics of different spacetimes including anisotropies, inhomogenities in Gowdy models and Schwarzschild black holes, (ii) extracting phenomenological implications by analyzing effects of quantum gravity on cosmological perturbations, and (iii) addressing fundamental issues in quantum cosmology using consistent histories approach. Numerical techniques developed in this project will also lead to fresh insights on results in the classical gravity, such as on the structure of spacetime near classical singularities.",
