 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, acquiring a versatile Optomec Aerosol Jet 300 (AJ 300) printing system for flexible electronic circuits and printable nanomaterials based chemical/biological (CB) sensors, supports current and future initiatives in additive manufacturing and material development. Flexible electronics and printable nanomaterials based CB sensors are highly desired in many applications, particularly those that require or may benefit from flexible substrates. In addition to low cost, flexible electronics offers light-weighted, thin-film electronics circuits capable of adhering on flexible and conformal surfaces. Such technology is expected to bring revolutionary changes to the current landscape of electronics, including thin-film cell phones, window-stickable thin-film TV, and functional clothes or removal skin stackers with various sensing, memory and communication capabilities. However, current development of flexible electronics is limited by the lack of fundamental knowledge of carrier transportation properties on flexible surfaces and the impact of bending and strain on circuit performance. In addition, there is no effective fabrication system capable of uniformly delivering materials on flexible substrates with high resolution and multi-layer alignment accuracy. The requested state-of-the-art system is expected to provide new capabilities to promote interdisciplinary research and education. The acquisition of the AJ 300 printing system should greatly enhance the collaborations of different projects through the sharing of the printer among cutting-edge, cross disciplinary researchers since flexible electronics, nano-materials, high rate nano-manufacturing, and chemical and biological sensors form part of the signature research programs of the institution. The system would provide an unprecedented opportunity for the education of flexible electronics and all the areas addressed with hands-on training opportunities in a minority-serving university. The proposed 3D printing system will serve as a key component to recruit and grow enrollment in STEM disciplines. Through the integration of discovery research into educational and outreach activities, the retention rate should most likely increase. Moreover, the instrument enables development and implementation of integrated classroom teaching and research. The AJ 300 printer also provides new opportunities for and collaborative research with other universities and industries for technology development and transfer for commercialization\r\n\r\nThe instrumentation, an additive, high-resolution multi-layer printing system capable of uniformly delivering fluid and nano-materials on almost any planar substrate or 3D surface with precise multi-layer alignment accuracy, enables the PIs to perform systematic research on fundamental issues of flexible electronics, such as carrier (electrons and holes) transport on flexible surfaces, and circuit performance variation under bending and strain due to changes in the band structure, Fermi-level, carrier mobility, and threshold voltage. The knowledge obtained through systematic research will form a solid base for the development of flexible electronics, particularly for accurate modeling and design of flexible electronics. The AJ 300 printing system also provides a research platform for various flexible electronics and optoelectronics devices such as conformal antenna, highly ordered self-assembling polymer/clay nanocomposite, Terahertz radiation and detection, and additive manufacturing. It can also function as a test printing system for the printable nanomaterials development and printable nanomaterials based CB sensors, including nanomaterial engineering, synthesis, and process development as well as large-scale cost-effective CB sensor fabrication and integration. Furthermore, the instrumentation would support research in scaling and integration of direct printing and investigate the couplings between the deposition of the droplets, formation of the composite structure, and device performance.",
