And while the mechanical and biological pretreatment routes are largely well understood, substantial uncertainty remains in how to chemically pretreat biomass to enable further processing. The goal of this collaborative project is to advance multiscale models of molecular solvation to better understand dissolution of cellulosic biomass in ionic liquids. Ionic liquids are an important class of materials, which have a broad spectrum of applications. The project will (i) apply multiscale solvent models to ionic liquids; (ii) establish the use of X-ray solution scattering experiments to validate multiscale models; (iii) apply these models to understand why small concentrations of dissolved water limit cellulose dissolution; and (iv) integrate research with education and outreach efforts to advance cross-disciplinary training and broaden STEM participation.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will elucidate the fundamental relationships between ionic liquid structure and performance, and how these relationships depend on temperature and water content. These dependencies are key to enabling the rational engineering of ionic liquids for robust performance during chemical processing in ionic liquids. The computational techniques that will be developed will link the microscopic details with macroscopic behavior using a novel multiscale approach that drastically reduces the computational costs associated with atomistic molecular dynamics and coarse-grained simulations. By reducing the number of atoms present in the system, the cost of calculating electrostatic forces, the dominant cost in molecular dynamics simulations of charged systems, will be greatly reduced, allowing for much larger and longer simulations with the same set of available computational resources. This approach will allow for much more in-depth studies of the interactions between ionic liquids and cellulose than is currently possible. The ultimate objective is the identification of the dominant criteria for selecting ionic liquids that will enable the design of more economical and more efficient chemical processes for cellulose dissolution.",

The multiscale method solves long range electrostatics with boundary element solutions of Poisson-Boltzmann theory using a solvation-layer interface boundary condition (SLIC). SLIC incorporates the effects of solvent shape asymmetry and polarizability that can be determined unambiguously from atomistically-detailed, molecular simulation. The multiscale approach also accounts accurately for &nbsp;hydrogen bonding, London dispersons and cavity formation. For the first time experimental solvation Gibbs energy, entropy and heat capacity are predicted accurately without temperature-dependent parameters. The model has been validated with the largest dataset assembled for solutions of simple small molecules as well as ionic liquids. We demonstrated that the SLIC theory solved with the boundary element method can accurately model biological membrane deformation mechanics using explicit forcefield partial charges without having to postulate a phenomenological continuum elastic energy. The method enables the accurate simulation of square microns of phospholipid bilayers with atomistic precision in orders of magnitude less time and resource complexity than all known methods published to date. This new computational method is also developed to design antibiotic nanoparticles. Solvation theory has also been applied to provide mechanistic insights into the role of water on high strength fiber softening and to provide insights into the solubilization of novel two-dimensional polymers.</p>\n<p>There were several broader impacts resulting from this award.
