Theory and modeling are having a major impact in changing our understanding of molecular biophysics. The quantity and quality of new data being created cannot be understood and interpreted as in the past. Understanding and modeling of all this information requires an interdisciplinary integration with theoretical approaches stemming from the physical sciences. More importantly, starting from modeling, one can begin to search for underlying processes governing complex biological processes that have the potential to lead to theories in biology.\r\n\r\nThis workshop will produce a document that should help the National Science Foundation to guide science at the interface of the biological and physical sciences and provide guidelines for continued support of transformative research in this field over the next 25 years. The attendees include scientists in the forefront of the field including members of underrepresented groups.",
