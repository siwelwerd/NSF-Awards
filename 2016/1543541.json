 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Ross Sea region of the Southern Ocean is experiencing growing sea ice cover in both extent and duration. These trends contrast those of the well-studied, western Antarctic Peninsula area, where sea ice has been disappearing. Unlike the latter, little is known about how expanding sea ice coverage might affect the regional Antarctic marine ecosystem. This project aims to better understand some of the potential effects of the changing ice conditions on the marine ecosystem using the widely-recognized indicator species - the Ad\u00e9lie Penguin.  A four-year effort will build on previous results spanning 19 seasons at Ross Island to explore how successes or failures in each part of the penguin's annual cycle are effected by ice conditions and how these carry over to the next annual recruitment cycle, especially with respect to the penguin's condition upon arrival in the spring.  Education and public outreach activities will continually be promoted through the PenguinCam and PenguinScience websites (sites with greater than 1 million hits a month) and \"NestCheck\" (a site that is logged-on by >300 classrooms annually that allows students to follow penguin families in their breeding efforts).  To encourage students in pursuing educational and career pathways in the Science Technology Engineering and Math fields, the project will also provide stories from the field in a Penguin Journal, develop classroom-ready activities aligned with New Generation Science Standards, increase the availability of instructional presentations as powerpoint files and short webisodes.  The project will provide additional outreach activities through local, state and national speaking engagements about penguins, Antarctic science and climate change. The annual outreach efforts are aimed at reaching over 15,000 students through the website, 300 teachers through presentations and workshops, and 500 persons in the general public. The project also will train four interns (undergraduate and graduate level), two post-doctoral researchers, and a science writer/photographer. \r\n \r\nThe project will accomplish three major goals, all of which relate to how Ad\u00e9lie Penguins adapt to, or cope with environmental change. Specifically the project seeks to determine 1) how changing winter sea ice conditions in the Ross Sea region affect penguin migration, behavior and survival and alter the carry-over effects (COEs) to subsequent reproduction; 2) the interplay between extrinsic and intrinsic factors influencing COEs over multiple years of an individual?s lifetime; and 3) how local environmental change may affect population change via impacts to nesting habitat, interacting with individual quality and COEs. Retrospective analyses will be conducted using 19 years of colony based data and collect additional information on individually marked, known-age and known-history penguins, from new recruits to possibly senescent individuals. Four years of new information will be gained from efforts based at two colonies (Cape Royds and Crozier), using radio frequency identification tags to automatically collect data on breeding and foraging effort of marked, known-history birds to explore penguin response to resource availability within the colony as well as between colonies (mates, nesting material, habitat availability).  Additional geolocation/time-depth recorders will be used to investigate travels and foraging during winter of these birds. The combined efforts will allow an assessment of the effects of penguin behavior/success in one season on its behavior in the next (e.g. how does winter behavior affect arrival time and body condition on subsequent breeding). It is at the individual level that penguins are responding successfully, or not, to ongoing marine habitat change in the Ross Sea region.",

We chose a metapopulation of 4 colonies on Ross and Beaufort islands that together comprise 8% of this species' world population and range in size by three orders of magnitude: Cape Crozier (~250,000 pairs) to Cape Bird and Beaufort Island (~60,000) and Cape Royds (~2,000). The Crozier colony doubled in size during our study, is still growing (as is Cape Bird) and is now likely the largest for this species (Fig. 1). We compared the reproductive and foraging effort and success of penguins of known age and history at these colonies and continue to estimate and model vital rates (Fig. 2). A sub-goal has been to determine the longevity of this species, and the possible influence of senescence on life history, and we propose herein to continue toward this goal. While the current longevity record is 20 y, a number of individuals banded 19 y ago are still breeding, about to equal that previous limit. We also found that a small minority of breeders are always successful, and have been attempting to figure out why, but realize we still have much more to learn. Finally, we hypothesize that we are seeing effects of the growing sea ice season and extent documented for the Ross Sea region of the Southern Ocean on Adelie penguin demography, as well as perhaps effects of removing a main predator (adult toothfish) and wish to explore this question further.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Based on a retrospective analysis of colony-size data, it appeared that changes in sea-ice extent and especially prevalence of the Ross Sea Polynya, as a function of climate factors, was responsible, in part (30% variation explained), for the population trends during the 1980s. However, we subsequently concluded that the extraction of 15,000 minke whales (direct competitors of penguins) from the Ross Sea sector during the 1970-80?s was likely contributing to the penguin increase. As the whale population recovered upon cessation of whaling, penguin increase ceased. Now the colonies are increasing again (Fig 1), and we hypothesize that this is due to competitive release as large Antarctic toothfish (<em>Dissostichus mawsoni</em>), which eat the same fish prey as do the penguins, are removed from the system by commercial fishing.</p>\n<p>Seeking to understand intraspecific competition as one factor in colony size change, we compared penguin \"quality of life\" at colonies of different size. We developed banded, known-age, known-history populations at each colony, as noted, a process taking several years owing to delayed recruitment (5-6 y). We helped pioneer use of implanted RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tags and computerized weighbridges (WB) to assess adult mass, meal size fed to chicks, and feeding frequency. Reliable WBs have been deployed at 3 colonies for 9-19 seasons. We found that penguins are <em>optimal foragers </em>when trips are &le;2 days long (food loads increase with trip length) but as trips increase &gt;2 days in order to find quality prey patches farther away (the subject of another analysis), meal size, adult body mass, and chick growth decrease (Fig 3). Further, foraging behavior varies by sex, age, body size, and individual quality (\"BQI\": an index related to the propensity of an individual to breed successfully relative to the rest of the population) as well as sea ice conditions. Longer trip times, lighter adult mass, and higher energy expenditure occur at the largest colony, as well as an expanding foraging area that excludes individuals from other colonies as the chick-provisioning period progresses, indicating intra-specific competition within and between colonies. Trip times were also affected by minke and killer whales in the penguins? foraging area, through inter-specific competition for food (more whales, longer trips and prey switch). Finally, coupling the above results with IPCC climate model-projected changes to the Ross Sea environment, we made qualitative predictions for how Ad?lie Penguins would respond over the next 50 years: increase then decrease.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/02/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: David&nbsp;G&nbsp;Ainley</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1543541/1543541_10424442_1622674203753_Fig3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1543541/1543541_10424442_1622674203753_Fig3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1543541/1543541_10424442_1622674203753_Fig3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 3 (Top) Predicted chick mean mass (gr; with 95% CI) at 5 wks post-peak hatch from best model plotted against colony size; (Bottom) mean number of chicks per pair (with 95% CI) at Cps Crozier and Royds, when icebergs were (2001-2005) vs not and increased amount of sea ice.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Ainley</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">David&nbsp;G&nbsp;Ainley</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1543541/1543541_10424442_1622673573396_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1543541/1543541_10424442_1622673573396_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1543541/1543541_10424442_1622673573396_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 1.
