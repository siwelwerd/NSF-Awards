  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Principal Investigator (PI), Jaclyn Lang, published three peer-reviewed journal articles during the period she held the NSF postdoctoral fellowship.  All of these articles were in some way related to Galois representations, a fundamental tool in modern number theory.  The PI has given 29 invited lectures on this work in nine countries to ensure that the work has appropriate broader impacts within number theory.  Moreover, she co-founded an online community POINT: People Online In Number Theory to help early career researchers in number theory connect with one another and more established researchers during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe primary project is called Big images of two-dimensional pseudorepresentations and is joint with Andrea Conti and Anna Medvedovsky.  Building on work of Bella&iuml;che, we use purely algebraic methods to prove a big image theorem for two-dimensional pseudorepresentations.  The intellectual merit of the project is evidenced by the fact that it recovers nearly all of the known results about images of Galois representations and also proves previously unknown cases.  In particular, we recover the main result of the PI\u2019s Ph.D. dissertation and extend the result to the case when the residual representation is reducible.  In this project, the PI is able to obtain much stronger results than anticipated in the project proposal, largely thanks to the foundational work of Bella&iuml;che, which was not available at the time the proposal was written.  This work has been tentatively accepted at Mathematische Annalen, pending minor revisions.\n\nA secondary project is called A-inf is infinite dimensional and is joint with Judith Ludwig.  The ring A-inf is a rather complicated ring that is central to the area of p-adic Hodge theory, which studies p-adic representations of the absolute Galois group of the p-adic numbers.  We show that the dimension of this ring is infinite, in spite of the fact that it behaves like a two-dimensional rings in many respects.  The intellectual merit of this project lies in the fact that this important ring was previously only known to have dimension at least three.  This work is published (open access) in the Journal of the Institute of Mathematics of Jussieu.\n\nThe final project is called Chow motives associated to certain algebraic Hecke characters and is joint with Laure Flapan.  In this project, the PI constructs a geometric object &mdash; known as a motive &mdash; whose associated Galois representation matches that of an analytic object &mdash; known as an algebraic Hecke character.  The result is valid for Hecke characters associated to certain Weil curves.  The intellectual merit of this project is evident in that as a corollary one obtains the modularity of a family of varieties constructed by Schreieder for their Hodge-theoretic properties.  This work is published (open access) in the Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, Series B.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jaclyn A Lang"
