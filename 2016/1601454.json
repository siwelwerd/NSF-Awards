 "awd_abstract_narration": "U.S. manufacturing competiveness relies on workers trained in advanced manufacturing technologies. This project focuses on the use of cobots in advanced manufacturing systems, and aims to develop critical industry-driven, hands-on learning content for cobot technicians, engineering technologists, and robotic automation teachers and faculty. Cobots, or collaborative robots, are safe and flexible enough to operate in the vicinity of and harmoniously with human operators. With a predicted 150,000 cobots to be installed worldwide in the next three years, cobots will become standard practice in advanced manufacturing systems and will cause manufacturers to re-evaluate traditional barriers between human, semi-automated, and automated tasks. \r\n\r\nThe Oakland Community College Department of Engineering, Manufacturing, and Industrial Technology (OCC-EMIT) and the Wayne State University Division of Engineering Technology and Industrial and Systems Engineering Department (WSU-DET) will: (1) develop a cobot  course and create an industry-based cobot laboratory at OCC-EMIT to educate community college students and develop their cobot skills and competencies; (2) develop a two-day cobot short course at WSU-DET to teach community college instructors advanced cobot topics; (3) develop and deliver seminars for community college faculty, secondary STEM teachers, and industry professionals to broaden cobot awareness; and (4) establish articulation agreements to create a pathway for OCC-EMIT students to continue cobot education at WSU-DET. Evaluation and assessment activities will be used to measure the effectiveness of the cobot learning program. The deliverables of this project include comprehensive educational material for STEM secondary teachers, community college and university faculty to educate  manufacturing workers in cobot technology.  Cobot learning modules, materials, seminars, short-course, and labs will be disseminated through  OCC-EMIT and WSU-DET websites and will be available for distance learning and industry-based training.",

United States manufacturing relies on workers trained in advanced manufacturing technologies such as collaborative robots, which transform how workers interact with manufacturing automation. Collaborative robots (cobots) are safe and flexible enough to operate in the vicinity of and harmoniously with human operators. Due to the predicted benefits of cobots in factories, cobots have required manufacturers to re-evaluate traditional barriers between human, semi-automated, and automated tasks, and recruit workers with cobot expertise or train existing workers. In response to this need for cobot trained workers, OCC-EMIT and Wayne State: (1) established a cobot community college course and created an industry-based, cobot laboratory at OCC-EMIT to train community college students in cobot skills and competencies, (2) created cobot learning content for university level students at Wayne State University, (3) offered a two-day cobot short course to educate community college instructors on advanced cobot topics and how to develop cobot learning programs, and (4) engaged with K-12 educators through one-day seminars to broaden their awareness of cobots and next generation manufacturing technologies.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>The centerpieces of OCC-EMIT's cobot laboratory are two FANUC CR-7iA/L collaborative robots. These cobots and supporting equipment were critical to the creation of a new two credit hour course in Oakland Community College's Robotics/Automated Systems Technology program, ROB 1650 Collaborative Robots. Three application labs in ROB 1650 incorporated the collaborative robotic functions into practical usage in pick and place operations, common in manufacturing and assembly factories.&nbsp;Two application labs utilized the automation simulation software, enabling students to practice and train in cobot virtual simulations prior to executing on the physical cobot. In addition to ROB 1650, cobot laboratory capabilities were leveraged in ROB 2400, OCC-EMIT's Robotic Automated Systems Applications to satisfy community college student capstone project requirements. Students apply the cobots in a laboratory application to demonstrate their knowledge of collaborative functions, error checking, notification, and recovery. Wayne State designed cobot learning modules based on OCC-EMIT cobot learning content so that community college students could more easily transition to Wayne State, if interested in a four-year degree. Wayne State Department of Engineering Technology courses MIT 5700 Industrial Robot Modeling and Simulation and ET 5800 Industrial Robot Programming were revised to incorporate cobot modules. A new course, Industrial Cobotics and Safety, was developed to focus solely on cobot training and education. </span></p>\n<p><span>In addition to cobot learning and laboratory advancements, it was imperative that the project educate and disseminate cobot information to K-12 educators and community college instructors so that high school and community college students become aware of career opportunities in collaborative robotics. OCC-EMIT and Wayne State achieved this dissemination by hosting three seminars for K-12 educators and one workshop for community college instructors. The K-12 educator seminars focused on awareness of cobot technologies and career pathways in collaborative robotics. The workshop for community college instructors guided participatnts through the steps instructors need to take to create collaborative robotic learning programs at their home institutions. Overall, this NSF project delivered new, critical cobot educational content at the community college and university level capable of training future cobot technicians and engineers, which can be replicated at other institutions that aim to develop cobot learning programs.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/23/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeremy&nbsp;Rickli</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1601454/1601454_10459014_1640092945661_OCCCobotSimulationWorkcell--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1601454/1601454_10459014_1640092945661_OCCCobotSimulationWorkcell--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"OCC Simulation Workcell\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1601454/1601454_10459014_1640092945661_OCCCobotSimulationWorkcell--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"OCC Simulation Workcell\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">OCC Simulation Workcell with the FANUC CR7iA collaborative robots and HMI panels for application development in FANUC HandlingPRO software.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Oakland Community College</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;Sefcovic</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">OCC Simulation Workcell</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1601454/1601454_10459014_1640093077304_OCCCobots--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1601454/1601454_10459014_1640093077304_OCCCobots--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"OCC Cobots\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1601454/1601454_10459014_1640093077304_OCCCobots--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"OCC Cobots\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">FANUC CR7iA Collaborative Robots at Oakland Community College</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Oakland Community College</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;Sefcovic</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">OCC Cobots</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1601454/1601454_10459014_1640093250959_COBOTHMIForceLimitsScreen--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1601454/1601454_10459014_1640093250959_COBOTHMIForceLimitsScreen--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"HMI Force Limits\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1601454/1601454_10459014_1640093250959_COBOTHMIForceLimitsScreen--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"HMI Force Limits\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Human Machine Interface (HMI) panel to set Contact Stop Force Limits on the robot to stop the robot when a collision occurs.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Oakland Community College</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;Sefcovic</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">HMI Force Limits</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1601454/1601454_10459014_1640093419339_COBOTHMIApplicationScreen--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1601454/1601454_10459014_1640093419339_COBOTHMIApplicationScreen--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"HMI Application Screen\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1601454/1601454_10459014_1640093419339_COBOTHMIApplicationScreen--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"HMI Application Screen\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Human Machine Interface (HMI) screen for testing and monitoring for contact stop in the Cobot application.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Oakland Community College</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">John&nbsp;Sefcovic</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">HMI Application Screen</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
