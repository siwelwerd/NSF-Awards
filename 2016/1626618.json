 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden (RSABG) to acquire modern instrumentation and analytical capacity for the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) laboratory.  SEM is one of the principal methods for examination of detailed surface structure (micromorphology) of biological materials. This instrument is of fundamental importance to research and training at RSABG, the largest botanic garden dedicated to California native plants and an important research center for plant comparative biology. Specifically, RSABG will acquire a Hitachi SU3500S Variable Pressure SEM, together with specimen preparation equipment and SEM-image analysis software. Vastly improved SEM capabilities will support research by RSABG faculty, staff scientists and students to further our understanding of the evolution of plant diversity through integrating comparative morphological and anatomical research on plants with cutting-edge molecular methods and phylogenetic analysis. The enhanced view of meristems, surfaces of leaves and stems, floral structures, seeds and pollen grains enabled by SEM imaging expands our knowledge of plant form and function. Notably, for many plant groups, SEM photomicrographs of pollen grains are essential components of species descriptions. In addition, quality SEM micrographs are an important means of effective and exciting visual communication, both in scientific presentations and in formal and informal education. SEM imagery from the Hitachi SEM will enhance our work in plant conservation through enhancing our ability to observe reproduction in rare plants. It will also contribute to public and formal education by providing images that are both beautiful and information-packed to support programming for K-6 and college students, as well as other visitors to RSABG through use of such images in exhibits. The facility will also augment microscopy capabilities available to researchers at the Claremont Colleges.\r\n\r\nThe SU3500S Variable Pressure Scanning Electron Microscope, the Cressington 108 Auto Sputter Coater with an MTM-20 high resolution thickness controller and MountainsMap Universal software represent significant improvements to and expansion of research infrastructure at RSABG. This integrated system will dramatically improve our conventional (i.e., high vacuum) SEM capabilities and also significantly expand our research tool chest by adding (1) higher resolution and magnification than currently achievable, (2) low vacuum capacity and a Peltier cooling stage for observing hydrated, living tissue and (3) sophisticated image analysis software. The low vacuum capabilities of the instrument will expand considerably the research questions that we can address while also ensuring that observations made are accurate. The image analysis software that is a vital part of the package will transform our analytical power to gather data from SEM images: to characterize, quantify and analyze 2D and 3D structure, and to integrate these morphometric data with comparative phylogenetic analyses to advance our knowledge of the patterns of plant evolution.",

The instrument is also available to our colleagues locally (see below). Our former SEM was acquired decades ago and, in terms of electronics and controls, would have been entirely at home on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise &ndash; the original starship Enterprise with Captain Kirk at the helm. The new SEM is a giant leap forward and has been a tremendous addition to our research resources.</p>\n<p>In addition to the SEM, the grant also supported acquisition of a new &lsquo;sputter coater.&rsquo; This is an instrument that vaporizes gold to lay down a thin, even layer of the metal onto the surface of the specimen that is to be viewed using the SEM. The thin layer of gold protects the specimen from being destroyed by the electron beam and yields a sharp, crisp image.</p>\n<p>Lastly, to enable us to take full advantage of the SEM, we acquired a sophisticated software package for analysis of the images. As an example of what the software can do, staff scientist Dr. Carrie Kiel recently used it &ndash; &nbsp;together with SEM images of pollen grains from numerous species of Acanthaceae &ndash; to quantify differences in the topography of the surface of the pollen grains among species. Most of these pollen grains have bumps of varying height (like tiny hills or mountains) whereas others are smoother. Quantifying that difference was made possible by the MountainsMap software. Specifically, Dr. Kiel showed a relationship between pollen grain surface topography and pollinators.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit. The suite of instruments and software supported by the NSF MRI grant (plus cost share from RSABG) are greatly enhancing our researchers&rsquo; ability to document plant structures using scanning electron microscopy. This includes providing exquisite images for use in presentations and publications. At RSABG, the SEM is used by our staff scientists, our graduate students, and participants in our &ldquo;Summer Research Institute&rdquo; for undergraduates. The SEM has also been used by colleagues from local colleges (Pomona College, Harvey Mudd College) and from California Polytechnic University Pomona. Presentations at scientific meetings (regional and national) and publications are already being produced.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts. SEM imagery is captivating; the images can be quite beautiful but can also evoke wonder (see attached images of plant protective structures). &ldquo;Who knew that leaf surfaces looked like&nbsp;<em>THAT&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;is something that we hear frequently. Plants can be challenging for people to &lsquo;get,&rsquo; to understand why they are important. We have found that SEM imagery helps us to bridge that gap and to capture public interest. SEM images captured using the new instrument almost immediately made their way into publications and other print materials for the public (e.g., RSABG&rsquo;s newsletter, website, correspondence with Garden insiders and potential donors) and into our public exhibits. SEM images of some of the remarkable structures that serve to defend plants from would-be herbivores (predators) helped to inspire our &ldquo;Game of Thorns&rdquo; exhibit and a lot of imagery for the exhibit came from our SEM (<a href=\"https://www.rsabg.org/game-of-thorns\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.rsabg.org/game-of-thorns</a>). These images also inspired the &ldquo;Grove of Thorns&rdquo; &ndash; an installation of giant thorns that were massively up-scaled from SEM imagery (see attached image). We also use the SEM for outreach, providing &lsquo;behind the scenes&rsquo; experiences into methods used by our scientists to understand plants. We have yet to meet a person who is not captivated by a charismatic plant structure being viewed using scanning electron microscopy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/14/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lucinda&nbsp;A&nbsp;Mcdade</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626618/1626618_10459451_1578968828003_RSABGGameofThorns2017167--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626618/1626618_10459451_1578968828003_RSABGGameofThorns2017167--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"RSABG Game of Thorns\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626618/1626618_10459451_1578968828003_RSABGGameofThorns2017167--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"RSABG Game of Thorns\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Grove of Thorns - giant 3D sculptures crafted based on SEM images were part of the Game of Thorns exhibit.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">David Bryant</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lucinda&nbsp;A&nbsp;Mcdade</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">RSABG Game of Thorns</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626618/1626618_10459451_1578963574684_CylindropuntiaproliferaSEM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626618/1626618_10459451_1578963574684_CylindropuntiaproliferaSEM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Cylindropuntia\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626618/1626618_10459451_1578963574684_CylindropuntiaproliferaSEM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Cylindropuntia\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Glochids of Cylindropuntia (Malvaceae), color enhanced</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dylan Cohen & David Bryant</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lucinda&nbsp;A&nbsp;Mcdade</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Cylindropuntia</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626618/1626618_10459451_1578968706274_BromeliadLeafScales.land--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626618/1626618_10459451_1578968706274_BromeliadLeafScales.land--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"BromelidadLeafScales\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626618/1626618_10459451_1578968706274_BromeliadLeafScales.land--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"BromelidadLeafScales\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Scanning electron photomicrograph of scales on the surface of a leaf of a bromeliad, colorized to enhance the image.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Andy Siekkinen & David Bryant</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lucinda&nbsp;A&nbsp;Mcdade</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">BromelidadLeafScales</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626618/1626618_10459451_1578958390742_FremontodendronLeaf_0011--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626618/1626618_10459451_1578958390742_FremontodendronLeaf_0011--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"FremontodendronLeaf_0011\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1626618/1626618_10459451_1578958390742_FremontodendronLeaf_0011--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"FremontodendronLeaf_0011\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Stellate trichomes on the leaf of a Fremontodendron (Malvaceae)</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Loraine Washburng</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Lucinda&nbsp;A&nbsp;Mcdade</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">FremontodendronLeaf_0011</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
