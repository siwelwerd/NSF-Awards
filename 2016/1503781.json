 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arctic terrestrial ecosystems exchange greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane), water vapor, and energy with the atmosphere.  The balance between uptake and release of these quantities influences both the Arctic region and the global climate system.  The terrestrial cycling of carbon, water, and energy are strongly linked, and therefore need to be studied at the same time and in the same place. This project continues long-term measurements of carbon, water, and energy balance in terrestrial and freshwater systems in the Alaskan Arctic, extending measurements that began in 2007.  Carbon loss over the winter has recently increased dramatically at one of our study sites, as winter air and soil temperatures have warmed. This study will determine whether these losses continue and seek to understand the underlying causes. Broader impacts of this project include contributions to teaching and learning, including underrepresented groups, support of undergraduate summer research, participation in the Marine Biology Laboratory Logan Science Journalism program and the Arctic LTER Schoolyard program, and outreach to K-12 schools in Fairbanks, Alaska, and to Native Alaskan communities. This project will support career development of two female Principal Investigators at UAF.\r\n\r\nThe proposed research will extend continuous measurements of carbon, water, and energy balance in three tundra ecosystems near Imnavait Creek, Alaska. Ecosystem/atmosphere flux measurements have been collected at these sites via eddy covariance since 2007. Long-term monitoring of hydrology and stream chemistry of Imnavait Creek and depth of thaw in its catchment area will be maintained. Additional measurements to help interpret these data will include water table depth, plant community composition, and vegetation greenness via reflectivity, which is related to leaf area and biomass. Long-term measurements of stream chemistry and discharge are available at Imnavait, enabling comprehensive assessment of carbon budgets.  All data will be made publicly available and archived at the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) web site, the International Arctic Research Center Data Archive, and the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS).\r\n",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe Arctic is an important player in the realm of global climate change for at least two reasons:\n\n 1) The Arctic is warming about twice as fast as the rest of the world and can therefore serve as a harbinger for changes yet to come in ecosystems further south. The Arctic is already responding to this warming. A key question that needs to be addressed is \"Are there responses in arctic ecosystems that can be generalized to ecosystems further south, allowing society to anticipate and develop strategies for mitigation and adaptation?\"\n\n 2) Arctic ecosystems are underlain by permafrost that currently stores between 20 and 40% of the organic carbon in all soils around the world. This carbon, if released as carbon dioxide to the atmosphere would more than triple the current carbon dioxide concentration.  A key question that needs to be addressed is \"How much of the carbon in arctic ecosystems is susceptible to release to the atmosphere and at what pace?\"\n\n The Arctic Observatory Network (AON) and this project in specific help address both questions. \n\n Intellectual Merit: This specific grant processed data from instruments on towers set out in different arctic ecosystem to measure continuously carbon dioxide exchange between the ecosystems and the atmosphere.  The processing filled gaps in the measurement record by modeling carbon dioxide exchange during periods when the measurement instruments failed.  It also provided confidence limits on the carbon dioxide exchange rate. \n\n Broader Impacts: A major goal of this project was to archive the carbon-dioxide exchange data, the processed data and the confidence limit, along with several other data sets being collected as part of this AON project.  These data are freely available to researchers, teachers, students, and other interested parties over the world-wide web.  The project also provided experience to a technician in the processing of carbon-dioxide exchange data. \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/14/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Edward B Rastetter"
