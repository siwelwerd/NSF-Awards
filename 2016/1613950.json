 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the advent of emerging massive datasets in image processing,\r\nbiology, finance, and so on, traditional data mining systems\r\nface new challenges to induce knowledge and discover causal\r\nrelations in dynamic streaming feature environments, where new\r\nfeatures continuously stream in over time. These challenges include\r\n(1) continuous growth of feature volumes over time, (2) a huge feature\r\nspace, even of unknown or infinite size, and (3) not all features\r\nbeing available before learning begins. These challenges call for a\r\nnew learning paradigm with continuously increasing features. In this\r\nproject, we take the increasing feature volumes as streaming features,\r\nand the corresponding learning problem is referred to as Online\r\nLearning with Streaming Features (OLSF). Since existing online\r\nlearning efforts mostly deal with data with increasing observations\r\nbut fixed feature dimensions, OLSF provides a unique chance to unfold\r\nand characterize pattern trends for dynamic systems with streaming\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nThis project aims to address two fundamental issues for OLSF: (1)\r\ncausal discovery with sequentially increasing feature dimensions; and\r\n(2) causal relations for feature selection. We design novel methods\r\nand algorithms for causal discovery in OLSF and establish formal connections\r\nbetween casual discovery and feature selection by investigating the\r\nmutual benefits between them in the context of online stream feature\r\nlearning.  To evaluate the proposed research, we conduct empirical\r\nstudies on a large body of benchmark datasets, as well as with a\r\ndomain-specific real-world case study in personalized news filtering\r\nand summarization where the feature space changes over time.  The\r\nnew algorithms and techniques in this project will advance our ability\r\nto discover knowledge from dynamic systems using streaming features\r\nwith bounded resources. The spectrum of the methods from the project\r\nwill not only enrich our knowledge and understanding of pattern\r\ndiscovery and machine learning for dynamic systems, but also provide a\r\nnew view to capture and characterize dynamic systems from a streaming\r\nfeature perspective.",
