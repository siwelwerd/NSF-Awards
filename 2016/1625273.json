Or is community efficacy responsible for both disorder and crime.  The researchers approach this question by embedding field experiments with neighborhoods that vary by social capital and community efficacy.  The answers to these questions have important intellectual payoffs and policy implications.  Intellectually, the project will provide an important test of the broken windows hypothesis in criminology disorder is a cause of crime and norm violations versus the collective efficacy hypothesis disorder and crime are each caused by community efficacy, and therefore, disorder is spuriously related to crime.  The project will yield stronger causal statements than previous research because it uses experimental methods.  The project has important policy implications.  If disorder causes crime directly, then zero-tolerance policing in which police focus on cleaning up streets of panhandlers, broken windows, graffiti, and other signs of disorder is called for.  If disorder and crime are not causally related but are instead each caused by community efficacy, then policies of community empowerment increasing community resources, social ties, and civic participation are called for.  The researchers are incorporating diverse and underrepresented students in the research process and working with the city of Seattle to disseminate their results.\r\n\r\nTo test broken windows theory against collective efficacy, the investigators will conduct experiments in multiple neighborhoods, capitalizing on their survey measures of collective efficacy and disadvantage.  Five experiments will examine whether the presence of disorder (graffiti and litter on the ground)affects norm violating behavior.  (1) A Letter Drop, in which 24 stamped addressed letters are dropped in each of 123 census tracts. Half will be dropped within sight of graffiti. The mail back rate provides a measure of collective efficacy, as well as a test of whether physical disorder (graffiti) impedes prosocial activity. (2) A Lost Envelope Experiment, in which an envelope with a visible $5 bill enclosed is placed near a mailbox, and passersby can either ignore, mail or steal the envelope. The treatment condition, graffiti and litter nearby, tests whether disorder promotes theft and impedes prosocial behavior. (3) A \"Litter Cam,\" in which a time-elapse camera will record time-to-cleanup in a setting filled with litter. The hypothesis tested is that time to clean up will be shorter in collectively efficacious neighborhoods. The treatment condition \"graffiti in the vicinity\" tests whether additional disorder impedes acts of collective efficacy. (4) Intervening During an Act of Littering, in which a confederate (varied by race and gender) is observed littering in front of local passersby. The outcome is whether passersby interrupt the confederate. We test the hypothesis that the race/gender of the litterer interacts with the race/gender of the intervener. (5) Littering a Flyer on a Car, in which a flyer placed on windshields of parked cars is either littered or not. The treatment, disorder (graffiti), tests the broken windows hypothesis.",

In the control condition, researchers observed passersby and recorded whether they ignored the envelope, mailed the envelope (a prosocial act), or stole the envelope (an antisocial act).  The treatment condition spread graffiti and litter on the sidewalk.  The results failed to replicate Keizer et al:  Passersby were no more likely to steal the envelope in the presence of graffiti and litter than in the control condition of a clean sidewalk.  Instead, they were less likely to mail the envelope in the presence of graffiti and litter, suggesting that neighborhood disorder impedes pro-social behavior.  These results fail to support broken windows and provide some support for collective efficacy.\n\n Research on collective efficacy has measured collective efficacy using survey items administered to neighborhood residents.  Rarely has the process of collective efficacy--intervening in norm-violating behavior on behalf of the common good--been examined.  In particular, no research has examined whether collective efficacy--intervening when others commit deviance or incivilities--varies by the characteristics of the perpetrator.  Are Seattle residents neighborhoods more reluctant to intervene when a black person is violating a norm?  We found that bystanders were reluctant to intervene when the litterer was a black male, compared to white male or white female.  We did not, however, find that interventions varied by whether litter and graffiti were present. Interventions were also not correlated with neighborhood rates of collective efficacy.\n\n Finally, given the reliability issues endemic in survey research, an important question has asked whether collective efficacy can be measured without resorting to survey methods. To explore this, we attempted to replicate Milgram et al.'s (1965) classic \"lost letter\" experiment (see also Sampson 2012).  We dropped 24 letters in each of 122 Census tracts in Seattle.  Each letter was stamped and randomly-addressed to one of three conditions:  (1) a personal letter (N = 979); (2) the American Neo-Nazi Party (N = 979); and (3) Friends of Black Lives Matter (N=980).  The dependent variable is whether or not the lost letter was returned.  The independent variables include the addressee condition and characteristics of the Census tract (racial composition, disadvantage, collective efficacy).  The results replicated Milgram et al.'s study remarkably:  return rates were 58% for Seattle, compared to 48 percent for Milgram for New Haven, and 33% for Sampson for Chicago.  Consistent with Milgram, return rates were 79% for the personal letter, 71% for the Black Lives Matter letters, and 24% for the American Neo-Nazi Party.

We do find some support for collective efficacy theory:  disorder undermines prosocial behavior, and the prosocial acts of mailing lost letters is associated with neighborhood collective efficacy.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/13/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ross L Matsueda"
