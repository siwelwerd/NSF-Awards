Fisher\r\n\r\nIn the study of mathematical objects, a key role is often played by the symmetries of the object - particularly when the object has many symmetries. The proposed research projects investigate ways of characterizing, describing and studying spaces with many symmetries in various dynamical, geometric and topological settings. These questions often require learning, adapting and applying ideas and techniques from many areas of mathematics. This work has connections with diverse areas of mathematics: from differential equations (the use of wavefront sets to study fine analytic properties of solutions to equations) to theoretical computer science (expander graphs, Kazhdan's property (T) and coarse embedding problems).\r\n\r\nThe main thrust of the proposed research is to introduce and develop new analytic techniques in group theory and the study of group actions. Major projects include: (a) studying quasi-isometries using a new notion of coarse differentiation (introduced in recent joint work with Eskin and Whyte) and newer ideas involving non-standard analysis and Loeb measures; (b) developing techniques for studying rigidity of dynamical systems based on analytic techniques from partial differential equations, particularly the theory of wavefront sets; (c) classifying hyperbolic groups which act smoothly on their boundaries using ideas from both dynamics and geometric group theory; (d) developing new cohomological methods in the study of rigidity of group actions. All research lies in the broad interdisciplinary area of rigidity in dynamics, geometry and topology. Many proposed projects involve applying analytic ideas and techniques to problems traditionally studied by dynamical, geometric or topological methods.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant funded basic research into fundamental topics concerning symmetry in geometry and dynamics.  These concern when symmetries or flows uniquely constrain the shapes of spaces.  \nA major breakthrough achieved during this grant was a resolution of key cases ofa conjecture made by Zimmer in 1983.  This research was the subject of an article in Quanta that describes the breakthrough in broadly accessible terms.  The key point is that certain \"small spaces\" cannot have \"lots of symmetry\".  The solution to this problem brought together ideas from many areas of pure mathematics in surprising and novel ways and opens up the possibility of further progress.\nAnother key development is the a characterization of geometric spaces arising from number theory in terms of their geometry.  Namely in terms of their nice geometric subspaces.  This is the first new characterization of these spaces since the 1970's and is a fundamental breakthrough in understanding hyperbolic spaces. It bring together in particular geometric and dynamical ideas in novel ways and points toward more rigidity of these spaces than was expected.  \nLastly a project on this grant studied new constructions of expander graphs, which are fundamental objects in theoretical computer science.  \nThe work on this grant has intellectual merit in that it made fundamental scientific breatkhroughs.  The broader impacts were primarily through the PI training younger scholars as students, postdocs and collaborators.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/04/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David M Fisher"
