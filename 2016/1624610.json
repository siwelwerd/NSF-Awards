 "awd_abstract_narration": "Overwhelming evidence from education research has shown that active learning instructional techniques generate significantly greater student learning than traditional approaches in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses. To date, though, few college and university faculty employ active learning approaches in their introductory STEM classes. This disconnect between practices with established higher effectiveness and actual classroom teaching is particularly troublesome in mathematics because student success in all STEM disciplines relies on a strong mathematics foundation. This project will investigate environments at six institutions that have successfully improved student learning in the Precalculus-to-Calculus 2 (P2C2) sequence by employing active learning in mathematics (ALM). The results of this work will lead to important strategies for adapting, implementing, supporting, and assessing ALM in P2C2 courses. In order to meet the needs of institutions wishing to improve their mathematics instruction, the project will produce multiple options for implementation based upon case studies of the successful institutions. Overall, the project will benefit the mathematical sciences community by: improving student success in high-enrollment undergraduate courses, better preparing those students who go on to STEM majors, and improving the teaching of future faculty through the mentoring of graduate students. Faculty members at the University of Colorado at Boulder (1624628), San Diego State University (1624639), and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (1624643) will collaborate with the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU) (1624610) to research and advance how to influence and sustain educational change in mathematics departments--ultimately, at national scale. \r\n\r\nA fundamental goal of the project is to develop a better understanding of how to enact and support institutional change for implementing ALM in undergraduate learning environments. The underlying research question is: What conditions, strategies, interventions and actions at the institutional, departmental and classroom levels contribute to the initiation, implementation, and institutional sustainability of ALM in the undergraduate P2C2 sequence across varied institutions? Project team members will work as part of APLU's ALM Research Action Cluster to advance understanding of the factors that influence and enhance institutional change as manifested through implementation of models of ALM in the P2C2 sequence. Research will follow a design research methodology linking qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis to capture the iterative and cyclical processes of institutional change. The project will be carried out in two phases, with Phase 1 consisting of the aforementioned case studies at six institutions and Phase 2 consisting of longitudinal case studies of nine diverse institutions that set out to infuse and institutionalize ALM in the P2C2 sequence. Phase 1 will offer the field a retrospective account of ALM models of change that worked, and Phase 2 will develop theory and insights into the processes by which change focused on ALM can unfold over time, along with the affordances and constraints related to institutional change. The project will proactively disseminate its results and findings across APLU's large network of member institutions and beyond to promote adoption of ALM approaches.",

Failure rates in Precalculus through Calculus 2 (P2C2) courses are typically 25-50%, with gaps magnified for students from groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The collaborative research project Student Engagement in Mathematics through an Institutional Network for Active Learning (SEMINAL) focused on how to effectively enhance inclusive student learning by transforming mathematics instruction away from lecture-based approaches to active learning strategies in large-enrollment, entry-level mathematics courses at universities around the United States. \nKey Findings:\nSEMINAL, an NSF funded 7-year project involving more than 120 math faculty at 26 institutions, determined that effective implementation of active learning strategies requires that departments undergo a change in culture. These changes entail effective leadership practices and a collective commitment to implementing inclusive learning strategies, using appropriate data to inform decisions, coordinating courses, building instructor community, and providing professional development.\nEffective cultural change relies on four frames: people; structures; power dynamics; and collective beliefs. \nDefinitions of active learning vary. SEMINAL adopted Laursen &amp; Rasmussen?s (2019) definition involving rigorous mathematics, student-to-student communication, instructor use of student thinking, and instructor attention to equitable teaching practices. In analyzing over 100 interviews from administrators, faculty and instructors who articulated their conceptions of active learning, we found interviewees emphasized student engagement more than what instructors did to facilitate active learning.\nMore equitable student learning requires explicit attention: Merely putting students in groups, without attending to participation norms and group dynamics, is likely to maintain inequitable student outcomes. \nDepartments in SEMINAL's Networked Improvement Community across diverse institutions tried additional inclusive learning strategies and departmental change efforts not originally envisioned.\nDepartments with instructors already collaborating on instructional improvement were more successful in responding to the challenges of the pandemic than those without established communication norms before the onset of the crisis.  \nInstructors can learn to respond to microaggressions to help increase student belonging. Instructors from SEMINAL who participated in a year-long professional development to help them teach more equitably embraced the process of learning together to help students be more successful in mathematics courses.\nKey Change Levers Identified:\n\n Effective leadership at the course, department, and college levels; \n\nUse of appropriate data to inform decisions; \n\n\nDepartment commitment to implementing inclusive active learning strategies; collectively improving instructional materials to support student collaboration, reasoning, and communication; \n\n\nCourse coordination and making those materials available in an organized fashion to future instructors;\n\n\nInitial and longitudinal instructor professional development; instructor communities of practice that go beyond course logistics to discuss inclusive teaching strategies; \n\n\nEmploying learning assistants to support student learning; \n\n\nImproved learning environments that support peer-to-peer interaction (e.g., movable tables and chairs); student placement practices; \n\n\nPlanning for sustainability (start off planning how to handle the ongoing churn in instructors each term, and turnover in departmental and college administrators); include attention to effective teaching and beliefs about teaching in department hiring practices; recruiting strategic members to help drive and sustain change efforts (those with formal positions of power as well as those with passion for making the changes); and \n\n\nConnect to a network with other individuals seeking to make similar changes.\n\n\nResearch Process:\nThe primary research question, \"What conditions, strategies, interventions, and actions at the departmental and classroom levels contribute to the initiation, implementation, and institutional sustainability of active learning in the undergraduate calculus sequence across varied institutions\" informed the identification of three research objectives: leveraging case studies, building theory and catalyzing change.\nSEMINAL had three phases.
