 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Georgia Institute of Technology proposes to add four new cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students to their existing CyberCorps(R) Scholarship for Service (SFS) program in cybersecurity with strong background in network forensics and big data analytics. Georgia Tech is a premier technological university that offers a rich set of educational programs in the broad area of cybersecurity. Its graduate degree in information security was launched in 2002, and students in other degree programs can also choose cybersecurity focus. The previous SFS Scholarship award has graduated 40 students and it provided evidence for the quality and diversity of students Georgia Tech attracts, its rich and broad cybersecurity curriculum; and quality of research programs in many areas of cybersecurity. Students who have graduated from Georgia Tech have become leaders in the cybersecurity field, serving in key roles in government and industry.\r\n\r\nThis five year CyberCorps(R) SFS proposal seeks funding to support a total of 28 students.  These students will come from all degree levels - ranging from undergraduates to PhDs - from multiple colleges at Georgia Tech. In addition to scholarships for students, a capacity building component will allow new courses to be developed in emerging areas such as Internet-scale network forensics and big data analytics for better understanding of malware threats. Georgia Tech has been at the forefront for both educational innovation and cybersecurity curriculum content creation and dissemination in the past. It has collaborated with industry and government agencies to host multiple workshops for this purpose. By supplementing a demanding curriculum with research and leadership mentoring, SFS students will be presented with opportunities that will help them prepare for high impact careers.",
