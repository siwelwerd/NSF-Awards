This site has been successfully operating for the past fifteen years and has achieved a high level of participation from women and minorities. The objective of the REU site will continue to focus on inspiring undergraduate students with an emphasis on women, minorities, and US Armed Forces veterans to pursue careers in science and engineering by exposing them to hands-on research opportunities. In addition, the new recruitment will include participants who show great interest in research, but are underachieving academically. It is highly expected that this REU site will enable such students to develop their talents and progress towards their career goals.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The REU site at PSU ties diverse research projects together under the overarching theme of electron microscopy for multidisciplinary applications. Through a concentrated summer program, the participants will obtain technical training, conduct independent research, visit local high-tech industries, and present their research at an REU symposium. The activities will begin with a training week including workshops on laboratory safety, library database searches, and graduate school applications. Also offered is an intensive short course that trains students in using scanning electron microscope or focused ion beam microscope for material and device characterization. Students will then use these acquired skills in research projects offered by faculty mentors from the departments of Mechanical and Materials Engineering, Electrical and Computer Engineering, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Geology. It is highly anticipated that REU participants will leave the summer program with a quintessential skill (electron and ion microscopy) applicable to all disciplines and a broader perspective of the impact of research experience on their high education and career choices.",
