 "awd_abstract_narration": "A goal of the Tribal Colleges and Universities Program (TCUP) is to increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) instructional and research capacities of specific institutions of higher education that serve the Nation's indigenous students. Expanding the STEM curricular offerings and research capacity at these institutions expands the opportunities of their students to pursue challenging, rewarding careers in STEM fields, provides for research studies in areas that may be culturally significant, and encourages a community and generational appreciation for science and mathematics education. This project aligns directly with that goal, and moreover will inform the research literature on environmental science in several key areas of interest to and relevance to Indian country.  \r\n\r\nUnited Tribes Technical College (UTTC) will revolutionize the environmental science program it offers to students by increasing the research capacity of the faculty and the institution, including project-based learning opportunities in the revised curriculum, focusing on faculty professional development, developing a BS in environmental science with an emphasis on ecology and molecular biology, and providing a bridge program that will both recruit students to the program and increase their college readiness for the program.",

By adapting successful STEM education models like Learning Assistants, we aimed to develop models that could be used campus wide. Advanced training in cellular and molecular ecology expanded opportunities for students in graduate programs and research careers. Support for student and faculty research not only improved recruitment and retention but also increased UTTC's overall research capacity.</p>\n<p>This project had far-reaching impacts on Indigenous students and those from underrepresented groups. A structured community outreach program positioned UTTC as a central hub for enhancing Tribal community engagement in science. Strengthened local, regional, state, and national partnerships and new collaborations built a broader network for interdisciplinary research projects and sustainable curriculum. The project management structure, including external evaluation and expert advisors, ensured timely attainment of goals, fostering a transformative impact on UTTC's STEM recruitment, retention, and engagement strategies.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the project, our graduates have moved on to graduate programs and moved into the workforce.

Student that have matriculated into graduate programs have obtained Master&rsquo;s degrees.&nbsp; We currently have one student pursuing a Ph.D. at North Dakota State University, focusing on natural resources and the impact of contaminants on soil chemistry. Our research initiatives facilitated the engagement of over 50 undergraduate students, 2000 students and community members in outreach, and 25 Learning Assistants in active pedagogy programs.
