Metabolomics, the large-scale study of metabolites, is revolutionizing our understanding of plant metabolism and novel gene function, but its full scientific promise has not been realized due to multiple technical challenges.  These challenges include the accurate chemical identification of metabolites and a sophisticated understanding of the spatial/temporal distribution of metabolism.  To address these issues, a synergistic international team of plant metabolomics and metabolism experts will use an integrated approach to push key technical developments.  The project will use these enabling technologies to gain a better understanding of carbon sequestration and allocation in relationship to energy and a low carbon society.  The major biological objective is to discover and elucidate key genes involved in metabolism of cell wall components (especially lignin and phenylpropanoids) and energy dense lipids.  The major technical objective is to develop advanced analytical technologies and use them for the systematic and data directed metabolome annotation of two model plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula (a close relative of alfalfa, Medicago sativa). \r\n\r\nThis project will enable the engineering of plants for bioenergy by advancing our understanding of carbon allocation and partitioning and, thus, contribute to a low carbon society.  Novel and sophisticated metabolomics technologies will be developed, resulting in increased metabolomics coverage.  Valuable spectral libraries will be generated and distributed to the metabolomics community.  Collaborative relationships between US and Japanese scientists and institutions will be strengthened through a foreign exchange program.  The project will provide multi-disciplinary training for four USA postdoctoral researchers in plant metabolomics, molecular biology, integrated systems biology, and cutting-edge analytical biochemistry.  Hands-on metabolomics workshops will be conducted each year to provide advanced educational opportunities for the international metabolomics community.  This project will support three summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) students each year.",
