 "awd_abstract_narration": "Community colleges serve a large portion of students who require mathematics at the undergraduate level and play an increasing role in STEM workforce development. There is a growing national interest in the role of community colleges for undergraduate education. The proposal seeks to investigate the conditions under which instruction in community college algebra courses can be associated with student learning gains and course performance. This information can be used to design programs to improve instruction and to support student success in algebra. The study involves six community colleges from three states and focuses on three key algebra topics: linear equations, rational equations, and exponential equations. The results will also have applications for mathematics courses at other institutions of higher education. This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. \r\n\r\nThe project will connect both levels of the classroom (students and instructors) in a model that examines personal characteristics of both groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, educational background, student mathematics knowledge, and beliefs about mathematics) and aspects of classroom interaction (e.g., quality of mathematics, quality of instruction). The institutions represent urban, suburban, and rural communities, a range of institution sizes, and three different regions of the United States. A model is proposed for examining these related variables to examine what relationships exist. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected in a mixed methods design in multiple project phases. The first phase will include pilot testing some of the instruments for the project and testing the models. Later phases include data collection and analysis across the institutions. Data collection includes student-level and instructor-level measures. For students, the project will examine measures of mathematics performance, mathematics beliefs, and perceptions of the classroom environment. For instructors, the project will examine knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes. Demographic information will be collected for all participants. In addition to the quantitative measures, classroom observations and video analysis will be used to document the nature of instruction.",

The study focused on three key algebra topics: linear equations, rational equations, and exponential equations. The project analyzed data at classroom levels (students and instructors) in a model that examined personal characteristics of both groups (e.g., gender, ethnicity, educational background, beliefs about mathematics and mathematics teaching/learning,&nbsp; students&rsquo; mathematics knowledge, and teachers&rsquo; knowledge for teaching) and aspects of classroom interaction (e.g., quality of mathematics, quality of instruction). The eight institutions represented urban, suburban, and rural communities, a range of institution sizes, and three different regions of the United States. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected in a mixed methods design in multiple project phases via surveys, tests, artifacts (student work, syllabi), video and audio recordings of lessons, and instructors&rsquo; reflections on all the lessons recorded . The project examined measures of students&rsquo; mathematics performance, mathematics beliefs, and perceptions of the classroom environment; instructors&rsquo; knowledge for algebra teaching, beliefs, and attitudes; and qualities of instruction. To assess quality of instruction, the project developed an instrument, the Evaluating Quality Instruction in Post-Secondary Mathematics (EQIPM) which measured three components of the quality of instruction in community college algebra: the quality of student-content interaction, the quality of instructor-content interactions, and the quality of instructor-student interaction. In addition, the project improved on an instrument to assess covariational reasoning among community college students, the Algebra and Precalculus Concept Readiness test. The modeling confirmed prior results regarding student performance due to prior knowledge and personal characteristics on course performance. Further development of an instrument to assess knowledge is needed to assess student learning. Further diversification of the instructor sample is needed to assess the discriminatory power of EQIPM.
