 "awd_abstract_narration": "Legacy award EEC 0530588 included a focus on teaching electrical and computer engineering (ECE) system design. To support system design thinking and learning, the project utilized student-designed interactive competitive activities. The current I-Corps L project expands on this and other awards to connect students in electrical and computer engineering programs across the country through mobile interactive competition design projects. The project seeks to create a nation-wide capstone program for ECE students, similar to exhibitions in other disciplines that are collaborative rather than competitive. Small-scale trials at Bucknell demonstrated the potential of this type of design for engaging students and teaching elements of system design across all levels of abstraction.\r\n\r\nThe intent of this project is to link these competitive activities with learning since in order to compete, students have to create hardware and software. Since the competitive activity is integrally tied to design, the project has the potential to create rapid feedback on design choices, thus leading to more effective system design skills.  Additionally, the project may opt to develop a commercial activity for purchase. Initial trials conducted to date reveal unique affordances between competitive activities and engineering design. The interactive competitions depend as much upon stories and rules as the physical infrastructure (hardware and software) that supports play. Such activities have been defined as formal rule-based systems with variable and quantifiable outcomes in which different outcomes have different values to players. Players exert effort by both optional and negotiable activities to achieve favorable outcomes which brings an emotional stake. It is the player-centered and engaging characteristics of these competitive activities the project seeks to combine with the engineering design process. More specifically, the activities allow great flexibility in student design challenges so they become more adaptable to institution-specific learning outcomes and curricula. Changing the rules can significantly change the design parameters so that a large range of design projects are enabled even with a cost-effective and limited set of hardware and software. Furthermore, the activities can be placed in narratives drawn from many popular works relevant to STEM students and other learners, and thus have potential appeal to many audiences.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis National Science Foundation Innovation Corps for Learning (ICorps-L) project sought to explore the commercial feasibility of creating an internet-of-things based learning platform to teach students basic elements of networked devices.  The three person team investigated how to both create customer value and build a sustainable business model based on a mixed hardware and software based platform which could support education in smart systems to address workforce needs driven by the expected economic impact of the Internet of Things (IoT).  During the project the focus expanded to explore integration of IoT technologies into healthcare challenges.  \n\nThe intellectual merit of this project was in determining both architectures and design parameters for a platform to meet emerging customer needs in education and health care as well as undertaking customer discovery research to design a business model that would make a venture financially sustainable.  Several possible models were explored including informal education and healthcare; a LLC company, Plega, was founded to continue further development; and the team conducted customer discovery research at national venues to inform product development.  The project created a minimum viable prototype that is currently being used as a proprietary platform for further technical development and as a working demonstration for seeking other channels to develop the business.\n\nThe broad impact of this project arises both from founding a commercial venture and the development of a potentially viable business model which addresses emerging needs in education and healthcare.  Both of these domains are complex and dynamic societal challenges with a disproportionate impact on human well-being.  The research done during this project informs new ideas in technology education that will became increasingly necessary for both economic development and success in the job market in the 21st century when automation enabled by smart systems is expected to dramatically change the nature and availability of work and lead to new workforce preparation challenges.  Healthcare, characterized by unsustainable spending levels, can be greatly improved by developing new forms of physical activity which can be tuned to individual patient needs which is where Plega is focusing future business development.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/05/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Alan Cheville"
