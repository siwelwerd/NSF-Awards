 "awd_abstract_narration": "Terrestrial biospheric models are a critical tool used to evaluate the response of the biosphere to future climatic conditions. With these models we aim to understand how ecosystems will respond to changes in climate and particularly increasing temperature, and which mechanisms currently control carbon exchange. The objective of this project is to derive an observation-based, instead of model-based, constraint of temperature-induced variability in the carbon cycle. This project builds a collaborative relationship with Dr. Louis Schipper and Dr. Vic Arcus of the University of Waikato, New Zealand, to gather observations of terrestrial carbon cycling, coincident with sunlight, water and temperature across every vegetated continent and major biome. Arcus and Schipper have developed a new fundamental theory that will allow models to take into account peculiar properties of enzymes that control cycling of carbon to provide new insight into future changes as the globe warms.\r\n\r\nThe research team will statistically attribute both photosynthesis and respiration to temperature, through accounting for the role of other regulating factors (e.g. water availability, sunlight) and build mathematical algorithms which capture observed variability. A new theoretical model of temperature dependence of biological processes (macro-molecular rate theory) will be applied to ecosystem scale photosynthesis and respiration. This project will use data from 10 major biomes located around the globe to understand and better constrain the global carbon cycle, improving the accuracy of terrestrial biosphere models, and our predictions of future concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.  This work builds our understanding of both short-term events, such as heat waves, as well as long-term events, such as global environmental change.\r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Royal Society of New Zealand.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\nThe objective of this project was to derive an observation-based understanding of temperature-induced variability of the carbon cycle, accounting for the role of other regulating factors (e.g. water availability) to understand and better constrain the global carbon cycle and create tangible benchmarks for terrestrial biosphere models.  These models are the basis of our prediction for the future of the biosphere, and predict a large portion of the global carbon cycle.  Terrestrial biosphere models to date have such a wide spread in their projections that they add large amounts of uncertainty to future climate projections.  Here we generated an observation-based constraint of the temperature dependence of the global carbon cycle to improve both models, and our protections of future climate change.\n\nIn concert with a team of scientists at the University of Waikato, we applied the novel Macro-Molecular Rate Theory, a thermodynamics-based theory which explains the temperature dependence of enzyme catalyzed rates.  In our case, we applied this theory to ecosystem-level measurements of photosynthesis (a sink of carbon to the biosphere) and respiration (a release of carbon from the biosphere).  This work resulted in the first observationally derived curves for global photosynthesis and respiration.  These curves corroborate that we are currently in temperatures which support the sink of carbon from the atmosphere to the biosphere.  They also demonstrate that we are likely to experience frequent temperatures as soon as 2040 which will slow the land sink of carbon to the biosphere.  These novel curves allow us to evaluate the land-sink of carbon at future temperature scenarios without the use terrestrial biosphere models, and to compare our findings with those models to improve their predictions.\n \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/03/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katharyn D Woods"
