 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Iona College DESIRE program supports twenty-four (24) economically disadvantaged students with high academic aptitude, for scholarships in STEM fields, through targeted, hands-on high school outreach and recruitment programs. The STEM disciplines targeted by the DESIRE program include Chemistry and Computer Science. To ensure intellectual merit, the DESIRE Program uses proven high-impact educational practices (HIEPs) to develop the Academic, Professional, Interpersonal, Intrapersonal, and Intercultural dimensions of scholarship recipients for success in STEM. \r\n\r\nThese Scholars will be exposed to HIEPs that increase student retention, and will benefit from the various resources at Iona dedicated to intervention, resilience, and enrichment: tailored core courses, an interdisciplinary academic learning community, a science living and learning community residence, undergraduate research, and experiential/service learning. For professional development, the scholars will be offered industrial internships and professional mentors through Careers in Science seminars and established science alumni network. The DESIRE program will serve as a model for peer institutions for the improvement of their programs to support and retain students in STEM.  The broader impacts of the program ensure that STEM workforce needs are addressed and highly trained STEM professionals willing to embrace scientific pursuits at the graduate and professional levels are produced. The high school partnership will provide an enduring and sustainable pipeline for identification and matriculation of high caliber students with financial need. The DESIRE program will lead to completion of STEM degrees by an increased number of underrepresented students, and an increased number of underrepresented high school students becoming interested in STEM careers.",

The overall goal of this project, Iona University's DESIRE (Development of Excellence in Science through Intervention, Resilience, and Enrichment) Scholars Program, is to satisfy the national need for well-educated scientists by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Iona University. The major goals of the funded project are to recruit, support, and promote the success of academically talented students with financial need, for study in the fields of Chemistry or Computer Science, through the fostering of academic and professional excellence towards completion of STEM degrees and inspiration to pursue STEM careers. Iona is a private institution in the New York City metropolitan area that enrolls a large proportion of underrepresented minority and commuter students who need strong support to develop connections to their STEM major and the institution. The DESIRE Program develops the critical thinking and problem solving skills of students majoring in Chemistry and Computer Science, as well as their understanding of the impact and relevance of science on problems in local and world communities, to promote both academic success and a sense of social and ethical responsibility. The project initiatives include a first-year learning community, faculty mentoring, peer-led academic and social network support, undergraduate research experiences and conference presentations, and a career development plan. The project objectives are to improve recruitment, retention, and graduation of the scholars; facilitate the scholars? ability to develop strong connections with faculty and peers; increase their awareness of STEM professional activities and professions through research experiences; improve their understanding of careers; and facilitate their placement in a STEM career or graduate program. Over its grant duration, this project funded scholarships to 32 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in Chemistry and Computer Science. Over 70 percent of Scholars are woman and from underrepresented groups, and about 90 percent of Scholars are commuter students. Of 13 NSF Scholars graduated, 4 Scholars entered STEM graduate programs and 9 are employed in STEM. Iona University continues to support current scholars through graduation. NSF Scholars have contributed 4 peer-reviewed articles as co-authors, and gave 35 national, 13 regional, and 34 local presentations at conferences. The success of the project has been disseminated to a broader education community via two peer-reviewed publications and one under review.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/10/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Sunghee&nbsp;Lee</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
