 "awd_abstract_narration": "The remarkable function of the brain requires proper growth and formation in the embryo. First, a small cluster of cells increases dramatically in number, then transforms into an exquisitely organized organ with a complicated pattern of connections.  Most of the time, this process results in brains that are perfectly normal, with the right number of nerve cells.  Surprisingly little is known, though, about how the growing brain decides how many cells to produce.   This research project will look at the control of cell number in the growing brains of transparent living zebrafish during the first few days of life.  The PI has developed techniques for watching clusters of dividing cells over time in special zebrafish embryos whose brain cells glow with unique combinations of colors (called \"Brainbow\").  This coloring allows new cells to be followed as they divide off from their mother cell.  So far it appears that families of cells (mother cell with her set of daughter cells) compete with other families to survive in the growing brain.  This type of competition has not been seen before in the brain, and may be responsible for controlling growth - not only in the brain, but in other organs as well.  The PI will test which genes are important for cell families to survive this competition.  The work will generate a number of new research tools that will be shared with the scientific community.  Undergraduate students will perform and analyze  the experiments themselves, providing rich opportunities for research training early in developing scientists' careers.  By also transforming the data they have personally collected into an interactive, educational website, students will learn various digital media approaches to making scientific material understandable to traditional and non-traditional audiences.  The colorful images produced by this research have great appeal to both scientists and non-scientists, making it easier for students to learn how to engage the public with their work.\r\n  \r\nTo study dynamic cellular behavior in the living brain, the PI has developed an approach using in vivo time-lapse confocal imaging and multicolor fluorescent protein (Brainbow) expression in zebrafish.  Using this technique, the PI has shown that programmed cell death occurs non-randomly in the living brain, with specific neural progenitor cells and their neuronal progeny (entire clones) undergoing cell death in a coordinated manner, while neighboring clones appear normal. If whole clones of dividing cells are in fact competing with one another, increases or decreases in cellular fitness should influence a clone's competitive edge.  The planned research will use a mosaic approach to alter gene expression in individual cells, coupled with global Brainbow expression to simultaneously follow dynamics within multiple clones of dividing cells.  Cellular fitness will be targeted via both cell-intrinsic mechanisms (cell cycle, c-myc activity) and cell-extrinsic mechanisms (access to extracellular BMP signaling).  These experiments will test directly whether cellular fitness influences a clone?s ability to survive in the developing brain.  Overall this may support the hypothesis that competition among clones of dividing cells helps regulate neuronal production and growth in the developing nervous system.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nHow growing tissues regulate their size is a fundamental question. This is particularly important in the brain and nervous system, where growth drives the formation of circuits that control behavior. Competition among cells in the developing brain is one mechanism that could regulate growth; however, surprisingly little is known about cell competition during neural development.  \n\n \n\nThis project tested whether competition occurs among families of neural stem cells that are dividing during early brain development. The researchers used the zebrafish model system -- a vertebrate animal that is transparent while the brain is forming.  This allowed for the use of light microscopy to directly observe the growth and development of the brain in living animals in real time. To visualize cells the in the brain, the researchers used a multicolor labeling system called \"Brainbow\", which color-codes families of developing cells.  Using this labeling, they were able to determine that families of cells (also termed \"clones\") occasionally die in a stereotyped, progressive manner.  Meanwhile, the cells around these isolated families appeared healthy and robust.  This suggested that clones may be competing with one another during development, and that some less fit clones did not survive, while neighboring healthy clones thrived.  To test what factors influence this pattern, the researchers studied different molecules, including a cellular factor called c-myc, and and extracellular growth factor called Bone Morphogenetic Protein.  The researchers also measured multiple morphological parameters both within and among clones, as well as tracked movement and location of related cells over time.  Finally, the researchers used a technique called calcium imaging, which allowed them to follow activity in related cells within the growing brains of living embryonic fish.  The researchers detected patterns of potentially coordinated activity, suggesting that clonally related cells communicate with one another during this period of time.\n\n \n\nThis work is important because it shows that families of dividing cells during development may play an important role in the regulation and coordination of brain growth.  It is not known how or whether such family units are involved in brain organization.  This work, along with work from other labs, begins to identify some of the roles that clones of cell may play during development.  This work is relevant not only to brain development, but to the formation of other organs and tissue systems as well.\n\n \n\nThis research has been disseminated at national scientific conferences and has helped to generate seven peer-reviewed publications, which included 18 undergraduate student co-authors.  The tools and reagents generated in this work have been shared with labs across the United States and Europe.\n\n \n\nThe work also has broader impacts because it has influenced many undergraduate students, particularly students who are considering careers in science themselves.  Twenty-six students were directly involved in the research, 18 of whom are women (69%) and 11 of whom are from backgrounds that have been historically minoritized in science (27%).  Approximately 50 students have learned how to use multicolor fluorescence microscopy.  The majority of these students have gone on to their own careers in the health and science.  Furthermore, the PI created an undergraduate course on science communication, which has helped to mentor over 50 additional undergraduate students in techniques for explaining scientific concepts to the public and inspiring non-scientists to become interested in science.  Clear scientific communication is a critically important skill for young scientists to develop at an early stage of their career, particularly in a world with an ever-increasing demand for scientific literacy.  The image data generated in this project has been used in the media, in art exhibitions, and publications, and has also been used to engage and inspire students at the K-12 level.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/04/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tamily Weissman"
