 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non technical abstract:\r\nThis International Research Experience for Students (IRES) is focused on quantifying disaster risk reduction geographic information capacities. Each year, a cohort of five U.S. graduate students from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) will participate in a ten-week summer research experience with collaborators at the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) and the University of Bonn (UBonn)  - both located in Bonn, Germany. Highlights of collaborative activities include student access to and learning from UNU-EHS, UBonn, and other international disaster risk reduction experts, student research training activities, spatial data set acquisition, and access to international scientific networks only available in Bonn. The primary student research project is to create and rigorously evaluate a Disaster Risk Reduction - Information Capacity Index (DRR-ICI). A DRR-ICI currently does not exist. The scientific purpose of the DRR-ICI is to quantify and evaluate how disaster risk reduction geographic information capacities such as information availability, scale and relevancy vary within Germany and from country to country. The project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning by creating unique linkages to international organizations that will train, educate and professionally develop the next generation of interdisciplinary STEM research scientists focused on disaster risk reduction and GIS. Intellectual products created by IRES students, such as the DRR-ICI, will provide important benefits to society that can bring global attention to disaster risk reduction research and GIS potentially saving lives when disasters occur. The project is particularly strong in enhancing infrastructure for research and education as IRES students will become part of both the UN and German disaster stakeholder networks that are only available by being on-site in Bonn.\r\n\r\nTechnical abstract:\r\nThe research team will create transformative knowledge on understanding the relationship between geographic information capacity and disaster risk reduction ? an area that has received little research attention despite the overall importance of geographic information for disaster risk reduction. Student research efforts to create and evaluate a DRR-ICI will make valuable intellectual contributions to understanding (a) how disaster risk reduction geographic information capacity is itself a disaster risk factor, (b) how geographic information capacity can be tied to geographic information best practices, and (c) comparing geographic information capacities between countries and sub-national levels within countries to inform disaster management decision making. The DRR-ICI developed by students will provide practical, intellectual products for disaster risk reduction teaching and learning that can transition into real use in the event of a disaster.",

For example, maps are vital when a disaster occurs. Not having access to timely geographic information, experts who know how to utilize geospatial technology, or the capacity to share geographic information with collaborating organizations can literally be the matter of life or death in some cases. Through the research project, RIT students were able to gain first-hand experience conducting international research with experts at the United Nations University, the University of Bonn, and were able to engage in a broad range of other scientific research activities in Europe related to geospatial technology and disaster management. None of these research experiences would have been possible if the students had not been able to travel to Europe as many of the organization's the students worked with are simply not available through virtual connections. The students also gained practical experience with understanding disaster management&nbsp; practice through incorporation into summer training schools with United Nations University. Several project activities were also connected with the Principal Investigators (PI)&nbsp;NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) project. For example, several of the IRES students were able to utilize experiences from Germany to study the relationship of geographic information capacity and the response to Hurricane Harvey through REU field work in Texas. The IRES project created a new scientific knowledge related to the concept of geographic information capacity as reflected in several scientific publications. Additionally, the project created new scientific knowledge in a variety of related fields such as Sustainability where PhD students were able to conduct novel research on topics ranging from the modeling of the use of electronic vehicle batteries for disaster resilience to understanding the consequences of electronic waste after a disaster occurs. The project made significant impacts on engaging underrepresented groups in science including over 50% participation by female project participants (including two female deaf and hard-of-hearing participants) and several undergraduate students. The project experience also led to the creation of new international scientific networks that the project PI still engages with. Ultimately, all of the goals of the project were met. This project represents a clear case of the benefits that the IRES program can provide to students. The project helped create the next generation of a globally-engaged scientific research workforce with the necessary skills to tackle global challenges such as natural disasters using geospatial technology.&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/30/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Brian&nbsp;Tomaszewski</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559450/1559450_10414137_1640811095885_Figure_1_April_2020_1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559450/1559450_10414137_1640811095885_Figure_1_April_2020_1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Geographic Information Capacity Model.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559450/1559450_10414137_1640811095885_Figure_1_April_2020_1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Geographic Information Capacity Model.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Major scientific project results: Development of a Geographic Information Capacity model for disaster risk reduction and its relationship to international diplomatic frameworks (shown as rounded rectangles).</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Elsevier user license: https://www.elsevier.com/about/policies/open-access-licenses/elsevier-user-license</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (restricted use - cannot be shared)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Brian&nbsp;Tomaszewski</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Geographic Information Capacity Model.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559450/1559450_10414137_1640808586487_IRES_2018_EUa--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559450/1559450_10414137_1640808586487_IRES_2018_EUa--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students visit EU ECHO.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559450/1559450_10414137_1640808586487_IRES_2018_EUa--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students visit EU ECHO.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2018 IRES Students at European Union European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (EU ECHO) in the Netherlands where they learned about disaster response and information capacity issues - an experience only possible by being in Europe.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Joerg Szarzynski</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Creative Commons</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Brian&nbsp;Tomaszewski</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Students visit EU ECHO.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559450/1559450_10414137_1640809646229_IRES_UN_2018c--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559450/1559450_10414137_1640809646229_IRES_UN_2018c--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Students at the United Nations in Bonn.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1559450/1559450_10414137_1640809646229_IRES_UN_2018c--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Students at the United Nations in Bonn.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">NSF IRES students at United Nations University\ufffds Institute for Environment and Human Security (UNU-EHS) in Bonn, Germany.
