 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) grant aims to make the design of fluid systems more intuitive, accessible, and inexpensive.  Fluid systems, such as aircraft, biomedical pumps, or turbines, play a vital role in many sectors of the U.S. economy.  Due to the complex physics of fluid flow, these systems are often difficult and costly to design.  This presents a barrier to start-up companies seeking to develop products that involve such complex fluid flows.  The complicated nature of fluid flows also poses a barrier in engineering education, where students often struggle to achieve intuition regarding fluid flows.  To mitigate these barriers, this award envisions an immersive, virtual-reality design environment in which engineers can interact with aircraft or heart pumps in the same way artists interact with clay.  A key requirement of this vision is the ability to provide engineers with instantaneous performance predictions as they shape their virtual designs.  This award will help build the knowledge necessary for real-time prediction of complex fluid flows, thereby enabling the next generation of tools for immersive computer-aided design and engineering education.\r\n\r\nPredicting the performance of fluid systems quickly and accurately for preliminary design remains a challenge due to the nonlinearity of the governing equations and the large cost of high-fidelity simulations.  Reduced-order models provide a suitable alternative approach, since they have the potential to significantly reduce computational cost with only a small reduction in accuracy.  The innovation explored in this award is to create reduced-order models that achieve high accuracy for boundary quantities that engineers are typically interested in, e.g., lift and drag, rather than high accuracy for the overall flow.  Specifically, the research team will investigate adjoint-based basis functions to construct reduced-order models suitable for prediction of such boundary integrals.  After using the reduced-order model to find a preliminary design, a numerical optimization based on a high-fidelity model can be applied to refine the design parameters.  Here, numerical error estimation and control is especially important, because an optimization algorithm may exploit numerical errors rather than physics to optimize the quantity of interest.  This research will explore the use of simultaneous geometry and mesh optimization as a means of addressing error control.  Finally, after optimization, an engineer may need to explore the design space in order to meet qualitative constraints or consider tradeoffs.  The research team will test the hypothesis that matrix-free spectral methods can re-parameterize and approximate the design space in such a way that engineers can make real-time changes without significantly impacting optimality and feasibility.",

A discretization is a way of transforming a continuous mathematical model into a discrete one that can be solved using a computer.

Despite its fundamental importance, few fluid discretizations are guaranteed to respect the second-law.  We found that entropy-stability is critical to ensuring robust simulations that do not fail.\n\nProject Outcomes:\n\nEntropy-stable discretizations for accurate and robust simulations on triangular and tetrahedral grids.  This outcome is significant because triangular and tetrahedral grids are needed for practical geometries, and previous entropy-stable discretizations were developed for tensor-product (i.e. quadrilateral and hexahedral) grids.\nEntropy-stable discretizations can be created on curved elements using an optimization-based procedure to define the so-called metrics.  In practice, elements near surfaces must be curved to match the geometry; however, the curving process can cause the discretization to lose important properties such as entropy-stability and conservation.  This method ensures these properties are not lost and has become a popular method for curving elements in entropy-stable simulations.\nAn entropy-stable version of the discontinuous Galerkin difference (DGD) method suitable for unstructured grids.  The DGD method is a type of discretization that has been shown to be accurate and fast on structured (tensor-product) grids.  This outcome represents an extension of DGD to triangular/tetrahedral unstructured grids and includes an entropy-stable version of DGD.\nA generalized version of DGD suitable for solving flows on point clouds.  The DGD solution degrees of freedom --- that is, the locations where the fluid flow is represented discretely --- can be partially decoupled from the underlying computational grid.  This insight enabled a version of DGD for point-clouds, greatly increasing the flexibility and, potentially, the speed of fluid-flow simulations.\nSimplified R-refinement using generalized DGD.  R-refinement is a type of adaptation procedure in which the degrees of freedom are repositioned in order to improve solution accuracy.  R-refinement has not found widespread use, because moving the degrees of freedom usually requires moving the grid, which is difficult to do without causing inverted/invalid elements.  By contrast, the degrees of freedom in generalized DGD can be moved independently of the grid, which greatly simplifies R-refinement.  \nAdjoint-based reanalysis is not effective for fluid-flow problems.  Reanalysis refers to solving an analysis problem after a geometry or parameter change.  Ideally, in this context, the analysis would only be repeated in subdomains where the solution most strongly impacts outputs of interest, such as lift and drag in aerodynamics problems.  The adjoint variables can be used to identify such subdomains, but the resulting predictions were not found to be sufficiently accurate for nonlinear flows with shocks.\nVirtual-reality (VR)-based activities are promising for learning aerodynamic concepts. A VR learning activity for lifting-line theory was developed.  In this activity, a student could change the shape of a wing using three separate parameters, and they could immediately see the impact this change had on induced drag (visualized as an arrow behind the aircraft).  Students in a small study reported greater motivation and improved understanding of induced drag after completing the activity.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/06/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason E Hicken"
