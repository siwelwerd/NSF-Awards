 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professors Kevork Abazajian, Mu-Chun Chen, Jonathan Feng, Manoj Kaplinghat, Arvind Rajaraman, Yuri Shirman, and Timothy Tait at the University of California, Irvine. \r\n\r\nThis is an exciting time in particle physics and cosmology.  Data from a variety of particle-physics experiments are deepening our understanding of the fundamental interactions and probing the physics of higher and higher energies with unprecedented detail.  At the same time, outstanding questions in astrophysics and cosmology also guide theoretical work, and the interaction between cosmology and particle physics has been very fruitful.  This grant will support research across a wide spectrum of frontiers, with an eye towards exploiting innovative ideas in particle physics, cosmology, and at their interface to address outstanding problems in a wide variety of fields.   Particular directions to be studied include searches for new elementary particles at underground colliders, studies of the properties of neutrinos, and work that aims to shed light on the mysterious dark matter that makes up most of the matter in the universe.   This research will also study new ideas at the interface between particle physics and cosmology.    The research supported by this award thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in its most fundamental directions:  deepening our understanding of the physical Universe at both the smallest and largest length scales, and furthering our knowledge of the basic building blocks and forces that make up and shape our Universe.\r\n\r\nThe broader impacts of the group's activities are directed toward increasing public interest in and improving public understanding of the exciting results of physics and astronomy. The group's activities include developing and teaching a COSMOS summer course on particle physics and cosmology to high-achieving high school students from diverse socio-economic backgrounds, programs to strengthen the representation of underrepresented minorities in physics and other STEM fields, a wide array of public talks and outreach activities through print and web-based media, the training of postdoctoral researchers and graduate students both at UC Irvine and around the world, and significant contributions in the area of professional service.",
