The meeting is focused on the theory of groups and rings and will attract top mathematicians from around the world, in addition to graduate students and post-doctoral researchers from all parts of the US. The conference will foster new collaborations, introduce graduate students to established researchers and cutting-edge techniques, provide young mathematicians with opportunities to present their work, and encourage participation by researchers belonging to under-represented groups. \r\n\r\nThis year the Ohio State-Denison Mathematics Conference features keynote talks devoted to GK-dimension of algebras, universal constructions in rings, and embedding results in groups. There will also be contributed talks on a wide range of other currently active areas of research, including clean rings, Leavitt path algebras, projective and injective modules, and solvable groups.",
