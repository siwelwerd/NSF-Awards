 "awd_abstract_narration": "Infrastructure and buildings are designed to have long life cycles - on the order of decades. Many buildings in the world are still in operation after centuries amid numerous renovation efforts. This long operational phase represents the majority of a building's lifecycle, yet the information regarding maintenance and renovation is rarely kept up to date. Building Information Models (BIMs) can alleviate this data shortage by centrally storing this data. However, even with a BIM, building updates are not kept due to the difficulty of continuous manual updates over a building's lifetime. This project will create a method to automatically update a BIM by exploiting recent advancements in machine vision. This automation process can systematically and continuously analyze the built environment, detecting changes from a previous assessment. It can distill and update the critical building information with minimal human error and effort. This research will result in a fundamental change in construction record keeping and benefit building operators by enabling maintenance and renovation activities to more easily be planned throughout a building's lifetime. The findings of this work will be integrated into undergraduate and graduate educational modules. Videos created for YouTube will also be developed to attract high school and underrepresented persons to a career in civil engineering.\r\n\r\nThe project will generate contextual-data relationships for use by an active illumination range camera-based, machine-vision system for automatically updating a BIM database with construction changes and leveraging metadata distilled from BIM object-oriented database models, the Computer-Aided Facilities Management (CAFM) database, and expert knowledge input by human operators. The project will tackle several intellectual challenges.  A primary challenge resides in the machine vision component of the work, which will need to provide additional meta-data beyond a 3D geometric model of an object, pushing the boundary of machine vision for the context of civil engineering systems. Another challenge is to extend data modeling capabilities for the built environment. Specifically, capabilities to translate meta-data from machine vision to identify and obtain meaningful contextual data that is specific for the objects will be created. A specific logical component, the Contextual Decision Maker (CDM), will also be developed to merge meta-data from multiple data sources. Finally, the entire system will be tested in an indoor renovation project to provide a realistic machine-learning process that will grow more robust over time.",

Paper-based floor plans often reference other paper drawings to deliver design intent to construction site crews. This complicated process sometimes results in the poor transfer of design intent between the designers and construction crews, which can cause quality, safety, and productivity issues in construction sites. How can the process of access to information in 2D drawings be improved to reduce the need to reference different sheets? This project responds to this question by implementing an AR workflow that provides more straightforward access from paper-based floor plans to digital design information without the need to refer to other sheets. In this paper, the current process of viewing and accessing information using 2D drawings was investigated. Then an AR workflow was created to facilitate access to the design information. Finally a case study was used to test the AR workflow against the conventional method of using 2D drawings, considering variables such as time, error, and user preference. The results showed that the AR workflow is more favorable and could improve time and reduce errors.
