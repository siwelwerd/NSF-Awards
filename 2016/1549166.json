 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study is focused on improving the understanding of the interactions between soluble iron (Fe) and organic material in fine particles in the atmosphere.  This research is relevant to the larger question of how atmospheric iron affects the processing and aging of the organics in atmospheric particulate matter.  The results will provide information useful to atmospheric chemists and to environmental health professionals.\r\n\r\nThe project will examine the importance of the Fe-assisted oxidation route of water-soluble organic carbon. It consists of three tasks: (1) field sampling, (2) characterization of the particulate matter, and (3) photochemical laboratory experiments.  The field samples will be analyzed to assess the sources of the atmospheric Fe, since the source of the Fe may determine its chemical speciation and, thus, its solubility and availability to chemical reactions.  Aqueous extracts of the field samples will be subjected to an artificial aging process and undergo analysis for oxidation state and the chemical speciation of total iron, and the production of reactive oxygen species will be quantified. By investigating the role of transition metals and taking into account aqueous chemistry, this project will offer a more complete picture of how organic compounds are \"aged\" in the atmosphere.  The results will provide useful information on the role iron plays in the processing of organic compounds in atmospheric particulate matter and the potential impacts of these mixed particles on human health.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nMotivation\n\nWater-soluble iron in the atmosphere is important from a human-health effects and an environmental chemistry standpoint. For example, when inhaled, soluble iron leads to lung inflammation.  Additionally, soluble iron helps to fertilize about half of the world's oceans, meaning that iron depositing into the open ocean may lead to algal blooms, affecting carbon dioxide uptake.  The amount of iron that is water-soluble, and thus available to chemical reactions, in urban and desert areas is starkly different. For soils and sand lifted into the atmosphere, generally less than 1 % of the iron is water-soluble.  However, in urban areas, that soluble iron fraction can range from 20-80%, and thus is available for chemical reactions.\n\nGiven the disparity in water-soluble iron levels between native soils and urban centers, this study aims to test multiple processes which lead to soluble iron. First, we test, directly, iron solubility in urban areas, and how the solubility varies in each area. Second, we test the chemical properties of the iron and the chemicals that the iron interacts with, to determine how other pollution sources, like vehicle exhaust, affects iron solubility.\n\n \n\nField Study\n\nTwo field studies are reported in this project.  First, ambient particulate matter with a diameter under 2.5 microns (PM2.5) was collected at three sites in the Eastern Plains of Colorado: one urban site (Denver), one agricultural site (Jackson Lake State Park), and one mixed urban/agricultural site (Greeley, CO). Results from this study showed both previously unreported and previously underreported phases of iron in the atmosphere.  That is, we have discovered that ?native,? or metallic, iron is actually quite prominent in the atmospheres studies here.  Additionally, we found iron-sugar complexes to also be ubiquitous.  Iron-sugar complexes have never been identified in atmospheric PM, and are expected to be highly soluble, so this is of great interest.  Additionally, filter samples from automobiles were analyzed for soluble iron. Here, we found that soluble iron can actually be produced from specific components of automobile exhaust, in part, helping us to understand origins of soluble iron.\n\n \n\nLaboratory Study\n\nIn support of the field study, the investigators used very controlled laboratory conditions to specifically test light-absorption capability of the water extracts.  An additional variable (sunlight) was also tested in order to understand the role of light as particles are transported through the atmosphere.  Briefly, it was found that the observed light absorbance capacity was higher in the urban site than in the rural. The observations correspond to a scenario where the PM2.5 are mostly produced in the urban site and are transported to the rural one, with a mean age of the PM2.5 higher in the rural site.\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nThis study supported three graduate students in Chemistry and Biochemistry: including one first-generation, disabled Chicano student, and one female student.  To date, two students have completed Ph.Ds. through this study. \n\nOver the course of this award, the PI and students have participated in library programs and outreach at local schools, exposing science to learners, young and old.\n\n \n\nSummary\n\nThrough results obtained from this study, we have learned much about iron in the atmosphere.  The three major results are that 1) Fe(0) is far more prevalent than originally thought, 2) Fe-sugar complexes are present and signifies that these metal-organic interactions need significant more study, and 3) iron solubility is enhanced by components in vehicle exhaust. \n\n  \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/27/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Brian Majestic"
