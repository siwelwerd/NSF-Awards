 "awd_abstract_narration": "EcoHealthNet 2.0 is global research coordination network led by EcoHealth Alliance and a strong array of scientists and institutional partners from the US and abroad. The global health community is facing increasingly complex challenges related to infectious disease.  The majority of emerging diseases, such as Ebola virus, Zika virus, SARS and pandemic influenza originate in animal populations. Many disease outbreaks occur when people alter their environment (e.g., agricultural expansion, deforestation) such that contact between wildlife, livestock, and human communities is increased. Currently, scientists, public health practitioners, and policy makers are not adequately prepared to address complex global health challenges due to limited opportunities for interdisciplinary training at undergraduate, graduate or professional stages. The EcoHealth Net 2.0 project is designed to change the current science education landscape and develop a new generation of interdisciplinary scientists who will be better prepared to study, prevent and respond to environmental changes and infectious disease. This project will develop and deliver content to thousands of students and educators on a global scale, mentor ecohealth research scientists, and create lasting connectivity among scientists and policy makers from different disciplines as they advance in their careers and face complex challenges in global health. \r\n\r\nEcoHealthNet 2.0 will connect world-class research scientists from fields of medicine, ecology, veterinary medicine, epidemiology, microbiology, anthropology, climate science, data science, and economics with undergraduate and graduate STEM students from around the world to advance One Health research and education. The program has three core activities: (1) Didactic training: Selected lectures will be hosted at partner universities coupled with three 1-week workshops that will provide multidisciplinary educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students from the US and abroad. Workshops will teach applied skills in fields of disease ecology, science communication, and policy, providing in-person contact time with working professionals and research scientists. Lectures will be publicly webcast, reaching thousands of students and educators globally. (2) Experiential learning: Undergraduate and graduate students will be competitively selected to participate in mentored research projects that teach One Health principles and research methods. (3) Professional networking: Participants will be connected to scientific agencies and professional science and policy associations such as the USGS National Wildlife Health Center, the US Agency for International Development, the Institute of Medicine, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Association for Ecology and Health, and the One Health Alliance of South Asia.",

In order to tackle complex, multisystem health challenges, like emerging infectious diseases, we need to train an innovative workforce that embraces dynamic, multidisciplinary solutions underpinned by One Health. EcoHealthNet 2.0, is a global research coordination program that seeks to provide STEM students with integrative training in the disciplines of One Health and disease ecology (Figure 1). The program connects graduate and undergraduate students from universities around the globe with world class scientists and practitioners in the fields of medicine, ecology, public health, virology, social science, climate science, and data science through a combination of workshops and mentored research exchanges. EcoHealthNet serves to exemplify the value of multidisciplinary education and professional collaboration, imploring students and mentors alike to seek interdisciplinary solutions to real world health problems.</p>\n<p>We held the EcoHealthNet Workshop held four times between 2017-2022. The first two workshops were conducted in person, hosted by Tufts University and George Mason University, respectively. Participants were selected with the goal of creating a diverse cohort with representation from various geographies and academic backgrounds. Students were assembled from around the world to partake in one week of multidisciplinary training through a combination of guest lectures, moderated panel discussions, and technical skill-based sessions, supplemented by intermittent field excursions. We designed the workshops to expose students to a breadth of topics in One Health that may not otherwise be covered in their curriculum, spanning themes on disease ecology, social science, data science, communications, global health policy, health economics, and pandemic management. Sessions were led by experts from world class research institutions, government agencies, intergovernmental organizations, and media platforms (Figure 2), lending to an atmosphere of invigorating discussion, tailored counsel, and invaluable networking. Students workshopped spatial modeling in GIS with leading computational scientists, listened to firsthand accounts of disease specialists on the frontlines of Ebolavirus, Nipah Virus, and SARS-CoV-2 research, and mock interviewed with professional science journalists.</p>\n<p>In response to the pandemic, we transitioned to a virtual model for the last two workshops, conducting live sessions asynchronously over the span of three weeks. We maintained the interactive nature of the in-person workshop by incorporating peer-mediated discussions and group activities that encouraged collaborative problem solving, opening the floor to dialogue between students and speakers at the end of every session. The pandemic undoubtedly challenged program implementation, but it uniquely positioned us to scrutinize facets of pandemic preparation, prevention, and response as they were unfolding in real time, which made for an invaluable learning experience. Many students expressed overwhelming gratitude for the opportunity to attend remotely despite global circumstances: ?Staying thousands miles away in this pandemic situation, I can be a part of this global classroom and the thoughts of a number of experienced panelists and students can effectively influence my approach to research? (2021 participant). Furthermore, we sought to expand our audience by recording the virtual sessions so that they may serve as an educational tool to remote learners beyond the confines of the program. Videos of the workshop recordings are now available to the public via our website (<a href=\"https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/program/ecohealthnet\">https://www.ecohealthalliance.org/program/ecohealthnet</a>) and will be shared broadly across our social media platforms to encourage viewership. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second component of the EcoHealthNet program was a mentored research exchange which matched students with a remote, field, or lab-based research placement where they developed a discrete research project under the mentorship of a senior scientist (Figure 3).&nbsp;Students were competitively selected based on merit, research interests and compatibility with their project(s) of preference. The program identified students at a developmental stage of their education or training such that participation would have a profound impact on their career trajectory. Scholars spent 6-12 weeks harnessing critical research skills such as hypothesis development, study design, data collection and analysis, monitoring and evaluation, and in several cases, manuscript writing and publication.&nbsp;Remote placements cultivated data-driven skills in programming, modeling, data management, phylogenetics, etc, whereas field placements fostered techniques in laboratory procedures, animal/environmental sampling, vector control, and questionnaire administration, among others.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Between the workshop and the research exchange, EcoHealthNet 2.0 trained a total of 97 students, representing 66 universities and 25 countries. For many participants, the impacts of the program, whether educational, professional, cultural, or philosophical, have been immeasurable. Access to applied research experience and a diverse network of peers and professionals, at no sustained cost to the participant, is invaluable and all too uncommon for emerging STEM students. Confronted with an education system that remains largely one-dimensional in its approach to health challenges, opportunities are urgently needed to provide multidisciplinary training and advance One Health education. We hope that the network of EcoHealthNet alumni will serve to inspire like-minded programs and to disseminate One Health philosophy throughout the scientific community.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/29/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jonathan&nbsp;H&nbsp;Epstein</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1618919/1618919_10455127_1672342472421_Figure1Final--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1618919/1618919_10455127_1672342472421_Figure1Final--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"EcoHealthNet Participant Summary\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1618919/1618919_10455127_1672342472421_Figure1Final--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"EcoHealthNet Participant Summary\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Summary of EcoHealthNet participant geography and academic programs 2017-2022</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">EcoHealth Alliance</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonathan&nbsp;H&nbsp;Epstein</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">EcoHealthNet Participant Summary</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1618919/1618919_10455127_1672342805821_Figure2Final--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1618919/1618919_10455127_1672342805821_Figure2Final--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"EcoHealthNet Workshop Summary\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1618919/1618919_10455127_1672342805821_Figure2Final--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"EcoHealthNet Workshop Summary\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">EcoHealthNet Workshop key content areas and associated speakers / student testimonials</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">EcoHealth Alliance</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonathan&nbsp;H&nbsp;Epstein</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">EcoHealthNet Workshop Summary</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1618919/1618919_10455127_1672343647356_Figure3Final--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1618919/1618919_10455127_1672343647356_Figure3Final--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"EcoHealthNet Research Exchange\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1618919/1618919_10455127_1672343647356_Figure3Final--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"EcoHealthNet Research Exchange\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Featured Research Exchange projects 2017-2022</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">EcoHealth Alliance</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jonathan&nbsp;H&nbsp;Epstein</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">EcoHealthNet Research Exchange</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1618919/1618919_10455127_1672344193809_Figure4Final--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1618919/1618919_10455127_1672344193809_Figure4Final--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"EcoHealthNet Workshop Images\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1618919/1618919_10455127_1672344193809_Figure4Final--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"EcoHealthNet Workshop Images\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A- 2019 Workshop\ufffds \ufffdNipah 360\ufffd webinar panel discussion.
