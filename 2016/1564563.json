 "awd_abstract_narration": "Urban areas are expanding rapidly around the globe, resulting in drastic changes to the environment compared to natural landscapes: buildings and parking lots replace natural vegetation in cities. The urban environment, which encompasses a major portion of the US, directly affects the ecology and evolution of species, but little research has been conducted to understand the intensity and scope of these effects. Another critical dimension of global change is biological invasions, which threaten biodiversity worldwide. This project connects two important dimensions of global change to test a novel hypothesis that urban adaptation may increase the success of biological invasions, which often have dramatic ecological and economic effects on the invaded habitats. This award will also support the STEM training of a postdoctoral researcher and numerous graduate and undergraduate students. Curriculum materials will be developed for K-12 education and outreach efforts will target the urban areas where this research will be conducted and where the research team members live. \r\n\r\nThe way organisms interact with their environment is expected to drive intense natural selection on their morphology and behavior. This work will study the crested anole lizard, which is native to Puerto Rico but established via human-mediated introductions in several places outside its natural range. This research will use field and laboratory studies to first test the hypothesis that a widespread lizard species is adapted behaviorally, morphologically, and physiologically to urbanization. Second, the study will test if adaptation occurs at multiple life history stages, including embryos and juveniles. Lastly, the study will investigate a novel idea in invasion biology that adaptation to urban environments may predispose populations to become successful invaders of other urban areas, using molecular data to identify source populations. Detailed portions of the research will estimate thermal tolerance and examine behavioral thermoregulation in different habitats, use SNPs to identify the source population of the invaders, and examine habitat influence on development in the field. This research will help to establish whether or not adaptation to urban areas can facilitate the process of biological invasion, and will likely lead to conclusions that can be generalized across other urban tolerant species and biological invasions.",

For example, clearance of natural vegetation and construction of roads and buildings profoundly changes structural habitats for organisms. The removal of trees and increased heat-absorbing surfaces (e.g.., concrete) leads to substantial increases in temperature in cities compared to surrounding rural areas (called the \"urban heat island effect\"). Consequently, many organisms must tolerate, acclimate, or adapt to these major environmental changes. Urban environments can also facilitate the introduction and spread of non-native species, as cities are typical ports of entry. This collaborative project focused on how urbanization alters various aspects of the environment relevant to the persistence and spread of invasive lizards in Miami, Florida. While collaborators at the University of Rhode Island and the University of Massachusetts Boston focused mostly on how these changes in structural habitat and thermal environments affect performance and physiology of adult lizards, our research at Auburn University focused on the impacts on developing lizard eggs. This early life stage is important to study for several reasons: 1) after reptile eggs are laid in shallow nests they are at the will of the environment - unlike adult lizards, eggs cannot move to a new location if temperatures get too hot; 2) some of the most important events in development (e.g. forming of limbs and organs) occur during embryo development and these processes are highly sensitive to temperature. If nest temperatures get too hot or too cold, this can have serious consequences on egg hatching success and the development of hatchling traits (e.g., brain development, body size, running speed); 3) no population can persist without proper embryonic development, so learning about egg survival of non-native species is important to understand how invasive species establish outside their native range.</p>\n<p>Our research shows that ground temperatures in urban greenspaces where lizards often nest reach lethally high temperatures during short periods of the day.

Specifically, females that inhabit urban areas nest in places that are more shaded than what is generally available across the urban landscape. This behavior shields eggs from lethally high temperatures and allows proper development.
