Granular materials are ubiquitous in a range of industrial and natural systems, yet a quantitative understanding of many phenomena remains elusive and predictive capabilities remain limited. Advances in this field require the participation of multiple scientific and engineering disciplines, each of which has its own goals and techniques. \r\n\r\nNSF funds will be used to support the registration and travel costs for junior and early career scientists and engineers at the 2016 Gordon Research Conference on Granular and Granular-Fluid Flows. Support will also be provided to allow participation of members of underrepresented groups. Such support will fill a crucial, national need to continue to train the future work force in the science of particle technology.",
