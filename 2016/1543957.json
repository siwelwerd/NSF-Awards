 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is a tropical root crop with exceptional drought tolerance, making it a critical component of food security for 800 million people in tropical regions of Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Despite its importance, cassava's current 12 to 24 month crop cycle limits the economic prosperity of smallholder farmers due to the length of time between harvest cycles.  Identifying new cassava varieties that bulk roots early in the crop cycle is an essential solution to overcome this time constraint. Selection for an early root bulking trait, however, is currently limited because it requires destructive digging of roots, unmanageable breeding trial sizes, and large labor costs. This project will improve trait selection by adapting a technology from geophysics called ground-penetrating radar to produce three-dimensional quantifiable images of cassava roots non-destructively.  Using ground-penetrating radar, early bulking root masses can be imaged underground. The goal is to select for cassava varieties that increase cassava yields by 25 to 50% by selecting early stage root bulking from existing high yielding genotypes.  The development of a commercial ground-penetrating radar instrument and associated data processing software for selecting early stage root bulking in cassava will provide cassava breeders throughout the world with the tools needed to develop new higher yielding cultivars.\r\n\r\nCassava is a tropical root crop that is exceptionally adapted to drought tolerance but has a prolonged life cycle of 12 to 24 months. This long duration limits harvest capabilities for smallholder farmers in the developing world, thus reducing the benefits of the crop as a component of global food security. Overcoming this limitation through selection of new cassava cultivars that exhibit early stage root bulking (ESRB) is an essential solution to ensure continued food security. This project will adapt ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to non-destructively develop 3-dimensional (3-D) quantifiable images of cassava roots. Current GPR instruments and analytical software are designed for subsurface imaging but not necessarily adapted for crop research. This project will use uncoupled GPR transmitters and antenna and an in vitro cassava trough assay system to develop an accurate and cost effective GPR instrument design for cassava breeding in terms of central frequencies emitted and antenna geometries.  Ancillary soil matrix data will be combined to allow the development of broadband GPR filter processes of root versus soil matrix specific frequencies, derive root allometries, and begin to convert the individual data processing methods into a streamlined decision support software for ESRB selection.  In the long term, the aim is to increase yield by 25 to 50% via GPR-based selection of ESRB from existing high yielding genotypes.  The project will ultimately develop an ideal GPR instrument and an easy to use streamlined data processing and decision support software needed by cassava breeders to develop higher yielding early bulking cassava cultivars.",

Development of novel GPR instrument for use in cassava root biomass quantification.  \n\nThe project teamed with IDS Georadar to develop a novel multi-array air-launch GPR antenna.  The antenna array can be classified as an air-launched, bistatic configuration of modified vee-dipole wideband 1.8-GHz vertically-polarized antennas . The array consists of 8 antennas, each separated by 4 cm, with alternating transmit and receive capability. The array is housed in a 3D-printed box. The radar was mounted on a custom aluminum cart and pushed through the plots. GPR scanning can be perfomed at 90&deg; nadir directly above the plot, and at 25&deg; towards the plot.  After use, the instrument was also fited with an electronic marker trigger on the cart such that electronic markers could be placed in the continuous row scan data at the beginning and end of each plot scan for post processingblocking of data into plot level units of data (See attach report (Figure 1)).  Both the instrument and novel marker system showed ideal performance with the exception that the need to mount the GPR antenna on a raised cart created some cart instability between the cart and moving the cart next to the root zone of low branch cassava genotypes.  Move GPR instruments through low branching genotypes is problematic and requires resolution not easily overcome by most GPR instruments avaliable. \n\n2. Development of novel GPR data processing decision support software. \n\n \n\nDr. Dirk Hays  Texas A&amp;M University program team consisting of 7 Ph.D. students a postdoctoral fellow (Research Scientist) and 2 software developers (also Ph.D students) were highly sucssful in developing both a desktop and cloud based version of GPR Studio and GPR Library capable of both functioning and highly efficient root and tuber quantification algorithm development platform and as a breeder bulk root selection platform.  The GPR Studio software was used by the 7 Ph.D. students in conjunction with the GPR instrument described above to develop root and tuber biomass quantification algroithms for root and tuber crops cassava, potatoes, and peanut, as well as crops with fibrous roots systems such as perennial sorghum and millet and the annual forage and grain crops wheat, barley, oat, rye and triticale see more description below.\n\nGPR-Studio is a software solution (developed by Dr. Hays Lab at Texas A&amp;M University) that offers users all the tools they need to process, analyze and visualize their data.

Development of novel GPR root biomass and ESRB quantification algorithms.   \n To date we have developed and published novel GPR root biomass quanitification methods using 2D and 3D threshholding, wavelet analysis, curvlet analysis and discrete Fourier transformation (DFT).  While wavelet analysis appeared promising in early testing, the method was unstable across rows in a plot and locations.  At present, both 2D and 3D image thresholding and especially power spectra derived from discrete Fourier transformation (DFT) of the GPR return data have demonstrated good reliability and stability in terms of accurate and multi-locational ESRB quantification algorithms.  The method was successful in defining algorithms across entire cassava trials in both Colombia at the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) and in Nigeria at the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA).  Development of these algorithms required the use of Bayesian ridge regression methods to account for the noise in the data derived from the interaction between the GPR cart and the low branching cassava genotypes. Our result show that models with GPR spectra as a covariate outperformed those without. While 41% of the variation in root biomass is explained (R2 = 0.41), with a Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.64. The results provide evidence that the GPR power spectra contains information about cassava root structure, and that a simple regression model without interactions between covariates produces the best mean prediction accuracy from both the cross validation and non-cross validation schemes. In addition, the algorithm derived from trials at IITA could predict cassava root biomass at CIAT trials with a Pearson correlation  coefficient (r) of 0.67.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/15/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Dirk Hays"
