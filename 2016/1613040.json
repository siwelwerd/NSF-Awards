The EoR is one of the last unexplored phases in the history of the universe. Broader impacts of the work include training of women and underrepresented minority students through a program called Research Experiences for Non-Traditional Undergraduates (RENTU).\r\n\r\nThe award will provide support for the US-based imaging power spectrum analysis team, which has been at the forefront of analyzing data from the Mileura Widefield Array telescope in Australia, and will provide one of the cornerstone analysis pipelines for the new Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), an NSF-supported radio telescope in South Africa.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe purpose of this award was to advance the field of 21 cm cosmology, a new radio astronomy technique with the potential to detect the signatures of the first stars and galaxies in the Universe.  Understanding the properties of these first luminous is of significant intellectual merit -- eventually they evolved into the stars and galaxies we see today, but the detailed physics governing their evolution is unclear, leaving a gap in our origin story.\n\nObserving the signatures of the first stars and galaxies is exceedingly difficult because of bright interfering radio signals from both humans and other astrophysical objects.  Under this award, we developed techniques for extracting the cosmological radio signal and applied them to data from the Murchison Widefield Array in Western Australia.  Of the utmost importance is modeling the array itself through a process generally referred to as \"calibration.\"  Without accurate calibration, the response of the radio array mixes signal and contaminants together in an inseparable way.  We developed new techniques to improve calibration and mitigate this contamination.  \n\nDuring the lifetime of the award, we developed new hybrid calibration techniques combining different approaches -- a feat made possible only through the unique capabilities of the Murchison Widefield Array.  We produced a precision map of the southern sky in low-frequency radio waves that will be invaluable for calibrating future experiments.  We also developed a number of simulation techniques for vetting our new algorithms as part of a larger analysis pipeline.  The end result were two landmark papers which each, in turn, placed the most stringent limits on the cosmological 21 cm signal to date.  These improved limits are interesting in that they begin to rule out some models of early universe physics, but more so because they demonstrate the potential for future success with our approach and illustrate the key challenges still facing the field of 21 cm cosmology.  \n\nDuring this award, we also developed a Research Experiences for Non-Traditional Undergraduates (RENTU) program to help undergraduate students from less traditional backgrounds (e.g. resumed education or veterans) gain substantive research experience.  In depth summer research projects are a key part of the undergraduate experience and an almost de facto necessary component of a graduate school application.  However, students with families or job responsibilities often cannot participate in these programs.  RENTU provides a student-first approach, identifying the student, and working with them to find a research project that works for their schedule and commitments.  Overall, we supported 5 RENTU students, helping create broader impacts on the US STEM workforce and the diversity of the graduate school population.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/27/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan Pober"
