 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project investigates what variables contribute to the emergence and new informal economic sectors, and what socioeconomic impacts these sectors have on trade and exchange. Industrial labor and formal, waged employment has declined in many countries across the world, accompanied by the shrinking of state-sponsored social security. Informal, precarious, and temporary modes of making a living have risen in their place. In many parts of the world, this arrangement is a harbinger of an economic future where ethnic, religious, and kinship relations figure more prominently in socioeconomic stability and access to resources. This project, which trains a graduate student in methods of conducting empirically-grounded scientific research, explores the factors that contribute to the emergence and durability of new informal sectors. The project has important implications for analyzing market behavior in critically understudied economic zones, where current economic policies are often unable to account for robust, yet unquantifiable \"informal\" sectors.\r\n \r\nGrace Zhou, under the supervision of Dr. Sylvia Yanagisako of Stanford University, will explore the implications of inequalities of privatization and liberalization in the economic sphere, which often produce unexpected solidarities that have the power to challenge existing hierarchies. Nowhere is the emergence and dominance of informal economies more apparent than in post-Soviet Central Asia, where the Soviet developmental state left behind few employment and government supports after its retreat. The research will take place in Osh, Kyrgyzstan, a major trading city between China and Russia, where the growing prominence of informal markets in the economic, social and physical landscape has become a symbol of the ineffective state. With little public trust in state institutions, amidst increasing dependence on the market's uneven distributive functions, marginalized communities are forging alternative routes for the distribution of resources and services. Research methods include interviews, participant observation, and social network analysis of individuals working in the informal sector. In conducting research on marginal groups in a key market hub of the region, this project will shed light on important new formations arising out of a tumultuous global economy. Exploring livelihoods that are based on a growing, vernacular tertiary sector has broader implications for public understandings of economic ingenuity, social mobility, and interpersonal exchange between heterogeneous groups of people.",

During two years of research with businesswomen, sex workers, and \"unemployable\" women, my project interrogated the imbrications of work and welfare in a context of state withdrawal. Working against the gendered devaluation of \"non-productive\" labor in both socialist and capitalist societies, I explored forms of intimate labor that have arisen to sustain livelihoods after the end of \"productivist\" economies. The main outcome of this research project is my doctoral dissertation, which is currently in progress. My dissertation (1) builds an expansive account of intimate labor; (2) theorizes intimacy, dependency, and distribution; (3) examines how these practices reproduce, challenge, or transform economic inequalities, social structures, moral subjectivities, and political possibilities.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;This project contributes to greater understanding about social, economic, and political change in the contemporary world. Wage labor was envisioned as the basis for legitimate citizenship and social personhood according to both capitalist and socialist teleologies of the 20th century. But since the 1970s, scholars across the social sciences have been writing about diverse transformations in the structural dynamics of labor, and in qualitative experiences of laboring, through \"emergent\" categories of labor variously labeled \"affective,\" \"immaterial,\" \"informal,\" \"illicit,\" or \"precarious.\" In a parallel vein, others have been writing about the retreat of the state and the implications of globally accelerating dynamics of devolution and privatization, decentralization, and deinstitutionalization. This project approaches these phenomena as one dynamic, one that comes together as a fundamental rewriting of a state's obligation to its citizens. My project raises broader questions about redistribution that has implications beyond academia. What if wage labor were no longer a sufficient measure of equitable wealth distribution or welfare provision? How do those wrestling with the decline of industry, waged employment, and state welfare imagine socio-economic futures? What would an equitable future look like in this context? Through the vantage point of post-Soviet Central Asia, this project provides an ethnographically rich depiction of the lived realities of people in Kyrgyzstan who have been grappling with these questions for almost three decades. In a context where many people can no longer expect wage labor to facilitate their incorporation into modern life--despite the fact that in reality, this expectation only ever materialized for some people, and for a relatively short span of time--webs of intimate sociality sustain diverse activities of livelihood-making, and act as force fields where economic pursuits, political subjectivities, and social positions are actively constituted and negotiated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">This project also improves public knowledge about socio-economic realities in Central Asia. Policy analyses of Kyrgyzstan foreground the geopolitical importance of a region criss-crossed by gas pipelines, drug routes, military supplies, and Euro-Asian trade agreements. The region's significance is often framed through its relations to world powers. China's New Silk Road project has poured billions of dollars into Central Asia for roads, railroads, and pipelines, improving mobility for people and goods alongside a particular brand of Chinese development. Russia's Eurasian Economic Union recruited Kyrgyzstan as its fifth member in August 2015, promoting trade and labor exchange among its members. My ethnographic project highlights the people whose desires, actions, and failures occupy the everyday realities of these top-down trade agreements. This is especially relevant when current economic policies are often unable to account for robust, yet unquantifiable \"informal\" sectors like booming reexport and resale bazaars across Kyrgyzstan. Work in these sectors, often driven by women, have profound impacts on individual and societal well-being. Exploring livelihoods that are based on a growing, vernacular tertiary sector has broader implications for public understandings of economic ingenuity, social mobility, and interpersonal exchange between heterogeneous groups of people.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Other than the dissertation, which is currently underway, the concrete outputs of this project have so far taken the shape of conference papers and presentations.
