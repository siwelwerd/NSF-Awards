 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project entails the fundamental study of condensation phase change on nanoengineered surfaces, covered with an ultrathin hydrophobic or super-hydrophobic coating. A significant outcome of the project is the possibility of engineering or \"designing\" better (more resilient) surfaces. The study has potential to impact several industries, such as power utilities, heating ventilation and air-conditioning equipment, electronic devices, and desalination systems.\r\n \r\nThe main objective is to determine the surface coating defects formation, degradation and nucleation dynamics during condensation, which is key to enhancing longevity and heat transfer effectiveness of the surface. A new advanced scanning probe microscopy technique will be utilized for process visualization. Educational effort is very broad, involving research experience activities for k-12 teachers and students, new laboratory activities for undergraduate engineering students, and a new graduate course.",
