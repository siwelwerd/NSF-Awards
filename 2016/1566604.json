 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamic & Mechanism B Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Amelia Fuller of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Santa Clara University is studying the synthesis and properties of large molecules that mimic compounds found in nature.  The synthetic methods to make these compounds allow Professor Fuller to easily change structure and chemical composition, ultimately enabling a comparison of these variations on molecular function.  The three-dimensional structures of these molecules and their abilities to bind to metal ions is studied.  These molecules have potential application as therapeutics and sensors.  Experiments are being conducted by undergraduate students in two venues: in Professor Fuller's independent laboratory, and in an introductory undergraduate organic laboratory course at Santa Clara University.  Integration of research experiences into the course curriculum enhances the scientific training of approximately 50 undergraduate students over the course of the award. \r\n\r\nMacrocyclic peptide-derived natural products exhibit a range of applications as potential therapeutics, supramolecular hosts, and metal-binding agents.  These inspire the design, synthesis, and study of diversely functionalized macrocyclic N-substituted oligoamides. The syntheses provides access to diverse macrocycles that include either azole heterocycles or carbocyclic aromatic rings in the oligoamide backbone.  Examples to be prepared modulate appended functionality, ring size, and ring flexibility, all of which are anticipated to confer interesting conformational and functional contributions.  Their structures are investigated in solution and in the solid state.  The capacity of azole-containing macrocycles to bind metals in analogy to azole-containing peptide-derived natural products is evaluated.",
