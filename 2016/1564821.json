 "awd_abstract_narration": "This National Science Foundation (NSF) Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (S-STEM) project is a collaborative effort between Arizona State University, Central Arizona College, Cochise College, Eastern Arizona College, Estrella Mountain Community College, Glendale Community College, Mesa Community College, Mohave Community College, Phoenix College, and Yavapai College. The program will provide scholarships for talented, low-income students with demonstrated financial need who are pursuing degrees in engineering or computer science. In addition to scholarships, the program will provide academic and other support to increase the persistence of these academically talented, low-income students.  The project design includes an academic success and professional development course along with project-based activities.  Faculty and industrial mentors help students to envision the potential career opportunities and benefits available in engineering and computer science. Nine of the ten collaborating schools are classified as Hispanic Serving Institutions. Scholarships and support for low-income and academically talented students, who may not otherwise be able to obtain engineering or computer science degrees will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic well being of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe project seeks to address the need to expand the engineering and computer science workforce by increasing the success of Arizona State University students including students that transfer from community colleges. The program combines a network of engineering mentors with a successful student-centered and mentor-driven academic success and professional development course to significantly increase the number of community college students that consider, choose, continue and graduate with a bachelor of science in engineering or computer science.  At the center of the proposed initiative is a commitment to involving students in career-shaping projects that will permit them to discover, nurture, and fully develop their technical interests. Guided by grounded theory and social cognitive career theory, the project will also study the factors most central to maintaining effectiveness while scaling up a successful student-centered and mentor-intensive transfer student support system to encompass a larger group of collaborating institutions. Community colleges will play an increasingly important role in educating the nation's engineers. This statewide project will serve as a collaborative model for four-year and two-year schools across the nation. This research will provide knowledge helpful in establishing a transfer student support program in Arizona and will inform other university and community college networks in other parts of the United States. The findings from the program will be disseminated widely to the engineering and computer science education community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe purpose of this S-STEM ASAP scholarship program is to discover, nurture and develop future engineering talents to meet our states and countrys anticipated growing demand for a skilled and diversified workforce. This workforce will contribute to our high-tech economy and the U.S.s global competitiveness. The activities in this project are designed to help students take control of their career, maximize their job prospects and help them prepare to participate in the ongoing technological revolution. Phoenix College (PC), a Hispanic Serving Institute (HSI), seeks to recruit students who are pursuing degrees in the fields of computer science, engineering, and related STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) fields that leads to potential engineering careers. We are trying to get more students to opt for a STEM related career  especially engineering.\n\n\nEngineering is a multidisciplinary and cross-disciplinary area of study. Students taking engineering classes must take other prerequisite STEM courses to satisfy their basic knowledge requirements. The engineering courses that we teach have stimulated the need for courses in other disciplines. Their enrollment stimulates the needs for classes in other disciplines such as: Physics, Chemistry, Geology, Astronomy, Biology, and Mathematics. This project will act as a force multiplier in our efforts for the recruitment and retention of students in the engineering and related STEM areas. It will also make it easier for our students to transfer to universities or other four-year higher education institutions.\n\n\nThis project has been working the past seven years to help our students. We had awarded the scholarship to 39 unique individual students. Some of the students continued to participate with our project for multiple semesters (up to three semesters). They have to reapply for the scholarship each semester. Seventeen of our students graduated and had transferred to ASU (Arizona State University) and UofA (University of Arizona) to further their studies in Engineering. To date, 43.6% of our student participants had graduated and transferred to universities. The performance of our student participants was better than the average students attending our college. The average graduation rate for students at Phoenix College is about 13% to 15% over the same period. We believe that our program is helping a number of students finish their freshman and sophomore education to continue into the universities. The supports provided by this project have proven valuable for current scholars in encouraging their continued commitment to STEM field studies and perseverance in completing educational goals. This project also offer students glimpses about the demand and rigor needed to work in a STEM area  especially engineering. It is also better for students, who may not make it in the field, to decide early in their educational process to opt for other areas of endeavor.\n\n\nThe project had mentored these students with professional advice and career guidance. We also gave them research opportunities to further enrich their experiences relating to activities associated with the engineering endeavor, beyond the activities in a normal classroom environment. It is important that students get hands-on skills that can be used in the workplace, besides the conceptual and theoretical training that they get in their lectures, before they go out to work. We are trying to teach our students about various aspects of the designing, prototyping, feasibility testing, integration of modular components and manufacturing processes. We had collaborated with other colleges and programs within our school in an attempt to give our students a well-rounded experience.\n\n\nThe activities provided by our program try to help the students develop and improve academically and professionally. The environment fostered by this program is not Work for Pay, with most of the activities being performed on a voluntary basis by our students. We feel that our activities are for encouragement, exchange of ideas, collaboration, guidance and inspiration. Most students attend these sessions regularly. Many of our students come from under-represented, disadvantaged, minority populations where they are often the first person in their family to ever attend college and also their families dont have a role model working in a technical area such as Engineering or a STEM related field. The two co-PIs for this program had years of experience working at companies in industry, government agencies, and now in academia. We came from similar circumstances, as our students, and are trying to pay back for some of the mentorships/guidance and opportunities that were given to us by our various past mentors. The project also worked on outreach/school events to make Phoenix College a brighter Beacon of Hope for our students and surrounding communities.\n\n\nThis project was working to try to reverse past trends by increasing awareness to STEM careers, especially engineering, opportunities to our students and helping to develop more of them to be capable of working in an increasing high-tech, innovation-oriented workforce  to maintain the U.S. strategic competitiveness in the world market.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: EddieOng\n"
