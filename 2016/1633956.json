 "awd_abstract_narration": "This study investigates whether and how school classrooms become spaces of citizenship formation. The project focuses on the Arizona Revised Statute (ARS) \u00a7 15-112, which is the basis for elimination and alteration of ethnic studies courses in Arizona public and charter high schools. The ban focuses on specific courses, despite research showing how those courses are central to student success. Debates surrounding such courses reflect concerns about the U.S.-Mexico border, migration, and what constitutes American culture. Project investigators inquire into the process by which school classrooms and specific types of school curricula shape national identity, citizenship practices, and educational outcomes. The project focuses on the role of education among underrepresented groups to foster inclusion and national identity, and is directed and conducted by individuals who are underrepresented in STEM fields. The data will be disseminated through conference presentations and publications, reports to participants and through the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research. Ethnic studies courses are currently a topic of similar debate in other states, and an analysis of the impacts of the ethnic studies ban in Arizona is likely to inform decisions made elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThis research examines the following questions: 1) How do high school classrooms function as political spaces, and what are the associated educational outcomes? 2) Does the ban promote a form of whitened citizenship in the United States? If so, how? 3) What are the processes of citizen-subject formation available to teachers and high school students in this context? The project's intellectual merit derives from new disciplinary engagements with the geographies of young people and the role of the school as both a system and a space in constructing and producing the citizen. Until recently social science research on minors emphasized parenting and behavioral studies, and largely ignored the political context of minors. This project addresses the distinctness of political spaces inhabited by teenagers and how they are engaged in the process of citizen formation. The investigators will collect data through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with policy-makers, teachers, activists and former students; narrative analysis of court documents and public records; and direct observation of classes, Arizona House of Representatives Education Committee meetings, and Tucson Unified School District school board meetings. This combination of qualitative approaches is designed to triangulate information about professed beliefs, political narratives, and observed behavior.",

The ban specifically targeted at Mexican-American studies (MAS) and there is disagreement among supporters of the bill over whether it should end at the dissolution of MAS courses, or whether this is only a first step in eliminating all ethnic studies courses in the state of Arizona. Ethnic studies advocates in Tucson defended the MAS classes, citing research showing that students enrolled in them were more likely to do well on standardized exams, graduate, and go on to college (Cabrera et al. 2014). This research project follows the ensuing legal battles over ARS &sect; 15-112 and locates the struggles over the MAS ban both within contemporary struggles to define what it is to be American and the role race plays in understandings of the nation, and the public school&rsquo;s historical role in citizen formation. While our analysis is incomplete at this time, at the moment we see three important themes emerging:</p>\n<p>1) Two opposing understandings of racism were employed in debates that reflect the different understandings of racism at play in nation-wide discussions about the role of race in contemporary American society. These two understandings of racism allow for entirely different approaches to addressing the problem of racialized inequality in educational outcomes. The first understanding of racism, supported by proponents of ARS &sect; 15-112, suggests that racism is something felt or done by individuals, born specifically out of hatred for another race and/or a named desire to promote the supremacy of your own racial group. Defenders of MAS understand racism to be not merely the actions or thoughts of an individual, but systemic. This understanding of racism sees it as something that can be maintained without individualized hatred. Because of this, defenders of MAS see a need for both systemic restructuring to address issues of racial inequality in school systems and creating classroom spaces where systemically marginalized students&rsquo; cultures and histories are centered. Proponents of ARS &sect; 15-112 reject the idea that there is a systemic source of racialized inequality that promotes unequal outcomes and so prefer individualized approaches to inequality in educational outcome such as tutoring or looking to improved teacher training and more &ldquo;rigorous&rdquo; curriculum. Understanding this rift in views on racism as it pertains to education may be key to better future communication about and analysis of policy plans designed to address uneven educational outcomes.</p>\n<p>2) Defenders of ARS &sect; 15-112 often couch their arguments in terms of favoring an individualistic society and express concern over a perceived promotion of collectivist ideas in the MAS curriculum via centering shared histories, experiences and cultures. Individualism was touted as one of the primary identifiers of American culture, while group solidarity was considered &ldquo;anti-American.&rdquo; We perceive conflict here between the idea of solidifying American ideals that should be taught to all Americans through the education system, and the idea that group solidarity should be discouraged and intend to investigate these lines of reasoning further.</p>\n<p>3) The author of ARS &sect; 15-112, former Arizona state superintendent, Tom Horne, employs a &ldquo;rhetoric of rudeness&rdquo; to rationalize targeting MAS.
