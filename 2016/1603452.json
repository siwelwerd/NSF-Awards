 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Greenland Ice Sheet is the largest ice sheet in the northern hemisphere.  However, as the arctic warms the ice sheet has been retreating, and as a result, altering the fundamental nature of weathering and the delivery of nutrients and elements to the ocean.  The proposed work is focused on the hydrological, biological, biogeochemical, and the isotopic signatures of proglacial watersheds, which are watershed that convey dilute but high volume glacial meltwater from the top and underneath the ice sheet to the ocean, and deglacial watersheds, which are watersheds that are no longer physically connected to the ice sheet and sourced only by annual precipitation and permafrost melt.  The PIs contend that while deglacial watersheds have received less attention, preliminary work suggests they may be equally or more important than proglacial watersheds for oceanic and atmospheric fluxes.  Moreover, as the ice sheet melts, the area contributing to meltwater and constituent fluxes will increasingly be from deglacial watersheds.  The understanding gained from this work will provide a context for the  prediction of future land-ocean and land-atmosphere fluxes in response to continued ice sheet retreat. \r\n\r\nResults of the project have the potential to change our understanding of global CO2, nutrient, and isotope cycling in response to ice sheet collapse and permit predictions of the future responses to global warming and ice sheet retreat.  Results will also provide a context to interpret past high latitude ice sheet retreat and climate change based on marine isotope records.  The project includes training for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral researchers, as well as a collaboration with students and faculty at a Greenlandic academic institution.\r\n\r\nThe proposed study will test the hypotheses that (1) deglacial and proglacial watersheds contribute distinct elemental, isotopic, and nutrient fluxes to the ocean and atmosphere as a result of evolving weathering patterns, and (2) these reactions and associated fluxes will change within and between watersheds as the Greenland Ice Sheet retreats. The project focuses on three field areas: deglacial and proglacial watersheds near Kangerlussuaq and Narsasuaq and a deglacial watershed near Sisimiut.  Each area has a distinct water balance, exposure age, and weathering characteristics, and will be sampled three times over two melt seasons to evaluate intra-seasonal and inter-annual variations.  Mass balance models and PHREEQc modeling of solute data will be used to identify and assess extents of weathering reactions. Weathering extents will also be estimated based on trends in proportional contributions of minerals and offsets between dissolved and bedload strontium and lead isotope ratios, and will be linked to phosphorous fluxes and organic carbon lability and degradation. This holistic approach will provide a broad view of the relative elemental, nutrient and isotopic fluxes in proglacial and deglacial environments.  These results will provide magnitudes, time scales, and drivers of weathering reactions, with a goal of linking fluxes to past records and future predictions of global climate change associated with continental ice sheet collapse.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAs ice sheets retreated following the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~20,000 years ago), they exposed glacially crushed, fine-grained sediment susceptible to chemical weathering reactions.  These reactions impact stream water compositions and solute and gas delivery to the ocean and atmosphere that in turn alter ocean ecosystems and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations (Fig. 1) and produce a record of ice sheet advance and retreat in deep sea sediments.  The effects of glacial retreat on chemical weathering can be studied along the exposed margins of Greenland because there is a continuum from landscapes exposed 11,000 years ago near the coast to landscapes adjacent to the only remaining northern hemisphere ice sheet.  For this study, samples of stream water, stream sediment, and bedrock were collected from proglacial watersheds that drain meltwaters from outlet glaciers near the town of Kangerlussuaq and three deglaciated watersheds that are isolated from ice meltwater and span a ~150 km transect between the coastal town of Sisimiut and the ice-proximal town of Kangerlussuaq in southwestern Greenland (Fig. 2).  Samples were also collected from a proglacial system and four nearby deglaciated watershed near the town of Narsarsuaq in southern Greenland.  Samples were collected during three field seasons: early (spring freshet) and late (fall freeze-in) melt seasons in 2017 and peak summer melt season in 2018.  Discharge from the proglacial river near Kangerlussuaq has been continuously monitored since 2016 and discharge of five sampled deglaciated watersheds was monitored as part of this study.  Selected samples were analyzed for major element, trace element, and nutrient concentrations, carbon dioxide and methane concentrations and carbon isotope ratios, and Sr isotope ratios.\n\nSample analyses reveal distinct differences in stream water compositions and fluxes from proglacial and deglaciated watersheds driven by distinct biogeochemical processes in glacial and non-glacial streams.  Meltwater draining from beneath outlet glaciers is supersaturated with methane compared to atmosphere, indicating glacial meltwaters are a source of this greenhouse gas to the atmosphere and may enhance warming.  In contrast, meltwater carbon dioxide varies between super- and undersaturated concentrations, depending on the extent of subglacial organic matter and mineral weathering reactions (Fig. 3).  Therefore, the climate impact of this greenhouse gas depends on local subglacial processes. Non-glacial stream compositions are impacted by chemical reactions in lakes as indicated by differences in major element and nutrient concentrations of streams flowing into and out of Oqummiannguup Lake in Sisimiut.  Major element exports from the lake are enriched compared to inputs early in the melt season but become diluted compared to inputs during the melt season.  In contrast, exports of the nutrients Si, PO4, and NO3 from the lake are lower and NH4 is generally higher relative to imports to the lake (Fig. 4).  These results indicate biogeochemical processes such as mineral weathering, organic matter degradation, assimilation by primary productivity, and sequestration into oxide mineral precipitates within lakes, as well as mineral reactions in ground water flowing into deglaciated lakes, provide key controls on solute exports to the ocean.  When nutrient fluxes are compared between glacial and deglaciated watersheds, dissolved inorganic nitrogen, (DIN), PO4, and labile organic matter fluxes are lower and Si fluxes are higher from non-glacial compared with meltwater streams when normalized to their catchment areas (Fig. 5).  These differences imply that DIN, PO4, and labile organic carbon exports to the ocean would have been high and Si exports would have been low as extensive proglacial meltwater systems developed during rapid ice retreat with similar responses expected as future global warming increases meltwater export.  In contrast, as ice sheets stabilized ~6,000 years ago, meltwater discharge decreased compared to non-glacial runoff and thus DIN, PO4, and labile organic carbon exports to the ocean likely decreased and Si exports increased. \n\nAlong with identifying potential impacts on solute and greenhouse gas fluxes with retreat of continental ice sheets, this project has provided training opportunities for six undergraduate, students, one graduate student, and two post-doctoral researchers in high latitude research, laboratory analytical techniques, data analyses, development of international collaborations, and presentation of results to scientific and more general audiences.  All of the students and post-doctoral researchers were engaged in the project research activities including making presentations at major meetings and co-authoring abstracts and peer-reviewed publications.  Of particular significance to human impacts is the development of collaborations between researchers at the University of Florida and Greenlandic researchers, primarily at Asiaq, the Greenlandic Survey, and at the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources, a branch of Illisimatusarfik?University of Greenland.  These collaborations resulted in co-authorship of peer-reviewed publications and developed the framework for future collaborations.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/17/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ellen E Martin"
