 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Protein Folding Dynamics \"Folding: The Landscapes of Natural and Synthetic Life\" will be held at the Hotel Galvez in Galveston, Texas, January 10-15, 2016. The meeting will bring together senior scientists, postdoctoral researchers and graduate students from a wide range of interests and approaches to protein folding dynamics. The nature of the conference allows close interaction among participants, who can share their ideas and results. By bringing together researchers from chemistry, physics and biology to explore recent exciting developments in this field in a concrete forum that encourages open discussions from researchers working on different systems, the new paradigm of cross-disciplinary research is strengthened.\r\n\r\nThe conference will assemble experimentalists and theoreticians to discuss basic issues in protein folding dynamics and their role in function, in the evolution of protein sequences and in disorders associated with protein misfolding. It has become increasingly clear that understanding the details of protein folding dynamics is crucial in describing virtually all processes of life, including protein synthesis, co-translational folding, protein allostery, protein function and diseases related to protein misfolding. The conference will cover a range of topics namely in vitro and in vivo folding, protein aggregation, protein evolution and design, and the role of protein dynamics in function. The 2016 conference is expanding to include complete formal sessions on protein evolution and the folding of non-biological foldamers and even complete chromosomes. This expansion was partly in response to requests from previous years' participants but also the current organizers believed that extending the range of topics would add to the intellectual merit of the conference. Participants will able to spend time together over a week of talks and presentations, thus allowing synergy of ideas and identification and solutions of a variety of problems.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe 2016 Protein Folding Dynamics GRC focused on the protein folding problem that has long been regarded as a fundamental mystery blocking our understanding of how the genetic information locked in DNA is transformed into a dynamic living organism.  In the last decades, however, a basic understanding of the folding process has been achieved.  The keys to this progress include borrowing theoretical ideas about energy landscapes from condensed matter physics and physical chemistry, employing powerful computer simulation techniques and bringing to bear new experimental tools such as single molecule methods and ultrafast spectroscopy, as well as elaborating the classical kinetic techniques of biophysical chemistry while exploiting the capabilities of protein engineering.  Thus many communities from physics, chemistry and biology have merged to form the discipline of protein folding dynamics.  Many of the fundamental issues about how proteins fold remain under intense investigation.  New frontiers include understanding the diversity and basic time scales of folding larger proteins building on what has been learned in small model systems.  Also we can now enquire how folding behavior has evolved in natural history, using huge quantities of genomic data.  Folding is now known to be an emergent property.  Recognizing this, to test our understanding, the community is now also exploring whether folding can be instantiated in completely novel designed systems, s-called \"foldamers\".  Folding is not just a preliminary step to biological function but is intimately involved in functional processes such as allosteric change and molecular recognition.  Furthermore the evolution of these capabilities has shown its mark on protein folding dynamics, an area of great ferment bringing together a new group of biologists.  The misfolding of some proteins seems central to the progress of many diseases such as Alzheimer's and here the new tools of the folding community are bringing new insights.  Finally we now can ask whether the hard won paradigms of protein folding dynamics gleaned from studying small globular proteins can be applied to membrane protein folding in which other biological actors are implicated as chaperone's.  Also can folding concepts be applied to studying how the very largest structures in the cell are organized, such as chromosomes?  Sessions at the meeting covered both new developments in the basic areas as well as applications of folding dynamics to more complex biology.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/31/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Peter Wolynes"
