 "awd_abstract_narration": "Advances in information technology are making it possible to collect increasingly massive amounts of multidimensional, multi-modal data across a diverse range of disciplines including bioinformatics, neuroscience, and the social sciences. One particular area where such multidimensional, multi-modal, and often nonlinear data is collected is neuroscience, in particular human brain connectomics. Connectomics aims to offer a comprehensive framework to describe neuronal connectivity by constructing networks from multi-modal and multi-subject, as well as both temporal and spatial, data. These high dimensional datasets pose a challenge to the signal processing community to develop data reduction methods that can exploit their rich structure in order to extract meaningful summarizations. Over the past several decades a tremendous amount of work has focused on the analysis and compression of high dimensional point-cloud datasets via low-dimensional manifold and subspace techniques. Although the research on low-dimensional structure learning from vector-type data is well developed, the direct application of these methods to higher order data poses significant challenges, including both increased computational complexity, and their inability to capture the couplings across different modes. This research addresses these problems through a tensor-based framework for data reduction and low-dimensional structure learning with a particular focus on reducing dynamic functional connectivity networks (dFCNs) into physiologically meaningful network components.\r\n\r\nThe investigators develop two complementary approaches to address this high order data reduction problem: 1) Robust low-rank+sparse linear structure learning algorithms for tensors; 2) Multi-scale, locally linear adaptive tensor decomposition algorithms for compressing and learning structure from tensor data. Finally, this tensor based framework is applied to dFCNs constructed from electroencephalogram (EEG) data to assess well-known salience and control functional networks associated with affective regulation and cognitive control.",

The first focus of the project was dimensionality reduction of tensors. Large datasets usually contain redundant information and summarizing these datasets is important for better data interpretation. Higher-order data reduction is usually achieved through low-rank tensor approximation which assumes that the data lies near a linear subspace across each mode. However, nonlinearities in the data cannot be captured well by linear methods. In this project, we developed a multiscale tensor decomposition to better approximate local nonlinearities in tensors. The proposed multiscale approach constructs hierarchical low-rank structure by dividing the tensor into subtensors sequentially and fitting a low-rank model to each subtensor. This unsupervised higher-order manifold learning approach provides a way to summarize higher-order data by taking advantage of multiscale structure to better deal with intrinsic nonlinearities. This approach has been shown to provide higher compression rates with similar or better reconstruction accuracy compared to existing tensor decomposition methods. The second focus of the project was supervised learning with low-rank tensor approximations. Two major challenges that confound current tensor based supervised learning algorithms are storage complexity and computational efficiency. In this project, we addressed these problems by employing tensor-trains, a hierarchical tensor network structure that parameterizes large scale multidimensional data via a network of low-rank tensors. First, we introduced a supervised discriminative subspace learning approach based on the tensor-train model, referred to as tensor-train discriminant analysis (TTDA). We then introduced a multibranch tensor network structure for efficient implementation of TTDA. The multi-branch approach takes advantage of the flexibility of the tensor network structure by reordering the low-rank projection and core tensors to reduce both storage and computational complexity. Multi-branch implementations of TTDA are shown to achieve lower storage and computational complexity while providing improved classification performance with respect to both Tucker based and existing tensor-train based supervised learning methods.
