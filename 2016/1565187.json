Advance in Functional Polymers with Sophisticated Branched Structures?, to be held in Philadelphia, PA, Aug.21-25, 2016. The  symposium?s objective is to fill a gap in the coverage of these important polymeric species among recent ACS symposia. The species include star polymers, graft polymers, molecular brushes, dendrimers, and variously branched polymer structures constructed from supermolecular assemblies. Advances, and novelty in structure design, synthesis, characterization and applications will be emphasized. The meeting will provide an open platform for active researchers to present their recent achievements, and allow for the exchange and dissemination of knowledge, ideas, and visions among researchers including graduate student and postdoctoral fellows.",
