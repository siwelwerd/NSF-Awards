 "awd_abstract_narration": "In many physical systems, large and orderly structures are formed without distant parts of the system communicating directly. Understanding these structures is a long-standing challenge in probability theory; this project focuses on the mathematical study of these structures. One class of these, percolation, has arisen to study various random networks: for instance, underground rock formations carrying oil, traffic networks in cities, and polymer chains. Another class of these, Abelian networks, arose to describe situations where energy builds up microscopically until it reaches a certain threshold and then causes a large \"avalanche,\" and has been used to model earthquakes. A major issue the work under this project will touch on is how widely-separated (in space or time) parts of the random structure depend on each other: for instance, how do early topplings in an avalanche influence those occurring much later? These questions have connections to other important physical systems as well as to optimization problems from computer science.\r\n\r\nThe research under this award will study correlations and fluctuations in disordered systems (first-passage percolation and related disordered magnets) and critical systems (percolation, and Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld models also known as sandpiles). A primary focus in first-passage percolation will be the order of fluctuations of the random metric and its relationship to properties of geodesics. In critical percolation, the work will focus on the scaling of the chemical or graph distance in large finite clusters -- in particular, bounding the chemical distance exponent in two dimensions. A final focus will be structural properties of avalanches in the Abelian sandpile model, including the question of stabilizability of sandpiles in two dimensions.",

In many cases, even physicists have conflicting or unclear predictions for the behavior of such systems; the project contributed to the solution of several such problems, and should help clarify the behavior of these physical phenomena. The mathematical tools developed here could also find use in other disciplines. As an example: the \"fast path\" questions mentioned above involve the study of an optimization problem similar to those arising in computer science, and methods developed here could provide insight in such problems. Similarly, tools developed in this project should find use in other areas of mathematics. In particular, methods of \"concentration of measure\" developed here relate to issues from the area of mathematical analysis, and the Bak-Tang-Wiesenfeld model (one of the systems studied in this project) has been examined in a different light by researchers in the field of algebra.\n\nWhile under grant support, the PI has been involved in several activities related to building international collaborations and to training junior researchers. The PI has participated in the mentorship of several students; most recently (in summer 2020), involving a CCNY master\u2019s student in the project\u2019s research. The PI has joined with the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences to organize an international conference and workshop, which aims to build international collaborations on these issues and introduce graduate students to this rapidly growing area of mathematics.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/22/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jack T Hanson"
