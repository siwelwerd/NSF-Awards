 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project, acquiring a Riscure Inspector system to provide advance instrumentation for side-channel measurement and analysis, aims to provide the country with a unique capability within the Gulf Region to engage in cybersecurity research of side channel vulnerabilities, countermeasure development and analysis, and fault injection testing for security and reliability of critical infrastructure devices.\r\n\r\nSide channels are unintended information paths that occur as a side effect due to physical implementation properties, electrical devices that could contribute to information assurance (IA) and cyber security research and education to an institution with a track record in these areas. Unintended side channels introduce significant cyber security risks to computing systems and critical infrastructure. This instrumentation enables a significant expansion in its capabilities in side-channel security research critical to securing embedded devices used in cryptographic applications, medical devices, and smart cards.\r\n\r\nThe instrumentation enables faculty and students to be at the cutting edge of critical cyber security research issues. USA's School of Computing (SoC) is a fast growing academic unit on campus with a core focus in cyber security research collaborating on security-focused cross disciplinary initiatives. Hence, this system is expected to position the institution towards becoming a national leader in cyber security research and education support. The university traditionally meets the needs of a diverse student body with a high percentage coming from rural or financially depressed areas. It has higher than 60% of female students, and more than 1/3 non-while student population. The students will be afforded hands-on opportunities in research and classroom activities directly utilizing the side-channel system. The skills gained are expected to lead directly to internships and permanent employment. The instrumentation also provides opportunities for doctoral students in both SoC and CoE and offers opportunities for cohort activities for CoC?s current Scholarships for Service program. It additionally supports existing K-12 outreach through Center to Center for Forensics Information Technology and Security (CFITS).",

The system also allows us to perform fault-enabled side-channel injections from both an electromagnetic and optical (i.e., laser) source.  This specialized system, the Riscure Side Channel Analysis (SCA) and Fault Injection (FI) system, has allowed us to reach our goals through impacting three primary areas: 1) expanding research programs and capabilities, 2) expanding educational and training opportunities, and 3) expanding outreach opportunities.\n\nFrom an intellectual merit and research perspective, the system has been critical to the exploration of side-channel vulnerabilities and countermeasure development.  Side-channels are unintended information paths that occur as a side effect due to physical implementation properties of electrical devices. Unintended side-channels introduce significant cyber security risks to computing systems and critical infrastructure.  In cryptographic devices, side-channels can leak keying material that is otherwise computationally infeasible to break through traditional approaches.  Even mathematically proven cryptographic mechanisms, such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and the public-key RSA standard, are subject to side-channel weaknesses due to na&iuml;ve implementations. The equipment provided in this award enabled the completion of four related projects, to include three externally funded projects as part of an NSF Industry/University Collaborative Research Consortium and the completion of an undergraduate honors thesis.  These projects resulted in two peer-reviewed conference publications and one peer-reviewed poster presentation.  These projects also served as a catalyst for doctoral and masters research topics for continued use of the capabilities provided by this grant.\n\nOur educational and training opportunities contribute to both intellectual merit and broader impact.\n\nAs part of the initial system acquisition, five personnel (three faculty / two students) were trained and certified directly from the equipment manufacturer.  In turn, three additional students were trained in-house for advanced system use.  Over the life of the grant numerous training sessions were held coving both side-channel analysis against common cryptographic algorithms as well as fault injection to bypass smart-card PIN protections.   In total, these training sessions included contact hours to 17 undergraduate and two graduate students.  These students were from four different disciplines (Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Information Technology) and included 14 undergraduate, one master?s, and two doctoral students.  Additionally the system was used two consecutive years as part of a course offering in hardware security, reaching 21 undergraduate and two graduate students over both Computer Science and Computer Engineering disciplines.\n\nOur final goal directly supports broader impact as part of our ongoing outreach initiatives to our K-12 and industry partner programs.  The Riscure system has become a focal point for tours to industry partners as well as K-12.  This has allowed us to provide community awareness on cyber vulnerabilities that must be considered during system use and development.  Industry tours have led to follow-on project development, while student tours have assisted recruitment efforts into our academic programs.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 11/08/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Todd R Andel"
