 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Rochester Institute of Technology will implement a collaborative project to investigate whether specific 21st century competencies are being cultivated in postsecondary classrooms and workplace training, and the cultural, organizational, and systemic factors that support or impede such practices. Researchers will also examine how educators and employers define critical workforce competencies, student and employee experiences with education/training and the transition from school to work, and types of cross-sector partnerships that bridge the gaps between higher education and STEM industries. The fields investigated include photonics, information technology, energy, and advanced manufacturing industries in four regions in the U.S. with high concentrations of STEM jobs -- Seattle, WA, Raleigh, NC, Houston, TX, and Denver, CO. The study will result in a comprehensive account of how educators in a sample of 2- and 4-year institutions as well as STEM-related industries think about and actively cultivate key 21st century competencies. It will provide empirical evidence of how and when students and employees attain transferrable skills that are critical for their success in school, life, and work.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research team will use a framework integrating field theory, cultural models theory, and systems dynamics to guide a mixed-methods study to investigate five research questions: (1) How do educators and employers define, value, and incorporate into instruction and workplace training the essential 21st century competencies of collaboration, problem solving, communication, and self-regulated learning?  (2) To what degree do students engage in these competencies in the classroom?  (3) How do students and employees define, value, and think they are learning about these skills?, (4) What is the nature of cross-sector relations between education and industry in each region? and (5) Which individual, organizational, and sectoral factors influence whether (a) these skills are cultivated in school and/or work, and (b) active learning techniques are utilized?  A concurrent mixed-methods design will involve collecting interview data from faculty and administrators (n=80) and business owners (n=80), classroom observation data from faculty (n=64), focus group data from students (n=80) and employees (n=80), and survey data from a larger sample of educators and employers (n=464). To study instructional practices, a new module focusing on 21st century competencies will be developed for the Teaching Dimensions Observation Protocol (TDOP), and data will be analyzed using the ICAP (interactive, constructive, active, and passive modes of learning) framework. Data will be analyzed also using inductive content, social network, logistic and multiple regression, and causal network analytic techniques as appropriate to the dataset and research questions. The research team will hold one-day workshops for local stakeholders in each region, as well as a summative national conference, to present regional field data, provide training on how to integrate key 21st century competencies into existing curricula and workplace training programs, and to open new lines of communication between and among educators, employers, government, and other community members.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in three thematic areas: STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation, and STEM workforce development.",

The study also examined how faculty and trainers teach those competencies, and how students and employees have experienced that training.</p>\n<p>A large and high-quality mixed-method dataset was obtained from study sites in regions with a high concentrations of STEM jobs (Houston, TX, Raleigh, NC, Denver, CO, Seattle, WA). The dataset included interviews with 32 employers, 93 educators, and 60 focus groups with 206 students. The industries included health care (e.g., nursing), energy (e.g., petroleum engineering), advanced manufacturing, and computing related fields. Surveys of 1140 educators at 2- and 4-year colleges and 630 STEM employees were also obtained.</p>\n<p>The project supported research training for 2 postdoctoral researchers as well as 2 master's students, and 14 undergraduate students, many of whom contributed to papers and conference presentations.</p>\n<p>The project has helped bring issues of career-preparation and workforce development into more of the mainstream of discipline-based education research in the sciences. While most undergraduate STEM curricula emphasize concepts and ideas, other skillsets, including 21st century competencies are often at the fringes of the curricula and are less studied by researchers. This study's findings on industry practices as well as faculty teaching practices will lead to a better integration of workplace-relevant scenarios and skills in undergraduate STEM coursework.</p>\n<p>The analysis of employee and student interview data provided new perspectives on mathematical problem-solving in workplaces and disciplinary variation in problem-solving. Several forms of mathematical problem-solving were identified, spanning a breadth of purposes, such as doing math to obtain conceptual understanding of a problem, design a part, &nbsp;fabricate an object, or use data to answer questions. These mathematical problem-solving activities differed in their end goals, the various representations of math that were used, and the essential steps in the process. Likewise, when studying disciplinary variation in problem-solving we identified how the importance of risk and safety within a discipline affects attitudes toward failure, with some disciplines taking very proactive measures to minimize failure while others leverage frequent cycles of testing, failure, and revision to quickly converge on solutions. Our findings highlight the need to provide STEM students with exposure to a wide range of problem-solving activities throughout their education.</p>\n<p>Communication and teamwork also were a significant focus of the analysis. Much of the evidence calling for communication instruction in higher education tends to refer to lists of generic skills desired by employers and ignores how competencies like communication are complex and nuanced. Communication is at the center of social interaction and tied to particular professional scenarios, contexts and cultural norms. Data from EMPOWER revealed that effective communication is more than making technical or workplace-specific jargon understandable to laypersons but also involves an awareness of the particular situation and the key characters. For instance, professionals having to deliver a grim health diagnosis to family members is much different than troubleshooting with crews about broken equipment off an offshore oil rig. Communication decisions must do more than recognize that these scenarios are different, they must consider empathy, efficiency, directness, etc. and be responsive to the people involved. As called for by many Communication in the Disciplines scholars, communication education for college students must go beyond the generic strategies and instead use a more discipline and workplace specific model where students learn to develop an understanding of oral genres, cultural and social norms, and then make communication decisions based on that understanding.</p>\n<p>In an effort to respond to our own call for more holistic communication education, we developed guidance and frameworks for integrating communication and teamwork into college-level science education, specifically in the discipline of physics. Communication education provided within physics contexts is essential for deepening students' physics content knowledge while also developing communication competencies and promoting career success.</p>\n<p>Through an analysis of instructor interviews we have also characterized instructor's perspectives on 21<sup>st</sup> century competences as well as how and why they integrate them into courses.
