The program will serve three cohorts of 15 participants each, each of whom will receive a Graduate Certificate in Academic Leadership.\r\n\r\nBroader Impact\r\nWith the focus of this project on women STEM faculty in Historically African-American Colleges and Universities, this project will contribute significantly to increasing gender diversity in the leadership ranks at these institutions. By supporting women of color in STEM fields in realizing their leadership potential, this program will help ensure that students and faculty in these disciplines will benefit from the skills, wisdom, breadth of experience and unique perspectives that such women will provide. The model designed for the TCSPP Academic Leadership Graduate Certificate Program has promise for broad dissemination across its eastcoast, midwest, and westcoast campuses and their wide professional networks.",
