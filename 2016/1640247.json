 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of California Irvine (UCI) project, called CS1C@OC, will provide in-service teachers\r\nin Orange County (OC), California a program of study that will satisfy California's new teacher\r\ncertification pathway in Computer Science. Despite the demonstrated need for students to learn\r\nfoundational computer science skills, few K-12 students have access to rigorous CS courses. CS\r\nremains privileged knowledge, and improving access to this knowledge is one of the major\r\neconomic security and social justice issues of the 21st century. The CS community has struggled to\r\novercome issues of access and equity, although some enormous strides have come in teaching tools,\r\npedagogies, and standards. But none of these accomplishments can be broadly implemented or\r\nsustainable without certification pathways for CS teachers and teacher preparation programs,\r\nespecially for those teaching in underserved communities. CS1C@OC will develop such a CS\r\nteacher preparation program, specifically for California's new CS Supplementary Authorization.\r\n\r\nCS1C@0C aims to (1) increase in-service teachers' CS content knowledge and their competence and\r\nconfidence in evidence-based pedagogical practices for teaching computer science to diverse\r\nlearners; (2) increase diverse students' knowledge and skills in computational thinking and\r\ncomputer science principles as well as their interest in taking more CS courses; and (3) increase the\r\ncapacity of Orange County schools to provide CS courses. CS1C@OC will recruit and train 100\r\nsecondary school teachers--our share of the CS10K project (OC has approximately 10% of the\r\nnation's population)--largely from low-income communities serving underrepresented\r\npopulations, with preference given to teachers who, along with their school, make a commitment to\r\nteach Exploring Computer Science (ECS) and/or Computer Science Principles (CSP). UCI will\r\nprovide summer courses in CS content and pedagogy that will satisfy the requirements for\r\nCalifornia's newly-approved Computer Science Supplementary Authorization (which PI Richardson\r\nproposed and developed along with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing) while\r\nemphasizing CS instructional approaches that have proven successful with females and students\r\nfrom low-income, underrepresented communities. The project will also develop a hybrid\r\nprofessional learning community (PLC) for participating teachers and including existing OC CS\r\nteachers, so they can share information and experiences, continue to learn from each other, and\r\nhave further opportunities to develop themselves both personally and professionally throughout\r\nthe school year. The project will evaluate impact on teacher learning and development as well as\r\nimpact on student learning and attitude changes.",
