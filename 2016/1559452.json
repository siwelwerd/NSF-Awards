 "awd_abstract_narration": "Increasing awareness of environmental issues has led to interest in renewable energy sources and waste materials recycling. This collaborative project between Adelphi University (US) and Warsaw University (Poland) will address these topics by focusing research on the development of novel, smart materials for alternative energy sources and new methods of water purification using solar energy.  The project will increase the number of future U.S. workers who can understand and solve these important issues while increasing their ability to partner with international researchers who are also interested in these topics. This US-Polish International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project provides eight-week, photochemistry and nanotechnology research opportunity for twelve US students at Warsaw University, Poland. Specific efforts will be made ensuring the involvement of underprivileged and underrepresented in STEM minorities. Prior to their internships in Poland, students will spend the academic year working in research laboratory at Adelphi University developing essential technical skills relevant to the proposed research. This early-career research experience will enhance the professional training and education of the US undergraduate students by exposing them to modern instrumentation, advanced nanotechnology research, and its practical application. IRES students will develop global competencies through experiential education in an international environment motivating and inspiring young US researchers to invest in future research careers and become agents of change in today?s world. \r\n\r\nResearch efforts will focus on fabrication and characterization of nanohybrids combining CdX (X=S, Se) thin films with conducting polymers and wide-bandgap semiconducting metal oxides for photovoltaic and photocatalytic applications. Detailed studies of the nanohybrids formation process and their characterization will help to identify the key parameters influencing the semiconductor heterojunction quality, such as: materials? choice, their synthesis and processing, in order to correlate their composition, structure and performance. The experiments proposed in this project will test this hypothesis. Both, material synthesis and characterization of the photoelectrochemical and photocatalytic properties will be performed using state-of-the-art electrochemical, spectroscopic and microscopic instrumentation available at Warsaw University laboratories. The US-Polish team expects to gain a better understanding of the basic working principles of these nanohybrid materials in order to increase their effectiveness and construct high efficiency solar cells and photocatalytic devices for environmental remediation. Successful completion of the proposed research would suggest solutions on some environmental issues, such as: hazardous waste treatment and low cost, high efficiency, alternative energy sources. The results of this project will be disseminated by conference presentations, journal publications and community outreach.\r\n",

This U.S.-Polish International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project created a unique opportunity for U.S. students to acquire early career research experience abroad in the fields of materials science and nanotechnology working with renowned scientists. Through the collaborative research, scientists from Adelphi University (USA) and Warsaw University (Poland) acquired results that led to nanotechnological advances suggesting solutions on some environmental issues, such as: hazardous waste treatment and low cost, high efficiency, alternative energy sources. These research findings bring a major benefit for the society by helping to improve future, environmentally friendly technologies.</p>\n<p>The US-Polish IRES team has made new fundamental findings in two areas: photovoltaics (A) and photocatalysis (B). Research efforts were focused on detailed studies of the nanohybrids? formation process, their composition, structure and performance characterization. This research advanced the understanding of the key parameters influencing the quality of the formed heterojunction between the inorganic and organic semiconductors. The combination of several semiconductors with matching bandgaps makes them to be more efficient photoactive hybrid material comparing to single components due to better light absorption and increased charge separation efficiency. The results of this research improved the knowledge about processing and combining the semiconducting materials in order to control the composite?s architecture and fabricate the most effective, visible-light driven, photoactive hybrids.</p>\n<p>(A) These photovoltaic composites were fabricated in different configurations: i. CdSe deposited onto substrate with polymer deposited on top (substrate/CdSe/polymer), ii. polymer deposited onto the substrate with CdSe deposited on top (substrate/polymer/CdSe), iii. the simultaneous deposition of CdSe and polymer (substrate/(CdSe/polymer). It was found that the efficiency and photostability of these composites are affected by the nature of the deposition surface (Pt, Au or HOPG), relative amount of both components and their deposition order. The systematic design approach helped to find the optimal parameters for the formation of the best composition and architecture of a stable, visible-light driven photocatalytic composite. The prepared HOPG/CdSe/POMA photoelectrode shows photoelectrochemical properties superior to the single component photoelectrodes, as well as composites of different configurations. This visible-light driven photoelectrode has a potential application in solar cells. This work shows the approach in creating an effective semiconductor interface and optimizing the thickness of both components in order to get the best performance of the fabricated composite.</p>\n<p>(B) Photocatalysis is important in the degradation of industrial waste products. This inexpensive and eco-friendly method breaks down dangerous organic pollutants into safe compounds like carbon dioxide, water and short-chain acids. Initially, the fabricated photocatalytic systems were tested for the degradation of harmful organic dyes as model compounds and then for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol. The following composites: ITO/WO<sub>3</sub>/Au/C<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, ITO/WO<sub>3</sub>/TiO<sub>2</sub> and FTO/TiO<sub>2</sub>/CdS/PDAC revealed the best photocatalytic activity in 4-chlorophenol degradation under visible light. The changes of morphology and optical properties of the hybrids with relative amount of all components were monitored. The kinetics and mechanism of photocatalytic reactions were determined. A conducting polymer thin film suppressed photocorrosion during photocatalytic process and its amount was optimized taking into account heavy metal ions? concentration released to the solution and the hybrids? degradation efficiency.</p>\n<p>The results of this collaborative research were disseminated as oral and poster presentations at various conferences and published in two manuscripts in high impact factor peer reviewed scientific journals.
