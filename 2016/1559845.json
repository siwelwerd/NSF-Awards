 "awd_abstract_narration": "This renewal of a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site program at the University of Maryland College Park (UMCP) will provide undergraduate students with a strong academic background and research experience focusing on sustainable transportation systems. Recruitment specifically will focus on women, underrepresented minorities, persons with disabilities and students from colleges and universities where research opportunities in STEM are limited. All the REU Site projects are related to the area of transportation electrification, which acts as a common intellectual focus. The program will enhance the practical and theoretical foundation of students in the areas of power electronics, energy storage (battery, ultra capacitor and fuel cell), controls, optimization and mathematical modeling of grid integrated vehicles, and sustainable transportations by exploring creative, original, and transformative concepts. Over 40% of green house gas and 70% of emissions come from transportation which is largely dependent on one source of fuel, which is petroleum.  Electrification of transportation is one of the ways to become independent of oil.  The main broader impact of this REU program is ensuring the highest quality integrated education and research to meet the emerging workforce and educational needs of U.S. automotive and energy industries by educating young and talented undergraduate students in this field.  It is essential to point out that since the transportation industry is going through a major restructuring it is critical to train young minds in this field. The integrated research and educational activities of this REU Site will certainly facilitate this objective. \r\n\r\nOver a three year period, this REU Site program will engage undergraduate students in a 10-week intensive, summer research experience focused on sustainable transportation systems. The primary objectives of this REU program are to 1) annually recruit undergraduate students specifically from underrepresented groups and institutions with limited research opportunities, train them in basic research and provide laboratory experience in transportation electrification-related engineering projects, 2) promote the skills to become a successful researcher by providing insights into research methodologies, self-discipline, team integration, reporting and exchanging new\r\nknowledge, 3) expose students to the broader implications of their research, 4) help students prepare for graduate school and define career pathways, 5) integrate ethics discussion and training into all aspects of their experience, 6) develop collegial interactions between students and faculty and between students themselves, 7) increase the number of students, specifically from underrepresented groups, pursuing graduate studies in the field of transportation electrification, and 8) provide opportunities for participants to present and publish their work with faculty mentors.",
