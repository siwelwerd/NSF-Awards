 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will provide support the fourth conference of the Arab-American Frontiers program series which will be held in Abu Dhabi, UAE from November 5-7, 2016 and is co-organized by local partners the Masdar Institute, New York University Abu Dhabi, Khalifa University and the Petroleum Institute of Abu Dhabi. The project will provide an opportunity for approximately 35 early-career US scientists to attend the three day conference of approximately 100 total attendees. Participants are selected through a competitive application process, ensuring a meeting of research-active scientists and engineers who are ready to capitalize on the ideas and relationships developed at the conference. \r\n \r\nThe goals of the workshop are to: \r\n1)\tEnhance scientific dialogue and exchange among young researchers in Arab countries and the United States;\r\n2)\tEncourage and strengthen scientific collaboration and the transfer of techniques and approaches across disciplines within and beyond the Middle East/North Africa (MENA) region and the United States;\r\n3)\tEmpower young scientists, engineers, and medical professionals to assume leadership roles in their fields and beyond.\r\n\r\nGiven the limited opportunities for US scientists to interact with colleagues from the Middle East and North Africa, this meeting will provide an unparalleled opportunity for research-active, exceptionally promising young scientists and engineers to share their work and develop new ideas and opportunities for collaboration.\r\n\r\nThe conference purposely focuses on several topics that are not directly related to encourage the participants to make connections beyond their field of study and to facilitate interdisciplinary dialogue that may offer new, unexpected insights. Participants at previous workshops have highlighted this broad interdisciplinarity as an intellectual highlight of the meeting. The focus areas for this meeting were developed by the volunteer organizing committee and represent globally important topics in which the Middle East has valuable expertise and is investing important resources. All five cutting-edge topics are multi-disciplinary areas that will benefit from greater interdisciplinary dialogue. \r\n?\tSolar Energy and Water for Sustainable Living\r\n?\tNanotechnology for Next Generation Electronics and Photonics\r\n?\tExploring the Brain\r\n?\tAdvances in Petroleum Geosciences, Oil and Gas Exploration\r\n?\tNew Spacecraft Technologies for Earth and Space Exploration \r\n\r\nFurther development of ideas for cooperative work that develop at the conference will be facilitated by small collaboration grants for which participants may apply after the meeting. The previous three meetings have now been followed by 25 collaboration grants. Noteworthy bilateral and trilateral collaborations are underway, including work in groundwater quality assessment and purification, epigenetic cancer research, climate change impacts on plant physiology, and nanomaterials.",

The fifth symposium was held in Morocco in 2017 in partnership with l'Ecole Nationale Superieure d'Informatique et d'Analyse des Systemes (ENSIAS) and Mohammed V University.

The meetings convened about 64 general participants, 24 speakers and 12 organizing committee members from 12 Arab countries and the United States. Through formal presentations, the subsequent panel discussions, and three poster sessions, the 2016 symposium in the UAE covered advances in solar energy and water research; nanotechnology; neuroscience; petroleum geosciences; and new spacecraft technologies for earth and space exploration. The 2017 symposium in Morocco covered advances in water, sanitation, and hygiene; renewable energy; precision medicine &amp; cancer; smart agriculture; and smart cities. The session panels and daily poster sessions generated new ideas for cross disciplinary innovation that do not usually take place in regular single discipline-focused conferences. Based on the latest post-symposium survey,&nbsp;<strong>77.4 percent</strong>&nbsp;of the participants learned about new developments in their fields, while nearly&nbsp;<strong>93.5 percent</strong>&nbsp;of the participants believed the symposium gave them access to ideas and inspiration outside of their field that they plan to pursue</p>\n<p>Over the past two years, a total of 20 Arab-American Frontiers fellowships were awarded to pairs of participants who intended to collaborate on a research topic of common interest. For example, Dr. Ali Mirchi (Oklahoma State University, USA) and Dr. Adel Zghibi (University of Tunis El Manar, Tunisia) have met for the first time in Morocco and they have been awarded an Arab-American Frontiers fellowship to work on \"Use of Smart Water and Energy Metering for Sustainable Groundwater Management\". As a result, Dr. Mirchi visited Dr. Zghibi in Tunisia in March 2018 and gave a seminar at University of Tunis El Manar on water resources management in the Middle Rio Grande basin. The seminar covered portfolio-based urban and agricultural water management. Dr. Mirchi also visited irrigation districts in the eastern coastal zone of CapBon in northeastern Tunisia to learn about on-the-ground groundwater management practices to support irrigated agriculture.&nbsp; During the fellowship, Dr. Mirchi and Dr. Zghibi submitted a joint proposal for research funding to the cycle 7 of the USAID-sponsored PEER program.They received a PEER grant in August 2018 to work on \"The use of modeling, monitoring and smart metering for sustainable groundwater management in a Tunisian coastal aquifer\".</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impacts:</strong></p>\n<p>The 2016 and 2017 Arab-American Frontiers symposia served as an excellent opportunity to build new collaborations and establish research partnerships. Our most recent survey indicated that 70 percent of the US respondents did not have any interaction with Arab scientists prior to their participation to the Arab-American Frontiers symposium. The same survey indicated that for 93.5 percent of the U.S. attendees identified potential collaborators at the Frontiers symposium.</p>\n<p>The Arab-American Frontiers fellowships in particular are an excellent opportunity for training and developing new research networks for both visiting and host fellows. Visiting fellows are exposed to new research ecosystems and they have the opportunity to interact with members of the host fellow's research group and department. In addition, advancing research in the fields covered by the plenary sessions can have major societal impacts and improve lives in the U.S. and the Arab region.&nbsp; For example, two 2016 Frontiers participants, Dr. Firas Kobeissy (American University of Beirut) and Dr. Khalid Salaita (Emory University) are collaborating to explore targeted spherical nucleic acid nanotheranostic combinations for traumatic brain injury therapy. With no currently available FDA approved neurotherapy techniques for brain injury, this research has the potential to significantly impact those afflicted by a traumatic brain injury, including public servants and veterans.</p>\n<p>Finally, the symposia provided a platform to young scientists from the Arab world and the US to be more visible, grow professionally, and learn useful leadership skills. The symposium is participant-driven and is therefore an excellent opportunity for attendees to strengthen their leadership, communication skills, and expand their professional network. According to our recent survey, 90% of the respondents said that the symposium was useful for their professional development.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified:
