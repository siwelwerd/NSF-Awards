 "awd_abstract_narration": "This Noyce Master Teaching Fellowship project seeks to provide activities for the development of 16 school-based leaders in mathematics, who are deeply grounded in sound content and research-based pedagogical, leadership, adult education, and mathematics advocacy skills.  The master teachers will participate in coursework that highlights mathematics content and pedagogical techniques and complementary Advancement via Individual Determination (AVID) Path Trainings on classroom strategies that utilize writing, inquiry, collaboration, organization, and reading (WICOR) and culturally relevant teaching.  The master teachers will have a variety of opportunities to take leadership roles such as performing mathematics demonstrations, co-teaching courses, and acting as district advocates in their high-needs schools.  The project involves collaboration between the Rice University School Mathematics Project, Tapia Center for Excellence and Equity, and Glasscock School of Continuing Studies, AVID, and educators from the Houston Independent School District.\r\n\r\nThis Noyce Master Teaching Fellowship project will utilize Avid Path Trainings and complementary, content-rich graduate courses to develop master teachers ability to prepare college-ready, STEM students.  The focus on WICOR and culturally relevant teaching are in response to an emerging body of research that recommends that training for instructional leaders integrate high-quality instructional methods in an equitable learning environment.  A novel aspect of the project is the introduction to adult education skills that master teachers will receive, which they will then apply as they mentor other teachers.  This work is grounded in the theory of andragogy, which has six principles that address adult learners' (1) need to know, (2) self-concept, (3) prior experiences, (4) readiness to learn, (5) orientation to learning, and (6) motivation to learn.  Project evaluation will include assessment of the master teachers' effectiveness through Teaching for Robust Understanding of Mathematics classroom observation protocols, leadership through a modified version of the Survey for AVID Teachers, and adult education skills through the Andragogical Practices Inventory.  The Diverse Disposition Index will be use to assess their understanding of diversity and equity issues.  The results of the evaluation plan will be disseminated throughout the region through the Texas Education Agency, Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, Charles A. Dana Center at the University of Texas in Austin, Texas Regional Education Service Centers, and the Harris County Department of Education.",

Recruitment of 16 MTFs took place during the summer and fall of 2016. Selection took place in the late fall of 2016 after which the 16 selected MTFs were notified of their acceptances. MTFs' first meeting was held in the spring of 2017 to prepare for the first summer of professional development activities. MTFs jumped into the rigorous mathematics coursework and leadership building activities during this summer (2017) and second summer (2018). Another Noyce Track 3 group from the University of Louisiana Lafayette visited to observe our MTFs in action and for conversations about leadership (spring, 2018). MTFs' leadership activities positively impacted their school communities, HISD, and Rice University (Math Circle, Math-Letics, Life in Schools, and the Rice University School Mathematics Project [RUSMP]) through 2019. Many of the MTFs were also making time to serve as mentors for pre-service teachers at other universities.</p>\n<p>COVID-19 struck the greater-Houston area in the spring of 2020. Instruction in HISD moved from in-person to a virtual format in March, 2020. MTFs were called upon to take the lead in a variety of ways so that the essential work of schools could continue. They prepared videos, supported colleagues at their schools and across the district, and reassured parents and students. The challenges of COVID-19 prompted MTFs to step up their leadership efforts across HISD - assisting teachers with virtual instruction and helping parents support their children?s learning. MTFs were the acknowledged leaders in this transition to a virtual teaching environment. Their expertise and talent ensured that RUSMP's 2020 and 2021 virtual summer programs were successful as well as RUSMP's 2020 Fall and 2021 Spring Virtual Networking Conferences, and the NSF 2021 Robert Noyce Lessons Learned Conference (Fall, 2021).
