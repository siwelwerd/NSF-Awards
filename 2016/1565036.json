 "awd_abstract_narration": "Algebraic geometry is the study of solution sets of systems of polynomial equations called varieties. Symplectic varieties are varieties equipped with a notion of length so that around each point the variety looks like an even-dimensional vector space.  Symplectic structures arise naturally in classical mechanics, the branch of physics that describes the motion of macroscopic objects.  The main goals of this research project are to use tools from linear algebra and geometry to better understand and exploit natural symmetries enjoyed by symplectic varieties known as symplectic resolutions. The work is expected to strengthen connections of the field with geometric representation theory, combinatorics, and string theory.\r\n\r\nIn more detail, this research project consists of four interrelated subprojects. The first subproject is to study symplectic duality between pairs of symplectic resolutions. This duality is closely related to mirror duality for 3-dimensional gauge theories. The second subproject is to prove a conjecture relating the intersection cohomology of a symplectic cone to the quantum cohomology of its symplectic resolution. The third subproject is to classify hypertoric varieties using zonotopal tilings, much in the same way that toric varieties are classified by fans. The fourth subproject is to study a new invariant of a matroid called its Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nSymplectic duality is the study of the mathematical relationships between certain pairs of geometric objects (the Higgs and Coulomb spaces) arising in string theory.  One of these relationships is described by what is known as the Hikita Conjecture, which relates the cohomology ring of one space to the coordinate ring of the other.  My collaborators and I formulated a generalization of this conjecture called the Quantum Hikita Conjecture, which relates the quantum cohomology ring to the quantized coordinate ring.  We also proved this conjecture in a number of special cases.\n\nMatroids are combinatorial objects that abstractify the notion of linear dependence, and for each matroid one can define a polynomial called the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial.  My collaborators and I wrote nine papers and preprints on Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of matroids during the period of this project.  The highlights of this work were:\n\n1.  The definition of the equivariant Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial of a matroid with symmetries, and the calculation of this polynomial for arbitrary uniform matroids;\n\n2.  The definition of the Z-polynomial of a matroid, which has proved to be a powerful new way of thinking about Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials;\n\n3.  A perspective on finding geometric interpretations of Kazhdan--Lusztig--Stanley polynomials and Z-polynomials that unites previous work on classical Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials, g-polynomials of polytopes, and Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of matroids;\n\n4.  Defining and studying the augmented Chow ring of a matroid, which lays the technical groundwork for a forthcoming proof the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials of arbitrary matroids have non-negative coefficients.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/22/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nicholas J Proudfoot"
