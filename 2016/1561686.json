 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of Wisconsin-Madison and the Rochester Institute of Technology will implement a collaborative project to investigate whether specific 21st century competencies are being cultivated in postsecondary classrooms and workplace training, and the cultural, organizational, and systemic factors that support or impede such practices. Researchers will also examine how educators and employers define critical workforce competencies, student and employee experiences with education/training and the transition from school to work, and types of cross-sector partnerships that bridge the gaps between higher education and STEM industries. The fields investigated include photonics, information technology, energy, and advanced manufacturing industries in four regions in the U.S. with high concentrations of STEM jobs -- Seattle, WA, Raleigh, NC, Houston, TX, and Denver, CO. The study will result in a comprehensive account of how educators in a sample of 2- and 4-year institutions as well as STEM-related industries think about and actively cultivate key 21st century competencies. It will provide empirical evidence of how and when students and employees attain transferrable skills that are critical for their success in school, life, and work.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe research team will use a framework integrating field theory, cultural models theory, and systems dynamics to guide a mixed-methods study to investigate five research questions: (1) How do educators and employers define, value, and incorporate into instruction and workplace training the essential 21st century competencies of collaboration, problem solving, communication, and self-regulated learning?  (2) To what degree do students engage in these competencies in the classroom?  (3) How do students and employees define, value, and think they are learning about these skills?, (4) What is the nature of cross-sector relations between education and industry in each region? and (5) Which individual, organizational, and sectoral factors influence whether (a) these skills are cultivated in school and/or work, and (b) active learning techniques are utilized?  A concurrent mixed-methods design will involve collecting interview data from faculty and administrators (n=80) and business owners (n=80), classroom observation data from faculty (n=64), focus group data from students (n=80) and employees (n=80), and survey data from a larger sample of educators and employers (n=464). To study instructional practices, a new module focusing on 21st century competencies will be developed for the Teaching Dimensions Observation Protocol (TDOP), and data will be analyzed using the ICAP (interactive, constructive, active, and passive modes of learning) framework. Data will be analyzed also using inductive content, social network, logistic and multiple regression, and causal network analytic techniques as appropriate to the dataset and research questions. The research team will hold one-day workshops for local stakeholders in each region, as well as a summative national conference, to present regional field data, provide training on how to integrate key 21st century competencies into existing curricula and workplace training programs, and to open new lines of communication between and among educators, employers, government, and other community members.\r\n\r\nThis project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in three thematic areas: STEM learning and learning environments, broadening participation, and STEM workforce development.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn debates about the future of work and the skills that college graduates will need to thrive in life, society and the workforce, \"soft\" or \"21st century\" skills are inevitably part of the conversation.  However, we know relatively little about how postsecondary faculty and workplace trainers teach and train these skills, or what we call \"skills-focused instruction.\"\n\nIn the EMPOWER study our aim was to document how faculty and workplace trainers conceptualize and teach or train four important competencies - teamwork, communication, problem-solving, and self-regulated learning.  In addition, we also sought to identify the organizational, socio-cultural, economic and disciplinary factors that influence how these skills are taught and learnt.\n\nOur mixed-methods study took place in four cities with high concentrations of STEM jobs: Denver, CO; Raleigh, NC; Houston, TX; and Seattle, WA.  In these cities our research teams from UW-Madison and the Rochester Institute of Technology conducted interviews with 32 employers, 93 educators and 206 college students.  We also conducted 68 classroom observations and collected survey data from 1,127 educators and 627 human resources and workplace training professionals.  Our research subjects represented the energy, advanced manufacturing, health care, and computer science fields.\n\nIn analyzing our data, besides contributing to the science on instructional decision-making, sociocultural learning, workforce development and the nature of human competency, our aim was to provide practitioners in the field with useful knowledge and tools that they could use.  Given these goals, what did our project learn and accomplish?\n\nFirst, based on insights from this study our team created a 7-module online course on how to teach \"21st century skills\" that has enrolled over 250 faculty from around the world.  The course has even been translated into Spanish based in response to a technical university from Uruguay, which has sent over 50 STEM faculty through the course.\n\nSecond, the project has to date (April 2021) generated 6 articles in journals such as Higher Education, the American Educational Research Journal and the Journal of the Learning Sciences with 10 more in progress, 1 magazine article, 10 conference presentations and proceedings, 4 professional development talks, and 1 conference on skills-focused instruction and college internships (held at UW-Madison in Sept 2019).  Here are some key findings from our study:\n\n1. \"Soft\" or \"21st Century Skills\" are not generic or context independent:  In interviews with 96 employers, faculty and students in health care and the oil and gas industry, we found that how people define and use communication skills is deeply shaped by their discipline, workplace and task environment, and role group. This means that how we teach, train and measure these skills should focus on the competency itself and not categories like \"soft skills,\" that they must be grounded in situated views of cognition and practice, and that we must acknowledge that how we think about these skills are shaped by race, class, gender and power (Hora, Smolarek, Martin &amp; Scrivener, 2019; Smolarek, 2021).\n\n2. Many STEM faculty do not strongly emphasize these skills and rely on lecturing/non-interactive approaches to skills-focused instruction.  In analyses of survey (n=496) and interviews (n=25) we document how teaching key skills is not a major priority for many instructors, and that methods such as Q&amp;A and student presentations are commonly used approaches (Hora &amp; Lee, in press).  Another analysis of how 12 computer science faculty taught key skills revealed a committment to skills-focused teaching, but an emphasis on methods that involve little active student engagement or opportunities to practice the skills in authentic workplace situations (Hora, Chhabra &amp; Smolarek, 2020).\n\n3.  Factors enhancing interactive, skills-focused teaching include robust teaching social networks, prior industry experience, and professional development.  Too often education reform focuses on \"magic bullet\" solutions such as only hiring faculty with industry experience to teach \"soft skills,\" but our study found that while industry experience does shape how faculty think about teaching, it is not predictive of effective skills-focused instruction.  Instead, factors such as social networks related to teaching, organizational support and adequate time are critical for supporting faculty to focus on teaching these challenging skills (Benbow &amp; Lee, 2018; Benbow, Lee &amp; Hora, 2020).\n\n4. Effectively teaching communication, problem-solving, teamwork and self-regulated learning skills will require discipline- and occupation-specific professional development.  Our analyses of how skills such as problem-solving and communication (Martin, 2020; Poirier, Macias, Zwickl &amp; Rothwell 2020) are used in manufacturing, energy and computer science ocupations highlight how training STEM graduate students and faculty to teach these skills will require discipline- and even occupation-specific approaches.\n\nOur interdisciplinary study team will continue to analyze our extensive dataset and generate new knowledge about the nature of these skills, the prevalence of skills-focused instruction in the workplace, and how to best train STEM graduate students and faculty in how to effectively teach these skills to college students across the nation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/15/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Matthew T Hora"
