 "awd_abstract_narration": "A wide gap in rates of degree completion currently exists between highly selective colleges and universities and those that are nonselective.  Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne (IPFW) is an urban, nonselective institution with a high percentage of returning-adult, commuter, under-prepared, first-generation, and low-income students. This project will investigate what institutions like IPFW can do to help students decrease the time it takes to complete their undergraduate degrees in engineering, engineering technology, and computer science. S-STEM scholars, who will receive scholarships during their junior and seniors years, will be selected based on their high-ability or high-potential and demonstrated financial need. A team consisting of teaching faculty, academic advisors, and peer mentors will be created to supports the S-STEM scholars. Because many of the IPFW students are commuters with employment outside of school, it is expected that the program will accelerate the degree completion of the participating students and lead to a stronger Northeastern Indiana workforce.\r\n\r\nCommuter students attend school full-time or part-time, they live off campus, and their daily obligations are divided among home, work, and school. This project will lead to advancing our understanding of the factors, practices, and experiences (curricular and co-curricular) that affect these students? success, retention, and degree completion.  Areas of focus include (a) learning how commuters prioritize the three aspects of their lives (home, work, and school), (b) understanding the impacts and use of the financial assistance these commuter students receive, and (c) investigating best practices and interventions that lead to academic success for commuter students. This project has several broader impacts: (a) scholarship recipients will receive funding and enhanced academic assistance, (b) STEM degree completion will be made more visible to the greater population of IPFW students and pre-college students in local schools, (c) there will be enhanced collaborative partnerships among students, faculty, and local employers, and (d) knowledge gains on supporting the success of commuter students will contribute to the body of knowledge and to STEM workforce development.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBackground: Purdue University Fort Wayne (PFW) is a public institution serving northeast Indiana.  PFW is a metropolitan, non-selective institution with a high percentage of under-prepared, first-generation, low-income, commuter students, many of whom work. The typical student in the PFW College of Engineering, Technology, and Computer Science (ETCS) attends full time (at least when starting), receives financial aid, commutes, and works.  In addition, typical students are independent and report not being well connected with faculty, mentors, or student study groups.  And, despite most students receiving financial aid, many still have financial difficulties.  The overarching goal of this project is to improve student success and ultimately improve graduation rates. Supporting goals of this project are to identify impediments to success and to suggest strategies to reduce or eliminate the impediments.\n\nFindings: Financial concerns cause stress in our students.  Stress affects students, while programs such as learning communities and mentoring provide structure and advice to help students cope with stress. Learning communities help students interact with other students, especially with students outside of their major.\n\nStudents report benefiting greatly from exposure to internship opportunities, as well as interactions during meetings and seminars.  To make these aspects sustainable, permanent structures need to be put in place.  Programs to help students obtain internships should be continued by university career services.  Student chapters of professional societies can help to organize meetings and seminars, and the college has implemented a peer and alumni mentoring program. \n\nA majority of PFW ETCS students are employed.  Surprisingly, a majority of the students receiving financial support also work. Data from this project indicates that ETCS students who work take slightly longer to graduate, but are slightly more successful academically.\n\nStudent success is dependent on many factors, e.g. student intellect, background, motivation, personal circumstance, etc. Results of college-wide surveys indicate three primary challenges impact student success, viz. academic, time (work, family obligations, or commute), and financial. Although survey results indicate that the frequency and severity of these factors is dependent on the individual student's characteristics, chosen academic program, and personal circumstance, academic issues are usually the precipitator of problems.\n\nTargeted advising and support tailored to students in specific programs, i.e. engineering, computer science, and polytechnic, best serves students.  College-wide tutoring is structured with tutors serving specific programs.\n\nFirst-year retention is lower for polytechnic and computer science students compared to engineering students, but for different reasons.  Computer science students stop out at a high rate during the first-year, but the drop rate decreases quickly and stays low.  This suggests a problem unique to first-year computer science students, perhaps a lack of understanding of the academic expectations within the major.  Polytechnic students experience a more gradual and steady decrease in stop out rates, suggesting that polytechnic students face continual challenges as they progress through the program.\n\nEngineering students experience a relatively high rate of in stop-out in their second year--this implies that engineering students struggle academically after the first-year courses. Engineering students may transition to polytechnic programs due to academic issues.  Engineering students also dwell as seniors, taking an extra semester or two to graduate, due to multiple reasons, e.g. two semester senior design program, certificate programs, combined BS/MS, increased work, or a combination of factors.\n\nIt is critical that student success advisors identify the primary challenge for the individual student before it becomes a serious issue, compounds, and impacts student success. Success advisors need to connect students with the proper university resources to reduce or eliminate the barrier quickly and decisively.\n\nThree success tools have been developed:\n\nSuccess Assessment - a Qualtrics-based risk assessment as means for self-evaluation of barriers (academic, time, or financial) to success and collaborative evaluation of students? status and needs with their faculty mentor.\nRisk Indicator Survey - a Qualtrics instrument to flag students who are struggling in a particular class. Students who are flagged will be advised of support services and encouraged to develop a personalized improvement plan.\nEngineer Your Success - a worksheet activity given to students to (a) monitor progress in a specific class, (b) assist students in self-identification of barriers to success that might exist in a specific class, and (c) provide a process for students to develop a personalized improvement plan. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/06/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Donald W Mueller"
