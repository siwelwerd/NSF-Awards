 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many small communities own and operate small, decentralized wastewater treatment facilities, many of which are old and not flexible enough to adjust for treatment of variable water quality. Many of these communities do not have the resources to improve the treatment system or comply with new discharge regulations. While most wastewater treatment plants are fully automated, including small plants, their susceptibility to failure are high and their ability to quickly recover and resume operation are low. In this project the research team will be developing an innovative smart monitoring and control system to provide early detection of wastewater treatment system failure at small facilities and low-cost, remote monitoring and control systems for small, decentralized wastewater treatment systems.\r\n\r\nWater reclamation and reuse is not new, but discussions about new paradigms in water reuse, such as direct potable reuse, are accelerating across the country. Thus, when the source of water is explicitly impaired and it is destined to become drinking water, or even water for other beneficial applications, monitoring of water quality, early warning of treatment system failure, responsive operation, and an informed public are all critical to securing future water resources and protecting the public and the environment. A smart sensor network supported by smart data acquisition/processing and system-learning programs will ensure that next generation wastewater treatment systems can operate sustainably and continuously without negative impact on people and the environment. More than ever, plant operators and the public are highly informed and must have better tools to understand water quality and economics of domestic water reuse, and the negative impacts of water contamination. The human-centered system that will be developed through this project will provide these tools and stimulate energy efficiency system behaviors.\r\n\r\nA unique testbed will be used to conduct this research. It consists of an advance sequencing batch membrane bioreactor (SB-MBR) hybrid system treating >7,000 gal/day of real domestic wastewater. The research team will use this platform to integrate existing and new wireless sensor networks to monitor water quality and for process monitoring and control, to facilitate and test the development of a smart data acquisition/processing and self-learning control system. The smart service system will enable early warning of wastewater treatment plant failure, thus preventing long-term recovery and negative impact on community services. The testbed has five distinctive components: a demo-scale, advanced water reclamation system, a novel sensor network incorporating cutting edge analytical probes and instruments, a novel data processing and self-learning control system, energy management optimization module, and a public interaction center. It will also enable treatment of water to different end quality to produce water for different reuse applications (i.e., tailored water reuse). This new generation, smart system for tailored water reuse will have flexible and adaptable control systems that utilize new, smart sensor technologies, which interact with each other, learn from past performance, and can predict future performance and adapt the system to achieve preset objectives. After testing the new monitoring and control system at a demonstration scale, the team will work with their industrial partners to deploy, incorporate, and test the novel system at existing, decentralized treatment plants. \r\n\r\nThis project is led by the Colorado School of Mines (Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering and Department of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science) and Baylor University (Department of Applied Mathematic and Statistics). Aqua-Aerobic Systems (AAS), Inc. (Rockford IL; small business) and Kennedy/Jenks Consulting (San Francisco, CA; small business) are the primary industrial partners. Additional broader context partners include GE Power & Water (Boulder, CO), Ramey Environmental (Firestone, CO), and Southern Nevada Water Authority (Las Vegas, NV).",

The first step to ensuring high quality water is to have a variety of instruments that can measure and record the concentrations of contaminants/constituents in water (both source and treated) and the operating parameters of water treatment systems (flows, pressures, levels, temperatures, etc.). The second step involves the understanding, processing, interpreting, and using the data that was collected in the first step to improve the performance of the water treatment processes, increasing the efficiency and sustainability of the systems that provide us water. This ultimately protects both humans and the environment by proper operation, monitoring, and maintenance of the water treatment systems.</p>\n<p>Over the 5 years of the project, we worked with wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), from small demonstration-scale to full-scale urban/centralized systems, to enable early identification of process faults that can be easily resolved instead of allowing small problems to disrupt the entire system. We developed methods to increase the efficiency of processes to avoid faults and malfunctioning of processes. First, we focused on decentralized WWTPs. They are usually not attended by operators 24/7, and their normalized maintenance cost is higher; thus, it is more important to prevent failures and alert operators to significant changes in the system. Using multivariable analysis, we have developed data-driven tools that detect abnormal behavior of systems and alert to potential failures before they occur. We have made major methodological advances in fault isolation, which allows operators to see not only that a fault is occurring but also to identify the features that are impacted by the fault, facilitating fault diagnosis. Next, we developed a hybrid statistical and machine learning model to forecast the performance of an urban WWTP, and specifically adjusted operating conditions in advanced to minimize energy demand and infrastructure degradation. Incorporating our tools into the commercial supervisory control and data acquisition system of the plant, we were able to adjust system operations to achieve most efficient performance 50 minutes ahead of the point of measurement. In our next case study, we successfully combined our tools with artificial neural networks to forecast disinfection addition to the effluent of a large WWTP under varying conditions to achieve the desired clean water before discharge to the environment.</p>\n<p>As a result of this funding and with further support from NSF, we have developed an introduction to data science class that has now served nearly 200 undergraduate students. A five-week summer undergraduate research program that focuses on developing data science solutions to data-rich problems from our water and wastewater treatment partners has also been established. So far, nearly fifty students have participated in this program. Finally, a data science workshop has been developed specifically for professionals in the water and wastewater treatment fields that provides training in visualization, analysis, and modeling of data.</p>\n<p>One of the greatest achievements of this project is the infrastructure that we have developed to support future research in the field. We constructed a mobile pilot laboratory to demonstrate direct potable reuse (DPR) of reclaimed water under a broad range of conditions and for communities of various sizes. We teamed up with an industrial partner, Colorado Spring Utilities, to design and build a system equipped with numerous water quality sensors and an advanced control system. We have started developing model predictive controls and early fault detection systems that will make this mobile laboratory a critical academic asset for future generation of students, scientists, and engineers.</p>\n<p>Over the summer and fall of 2021, the DPR system has trnsformed 500,000 gallons of reclaimed water into drinkable water. Many public outreach events have been carried out around the mobile laboratory, including 49 tours (945 attendees, 85% tasted the purified water), 3 community event (760 soda tastings with soda made of the reclaimed potable water), 4 public presentations (101 attendees), 11 school/college tours, and many media events, stories, and <a href=\"https://www.csu.org/Pages/DirectPotableReuse.aspx\">videos created</a>. The public will continue to play a critical role in the adoption of new, unconventional sources of drinking water. Working with utilities, communities, and regulators, we will continue to support academic research, workforce development, and protection of the environment through integration of data science and engineering.</p>\n<p>We acknowledge the critical support from NSF, the Colorado Water Conservation Board, Colorado Springs Utilities, Denver Metro Water Recovery, the Boulder Water Resource Recovery Facility, Aqua Aerobic Systems/METAWATER, and the Zoma Foundation for this research. Moving forward, the research infrastructure and training developed under this research will be supported by grants from the US Department of Energy (2022-2024), the NSF Data Science Corps program (Grant #1924146), and potentially other local, state, and federal agencies.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/30/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Tzahi&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Cath</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632227/1632227_10456331_1643518941395_IMG_6294--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632227/1632227_10456331_1643518941395_IMG_6294--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"DPR Mobil Lab on the way to Colorado Springs\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632227/1632227_10456331_1643518941395_IMG_6294--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"DPR Mobil Lab on the way to Colorado Springs\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">DPR mobile lab on the way to Colorado Springs</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tzahi Cath</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tzahi&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Cath</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">DPR Mobil Lab on the way to Colorado Springs</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632227/1632227_10456331_1643519050859_Campus-14--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632227/1632227_10456331_1643519050859_Campus-14--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"DPR lan at CSU\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632227/1632227_10456331_1643519050859_Campus-14--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"DPR lan at CSU\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The DPR mobile demonstration laboratory deployed at the JD Phillips WWTP in Colorado Springs</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tzahi Cath</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tzahi&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Cath</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">DPR lan at CSU</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632227/1632227_10456331_1643519150272_IMG_6432--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632227/1632227_10456331_1643519150272_IMG_6432--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Public outreach activity at CSU\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632227/1632227_10456331_1643519150272_IMG_6432--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Public outreach activity at CSU\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Public outreach activity at CSU</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tzahi Cath</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tzahi&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Cath</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Public outreach activity at CSU</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632227/1632227_10456331_1643519566088_ScreenShot2022-01-29at10.11.06PM--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632227/1632227_10456331_1643519566088_ScreenShot2022-01-29at10.11.06PM--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Inside the mobile lab\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632227/1632227_10456331_1643519566088_ScreenShot2022-01-29at10.11.06PM--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the mobile lab\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Inside the mobile demonstration laboratory</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tzahi Cath</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tzahi&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Cath</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Inside the mobile lab</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
