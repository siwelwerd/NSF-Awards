 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant provides renewed funding for the participation of junior faculty in the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Summer Institute. For more than thirty years, NBER's Summer Institute has offered an ideal environment for developing new ideas and forging collaborative work relationships. Summer Institute brings together economists and scholars in other fields from universities, government, and international organizations for a few days or a few weeks of seminars, workshops, conferences, and cooperative research. The NBER Summer Institutes generate timely and influential research on important economic policy questions related to such topics as international financial stability, economic productivity and technology, environmental regulations, social security policy, and educational policies. The workshops are an invaluable part of the research infrastructure in economics and assist the research of a large number of economists.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Summer Institute is four weeks long, and includes at least 50 sessions organized and co-organized by over 80 individuals. There are more than 1,750 attendees from over 300 universities and non-academic institutions, and the majority of attendees are not NBER affiliates. While there are many presentations of work nearing completion, emphasis is placed on the workshop aspects of the program where new ideas are raised, preliminary research ideas are developed, and plans for joint or coordinated research efforts are established. Efforts are made to include a wide variety of new participants, and to reach out to women and minorities. Calls for papers are circulated widely and are available on the NBER website.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThis project supported three large economic research conferences held under the auspices of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Each of these conferences involved more than 2,500 participants over the course of a three week period.

These meetings, which brought together economists from colleges and universities, government agencies, think tanks, central banks, and international organizations, involved formal presentations of new research findings but also allowed time for informal interaction that could include planning future projects and carrying out collaborative work.

The first initiative focused on energy use in the transportation sector, with particular emphasis on the light-duty fleet and trucking. It emphasized the role of technological innovation, for example the emergence of new battery technologies that reduce costs, and other economic considerations such as tax incentives in the decarbonization of the transportation sector. The NBER convened a series of research conferences on this subject. The second initiative, which involved three supplements, focused on Transportation Economics in the 21st Century. It focused on the role of innovation in transportation markets, such as the rise of ride-sharing companies, the technological emergence of autonomous vehicles, and the growing capacity for tracking vehicles and collecting data on the movements of goods and people, in contributing to economic growth and affecting the consumption of transportation services. This initiative has also considered the role of transportation in supply chain resilience, and the sensitivity of transportation networks to both economic and other shocks.\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/10/2024\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: JamesMPoterba\n"
