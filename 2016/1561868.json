The conference will focus on topics in geometric group theory and related areas in low-dimensional topology. This conference is part of an ongoing series of conferences held at universities in Arkansas and Oklahoma, intended to increase interaction and collaboration among young and senior mathematicians in the area. It will feature prominent speakers from across North America, as well as a graduate student workshop.\r\n\r\nThe 2016 Redbud Geometry/Topology Conference will be centered on topics in geometric group theory, diffeomorphism groups, and the geometry and combinatorics of curves on surfaces. The invited speakers are Tarik Aougab (Brown University), David Cohen (University of Chicago), Thomas Koberda (University of Virginia), Kathryn Mann (University of California at Berkeley), Denis Osin (Vanderbilt University), Piotr Przytycki (McGill University), Jenya Sapir (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign), and Robert Young (Courant Institute, NYU). The conference begins with a workshop designed to enhance the experience of graduate students and junior researchers. The workshop will feature expository talks by Mann, Osin, and Przytycki.\r\n\r\nConference website: http://www.math.ou.edu/redbud/",
