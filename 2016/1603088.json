 "awd_abstract_narration": "Arctic ecosystems are warming at some of the fastest rates observed on earth.  In particular, Arctic lakes are experiencing more frequent years of warmer and deeper surface water.  However, the ability to detect and quantify ecosystem effects and specific biological responses to these climatic changes has been primarily limited to non-mechanistic modeled scenarios and observational studies in uncontrolled environments.  These lakes provide subsistence harvest for native communities in the Arctic and it is important to understand how the level of sustainable harvests might change under scenarios of continued warming.  This project will manipulate the temperature regime of selected Arctic lakes, observe the consequent changes of the lake ecosystem, and model these.  \r\n\r\nThis project will contribute to STEM workforce development through provision of support for the training of graduate students at two institutions.  It will also entrain undergraduate students into the research.  Through a collaboration with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, the principal investigators will provide outreach to I\u00f1upiat high school students via the Kaktovik Science Camp and to I\u00f1upiat K-12 students via the Arctic Village Science Camp Goonzhii.  They will contribute to the management of natural resources by presentations through established collaborations with the US Fish and Wildlife Service and the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, as well as through an interactive seminar series with local communities, e.g. the North Slope Borough of Alaska.\r\n\r\nThis project will complete a multi-year, whole-lake warming manipulation, to quantify the effects of future climate change on lake ecosystems in the Arctic. In addition, regional climate and lake models will be coupled with biotic responses to better understand the sensitivity of lakes to changing atmospheric conditions. The project is designed to answer: How will warmer lake temperatures and extended growing season alter (1) lake ice coverage and annual thermal regime; (2) abundance, activity, and diversity of primary and secondary producers; (3) fish vital rates, production, and dynamics; and (4) degree of carry-over across growing seasons and cumulative effects. Experimental results will be combined with long-term, archived data to inform a linked modeling system (coupled lake-climate model and integrated physical, climate, biological, and bioenergetic modeling) to answer: How will warmer lake temperatures and an extended growing season alter: (1) lake thermal regimes at regional scales, and (2) fish populations across lake types of the Arctic. This research will quantify lake thermal processes and lake-atmosphere feedbacks, provide more precise projections of lake horizontal and vertical temperature structures, and document and project lake biota and ecosystem responses to changes in lake thermal condition over large spatial scales and under different climate scenarios.\r\n",

Bacterial growth correlated with increasing water temperature in both natural measurements and experimental incubations (Figure 5a), but the boost in growth due to experimental lake warming was small and not statistically significant, likely because of the ultraoligotrophic (few nutrients, low productivity) nature of these lakes.&nbsp; The natural species composition of lake bacterial communities changed seasonally with the formation and breakdown of thermal stratification during the open-water period (Figure 5b).&nbsp; However, bacterial community composition was not significantly altered by elevated temperature, suggesting that this community is resistant to changes in temperature at the scale of our experiment.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For other biological communities, including zooplankton and macroinvertebrates, which may have been affected by lake warming, we observed that natural variability in food web composition and temperature regime, among both lakes and years, tended to overwhelm any potential experimental lake warming responses.&nbsp; In addition, the long, cold winters appear to reset the lakes after warming, with no carryover effects.&nbsp; However, by 2020, the project was largely shut down by the Covid pandemic, and in 2021-2022, by the Covid-based regulations put in place at the field camp.&nbsp; In sum, based on our limited time series of experimental lake warming, these Arctic lakes appear to be resistant to the direct effects of climatic warming; however, the indirect effects of climate warming and variability (e.g., thermokarst failure [tundra melt and slough]) may be more profound and are under exploration.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/22/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Phaedra&nbsp;Budy</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1603088/1603088_10440008_1695402363316_Slide2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1603088/1603088_10440008_1695402363316_Slide2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1603088/1603088_10440008_1695402363316_Slide2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">within image</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Phaedra Budy</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Phaedra&nbsp;Budy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 2.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1603088/1603088_10440008_1695402410596_Slide3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1603088/1603088_10440008_1695402410596_Slide3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 3.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1603088/1603088_10440008_1695402410596_Slide3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 3.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Included within</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Phaedra Budy</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Phaedra&nbsp;Budy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 3.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1603088/1603088_10440008_1695402314206_Slide1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1603088/1603088_10440008_1695402314206_Slide1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1603088/1603088_10440008_1695402314206_Slide1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Included within</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Phaedra Budy</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Phaedra&nbsp;Budy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1603088/1603088_10440008_1695402481928_Slide4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1603088/1603088_10440008_1695402481928_Slide4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 4.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1603088/1603088_10440008_1695402481928_Slide4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 4.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Included within</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Phaedra Budy</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Phaedra&nbsp;Budy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 4.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1603088/1603088_10440008_1695402601866_Slide5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1603088/1603088_10440008_1695402601866_Slide5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 5.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1603088/1603088_10440008_1695402601866_Slide5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 5.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Included within</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Phaedra Budy</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Royalty-free (unrestricted use)</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Phaedra&nbsp;Budy</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 5.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
