 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cape Fear Community College (CFCC) will develop the \"Chemical Technology-Enrolling Technicians and Improving Community Engagement\" program (CT-EnTICE). Project activities will build a pathway from regional high schools to the CFCC chemical technology program, and will improve technician education at CFCC. Project activities include a high school science project competition supported by an instrumentation loan program. This activity builds on past NSF ATE-funded work at CFCC (Project W.A.T.E.R.S., Award# 1003564), and will be coordinated with local industrial partners. It will bring a technology and research-rich educational experience in the context of industry needs to high school students in their classrooms. CT-EnTICE will support a part-time chemical technology liaison to reach out to local business and industry to build new partnerships with industry in CFCC's service area.\r\n\r\nCT-EnTICE will leverage what was learned during Project W.A.T.E.R.S. regarding positive community engagement and will incorporate industrial partners as active participants in its outreach activities. There is enthusiastic industry support for CT-EnTICE and the community science projects, and what is learned will improve technician education at CFCC. Anticipated outcomes of this project are stronger partnerships between the CFCC chemical technology program (which results in an Associates of Applied Science) and the community at multiple levels: students from high school, citizens from the community, and representatives from local industry. Ultimately, this project will increase the enrollment of the CFCC chemical technology program, expand the number of its community partners, and strengthen its relationships with industry. Many of the high schools targeted have a significant number of economically disadvantaged students, so heightened awareness of the CFCC chemical technology program through CT-EnTICE could lead these students to a pathway to economic prosperity. Project evaluation will measure participants' changes in opinions and perceptions of careers in chemical technology and their awareness of the program. The results will be disseminated through the ATE community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nCape Fear Community College's (CFCC) Chemical Technology (CT) Program, with the aid of the National Science Foundation (NSF), implemented CT-EnTICE:  Chemical Technology:  Enrolling Technicians and Improving Community Engagement project.  The CT-EnTICE project focused on problematic cores experienced by other CT Programs across the nation and found solutions on:  (1) how to craft effective student and employer recruitment efforts; (2) how to creatively incorporate STEM teaching practices to maximize student learning in a high technology trade; and (3) how to engage interest in a technician training program.  These solutions were developed with a four-tiered approach:  (A) a chemical technology competition, (B) a week-long high school student summer camp, (C) a laboratory check-out program for secondary schools, and (D) the creation of a program liaison. \n\nThroughout 2016-2020, a CT competition provided high school students, and their teachers, opportunities to network with CT faculty, staff, and students.  During each academic year, high school teachers and students experienced instrumentation training and engaged in a series of hands-on learning events focused on proper laboratory techniques.  The CT-EnTICE management team initially planned for a maximum of 48 students per year.  However, the competition directly impacted over 225 students (an average of 74 students per year).  Excitement and popularity developed around the competition, however, findings showed that students who participated in this type of event were often those who did not want to attend a community college or pursue a two-year degree in a vocational/technical field.  A total of four students (approximately 2 percent) enrolled in the CT program due to their experiences with the competition.  Others elected to attend state universities or ivy league institutions.       \n\nThe success of the summer camp unexpectedly matriculated more students into the CT program than the competition.  The popularity of the summer camp was evident from the initial stages of its creation.  Due to demand, the CT-EnTICE management team offered the first iteration of the camp one year earlier than the timeline presented in the original grant proposal.  Since 2016, the camp served 46 high school students and six of these students (13 percent) have enrolled in the CT program.     \n\nThe U-PIKs, a laboratory check-out program, was the least-effective activity included in the CT-EnTICE project.  Throughout 2016-2020 academic years, the U-PIK program provided service to over 1,200 high school, 120 middle school, 300 elementary, and 85 adult-learning (GED) students.  Even though the serving population seems substantial, it fell short of the target goals within each category.  These results were mainly due to the resistance of teachers modifying and updating their lesson plans.  However, the U-PIK experiments were also implemented within the CT program and allowed the program to create multiple ?field testing? experiments throughout the two-year program. \n\nFinally, the program liaison position was one of the most powerful recruitment and program awareness tools the CT-EnTICE project created.  With the implementation of the liaison?s position, the program consistently increased its enrollment throughout the 2016-2020 academic years.  For the first time since August 2000, the program?s enrollment met maximum capacity for two consecutive years.  The liaison also created two new partnerships with local employers, discovered more job openings than CT graduates, and visited over 50 employers throughout the state of North Carolina to inform them of the CT program.  Additionally, the liaison?s activities resulted in an unanticipated outcome:  acquisition of instrumentation through various donations including an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer (ICP-OES), a mercury analyzer, four dissolution baths, and three disintegration apparatuses as well as various consumables and supplies.  If purchased new, the equipment would be worth more than $250,000.    \n\nFinally, the CT-EnTICE project demonstrated that technician learning and enthusiasm, especially in the scientific field, can be improved using a more technologically advanced curriculum.  Fundamental changes within a science curriculum involving laboratory objectives, coupled with appropriate discussions on theoretical concepts, allowed students to clearly understand advances within the scientific and technician fields versus students who are deprived of these opportunities.  The activities also supported networking opportunities among high school students, CT students, and employers and intensified employer awareness throughout the state of North Carolina.  Ideas presented in the CT-EnTICE project can easily be integrated into any ATE program that needs to improve recruitment efforts, advance technician training, or create a stronger partnership between the community college, surrounding employers, and local secondary schools.  The program liaison, competition, high school camp, or instrumentation loan program can easily be replicated within any ATE program.  Utilizing these techniques in similar technician-training programs, the overall quality of education can be improved, and more technicians can be recruited, creating a more competitive and rigorously trained workforce that will help break barriers for students with AAS degrees.  Overall, this initiative provided new opportunities for training students in a high wage technician field and provided an innovative education model that can be replicated and used by other colleges.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/28/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Tracy L Holbrook"
