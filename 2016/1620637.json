 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the research activities of Professor Christopher Beasley at Northeastern University.\r\n\r\nAccording to modern particle physics, three of the four fundamental forces in Nature are expressed mathematically within the framework of certain types of theories known as gauge theories.  These three forces are the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force (which is responsible for radioactive nuclear decays), and the strong nuclear force (which holds atomic nuclei together).  The fourth fundamental force, gravity, stands as the notable exception.  The discovery of gauge theories is undoubtably one of the great scientific achievements of the 20th century, crucial not only for our modern understanding of elementary particle physics but also for vast swaths of modern geometry and topology.  Yet many foundational questions about the dynamics of gauge theory remain poorly understood.  These questions have bearing on such topics as the structure of the proton, the character of dark matter and dark energy, or even the mechanism for high-temperature superconductivity.  Professor Beasley will conduct research to develop new mathematical methods and tools, inspired by string theory, for analyzing a special class of gauge theories defined in two spatial dimensions. These gauge theories preserve supersymmetry, which relates particles of different spins to each other and is among the possible extensions of the Standard Model now being tested in experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  Research in this area thus advances the national interest by promoting the progress of science in one of its most fundamental directions: the discovery and understanding of new physical laws.  The project will also have significant broader impacts.  Substantial portions of the project involve joint work between Professor Beasley and his graduate students.  The project thereby serves to train the next generation of mathematical physicists in the methods of quantum field theory and string theory, as well as to disseminate those methods more broadly throughout the mathematical community.  Professor Beasley will also give a series of popular scientific talks for first-year undergraduates, will supervise junior and senior mathematics majors in a Research Capstone, and will videotape his lectures in a graduate course on quantum field theory for mathematicians.\r\n\r\nMore technically, Professor Beasley will study perturbative and non-perturbative properties of supersymmetric Wilson loop operators associated to Legendrian knots in contact three-manifolds.  He will investigate a relation between these operators and infinite-dimensional symmetry algebras known to occur in two-dimensional quantum field theory, as well as a new localization method for Feynman integrals.  Professor Beasley will also construct a novel, time-dependent topological supersymmetry on three-manifolds which fiber over the circle.  These ingredients will be applied to perform a variety of exact computations in gauge theory.  The project invokes deep notions from contact geometry and topology, and so will establish further interdisciplinary connections between theoretical physics and mathematics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nGauge theory provides a precise mathematical formalism in which to describe the effects of three out of the four fundamental forces of Nature.  Those gauge forces are the electromagnetic force, the weak nuclear force, and the strong nuclear force - with gravity being the fourth force and a notable exception to the gauge principle.\n\nChris Beasley studied special properties of gauge theories in two spatial (plus one time) dimensions.  Such two-dimensional quantum systems are important, as they may be associated to novel states of matter.  Knotting is a notable mathematical feature which also emerges in two-dimensional systems.  See the figure for an example of a knot.  In gauge theory, a knot represents the trajectory through space and time of a collection of charged particles, such as electrons or quarks.  Gauge theory provides insight into many subtle features of knots.\n\nChris Beasley has performed a variety of new constructions and exact computations in gauge theory.  These constructions violate the Lorentz symmetry of special relativity and can be interpreted as placing the gauge theory on a non-trivially curved, but still homogeneous, spacetime.  These results involve both new supersymmetry algebras and new classes of supersymmetric Wilson loop operators.  All results are reported in publicly-available PhD dissertations generated by the project as well as in papers and preprints.\n\nThe project lead to four PhD dissertations for graduate students in mathematics and physics.  In addition to providing technical training and mentoring for these PhD students, Chris Beasley supervised three undergraduate independent study experiences as part of the project.  Undergraduate research topics ranged from the Vlasov-Poisson equation to mirror symmetry to elliptic curve cryptography.  To popularize modern ideas in theoretical physics, Chris Beasley also gave public lectures on black holes and supersymmetry, respectively, pitched for audiences of undergraduate math majors.  During the grant period, Chris Beasley developed and taught a course on string theory for mathematicians.  Lecture notes and other resources are publicly available on the course website at web.northeastern.edu/beasley/MATH7374.  The course is intended as a one-semester introduction to string theory from both the perturbative and non-perturbative perspectives.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/14/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Christopher E Beasley"
