 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project uses the annual rings of tropical trees to reconstruct past rainfall in a drought- and famine-prone region, then applies this knowledge to understanding the role of natural and human-altered variability in the climate system in influencing regional patterns of drought in the past, present, and future.  Prior research determined that high elevation tree species in Guatemala and Honduras do form annual growth rings that can be dated to their exact year of formation; this is unusual for tropical tree species.  It is understood that variations in ring width in these trees reflect the amount of winter and spring rainfall.  With this knowledge, the investigators will develop estimates of past precipitation along Guatemala's 'Dry Corridor,' a region that currently suffers from severe water and food security challenges. Tree-ring data will be collected from mountain sites across this region, and these will be used to develop estimates of past rainfall over the last five centuries or more.  The benefit of these precipitation reconstructions using tree rings is that they can be used to understand whether current climate variability is exceptional compared to the last several centuries and the extent to which natural variability is entwined with a human-influenced changes.  Specifically this research will evaluate the hypothesis that there are important modes of natural variability in Central American rainfall at time scales of decades and longer. This knowledge will help test and improve models that predict future rainfall trends both regionally and globally and can be applied to understanding their cause and consequences.\r\n\r\nThis research expands the geographic extent of annual, climate-sensitive tree-ring data further into the American tropics.  Knowledge gained from this project will be relevant in a region with populations that are particularly vulnerable to climate change, as it is likely that increases in drought and flooding will be the most direct and immediate consequences of global warming for human society.  Changes in rainfall exacerbate existing and emerging threats to sustainable water supplies from growing populations, pollution, declining infrastructure, and boundary conflicts.  A long-term perspective on the potential range of variability in precipitation, and in particularly decadal-scale fluctuations, is critical for predicting and planning for the consequences of changes in water availability.  This research project provides a hands-on and international research experience for both graduate and undergraduate students from the United States and also facilitates the involvement of Central American students and scientists in geographic research with US collaborators. Coordination between US and Central American scientists will facilitate skills training and knowledge development so that local resources and information are available to address sustainability and vulnerability reduction efforts.  \r\n\r\nThis award is being co-funded by NSF's Office of International and Integrative Activities.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\n\n\n\nDrought in Central America is frequently accompanied by famine, internal migration, economic and societal disruption, and represents an ongoing humanitarian disaster.  Worryingly, drought in Central America is predicted by computer models to get worse over the coming century due to the combination of decreasing rainfall and rising temperatures, which would exacerbate existing problems of food security, endanger vital crop productivity, and further restrict the availability of freshwater resources.  However, extremely limited meteorological information from the region prevents a better understanding of natural precipitation variability and limits our ability to detect any current trends in drought occurrence or severity.  Our development of new sources of information about past, present, and future drought in the region thus seeks to provide knowledge than can be used to prevent or ameliorate the negative local, regional, and global consequences of these events.\n\nIn this project we have used the rings of tropical trees in Guatemala and Honduras to reconstruct moisture conditions over the last several centuries in order to provide a long-term context for the magnitude and frequency of current and potential future drought events.  We have demonstrated that tropical conifer trees growing in the mountains of Guatemala and Honduras form annual growth rings that can be exactly and precisely dated to their year of formation and whose width reflects the amount of moisture received in the prior autumn-summer and during the transition from the growing season winter-to-spring season.   Data from 9 tree-ring sites stretching from far western Guatemala to western Honduras allows us to estimate past rainfall, streamflow, and forest growth metrics over several centuries.  Our results show that current drought, rainfall, and streamflow trends are not yet outside of the range of variability characteristic of the prior 2 or 3 centuries and that while most drought events in western Guatemala last only one year there is evidence of past dry events lasting as long as 8 or 9 years, which has implications for resource management and natural hazard response.  We have found that both tree growth and precipitation in our study region is linked to sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific.  Warm sea surface temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean - linked to the El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomenon - appear to have a more stable relationship with tree growth and rainfall in our region than the cold ocean temperatures that occur during La Nina events.  Therefore, any changes in tropical ocean-atmosphere variability in the Pacific will be important for determining both future forest productivity and rainfall in Central America. Increased understanding of regional rainfall patterns and the connection to tree growth in these forests can be used to assist in planning and toward reducing community vulnerability at regional to local scales in urban, rural, and especially agriculturally-dependent communities.  \n\nOur results show the importance of a finer-scale of geographic understanding of the physical, dynamic, societal, agricultural, and economic causes and impacts of drought in our study region.  In this project we have sought to close the gap between new data generation and the use of relevant agrometeorological information by identifying key participants, decision makers, and modes of stakeholder engagement.  One key finding has been the identification and characterization of the existing mismatch between local-scale vulnerability and adaptations to drought and the relatively coarse scale of computer models used to predict future precipitation and temperature change. This further emphasizes the need to develop new, local, and relevant rainfall, drought, and ecosystem productivity and growth data from the region.  Toward that end, this project has provided multiple training opportunities for students and resource managers related to the development of tree-ring data on forest growth and productivity, droughts, and streamflow.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/31/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kevin J Anchukaitis"
