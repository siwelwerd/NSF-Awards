The conference website is here: http://www.ucalgary.ca/cnta2016/.  The CNTA meetings are held bi-annually, and are among the largest number theory conferences world-wide.\r\n\r\nIn addition to contributed talks, invited talks, and plenary lectures on current research in number theory, there will be a special session honoring the many contributions of Richard Guy, as we celebrate his 100th birthday. Topics covered by the conference traditionally have included algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, computational and algorithmic number theory, arithmetic geometry, diophantine approximation, combinatorial number theory, and any other areas related to or belonging to number theory.",
