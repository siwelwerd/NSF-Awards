 "awd_abstract_narration": "Jobs in lasers, precision optics, camera systems, photonics, and other technical areas that employ the science of light are essential aspects of our nation's technical competitiveness. The results of a recent national survey of photonics industries in the US conducted by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) National Center, OP-TEC, showed that, in the Western US, companies currently employ nearly 5000 photonics technicians, and projected a need for over 1100 additional technicians over the five-year period following the survey. Irvine Valley College (IVC) is leveraging an NSF award in photonics that has led to the development of for-credit courses and an Associates' Degree program in Laser and Photonics Technology to recruit both additional industry and educational partners. Together the partners will develop a plan for a Regional Center in Photonics in the western US to respond to industry need for photonics technicians.\r\n \r\nThis planning effort brings together industry and educational partners from the states of California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming to develop a comprehensive plan for a Regional Center in Optics and Photonics that would prepare students for entry-level technical positions in the industry. IVC will continue to work with the ATE National Center, OP-TEC, during the planning process.",
