For ten weeks each summer, ten undergraduate students and six pre-college teachers will participate in a broad array of activities that will prepare them to tackle these and other challenging problems in science and engineering. Students will gain exposure to a broad range of topics centered around the area of nanomaterials while being prepared for graduate school and future careers in science and engineering. Teachers will gain hands-on laboratory experiences to help them better understand the practice of science and engineering and subsequently communicate it to their students. Students and teachers will work with faculty, postdoctoral fellows, and graduate students with distinguished track records in research and education, emphasizing a rich array of interdisciplinary research opportunities for undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. The experience will train the next generation of science and engineering professionals while increasing participation of traditionally underrepresented groups.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: The UMN MRSEC comprises three Interdisciplinary Research Groups (IRGs) addressing pressing problems over a wide range of 'hard' to 'soft' materials: IRG-1, Electrostatic Control of Materials; IRG-2, Sustainable Nanocrystal Materials; and IRG-3, Hierarchical Multifunctional Macromolecular Materials. Each IRG integrates the six basic elements of materials science and engineering - synthesis, theory, structural characterization, property evaluation, processing and applications - required for effective innovation in materials research and development.  To enable talented and ambitious students to tackle these and other frontier nanomaterials challenges, the University of Minnesota Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (UMN MRSEC) will couple cutting-edge research practiced in the Center with a multi-tiered mentoring program and an extensive program in professional development and skill building. For ten weeks each summer, ten undergraduate students will participate in a comprehensive collection of activities designed to offer in-depth, stimulating research experiences, foster mentoring relationships with faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral fellows, and enhance student skills in preparation for graduate school. The programing is designed to promote and assure inclusion of females and underrepresented minorities in the preparation of the next generation of scientists and engineers.",

From 2016 to 2018, the University of Minnesota Materials Research Science and Engineering Center (UMN MRSEC) Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Site in Nanomaterials enabled talented and ambitious students to tackle these and other frontier nanomaterials challenges while developing the professional skills necessary for them to be successful in their future scientific careers.  During the three years of the award, a total of 68 undergraduate students were either primarily or partially supported.  Each student was given an independent research project under the direct mentorship of a MRSEC faculty member.  In addition to their research projects,  students participated in weekly workshops to develop writing and presentation skills leading up to a final formal oral research presentation and a poster presentation.  Weekly seminars and visits to local companies were also scheduled to expose participants to the breadth of opportunities available to them in materials science and engineering.  A fundamental goal of the REU site was to broaden participation in science and engineering through participation of traditionally underrepresented groups.  The 2016-2018 MRSEC REU cohorts comprised 47% women, 56% URM, and 65% of participating undergraduates came from minority serving or non-PhD granting colleges. \n\n \n\nThe RET Component of the award helped teachers develop technical skills in research and materials science while developing inquiry based research activities for the k-12 classroom that satisfy state and national standards in engineering.  A total of 15 teachers participated fully in the 6-week RET program.  Each teacher was integrated into a MRSEC faculty research group in order to learn the research and techniques used in the lab.  Teachers further expanded their exposure to materials science and engineering by participating in all meetings and seminars of the REU program. \n\nIn order to expand the reach of the RET program, a teacher workshop was developed in 2017 to allow RET participants to instruct larger groups of teachers in the underlying science and classroom implementation of their RET projects.  A total of 40 teachers participated in the 3-day workshop from 2017-2018.  A third essential component of the RET program was the RET student poster session which allowed participating teachers to bring their students to UMN to present posters of their research to the UMN research community.  861 middle and high school students presented research posters based on RET developed curriculum during the award period.\n\n \n\nIn total, 68 undergraduates, 55 K-12 teachers, and 861 pre-college students were impacted by this award. Work done by REU and RET participants resulted in 8 publications in peer reviewed journals and at least 15 oral and poster presentations at professional and national meetings.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: David Blank"
