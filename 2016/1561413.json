The proposed conference will convene researchers from the social sciences, business and legal worlds, and government regulators to identify how scientific evidence can and should support government regulation and policymaking. The workshop will chart a research course that facilitates science based regulatory approaches to scientific innovation, respecting the importance of differing values within a pluralistic democratic society. \r\n\r\nThe one-day workshop focuses on the technical domains of nanoscale materials innovation and commercialization; innovation in healthcare, and; environmental regulation for both ecosystem integrity and human health.  Topics considered include the regulation of emerging technologies; identifying authoritative science for policy and regulatory decisions, and; identifying the appropriate loci of regulatory enforcement in multi-level governance systems.  The excepted outcome is to stimulate joint research in regulatory science and to coordinate efforts of scholars in diverse disciplines with practitioners and policymakers across the United States.",
