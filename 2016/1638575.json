 "awd_abstract_narration": "Living systems are changing worldwide and critical decisions that affect their health and sustainability are being made every day. In the face of climate change and other environmental challenges, society can no longer rely solely on past experience to understand and manage the living world. This award asks the question, ?What would it take to forecast ecological processes the same way we forecast the weather?? This project will development an operational ecological forecasting capability similar to weather forecasting that uses an iterative cycle between making forecasts, performing analyses, and updating predictions in light of new evidence. This iterative process of gaining feedback, building experience, and correcting models and methods is critical for building a forecast capacity, and also a crucial part of any decision making under high uncertainty. In addition to making ecology more relevant to management, near-term forecasts routinely compare specific, quantitative predictions to new data, which is one of the strongest tests of any scientific theory. This project will generate near-term forecasts that leverage ecological data collected by the National Ecological Observatory Network and spanning a wide range of themes: leaf phenology, land carbon and energy fluxes, tick-borne disease incidence, small-mammal populations, aquatic productivity, and soil microbial diversity and function. This broad, comparative approach will be used to address cross-cutting questions about the nature of predictability in ecology and develop an overarching body of forecasting theory and methods.\r\n\r\n\tThe Near-term Ecological Forecasting Initiative (NEFI) will advance ecological knowledge at three levels: (1) overarching across-theme hypotheses about the predictability of ecological systems; (2) pressing within-theme questions about what drives process and predictability; and (3) advancing the tools and techniques that will enable an iterative approach to quantitative hypothesis testing. The overarching hypotheses of this project are that: (1) ecological predictability is more driven by processes error than initial condition error; (2) there are consistent patterns in the sources of uncertainty across themes; (3) across themes, spatial and temporal autocorrelation are positively correlated; and (4) spatial and temporal autocorrelation are positively correlated with limits of predictability. Overall, the answers to these questions address to what extent there are general patterns to ecological predictability, which would advance both our basic understanding of ecological processes and constrain the practical problem of making forecasts.\r\n\r\nThe expected outcomes of NEFI are to: (1) Disseminate data products and predictions that benefit society; (2) Develop new tools and cyberinfrastructure that enhances research and education; and (3) to promote teaching, training, and learning. Specific NEFI forecasts, such as tick-borne disease risk, aquatic blooms, carbon sequestration, and leaf phenology, are of direct relevance to society. Forecasts will be made available via open cyberinfrastructure that disseminates forecasts to the public and allows other ecologists to contribute new forecasts. To produce these forecasts, NEFI will develop an open-source statistical package, ecoforecastR, which will advance the tools and techniques beyond what is currently used by the community. Finally, in addition to the graduate students directly mentored through the project, NEFI will run an annual summer course on ecological forecasting that will train the next generation of ecologists.",

Work led by the collaborative branch based at the Cary Institute (NY) focused on developing near-term forecast cycles for cyanobacteria in lake ecosystems and for tick populations in forested ecosystems. The NEFI project had three overarching goals: to refine an iterative ecological forecasting approach calibrated to a broad suite of ecological function and taxa, to generate cross-system inference regarding predictability of ecological systems, and to train early career scientists to develop and use ecological forecasts. In collaboration with researchers at Boston University, the team at Cary Institute has developed, implemented and evaluated ecological forecasting models to predict cyanobacteria blooms in a nutrient poor (oligotrophic) northeastern lake. The team also developed a forecast cycle calibrated to the multi-stage life cycle of northeastern black-legged ticks. A key finding is that forecast error is predominantly associated with uncertainty in how to capture the population growth process in a mathematical model. Results from the cyanobacterial population forecast highlight important temporal insufficiencies in data generation?meaning that weekly observations are too infrequent for modeling the processes that control population growth of this organism. Low accuracy in forecasting the timing of peak population sizes for both cyanobacteria and ticks further highlights a critical need for theory development that specifically targets the goal of capturing infrequent, extreme events. However, even imperfect forecast models can be used to improve understanding of spatial transferability of site-specific models within and across regions, as well as help improve future sampling design. The model calibrated to tick and vertebrate host abundances observed in New York was used to forecast tick population sizes at National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites, in a spatial transference study that demonstrated consistent influence of abiotic drivers like temperature across regions and even among different tick species. Further, removing larval observations from the model had little effect on overall estimates of population growth, although it may still be an important indicator of future growth at sites newly inhabited by ticks.</p>\n<p class=\"normal\">We met our training goal with a suite of approaches targeting early career scientists from undergraduate to pre-tenure faculty stages. Cary partnered with the Global Lakes Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) to host a working group for graduate students and postdoctoral associates to collaborate on creating forecasts of cyanobacterial blooms, using existing data, and to publish the analysis. This bottom-up approach led to a Virginia Tech graduate student and a postdoc taking the lead in developing a cyanobacterial forecast for a single lake site (now published) as well as ongoing work on spatial transferability of forecast models in lake systems. In 2022, we engaged four undergraduate researchers (REUs) through the SUNY New Paltz AC<sup>2</sup> program to learn and conduct ecological forecasting research in lake ecosystems. The SUNY New Paltz AC<sup>2</sup> program recruits students that are STEM majors from across the nation and are from economically disadvantaged and traditionally underrepresented backgrounds.
