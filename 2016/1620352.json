 "awd_abstract_narration": "Partial differential equations (PDEs) are pervasive in engineering and science, and their numerical solutions are of paramount importance in understanding complex, natural, engineered, and societal systems. Though the past decades have seen tremendous advances in both theories and computational algorithms for PDEs, scalable numerical methods for complex, coupled, and multiphysics systems that fully exploit the extreme-scale computing systems remain challenging. This becomes the major impediment for future exascale systems unless dramatic changes in mathematical methods and computational algorithms take place. However, not much work has been done for this critical component of computational mathematics. Thus, there is a critical need to develop advanced mathematical discretizations that can enable scientific applications to harness the potential of extreme-scale computing in order to continue the pace of scientific discoveries and to promote the progress of science. \r\n \r\nThe PI will develop a high-order discontinuous finite element (FE) framework, including the weak Galerkin and the hybridized discontinuous Galerkin methods, and its scalable solver for geophysical fluid dynamic applications. In particular, the PI will design and rigorously analyze an abstract high-order discontinuous FE framework for a large class of PDEs including elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic types. The PI will also develop, analyze, and implement scalable solvers. Both hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic models will be developed and served as test beds for the developments. The advanced computational and mathematical methods developed in this project will potentially impact the computation of geophysical fluid dynamics. The project will contribute a competitive extreme-scale discretization for the dynamical cores of future high-resolution earth system models.",

We have proved the existence, uniqueness, and the stability for these challenging equations. We rigorously prove a priori convergence results with optimal convergence rate for these equations. For the MHD equations, we provided an innovative adjoint analysis to improve the convergence rates.

The challenge is how to solve the resulting nonlinear system equations of both the trace and the volume unknowns. To address this, we develop an innovative approach based on operator splitting. In particular, we propose IMEX HDG-DG schemes for planar and spherical shallow water systems. We split the governing system into a stiff part describing the gravity wave and a non-stiff part associated with nonlinear advection. The former is discretized implicitly with the HDG method while an explicit Runge-Kutta DG discretization is employed for the latter. The proposed IMEX HDG-DG framework:</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">i) facilitates high-order solutions both in time and space</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">ii)<span> </span>avoids overly small time-step sizes;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">iii)<span> </span>requires only one linear system solve per time stage;iv)<span> </span>relative to DG generates smaller and sparser linear systems while promoting further parallelism. Numerical results of various test cases demonstrate that our methods are comparable to explicit Runge-Kutta DG schemes in terms of accuracy while allowing for much larger time step sizes. We extend the approach to Euler equations and Navier-Stokes type equations (Euler equation with viscosity) with stratified density. We also manage to prove that our HDG schemes have a well-balanced property.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">3) We have also developed several extensions and methodologies beyond what promised in the proposal. First, we has developed new HDG schemes for Stokes equations, Osceen equations, and induction problems. Second, we have developed a Picard iterations for nonlinear MHD equations. This has allowed us to simulate very complicated and challenging problems in MHD. Of significance are problems with singular solutions and the island coalescence. Third, we have developed several new iterative solvers and preconditioners for various type of PDEs. On the iterative solver side, we blend the advantage of domain decomposition methods and the variational structure of the HDG methods to come up with an iterative HDG methods. We have also developed, for the first time, a multilevel solvers for the HDG trace systems that are proved to be scalable on thousands of processors. We are also the first who have developed a&nbsp;calable multigrid method for the HDG trace sytem on unstructured meshes. We have demonstrated the scalability and the efficiency of both multilevel and multigrid methods, as both solvers and preconditioners, for various PDEs including transport equation, diffusion equation with discontinuous and very heterogeneous materials (several orders of magnitude difference), Stokes equation, Osceen equations, and MHD systems. On the preconditioner side, we have developed a blocked BFBT preconditioner for the HDG trace system resulting from discretizing MHD equations.&nbsp; Fourth, we have developed an exponential integration approach for DG and HDG discretizations. The splitting is similar to the IMEX HDG-DG above, but the main difference is to use an exponential integrator on the linear(ized) part instead of integrating it implicitly. This approach combines the advantages of implicit method as it tries to compute the linear part exactly, and of explicit emthod as it requires only matrix-vector product. We have show a perfect scalability of the exponential integrator with DG discretization upto 50K cores.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In summary, the project has provided the first WG/HDG framework for a large class of PDEs. Indeed, we have applied this framework to derive rigorous WG/HDG schemes for various PDEs including transport equations, diffusion equations, convection-diffusion equations, shallow water equations, (stratified) compressible Euler/Navier-Stokes equations, and magnetohydrodynamics systems. This project potentially contributes a competitive extreme-scale discretization for  the  dynamical  cores  with  cloud/eddy  resolving  capability in atmospheric sciences, for magnetohydrodynamic systems in plasma physics, PDEs in fluid dynamics, etc. As a by product, we have developed several 2D/3D serial/parallel codes which will be made public after cleaning up and writing tutorials. We have publlshed 7 peer-reviewed papers on prestigious journals (including SIAM Journal on Numerical Analysis, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, and Journal of Computational physics), one report, and three PhD theses.
