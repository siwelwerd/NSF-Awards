 "awd_abstract_narration": "Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) are best-known from their North American range but more recently have also become established on nearly every Pacific island chain. Because of their geographic isolation, these island populations of monarch butterflies provide ideal ?natural experiments? for addressing ecological and evolutionary questions about the monarch butterfly.  This project will focus on museum specimens and live-caught monarchs from Australia?where populations of migratory and non-migratory monarchs co-occur?and will be in collaboration with Dr. Myron Zalucki (University of Queensland), the world?s foremost expert on Pacific island monarchs. Results from this research will contribute to a better understanding of (1) the genes and environmental cues that govern monarch migration, (2) how migratory and non-migratory monarchs may differ in their morphology, behavior, and interactions with parasites and (3) the strategies employed by milkweed host plants to cope with monarch herbivory. This information will contribute to strategies for protecting North American monarchs, which are currently being petitioned for federally protected status.  \r\n\r\nOceanic islands have long served as valuable natural laboratories for understanding evolutionary processes over both contemporary and long-term time scales. Monarch butterflies on Pacific islands provide replicated natural experiments for investigating transitions from migratory to non-migratory status as well independent re-associations with their milkweed host plants.  For this project, I will focus on Australian monarchs (both museum specimens and live-caught individuals) and their milkweed host plants. This will enable me to answer questions about (1) the short-term evolution of monarch wing morphology and antennal circadian rhythm expression in relation to migratory status, (2) the prevalence and virulence of the protozoan parasite Ophryocystis elektroschirrha, and (3) the evolution of resistance and/or tolerance traits in novel milkweed host plants.  The results of this research will contribute to a greater understanding of the basic biology of the monarch butterfly and potentially aid in its conservation.\r\n\t\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australian Academy of Science.",

These North American monarchs have many adaptations that make them well-suited to long-distance migration, including the ability to postpone their reproductive development as adults and re-allocate these resources to energy storage for their journey.\n\nWhile much research to date has focused on North American monarch butterflies, monarchs are also established in many locations throughout the world, including Australia, where they form non-migratory populations that breed year round.  There are many changes associated with the loss of migration: for example, non-migratory monarchs have wings that are smaller and rounder than migratory monarchs, and non-migratory monarchs are also much more likely to host parasites than migrants.  While it is clear that migrants and residents differ in important aspects of their biology, it is currently unknown whether resident monarchs retain the ability to resume migration, or whether the shift to non-migratory status is an irreversible change.\n\nFor this project, I worked with Dr. Myron Zalucki at the University of Queensland and tested whether resident Australian monarch butterflies are still able to respond to seasonal cues associated with the onset of migration in their North American ancestors.  To do this, I exposed Australian monarch caterpillars to either decreasing daylength (associated with the onset of migration in North America) or constant daylength and assessed reproductive development in the resulting butterflies.  I found that Australian monarchs do indeed respond to decreasing daylengths and that female butterflies reared under these conditions show significantly reduced reproductive development and greater body mass compared to butterflies raised under constant daylength.  This reduced reproductive development and greater body mass is associated with increased ability to migrate long distances.
