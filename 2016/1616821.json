 "awd_abstract_narration": "The livelihoods of fishermen who work in large marine ecosystems are heavily influenced by the variability inherent in biological and oceanic systems, as well as by the intrinsic uncertainty of economic and management structures. However, as fishermen adapt to these changes by moving across fisheries, their actions may strongly impact them and their communities, as well as influence local ecosystem dynamics. The linkages between environmental variability and ecological, economic, and social outcomes in marine ecosystems are poorly understood. Developing this knowledge is important so that regulators may adopt fisheries management approaches that allow fishermen to adapt to environmental variability while at the same time enhancing the social and economic value of fisheries and mitigating risks to both ecosystems and livelihoods. In this project, ecologists, economists and social scientists will collaborate and integrate primary survey research, modeling, and outreach to: 1) understand how environmental variability affects, and is affected by, linked social and ecological processes; 2) investigate how more integrated fisheries management can enhance social and ecological resilience; and 3) engage state and federal fisheries managers and fishing communities in the development and application of modeling approaches to better achieve ecological and social goals.\r\n\r\nTo better operationalize ecosystem-based fisheries management, the researchers will use time series approaches to identify the effects of environmental variability on fish population dynamics and spatial distributions, and to identify 'portfolios' of species whose productivity varies synchronously or asynchronously, in the context of the fisheries of the California Current marine ecosystem on the U.S. West Coast. To better understand fishermen's patterns of participation across multiple fisheries, this research will combine data from ethnographic interviews and structured surveys of fishermen, with data on fishing participation, revenues and costs, to develop an empirical model of fishing supply behavior that integrates economic motivations (e.g., profits, financial risks, and outside employment opportunities) with non-monetary considerations (e.g., psychological satisfaction from fishing or strong social ties to the fishing community). Finally, the researchers will integrate the model of fishing supply with models of the population dynamics of key fish stocks under environmental variability to create a coupled ecological-economic simulation model of West Coast fisheries. This model will be used by the researchers, in conjunction with fishery managers and stakeholders, to consider how alternative management approaches may enhance or hamper the resilience of the fishery by affecting fishermen's adaptive behavior. The research from this study would provide society benefits through providing an important tool to operationalize ecosystem-based fishery management, a stated priority for state and federal agencies.",

Fisheries are connected by physical, ecological, and human processes. Understanding these connections may offer opportunities to improve sustainability and the benefits people derive from fishery systems.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In this project, we explored linkages within federal and state fisheries in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (CCLME). The CCLME is a highly productive and dynamic ecosystem spanning nearly 3000 kilometers of coastline from Southern British Columbia in Canada to Baja, Mexico. It contains several important commercial fisheries with an average annual ex-vessel value of $682 million from 2012- 2021, supporting the livelihoods of thousands of fishers, along with suppliers and processing industries (Fig. 1). These fisheries are strongly influenced by bottom-up climate-related drivers and top-down pressures, including fishing pressure (Fig. 2). Although there is little evidence of strong trophic connections between the species targeted by these fisheries, their productivity is strongly influenced by climate variation that may create synchrony in productivity. In addition, many fishers participate in multiple fisheries, so shocks that impact one fishery might lead to changes in effort to others. We investigated whether and how an understanding of these connections can be utilized by fishery managers to improve sustainability and by fishers to enhance profitability and financial resilience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The research was divided into four themes. Theme 1 uses wavelet analysis to identify consistent environment-species and species-species interactions over the last four decades. Wavelet analysis has advantages over other methods of identifying this co-variation as it can deal with correlations with different temporal amplitudes and lags. Themes 2 and 3 explored what drives human participation in fisheries and the benefits that fishers derive from fisheries. Key contributions of this research are to understand the role of psychological and social factors in determining effort dynamics and to understand how diversification of fishing effort over species, space, and time impact financial risk for fishers. We also investigate how these margins of diversification have changed over time due to turnover in fisher composition and behavioral changes. Theme 4 brings these ecological and socioeconomic findings together to evaluate how management strategies can account for climate-driven and human connections between fisheries to deliver increased stability of fish populations and fishery income.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Contrary to our initial hypotheses we found relatively few cases of coherent synchrony between species or with environmental drivers. We did find a handful of species and environmental drivers that exhibited coherence. Persistent interactions we did identify occurred at different timescales, and wavelet analysis was useful in detecting these consistent patterns of covariation and ruling out transient or spurious associations. &nbsp;Using linear modelling, we also identified environmental drivers of the recruitment of Dungeness crab that could be used to improve forecasts of recruitment for managers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While many fishers fish in multiple fisheries, we found human connections between fisheries associated with shifting of effort between them are muted by regulatory barriers. We also found that fishers? tendency to move out of fisheries and into others when profitability declines or fisheries are closed is muted by social and psychological factors that make effort dynamics ?sticky.? While it may be difficult for fishers to assemble a portfolio of fisheries that purposely minimizes variance in their productivity as one might with a financial portfolio, strategies that spread effort over time and strategies that combine fisheries on long-lived more stable species such as sablefish with highly variable profitable fisheries such as Dungeness crab can reduce income variation for individuals. We found that regulatory strategies that enable more diversification can increase equality across fishers and reduce variation in individual incomes, but these regulatory strategies may also reduce overall profitability by fueling a race for fish and consequently lower prices in lucrative fisheries such as that for Dungeness crab.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In our review of historical patterns of diversification over species, space, and time, we find that spreading fishing effort over the season, even while holding species portfolios constant, has been a dominant mechanism for fishers to reduce financial risk. This temporal diversification primarily occurred through compositional changes in fishers over time and was facilitated by limited entry and catch share programs (Fig. 3). Indeed, fishers? changes in diversification have generally reduced their financial risk in the last 25 years.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our research suggests that our ability to understand and actively manage or exploit the dynamics of these connected fisheries systems remains limited even in this highly studied system with high quality data on climate, oceanography, population dynamics, and fishery harvests.
