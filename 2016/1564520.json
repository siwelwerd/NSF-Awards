 "awd_abstract_narration": "The New Scientist Training (NeST) program at Yakima Valley Community College (YVCC) will improve the performance of low-income and first-generation college students interested in earning a degree in a STEM.  The program will provide financial support to a minimum of 32 participants organized in four cohorts.  The ultimate objective of the project is to bolster the pipeline of Hispanic and other first-generation scientists from poorer backgrounds in the Yakima Valley who excel in technical fields.  The program will utilize five key elements:  incentivized scholarships to be awarded for academic performance; undergraduate research opportunities; formation of a STEM club; expanded tutoring; and proactive advising.   \r\n \r\nA two-tiered approach will be utilized to capture critical data and provide information to substantiate the degree to which the project is meeting stated outcome objectives.   The first tier of data collection and analysis will be quantitative, utilizing primarily YVCC's Student Management Information System to collect information about student demographics and persistence objectives.  The second tier will rely on qualitative data systematically gathered from faculty, staff, and students participating in various aspects of the project.  The result will be evidence that can be used at other institutions to improve underrepresented student performance and persistence in the sciences.",
