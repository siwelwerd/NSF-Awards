 "awd_abstract_narration": "The \"I Am STEM\" project recruits and awards scholarships to a cohort of financially needy and academically talented students, approximately 18 freshmen and 16 sophomores each year, at the Dunwoody Campus of Perimeter College of Georgia State University. This project is designed to increase enrollment and persistence in the STEM disciplines and links to existing student support structures for enrolling, retaining, graduating and transferring associate degree students. \r\n\r\nThe Project develops the participants' deeper learning competencies through two components: 1) developing a STEM Mindset and 2) fostering STEM Belongingness. To assist students in developing a STEM mindset, the Project utilizes two key components: a First Year Experience course and problem-based learning experiences targeting STEM gateway courses. To foster belongingness, the Project employs faculty mentoring, \"World of Work\" experiences, and a community service initiative to establish an ongoing learning community. \"World of Work\" experiences include industry tours and guest speakers; the community service initiative allows participants to develop personal and professional skills while engaging primary school students in activities that will help the children discover the joy and wonder associated with science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. The intellectual merit of the project is demonstrated through a research-based comprehensive assessment and evaluation plan. The results of the project generates knowledge regarding the factors that strengthen the participation of underrepresented students in STEM. The results of the project, as well as the details with regard to process and application of intervention approaches, serve as a roadmap for other access institutions to replicate the project strategies and therefore will have a broader impact.",
