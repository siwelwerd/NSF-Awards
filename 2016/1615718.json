 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nonlinear wave equations give a mathematical description for many phenomena in optics, fluid dynamics, and a variety of other physical systems. Such a description is instrumental for predicting behavior and designing engineering devices, such as optical switches for information transmission. Even when it is not possible to completely determine the solutions to such equations, the system can often be understood satisfactorily by considering an appropriate approximation, such as long time or small dispersion. A rich and maturing asymptotic theory has been developed for the somewhat idealized integrable wave equations. However, in order to provide accurate predictions for more realistic physical systems, it is necessary to extend the current models to account for issues including coupling or interference, higher-order corrections, and boundaries. By taking advantage of recent mathematical advances, this project will improve available methods to better model these three effects. Specific applications of the models studied include the development of all-optical switches, Raman scattering, flux propagation in superconducting Josephson junctions, and hydrodynamic turbulence. \r\n\r\nThe research aims to enhance the physical applicability of current models of nonlinear wave propagation through the following three projects: (1) Extension of the small-dispersion theory to multicomponent systems, including the three-wave resonant interaction equations, to develop better mathematical models of coupled systems. (2) Establishing results on the long-time behavior and onset of instabilities in near-integrable equations, such as Hamiltonian perturbations of the sine-Gordon equation, in order to better incorporate higher-order physical effects that may not be negligible. (3) Extending the unified transform method to understand small-dispersion behavior on finite or semi-finite domains. Analysis of the defocusing nonlinear Schrodinger, massive Thirring, and related equations will improve models where boundary effects are important.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNonlinear wave equations are fundamental models of physical phenomena ranging from the ocean and the atmosphere to optical cables and Bose-Einstein condensates.  The funded research focused on improving the applicability of these models through three key initiatives.\n\nFirst, the P.I. and collaborators have introduced a new method for studying dispersive behavior through the simpler model of coupled multicomponent systems.  While the coupled systems are not dispersive, they recreate behavior seen in dispersive systems, such as highly oscillatory dispersive shock waves. This provides a new approach for the future study of more complicated phenomena, such as the collision of oscillatory wave packets.\n\nSecond, the funded research has revealed a new universal framework describing rogue waves, isolated high-amplitude waves occuring in nonlinear systems that have been observed in nature and experiments.  Often these waves are mathematically modeled by extremely complicated high-order soliton solutions.  Research by the P.I. and collaborators has shown that high-order rogue-wave solutions for a variety of different equations and for different initial conditions have the same asymptotic behavior.  This result provides a new, computationally tractable way to study rogue-wave behavior arising in different contexts.\n\nThird, the research has taken the mathematical techniques developed to study nonlinear wave equations and extended them in new ways to analyze other problems arising in mathematical physics.  New results include the first study of the effect of drift on a sea of Brownian motions on a circle, the derivation of the asymptotic behavior of a classical family of rational functions with applications to nonlinear wave equations, new representations of certain matrix moments related to number theory in a form particularly amenable to further asymptotic analysis, and the behavior of the largest eigenvalue of particular matrix models exhibiting a transition between random matrix statistics and the standard Weibull distribution.\n\nThe research resulted in seven peer-reviewed publications plus two submitted preprints.  Professional development was supported through the grant by the training and involvement of four postdoctoral fellows (three of whom now have tenure-track positions), three graduate students, and one undergraduate student.
