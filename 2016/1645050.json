 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the KUMUNU 2016 algebra conference scheduled to take place at the University of Kansas on October 1 and 2, 2016. The KUMUNU conference is held during one weekend each fall and has taken place every year (but one) since its inception in 1999. The original idea was to bring together algebraists at three midwest universities: Kansas, Missouri, and Nebraska, but over time the conference has expanded in scope to its present status as a major regional conference. The conference will feature six talks by leading researchers in commutative algebra and a poster session. The award will be used to support travel and lodging for participants, particularly junior researchers and graduate students. Special efforts will be made to support participation by women and underrepresented minorities.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the topics presented at the conference fall under the umbrella of commutative algebra. Commutative algebra has its origins from multiple sources, including algebraic geometry and number theory. In its modern form, it often provides a common language for parts of several different fields, including algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory, combinatorics and computational mathematics. A recent trend in the conference has been to include talks that represent applications of commutative algebra to different fields, such as geometric singularities and computational and/or combinatorial topics, rather than topics that might fall purely under the purview of commutative algebra. Continued inclusion of speakers beyond the original triad of universities reinforce this pattern and contribute to the goal of broadening and strengthening connections between algebraists throughout the midwest.
