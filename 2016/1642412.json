 "awd_abstract_narration": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) technology is a potentially powerful communication and control option for people with severe motor disabilities, as well as a hands-free, voice-free control option for mainstream users. The success of this exciting work depends on close and productive multidisciplinary interactions among researchers working in neuroscience, psychology, engineering, mathematics, computer science, and clinical rehabilitation. For this reason, the Sixth International Brain-Computer Interface meeting , themed \"BCI Past, Present, and Future\", will be held May 30 - June 3, 2016, at the Asilomar Conference Grounds, Pacific Grove, California. The 2016 BCI Meeting will retain the unique, highly interactive, student-friendly, retreat-like atmosphere and high-impact activities that are the hallmarks of the BCI Meeting series, starting with the first BCI meeting in 1999.\r\n\r\nThis NSF award will provide live streaming of presentations made at the meeting.  This will provide access to people who have interests in BCI but are unable to attend. This includes all who may not have the time or funds to attend, but also the large population of people with impairments that hinder or prevent their attendance, exactly the population that would most benefit from the material presented at this meeting.  NSF funds will also support the editing and archiving of the presentations for viewing on-line after the meeting.",
