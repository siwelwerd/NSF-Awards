 "awd_abstract_narration": "Securing future sources of sustainable energy is a global challenge that will benefit greatly from international collaboration. The USA-Pakistan International Conference on Renewable Energy, to be held in Lahore, Pakistan from October 10 to 12, 2016, will facilitate these collaborations. \r\n\r\nSecuring future sources of sustainable energy is a global challenge and global collaboration is required to develop effective technologies that suit the wide range of needs and operating environments. U.S. scientists are increasingly seeking test-beds for evaluating technologies at the research stage, are seeking partners with new perspectives, and also seek new markets for the technologies they develop. This project will bring U.S. scientists and engineers to Pakistan for a three day conference to discuss a wide range of alternative energy technologies, focusing overall on material design, synthesis and evaluation of material sustainability. This direct communication may facilitate collaborations that improve the quality, versatility and applicability of research efforts by providing U.S. personnel with a more global perspective as well as the insights of new partners. \r\n\r\nThe workshop will discuss a range of topics that are both cutting edge and appropriate for promoting collaboration between U.S. and Pakistani scientists and engineers. The topics include: International Collaboration on New Energy, Storage and Smart Grid Technologies, Solar Energy, Hydrogen and Fuel Cells, Nuclear Energy, Wind Energy, and Other Energy Sources (geothermal, biofuel, energy efficiency, etc.). The workshop will be structured to promote interactions among scientists and engineers from different disciplines and at different career stages. It will include researchers in academic institutions, national research labs and industry in the U.S. and Pakistan. Entrepreneurs, policy makers and manufacturers are also expected to be present, and the conference includes an industry/manufacturers expo.",

This does not mean just to hold a conference overseas. This effort was to bring the world closer to the age of clean, renewable, economical and sustainable energy. It was aimed at a viable solution to energy crises and environmental problems by exploiting renewable energy sources, environmentally friendly clean fuels, sustainability and economically beneficial materials and techniques with the following aspects: \n\n1. To tap the potential for improving technologies for renewable energy production systems leading to higher efficiency and lower manufacturing cost of devices.\n2. To explore the fundamental mechanisms involved in energy conversion, storage, transport. 3.  Approaches in material design, synthesis and evaluating material sustainability issues.\n4. To illustrate a multitude of novel and more efficient energy technologies including solar thermal systems, solar cells, solar fuels, such as hydrogen, higher capacity batteries, nuclear and wind related science and technology.\n5. To foster interactions between scientists of different disciplines and stages of their careers, working in academia, national research labs and industry. The conference will also bring entrepreneurs, policy makers and planners side by side with scientists and engineers. \n\nMost of those items, if not all to be cautious, have been achieved. Out of this conclave emerged the state-of&ndash;the-art on new sources, new techniques and new materials for new and renewable energy. That, of course, is going to be beneficial to its participants and to the world leading to the development of new research ideas and collaborations. The direct communication has been and will be facilitating development and expansion of the potentially vast markets around the world.  \nThe Conference was able to achieve fostering interactions between scientists of different disciplines and stages of their careers, working in academia, national research labs and industry, entrepreneurs, policy makers and planners side by side with scientists and engineers.\nIn particular, some Pakistani institutions and personnel contacted overseas participants for their collaborative research programs. For example, COMSATS Institute of Information Technology University, Pakistan in collaboration with Texas Tech University, Lubbock, TX, USA submitted a research proposal to a joint program of US AID and Pakistan Higher Education Commission. In that proposal the major emphasis is the training of personnel from both countries at the participating institutions and/or their allied sights. \nThe full length papers of the talks are being collected for the publication in the proceedings of the ICEEES2016. The hydrogen energy related papers and on fuel cells are going to be published in the International journal of Hydrogen Energy. \nThe impact on the society and the interest of the general public are somewhat depicted by some of the clippings from the Pakistani newspapers attached herewith. Some websites are also submitted, which may provide the evidence of the popularity and the welcome of this activity.\nThe comments summary on the conference by the local body is added belw with the website og the news papersat the end.\n\nSummary of the comments and Newspapers clipping http: addresses \n\n\nA lot of people are talking about it. It is a question of life and death. The United Nations has laid stress upon all member states adopt alternative ways out. \n\n \n\nKeeping the importance of energy in view, a two-day international conference on the theme of \"Energy for Environmental and Economic Sustainability. Three renowned institutions of United States,: Texas Tech University, National Science Foundation, and International Association for Hydrogen Energyjoine with UMT, Pakistan\n\nScholars, scientists, industrialists and analysts shared new ideason various forms of energy.\n\n Dr. Hasan Sohaib Murad said that Energy Conference was one of the most successful events in the history of UMT.\n\nThe  Minister for Mines and Minerals Sher Ali Kha said the government was trying its best to meet energy needs of the country. \"We have launched one of the world?s largest solar power projects in Bahawalpur, the Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park,\" he added. \n\nThe speakers said that dire need for energy was being felt globally due to emerging technology, industrialization of developing countries, social development and population growth. They said fossil fuels were impacting the environment, causing air and water pollution and damaging human health and wildlife.\n\nDr. Anees Ahmed, Rector Riphah International University Islamabad, Dr. Nizam-ud-Din, chairman HEC Punjab and Abid HK Shirwani, DG UMT also spoke on the occasion.\n\nIt is to be noted that more than 400 authors of research papers participated in the conference while 200 unique papers from around the world were selected for the presentation.
