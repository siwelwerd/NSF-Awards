 "awd_abstract_narration": "The ability to understand and reason about the spatial relationships among objects supports children's academic readiness and achievements in math and reading yet, we know little about when they emerge or how to improve them during early development. One of the earliest and most accessible windows into spatial skills is children's block play--building structures with physical blocks. Building with blocks is surprisingly complex, which makes it difficult to characterize in detail how children build structures, why they sometimes struggle, and what can be done to improve their skills. Drawing on traditional observational methods and advancements in computer science, this project creates detailed, robust, and automatic techniques for characterizing children's building behaviors and articulating the different building paths taken by \"novice\" and \"expert\" child builders. Its multidisciplinary approach advances the frontiers of understanding about how people learn, and how they might use their STEM knowledge more effectively. The tools produced by the project will offer new ways to measure spatial skills in formal and informal learning settings, and has the potential to change the way we think about early block-building as a marker for learning. In this way the project reflects NSF's investments in promising developments that build a coherent, cumulative knowledge base, focusing on high-leverage topics.\r\n\r\nSpatial skills represent a fundamental aspect of human knowledge, supporting a wide range of cognitive functions including our ability to create and understand 2- and 3-D spatial representations of information. This project focuses on one of the earliest developing yet highly complex spatial skills--block building--which has garnered attention in both cognitive and educational arenas due to its accessibility and adaptability for young children in formal and informal learning contexts. Consistent with the Education and Human Resources Core Research program's mission of supporting fundamental research on learning in STEM that combines theory, techniques, and perspectives from a wide range of disciplines and contexts, the spatial skills coding system developed in this project combines video and motion tracking of children's block building. This will allow researchers to gather and characterize data from much larger numbers of children than ever before, to relate these data on block-building to other academically-relevant skills, and to use the characterization of child \"expert\" performance as instructional input to \"novice\" builders. Its use of traditional cognitive methods along with machine learning techniques to characterize the process of children's block building and how it develops will generate scalable tools that can be used by scientists and educators to characterize, analyze, and promote development of spatial skills in our youngest learners.",

Understanding a child's block building skills has long been viewed as a potentially valuable measure of skills related to mathematical and scientific reasoning--vital to success in science, technology, engineering, and math. However, scientific understanding of the detailed processes underlying successful building has been limited in the past, with investigators usually focusing on simple measures of overall accuracy or total time spent completing a structure. This methodological limit is likely due to the fact that characterizing in detail the step-by-step unfolding of block-building by children or adults is vastly more complex than first meets the eye. To solve this analytic problem, our interdisciplinary team developed a completely novel approach designed to observe and characterize the block building process as it unfolds, action-by-action, over time from the start of the build to its completion. Our work has led to substantial progress on both the technical development of an automated system designed to capture these time-bound processes, as well as our understanding of how children and adults manage to rapidly create accurate and stable structures.</p>\n<p>Our automated system for analyzing block building includes three components:&nbsp; A computer vision system to analyze video of the building process as it unfolds, blocks fitted with accelerometers to track how and where blocks are moved during the build, and eye tracking to understand how the builder allocates attention (model, copy, blocks) while they are trying to build a copy of a simple block model. Developing this system uncovered surprising problems in using computer vision algorithms to analyze the block building process.&nbsp; For example, the system often had difficulty 'seeing' the blocks themselves as units, when a child's small hands obscured the view of these.&nbsp; Moreover, the system sometimes had difficulty differentiating blocks based on specific combinations of size and color. We also developed a detailed coding scheme which could provide an objective representation of how the blocks were organized at every time point in the build, in terms of their relative locations and connections (Fig. 2). This resulted in a detailed, accurate representation of each action a participant took, as the build was being completed.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>As we built the system, we used human coding as 'ground truth' to evaluate the accuracy of the system's automatic coding scheme.&nbsp; An iterative process led to improvements in the accuracy of the scheme.&nbsp; We also used the human coding to carry out analyses of the step-by-step creation of each structure. &nbsp;Remarkably, we observed very high consistency in how both children and adults build structures (Fig. 3).&nbsp; Participants (from 4 years through adulthood) tended to build following certain principles, such as creating stable sub-parts and building from bottom to top (which allowed for an overall stable structure as the build unfolded). The degree to which people used these principles was related to how accurately they built the intermediate steps on their way to the complete model, as well as how fluently they moved the blocks.&nbsp; Examination of eye-tracking patterns showed that the process of a build involves iterative cycles in which both children and adults seek information from the model, shift focus on the on-going build itself, and then return to seek more information from the model.&nbsp; Overall, our most striking finding has been the similarity of principles and information-gathering patterns among children and adults. These similarities suggest that by age 4, children have acquired significant skill in block-building-- with the ability to carry out an accurate build over time, through cycles of information-seeking, building, action, and confirmation.&nbsp; This general program is leading us to think about individual differences and developmental change, by considering how changes to these basic principles and information-gathering strategies might be related to the growth of block building skills.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Together, the work of our team of cognitive scientists, engineers, and educators lays the foundation for developing further automated and scalable tools that will allow us to characterize strengths and weakness in spatial-constructive thinking, rapidly and objectively, even in young children. The insights offer potential avenues for developing smart-toys and hands-on (or virtual) assessments for feedback and training on these skills, which are known to be related to children's future success in STEM-oriented educational and career trajectories.&nbsp; Moreover, there are natural extensions of this work to other types of complex problem-solving tasks that could have implications for education in both children, adolescents, and adults across a wide range of more specific fields (e.g., architecture, geology, urban planning, etc.).</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/01/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Amy&nbsp;Shelton</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561278/1561278_10431298_1633115846045_ChildBuilder--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561278/1561278_10431298_1633115846045_ChildBuilder--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Block Building Task\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561278/1561278_10431298_1633115846045_ChildBuilder--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Block Building Task\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Example of a child comparing the block-building copy to the original model in the block copying task.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Amy Shelton and Barbara Landau</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Amy&nbsp;Shelton</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Block Building Task</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561278/1561278_10431298_1633116414106_Codingsystem--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561278/1561278_10431298_1633116414106_Codingsystem--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Block Coding Scheme\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1561278/1561278_10431298_1633116414106_Codingsystem--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Block Coding Scheme\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Illustration of the coding scheme used to track the relative locations and connections among blocks at each stage of the block building process.
