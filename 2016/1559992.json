 "awd_abstract_narration": "This REU Site award to the College of Wooster (Wooster, OH), Ohio Wesleyan University (Delaware, OH), Kenyon College (Gambier, OH) and Earlham College (Richmond, IN) will support 16 students for 9 weeks during the summers of 2016-2018. This project is supported by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (DBI) in the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) and the Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences(SBE). The research theme in the broad area of neuroscience include projects such as genetic model systems, neuromodulation, cellular responses to neurotrauma, rodent behavioral assessment, and cognitive and stress neuroscience.  Participating labs are located in Biology, Chemistry, and Psychology departments. The diverse student research projects span the biological and social sciences, including gene expression studies during nervous system development in Drosophila, regulation of sodium channel expression in lamprey neurons, the effect of nitric oxide synthase on olfactory neurons in the fleshfly, computational modeling of the microglia-astrocyte-neuron system, and studies of action video games (AVGs) on executive functioning and perceptual ability. All of these projects contribute to important basic and applied research with the AVG project providing a thorough scientific investigation of effects and potential transfer of acquired skills to other contexts using a combined behavioral and psychophysiological approach. Students will participate in a full-time, mentored, team-based research project. A 3-day opening workshop will introduce students to the research theme, development of research plans, and data management. In addition, students will be trained on the responsible conduct of research. Participants will gather weekly either virtually or at one of the participating institutions for research updates, demonstrations, and professional development in writing CVs, attending and presenting at scientific meetings, local outreach, career planning, and applying to graduate programs. Students will present their findings at a research symposium at the conclusion of the program. Housing, a stipend, and meal and travel allowances will be provided.  Students will be selected based on their interest in research, academic record, and other factors.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that a total of 48 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, will be trained over a period of 3 years. Students, especially those from groups that are typically underrepresented in science, are encouraged to apply. Students will learn how research is conducted, data analyzed, and results presented to both scientific and public audiences.  \r\n\r\nA common web-based assessment tool used by all REU programs funded by the Division of Biological Infrastructure (Directorate for Biological Sciences) will be used to determine the effectiveness of the program. Students will be tracked after the program in order to determine their career paths. Students will be asked to respond to an automatic email sent via the NSF reporting system. More information about the program is available at http://amyjostavnezer.voices.wooster.edu/nsf-reu/, or by contacting the PI (Dr. Amy Jo Stavnezer at ajstavnezer@wooster.edu) or the co-PI (Dr. Jennifer Yates at jryates@owu.edu).",
