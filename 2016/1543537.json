 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic subglacial environment remains one of the least explored regions on Earth.  This project will examine the physical and biological characteristics of Subglacial Lake Mercer, a lake that lies 1200m beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.  This study will address key questions relating to the stability of the ice sheet, the subglacial hydrological system, and the deep-cold subglacial biosphere.  The education and outreach component aims to widely disseminate results to the scientific community and to the general public through short films, a blog, and a website.\r\n\r\nSubglacial Lake Mercer is one of the larger hydrologically active lakes in the southern basin of the Whillans Ice Plain, West Antarctica.  It receives about 25 percent of its water from East Antarctica with the remainder originating from West Antarctica, is influenced by drain/fill cycles in a lake immediately upstream (Subglacial Lake Conway), and lies about 100 km upstream of the present grounding line of the Ross Ice Shelf.  This site will yield information on the history of the Whillans and Mercer Ice Streams, and on grounding line migration.  The integrated study will include direct sampling of basal ice, water, and sediment from the lake in concert with surface geophysical surveys over a three-year period to define the hydrological connectivity among lakes on the Whillans Ice Plain and their flow paths to the sea. The geophysical surveys will furnish information on subglacial hydrology, aid the site selection for hot-water drilling, and provide spatial context for interpreting findings. The hot-water-drilled boreholes will be used to collect basal ice samples, provide access for direct measurement of subglacial physical, chemical, and biological conditions in the water column and sediments, and to explore the subglacial water cavities using a remotely operated vehicle equipped with sensors, cameras, and sampling equipment. Data collected from this study will address the overarching hypothesis \"Contemporary biodiversity and carbon cycling in hydrologically-active subglacial environments associated with the Mercer and Whillans ice streams are regulated by the mineralization and cycling of relict marine organic matter and through interactions among ice, rock, water, and sediments\". The project will be undertaken by a collaborative team of scientists, with expertise in microbiology, biogeochemistry, hydrology, geophysics, glaciology, marine geology, paleoceanography, and science communication.",

The lake holds clues about our changing climate and the evolution of life on our planet, but it is hidden beneath thousands of feet of Antarctic ice.\n\nSo begins the award-winning documentary The Lake at the Bottom of the World, following the progress of the SALSA Science Team through its campaign to access, characterize and retrieve samples from Mercer Subglacial Lake (SLM), West Antarctica.  SALSA - Subglacial Antarctic Lakes Scientific Access - blended rigorous hypothesis-driven science with discovery, technology development, training, education, and public outreach to bring a heightened understanding of one of life's least touched Earthly habitats: the dark, cold wetlands that underlie much of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS).

Many detailed results are found associated with the individual SALSA awards; here, we highlight a few notable findings/achievements by the SALSA project as a whole:\n\nIce surface height variation data from satellites have been validated with GPS positioning, placing the SALSA field work period into the context of a roughly decadal SLM fill/drain cycle.  Sediment cores recovered from SLM display distinct layering at the lake floor interpreted as the product of lake fill/drain cycles.  The observed layering, along with statistical modelling, suggests that SLM has been a persistent feature for 1 - 2 centuries.\n\nThe 50-foot deep SLM is only the second subglacial Antarctic lake sampled, and is distinct from previously sampled 7-foot deep Whillans Subglacial Lake (SLW).  SLW is located under the Whillans Ice Stream, which is the neighboring ice stream to Mercer Ice Stream, flowing approximately in parallel. SLW is approximately ~ 60 km from SLM.  Both lakes present evidence of deeper, marine sedimentary influences, but measurements of microbial biomass/activity, methane and other chemical energy sources, such as dissolved organic carbon in SLM are low; while, energy sinks such as dissolved oxygen are high, compared to those in SLW.  Despite these differences, DNA analyses of SLM microbial communities demonstrate greater similarity to those in SLW than from marine sediments at the grounding line downstream from SLW where the grounded ice meets the ocean.  These novel findings imply a network of inter-related microbial populations beneath the ice linked through ice sheet dynamics and the transport of microbes, water, and sediments beneath the WAIS.\n\nIron, an important micronutrient that supports biological productivity by photosynthetic microorganisms, is typically found in low concentrations in the Southern Ocean. We documented a large export of trace metals including iron via subglacial outflow from SLM into the ocean cavity beneath the Ross Ice Shelf, which in turn is connected to the Southern Ocean.  Our findings suggest that ice sheets need to be included in models/studies assessing the iron fertilization of adjacent marine systems, such as the Southern Ocean through subglacial water discharge.\n\nStewardship of samples and preservation of the environment that we sampled is a requirement of our research.  Pristine sediment cores collected by SALSA are archived at Oregon State University according to internationally accepted protocols.  Sampling activities utilized state-of-the-art decontamination procedures for microbiologically clean access.  The drilling, sampling, and imaging technologies we used during the SALSA project serve as prototypes for those that may eventually be deployed to penetrate the icy crusts of ocean worlds like Europa and Enceladus in the search for life beyond Earth.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 02/13/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Mark Skidmore"
