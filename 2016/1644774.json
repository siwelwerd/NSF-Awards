 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of this project is to investigate the structure and function of an imperial Inka waystation and changes to the lifeways of local indigenous communities that its construction and maintenance generated. While researchers of ancient and historical human societies have long sought to understand the various forms of imperial conquest and control over incorporated subjects, there is an increasing interest in the activities of local populations within empires. Although the term \"empire\" is rarely used in reference to political states today, many in fact fit this definition because they consist of amalgams of ethnic groups brought together under a central control. Understanding how empires developed is difficult to obtain through analyses of written materials alone, because these tend to ignore the actions and motivations of the non-elite members of societies. However, archaeological investigations of the smaller-scale settlements brought under imperial rule can effectively begin to refine scholarly understandings of the ways in which indigenous populations resisted, grudgingly accepted, or eagerly collaborated with their imperial rulers. Archaeology thereby allows for the development of more comprehensive considerations of empires in which the activities of all social groups within imperial society, not just the most powerful individuals, may be subject to scrutiny. The project will provide ample opportunities for collaboration with international colleagues and local communities, and the collected archaeological remains will form the basis for a future museum facility within the study area.\r\n\r\nMatthew Warren, of the University of Texas at San Antonio, will carry out an archaeological research project to investigate the political and economic effects of imperial colonization in a violently disputed borderland region and the subsequent changes in social organization and activities of its indigenous inhabitants. By focusing on the varying roles of the different groups involved in a colonial frontier context, this study will help to advance theoretical understandings of the social processes at work within ancient and modern borderland regions alike. The study will be conducted in the San Isidro river valley of western Santa Cruz department, Bolivia, a former territory of the Inkas that experienced a series of invasions by peoples native to the tropical lowlands during the Andean empire's final years. The fieldwork will consist of an archaeological survey of the broader study area, excavations at the central Inka site and several ancient indigenous settlements, and an in-depth analysis of the all of the recovered archaeological materials. The resultant data will permit an examination of the efforts in which local peoples were involved following the incorporation of the area into the empire, and the extent to which they participated with the Inkas in their defense of the eastern Andean valleys against hostile invaders that represented a threat to both parties.",

The two NSF-funded phases of the project included&nbsp;<strong>(1)</strong>&nbsp;the completion of a full-coverage pedestrian survey within the study area, which yielded the documentation, surface artifact collection, and, as appropriate, detailed mapping of all archaeological sites encountered (a total of 17 sites).&nbsp;<strong>(2)</strong>&nbsp;These excavations were completed at four different archaeological sites within the study area, including the focal Inka&nbsp;<em>tampu</em>&nbsp;site (P1), and three non-Inka sites (P7, P13, and P16). The units within P1 were located in and around the central&nbsp;<em>kallanka</em>&nbsp;(rectangular hall with wall niches), the&nbsp;<em>kancha </em>(elite housing) complex in the eastern sector of the site, and in several locations in the southwest and southeast sectors of the site in various contexts (e.g. plaza, within a rectangular stone structure, and between a series of fortification walls). Adjustments were made to the specific locations of these units as deemed appropriate following an assessment of the results of the pedestrian survey (i.e. whether certain locations were deemed to be more or less likely in yielding significant cultural deposits through excavations). Two units were excavated in each of the other three selected non-Inka sites, the locations of which were chosen on the basis of higher surface artifact densities within these sites as observed during the survey work.&nbsp;<strong>(3)</strong>&nbsp;During and following the fieldwork (both the pedestrian survey and the excavations), artifacts were cleaned, labeled for curation purposes, and analyzed. The material types recovered included predominantly ceramics of various styles, but also lithic artifacts, faunal remains, soil samples, and carbon samples (for radiocarbon dating purposes).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span>In addition to developing a more comprehensive understanding of the Inka and pre-Inka occupations of a little-studied region of the eastern Andes, the intellectual merit of this research lies in its ability to contribute to the fields of colonialism and frontier studies within archaeology. Through the comprehensive documentation of archaeological settlements within the study area and the numerous excavations undertaken among these sites, the research team made substantial progress toward elucidating the cultural history of the region. For example, excavations at the Inka&nbsp;<em>tampu</em>&nbsp;site (<strong>P1</strong>) revealed that while the site was clearly designed by the Inkas and constructed according to the established imperial architectural canon, it was apparently inhabited and utilized almost exclusively by a combination of local indigenous peoples and&nbsp;<em>mitmaqkuna</em>&nbsp;(ethnically homogeneous population of transplanted settlers). This insight argues for an even more fluid model of Inka imperialism than has been previously developed, one that must be able to account for the extremely indirect form of imperial rule over the critical frontier region in which the present study area is situated. Such models of imperial expansion and provincial development will in turn form the basis for deeper understandings of imperialism across the world and through time, a topic of great importance given the central roles of empires in guiding so many of the critical developments in human history. Abundant evidence from excavations conducted at a nearby Formative-period (ca. AD 1 - 800) site (<strong>P13</strong>) indicates that the earliest inhabitants of the valley, who also seem to have occupied many neighboring sites, were almost certainly settlers from the tropical lowlands or the direct descendants thereof. This provides further evidence of the significant cultural and historical roots between the populations of the easternmost Andes and the neighboring tribes of the lowlands of what is today the Bolivian department of Santa Cruz. Although the present study area represented a contested political and geographic frontier of the Inka Empire, its deeper history reveals its intermediate position within numerous spheres of influence from the Andean highlands and the tropical lowlands. While the Inkas and the Spanish colonial authorities sought to divide the easternmost Andes from the hostile Chiriguano tribes inhabiting their foothills and the plains beyond, the pre-imperial nature of the region was therefore one of cultural and ethnic admixture and interaction.</span></p>\n<p><span>Over the course of this research, the Co-PI was able to develop significant collaborative relations with departmental and municipal authorities responsible for the oversight of the project, and forge a number of important research and professional connections with local archaeologists and archaeology students from the Universidad Mayor de San Andr&eacute;s (La Paz). Finally, every effort was made to educate and involve the local community in which the work took place, and this community outreach will continue into the future in subsequent fieldwork seasons.&nbsp;In the past, little information has been available to the local communities concerning the rich history of the region, and there is much interest among them for further collaborations in developing and sharing this knowledge.&nbsp;</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/23/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Matthew&nbsp;D&nbsp;Warren</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1644774/1644774_10446372_1508799792327_P1050645--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1644774/1644774_10446372_1508799792327_P1050645--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Inka kallanka at Pulquina Arriba\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1644774/1644774_10446372_1508799792327_P1050645--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Inka kallanka at Pulquina Arriba\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The kallanka (rectangular hall with wall niches) in the central sector of the tampu site (P1) may have been used to house imperial garrisons defending the frontier region of the Inka Empire.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Matthew Warren</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;D&nbsp;Warren</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Inka kallanka at Pulquina Arriba</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1644774/1644774_10446372_1508800000695_P1050560--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1644774/1644774_10446372_1508800000695_P1050560--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Midden Feature in the Inka tampu site (P1)\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1644774/1644774_10446372_1508800000695_P1050560--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Midden Feature in the Inka tampu site (P1)\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This is a midden feature excavated off of the central plaza of the Inka tampu site (P1), containing various ceramics and faunal remains from feasting activities at the site.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Matthew Warren</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Matthew&nbsp;D&nbsp;Warren</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Midden Feature in the Inka tampu site (P1)</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1644774/1644774_10446372_1508800381609_P1060510--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1644774/1644774_10446372_1508800381609_P1060510--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Funerary Urn from Site P16\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1644774/1644774_10446372_1508800381609_P1060510--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Funerary Urn from Site P16\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This is a funerary urn found to contain a small quantity of cremated remains that was excavated within a non-Inka site (P16) in the northern end of the study area.
