 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to the University of Georgia to develop a novel super-resolution microscope for biological research. For students and early-career researchers, this close collaboration at the intersection of biology, physics, optics, and chemical engineering will provide an invaluable training experience, and it will be enriched with professional development in interdisciplinary science communication skills. All team members will contribute to the development of an online team blog, lab notebook, and public website that will capture the progress of the research within a broader historical, scientific, and visual context, curated by the Boston Museum of Science. The Museum of Science team will also disseminate this work to thousands of science museum visitors, students, and the broader community with live presentations, demonstrations, podcasts, and a short NOVA-style film on the quest to see more clearly and deeply into the mysteries of life. The film will be directed by a multiple award-winning NOVA producer.\r\n\r\nThis instrument will combine holographic imaging using high resolution spatial light modulators and new techniques for correcting distortion induced by light scattering in thick biological tissue to achieve molecular-scale resolution inside organisms important for modern biological research, such as fruit flies and zebrafish. At The Ohio State University, semiconductor nanotechnology will be combined with DNA origami to create intensely bright and switchable light emitters, individually targetable to selected molecules operating within biological systems.  This novel combination of high-precision technologies will provide investigators an unprecedented view of important subcellular biological processes, such as neuronal signaling in intact organisms, potentially contributing to breakthroughs in areas of molecular and systems biology, biological engineering, medicine, and human health.",

  "por_cntn": "<div class=\"porColContainerWBG\">\n<div class=\"porContentCol\"><p>The primary goal of this project was to develop new methods of microscopy to enable imaging of very small proteins and biomolecules in living organisms and thick tissue. Currently, microscopes are limited to a resolution of ~ 500 nm, whereas many proteins and biomolecules are &lt; 10 nm in size. The ability to directly image biology as it is happening was a dream of Dr. Richard Feynman, specifically quoted in his ?Room at the Bottom? speech as it would enable significant advances in the field, with the potential to impact human and veterinary health.</p>\n<p>Intellectual Merit: In this work, we developed new imaging probes based on tiny (&lt; 10 nm) nanoparticles known as quantum dots (QDs). QDs are composed of semiconductor materials, like microprocessors in personal computers, and light up when they absorb light from the external environment (Figure 1). This property enables QDs to be seen on microscopes. However, their signal is blurred as it travels through thick tissue preventing biologists from seeing their location clearly. One way to circumvent this problem is to image each QD individually and to correct the blur using computational algorithms and advanced optics, which were developed by our collaborators at the University of Georgia site in this work. However, existing QDs did not have an on/off switch that would permit them to be individually imaged. Our work incorporated that on/off switch using two different methods.</p>\n<p>In the first approach, we used gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) (~ 15 nm in diameter) to quench the signal of the QDs (Figure 2). When the AuNPs are close to the QDs, they are turned off, and when they are farther away, they turn on. To enable control of the on/off signal, we used DNA strands to connect the two particles together. When the DNA was hybridized with its sister strand the particles were brought together and when the DNA was dehybridized the particles were separated. To control the hybridization process, we added chemical molecules to the DNA that change their shape in response to light. At blue wavelengths the molecules make it difficult for the DNA to hybridize forcing the particles apart, whereas at green wavelengths the molecules relax, encouraging DNA hybridization and NP binding. We were able to use this approach to achieve an efficiency of ~ 90% quenching of the QD signal.</p>\n<p>In the second approach, we used DNA dehybridization to erase QD signals over time. In this approach, signal is monitored over a time window and the changes from frame to frame are registered. When a sufficient number of QDs are erased from the frame, individual QDs remaining can be localized. These can then be subtracted from previous frames to identify locations of QDs that were erased. In this approach, we built a cage of DNA surrounding the nanoparticle surface. QDs were erased from biological proteins that they labeled by adding complementary DNA that had greater binding affinity than that of the DNA binding the QD to the biological protein. Using this approach, we were able to label proteins on biological cells and erase that labeling over the course of ~ 2-15 minutes depending on the composition of the label (Figure 3). Initially, we demonstrated this approach using chemical dye molecules, we are currently translating this approach to make it compatible with QDs.</p>\n<p>Broader Impacts: This work provided two systems that will advance biological microscopy by increasing resolution, i.e., our ability to see smaller things, inside cells. We are currently working with our collaborators at the University of Georgia to test our inventions in biological systems. Additionally, we have filed for a patent on one of our approaches, which has garnered commercial interest. Thus, it is possible that this work will lead to new commercial products for biological microscopy and possible the jobs that go into making those technologies. This work also trained 6 graduate students and 4 undergraduate students in the interdisciplinary field of biomedical imaging, which combines knowledge from physics, optics, and engineering with biology. These students represent a highly skilled workforce poised for high tech careers. One of these students has already accepted a position in the chemical industry with the remainder finishing their educations. Training was enhanced with science communication education provided through our partnership with the Museum of Science-Boston, including development of a public blog on our work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/02/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jessica&nbsp;O&nbsp;Winter</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1555470/1555470_10422479_1564764755022_Figure1outcomes--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1555470/1555470_10422479_1564764755022_Figure1outcomes--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1555470/1555470_10422479_1564764755022_Figure1outcomes--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Quantum dot (QD) imaging probes.
