 "awd_abstract_narration": "The goal of the project is to develop, apply, and field-test methodologies to exploit spatiotemporal distortions of dual-telescope, optical image sequences of naturally illuminated, random scenes for the retrieval of range-resolved cross-wind velocities and turbulence statistics. The investigators will use random, natural surfaces with rich optical texture, such as bare mountain faces, hillsides, and canyon walls, which are ubiquitous in the American West. The sun and the moon will serve as light sources by day and by night, respectively.  The availability of inexpensive, scalable, multi-purpose techniques and systems for passive optical remote sensing of the atmospheric boundary layer will benefit society in several areas, including weather monitoring and forecasting; air-quality monitoring and forecasting; cross-wind monitoring at highways, airport runways, and rocket launch sites; and wind sensing in support of wind-farm operations. The project will provide resources for mentoring a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student, contributing to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education and educator development.\r\n\r\nThe study will use pairs of synchronized image sequences collected with two digital cameras mounted at two, laterally spaced, large-aperture telescopes pointing at the same target area. Target distances will range from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers. Limited-visibility effects due to Rayleigh and non-Rayleigh scatter will be negligible for short ranges but are expected to play an important role for longer ranges.  The proposed research will combine observational, computational, and theoretical methodologies from (1) atmospheric turbulence and boundary layer meteorology; (2) wave propagation through atmospheric turbulence; (3) atmospheric radiative transfer of visible light; and (4) imaging physics of coherent and incoherent light. The research will integrate, apply, and test concepts and hypotheses that are traditionally addressed separately in different science and engineering disciplines.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIt has been known since ancient times that optical phenomena such as mirages and the twinkling of stars carry information about the structure and dynamics of the atmosphere.  However, a first-principle understanding of the statistical nature of these phenomena emerged only after World War II when Tatarskii integrated turbulence physics, electromagnetic field theory, and the theory of random fields and stochastic processes into a comprehensive theory of optical wave propagation through the turbulent atmosphere.\n\nThe overarching goal of this project was to take advantage of modern observational and computational techniques as well as state-of-the-art theoretical methods of optical turbulence to advance our quantitative knowledge about relationships between (1) optical observables such as scintillation (intensity fluctuations) and angle-of-arrival fluctuations (image motion) and (2) meteorological quantities such as mean states and turbulent fluctuations of wind velocity and temperature.  Such relationships form the physical and mathematical basis of various atmospheric remote sensing techniques and are essential for their design and optimization.\n\nOver the course of the project, we explored the usefulness of image sequences of natural scenes such as mountain faces, canyon walls, the moon, and stars. In several field experiments conducted in the foothills of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, at the south rim of the Grand Canyon, and on Maui, we imaged the same target scene with two laterally spaced telescopes, each equipped with a digital camera.  The distances of the selected terrestrial targets varied from about 1 km to 150 km. Accurately time-stamped images were collected at a rate of 60 frames per second.  The lateral spacing ranged between 0.5 m and 10 m.  Processing two-dimensional cross-spectra of pairs of images enabled us to determine image motion with a precision of down to one tenth of one pixel, which corresponds to an angle-of-arrival precision of 200 nanoradians for image sequences that we collected with 14-inch aperture telescopes.  (200 nrad corresponds to a lateral target displacement of 0.2 mm and 2 mm at a target distance of 1 km and 10 km, respectively.)  The frequency spectra estimated from the observed image-motion time series showed a -8/3 power law at high frequencies and a -2/3 power law at lower frequencies, as expected from the classical theory of optical turbulence and as verified in previous field experiments based on images from point sources.  The image-motion spectrum can be used to retrieve the wind speed and the refractive-index turbulence structure parameter along the propagation path.  The ratio of the vertical and lateral image-motion spectral densities carries quantitative information about the anisotropy of optical turbulence and the outer scale length.\n\nIn addition, we carried out experiments at two test sites, the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (now abandoned) near Erie, CO and the Table Mountain Test Facility a few miles north of Boulder, CO.  Both sites are characterized by homogeneous, flat terrain, which is ideal for calibration experiments and quantitative tests of theoretical models, hypotheses, and data-processing schemes.  In these field experiments, we deployed in-situ sensors (ultrasonic anemometer-thermometers and quartz-crystal barometers) along the horizontal propagation path interrogated by the optical sensors.  In the June 2019 Table Mountain experiment, we deployed a frequency-comb laser system side by side with our imaging system.  One outcome of this experiment was the first direct comparison between the refractive-index turbulence structure parameter retrieved from optical path-length fluctuations (based on timing-jitter measurements) and from collocated in-situ measurements, respectively.\n\nIndependently of the field experiments, we conducted computational studies by means of the Fourier-Fresnel split-step propagation technique, where we used one or multiple turbulent phase screens along the propagation path.  One outcome of these computational studies was that geometrical-optics predictions of the angle-of-arrival variance in the strong-scattering regime were more reliable than those predicted by the Rytov method.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/03/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Andreas Muschinski"
