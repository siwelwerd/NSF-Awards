 "awd_abstract_narration": "Samples of seafloor rocks, cores, corals, hydrothermal vent fluids and chimney deposits, sediments, other materials are valuable scientific resources that are collected at great expense on scientific oceanographic expeditions.  Some samples come from shallow, near-shore environments of unusual and ephemeral character and others come from mid-ocean ridges, seamounts, the abyssal plain, the roots of volcanic islands, and continental shelves.  Many samples come from inaccessible places miles below the surface of the ocean and are retrieved from the seafloor by specialized robotic vehicles, human occupied submersibles, coring devices, and/or rock dredges.  To preserve these valuable samples and make them available to other scientists for studies not envisioned by the original collectors, the Marine Geology and Geophysics Program of the Division of Ocean Sciences of the National Science Foundation funds four professionally run repositories that house samples collected by seagoing scientists.  This award funds the curation, storage, and distribution of marine seafloor samples by the University of Rhode Island's Marine Geological Sample Laboratory. Samples are distributed upon request to scientists and educators wishing to better understand the ocean basins, the distribution of its resources, and how the Earth works. Over the past 3 years, this repository has distributed more than 8,000 samples of seafloor material to US and international scientists to advance our knowledge of the seafloor, ocean crust, mantle, seafloor volcanism, and the history of ocean chemistry and Earth's climate.  Samples from the repositories have been used to pioneer new analytical techniques and provide important insights into seafloor, the continental margins, and sub-oceanic magmatic processes.  This award augments a significant investment by the University of Rhode Island by supporting additional staffing in the form of a graduate student dedicated to working with the other repository staff to maintain the collection, collect and verify submitted information on the samples, and enter these data and metadata into an online database that makes the collection visible to interested parties via the Internet so scientists and educators can find and request samples for research and education.  Broader impacts of the work include graduate level course involvement and public outreach via tours for primary and secondary school groups, local community organizations, and other interested parties.  This award also provides support for an essential piece of marine geology infrastructure and provides support to an institution in a state that does not receive a significant amount of Federal funding (i.e., an EPSCoR state).",
