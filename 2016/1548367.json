 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable the development of a unique low cost power analog Integrated circuit system ASSP (Application Specific Standard Product) that will be mass deployed worldwide in the light emitting diode (LED) lighting industry. Based on an innovative power supply design, significant cost savings and reliability is achieved through integration.  Furthermore LED lighting companies can significantly reduce the cost of manufacturing of LED Street lighting, enabling LED lighting to be sold to municipalities worldwide at a far lower cost than exists today. Cities worldwide can save significant amounts of energy and therefore costs by implementing LED lamps using this unique power supply system.\r\n\r\nThis Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project will enable for the first time a highly integrated power supply chip set, designed for municipal light emitting diode (LED) lighting, to significantly reduce energy consumption by intelligently managing urban lighting, while achieving significantly longer lifetime, higher efficiency and reliability.  An analog power supply integrated circuit system will be developed to allow a high degree of integration, and incorporate interfaces for communication, remote sensing and monitoring. The integrated circuits will be modeled, prototyped, and tested using simulators, and hardware and software will be optimized to achieve the best results. This analysis will enable manufacturing of prototype units in a very short interval, and allow mass production and deployment of the integrated circuits worldwide. Using the technology developed, energy savings of over 75% compared to conventional lighting will be realized by intelligently configuring urban lighting to optimum localized needs.",
