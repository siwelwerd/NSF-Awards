 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this SaTC-EDU project at Virginia Tech, faculty members and graduate students in the Engineering Education, Computer Science (CS), Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) and the Hume Center for National Security and Technology in College of Engineering are collaborating to develop and implement a unique curriculum delivery model in cybersecurity into the CS and ECE curricula using Jerome Bruner's spiral theory approach. A theme of software security for cyber applications is chosen to develop and implement cybersecurity learning activities across several required courses in CS and computer engineering curricula impacting more than 300 students each year. Investigators are also conducting cybersecurity learning research using a mixed methods research design. \r\n\r\nTwo research questions are being investigated: (i) How effective are the spiral theory-based learning levels in enhancing students' core knowledge and skills in cybersecurity?, and (ii) How does students' motivation vary across gender, ethnic backgrounds, academic levels, and disciplines when participating in the cybersecurity learning levels? This research contributes in identifying characteristics of cybersecurity learners and developing education and training programs targeted at engaging a broad range of students (e.g., students from various ethnic backgrounds) in STEM education, particularly in cybersecurity. The investigators plan to conduct a workshop at the site of Special Interest Group on Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) to share results with national and international educators.",
