 "awd_abstract_narration": "Cooperation is observed across all levels of biological organization: genomes cooperate within cells, cells cooperate within multicellular organisms, and individuals cooperate to form societies. However, at each of these levels, there are some individuals who cheat and others who do not, and biologists still do not fully understand how populations evolve stable systems with both types of individuals or how this coevolution is distributed across populations of the same species in nature. This is because individuals who cheat gain the benefits of cooperation without paying their fair share of the cost, and thus this should spread rapidly through populations. Studying the natural distributions of cheating and cooperation in populations is important because cheating is prevalent in the natural world and occurs across all levels of biological organization, from genes that enhance their own transmission to the detriment of the individual that harbors them, to brood parasites that trick others into raising their young. More importantly, the evolution of mechanisms to prevent cheating was likely critical to the emergence of biological complexity. Moreover, cheating can influence everything from the success of symbioses to the emergence of cancer, and thus has important applications to both medicine and agriculture. The novelty of this project is that the researchers will document natural populations of a slime mold in the wild to determine if there is variation (and coevolution) in the degree of cheating and in resistance to cheating across space and through time. The research also takes a population genomic approach to determine the genes involved in cheating and resistance. Overall the goal is to understand the ecological and evolutionary processes influencing the dynamics of cheating in nature. \r\n\r\nOne prominent hypothesis is that cheating selects for mechanisms to resist or suppress it, which in turn selects for mechanisms to overcome that resistance. Cheating might thus give rise to an arms race of adaptations and counter-adaptations. If so, then social conflict, just like other forms of selective conflict, may cause rapid, divergent, and never-ending change, driving evolutionary divergence and diversification. To date, this arms race hypothesis has garnered support from laboratory experiments and molecular evolution analyses, but there is no work examining how cheating impacts the evolutionary trajectories of social traits in nature. The goal of this research is to test several predictions of this hypothesis in natural populations of the social amoeba (or cellular slime mold) Dictyostelium discoideum. This organism has an unusual form of multicellularity that renders it particularly vulnerable to cheating. The research will quantify phenotypic patterns of adaptation and counter-adaptation in nature, inspired by approaches used to elucidate other forms of selective conflict, such as host-pathogen or genetic conflict. Longitudinal sampling across space and time, combined with the ability to save and revive past and future social partners, offers a unique opportunity to observe coevolution in situ and constitutes a major advantage over other model systems.",

However, cooperators often face the problem of cheating: some individuals gain the benefits of group membership without paying the costs. If unchecked, selfish behaviors can lead to loss of cooperation or destruction of the society. The goal of this research was to examine a remarkable example of cooperation in the natural world, where individuals make sacrifices for the good of the group. We seek to understand whether and how this society persists and how it might protect itself from cheating.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cells of the social amoeba&nbsp;<em>Dictyostelium discoideum</em>&nbsp;can live independent lives as single-celled organisms in the soil, but when food runs out, they come together and cooperate to build a multicellular organism. Only some cells survive this transition: the survivors form spores that can disperse to new locations. Others sacrifice for the group: they form a stalk that lifts up and supports the spores, but in the process they die. Because the cells first aggregate to form the multicellular group, different strains may be present together in a fruiting body. Under these circumstances, some strains gain an advantage by behaving selfishly. They avoid becoming the stalk themselves, but benefit from the death of the other cells that do.</p>\n<p>In this project, we took advantage of the genomic toolkit for this organism, the ability to sample, store, and revive strains collected over space and time in nature, and the ability to do controlled experiments in the laboratory to test how well different strains cooperate and resist cheating. We asked the following questions: (1) Is there evidence that resistance to cheating behaviors can evolve in nature? (2) Is there evidence that cheating and resistance can result in multiple adaptations and counter-adaptations, leading to an arms race of evolutionary change? (3) What are the mechanisms of resistance? (4) Do multicellular groups comprised of multiple strains perform poorly together? Can these negative feedbacks on the group limit the fitness benefits of cheating?</p>\n<p>Thus far, we have learned that more diverse groups show \"social heterosis\" (Fig. 1). Diverse groups show enhanced productivity, at least in terms of spore production. We hypothesize that the cells detect and respond to the presence of unrelated cells, preferentially adopting the (selfish) spore fate when surrounded by non-kin. We also found that multi-strain groups produce more, smaller, shorter fruiting bodies, which may be detrimental for spore dispersal (Fig. 2). This pattern likely reflects a previously described phenomenon of kin-dependent segregation, where cells co-aggregate but then separate from unrelated cells. Thus, one form of cheater-avoidance (i.e., limiting cooperation to closely related strains) may entail its own fitness costs. Second, whole-genome sequencing revealed the co-existence of multiple strains over small spatial scales in the soil (Fig. 3). We discovered a co-occurring cryptic species that looks indistinguishable from&nbsp;<em>D. discoideum</em>&nbsp;but is genetically quite divergent. This species can serve as a much-needed outgroup for molecular analyses, allowing us to do more powerful tests for adaptation at the molecular level (ongoing). Finally, in the laboratory, we found that cheaters can rapidly select for resistance to cheating (Fig. 4). Resistance is partly specific to the cheater: strains exposed to (i.e., evolved with) one cheater are slightly more resistant to that cheater than are strains that evolved with a different cheater. Genome sequencing of these resistant strains provided additional genes whose evolutionary dynamics we can study in natural populations. Studies of levels resistance in natural populations are still underway. Baseline analyses of genome sequences have been performed, allowing us to address overall patterns of molecular variation, gene flow, and the frequency of clonal versus sexual reproduction. Temporal evolutionary dynamics and the identification of genes that are most rapidly evolving in nature is still underway.</p>\n<p>This work provided funding and research experiences for a postdoc, multiple undergraduates, multiple REUs, and a PhD student at a Hispanic-serving institution.
