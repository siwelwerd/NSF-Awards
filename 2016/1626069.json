 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award funds the development of a Radio Frequency Quadrupole (RFQ) to be used as part of a front-end for ion injection into a cyclotron, a type of particle accelerator. The outcome will be a novel, fully-working front-end instrument that can be used for multiple purposes. Based on a concept originally introduced in 1981, but never realized, this will be the first demonstration of RFQ direct injection into a compact, high intensity cyclotron. The design is potentially transformative and promises a 3-5 times increase in efficiency of bunching and injection over classic front-end cyclotron designs. It is more compact and of comparable cost, significantly advancing accelerator technology. The accelerator system planned relies on conventional, well known, proven technologies. The innovation is in the combination of these technologies. The challenges are in the demonstration of, on one hand, the individual performances of the various components (the current from a source, RFQ and transmission, and coupling to the cyclotron) and, on the other hand, their integration into a compact, high beam current, cost-effective proton driver front-end. \r\n\r\nProton drivers have a broad impact; they are research tools (for neutrino physics, secondary particles for condensed matter research, neutron sources), tools for the future of energy, and more. The development of high intensity cyclotrons has two important impacts for industry. The first is to increase the energy, intensity and versatility of radiopharmaceutical cyclotrons. Protons from a cyclotron can, for example, efficiently produce Strontium-82, important for medical imaging. In addition, this work also has relevance to Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) technology, applied, for example, to driving thorium reactors, thus supporting the development of safe nuclear energy sources. A factor of 5-10 improvement in current would have a significant impact in these areas. The development and running of the front-end will include MIT undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs. This will provide an excellent educational experience, with increased accelerator science at universities and more hardware experience for young scientists. Upon successful demonstration, the new front-end could be used in the IsoDAR (Isotope Decay-At-Rest) experiment which has the potential to advance our knowledge about sterile neutrinos and shed light on several anomalies observed with neutrinos.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to make use of RFQ injection of H2+ into a compact cyclotron. Each H2+  ion provides 2 protons after stripping thus reducing the necessary beam current by a factor of 2 and reducing space-charge forces, overcoming the limitations of injecting an intense proton beam into the cyclotron central region. The RFQ injection uses RF radiation in a quadrupole structure as a method to alleviate the ion source requirements by improving the bunching efficiency. The efficiency of the direct coupling of the RFQ to the spiral inflector injection channel of the cyclotron (a matter of bunch matching between the two accelerators) is a delicate part of system integration; it has to be demonstrated and is a goal of the project.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis grant funded development of a novel radio frequency quadrupole accelerator for the IsoDAR experiment.   IsoDAR is an Isotope Decay At Rest neutrino source.   It will be the first high intensity neutrino source constructed underground, which allows it to be located near ultra-large underground detectors.      It is a driven neutrino source, using a proton beam accelerated to 60 MeV that impinges on a purpose-built target/sleeve.   The restrictions of space and the energy of the protons called for a cyclotron design, however commercial cyclotrons can only produce 1/10 of the 10 mA needed by IsoDAR.   To solve the problem, a very high intensity 60 MeV cyclotron needed to be invented.    Solving the problem of reaching high intensities in a cyclotron had several components, but key among them was how to bunch the incoming beam such that the cylotron would successfully \"capture\" and accelerate the protons.\n\nThe problem is that incoming beam is continuous, but to accelerate beam the cyclotron must push the beam along using an RF wave.    This is analogous to a surfer catching a wave and being accelerated forward.      Just as how a surfer catching the wave at the wrong point crashes out, the beam that arrives at the wrong time with respect to the RF wave will be lost.     Thus, cyclotron designers introduce \"beam bunchers\" that compress the and time it to catch the RF wave at the right moment.    However, best commercial bunchers are only able to bunch 10% to 20% of the beam, which is too low for IsoDAR uses.\n\nWe solved this problem through development of the RFQ supported by this MRI.   An RFQ will naturally bunch a beam, although it has never been used for this purpose with a compact cyclotron.   Many RFQ accelerators exist already, but ours runs at an unusually low frequency RFQ to match the frequency of RF cycles in the cyclotron.  This RFQ is also unusual in that its primary purpose is buncing, rather than accelerating beam---as a result it is low power.      This is also the first RFQ to be used for axial (as opposed to radial) injection into a cycloron.  That meant that the RFQ needed to be short.  The rapid defocusing that happens at the end of the RFQ had to be addressed through a magnet that connects the end of the RFQ to the start of the cyclotron spiral inflector that brings the beam into the accelerating plane.    We have developed an RFQ that allows for 80% of the beam to be captured -- more than a fector of 4 improvement over today's beam bunchers.\n\nAs we designed this RFQ, we made use of machine learning.    Machine learning was new to the accelerator community at he time and our work has made us leaders in this development.    We are the first group to design an RFQ using surrogate modeling.    Our paper was the first paper in the innaugural edition of the new Frontiers of Physics series on AI for accelerators.  \n\nOur work has been award winning, including an American Physical Society Division of Particles and Fields Early Career Instrumentation Award given to the MIT-based designer of the IsoDAR cyclotron, in part for the development of this RFQ.  \n\nOur work has also advanced training.  We have had one student write a thesis on the AI-based RFQ design,   We have had many undergraduates work with us on this project, developing diagnostic equipment and data acquisition systems.   Our undergraduate group has been nearly gender-equal and with more than 10% minority participation.   Our work on this RFQ ad the cyclotron in general was highlighted in a plenary talk to the Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel as a rare example of a university-based accelerator-physics breakthrough.\n\nAlong with training, the broader impacts of this work lie with enabling high power cyclotrons.    This accelerator design, with its RFQ injector, actually represents a family of accelerators that can run at a range of energies and a variety of beams.   These can be used to produce much-needed medical isotopes including 225Ac.  A machine that would use the same RFQ design that accelerates deuterons can produce neutrons for materials testing for fusion.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/01/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Janet M Conrad"
