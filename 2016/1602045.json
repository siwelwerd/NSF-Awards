 "awd_abstract_narration": "This PFI:AIR Technology Translation project focuses on translating a novel titanium alloy to address the need for improving the outcome and reducing implant-related complications during growing rod treatment of adolescent scoliosis.  The adaptive growing rod is important because of its potential to reduce the high incidence of implant loosening and failure, which are the primary sources of complications in the treatment of severe early-onset scoliosis in children and often necessitate costly and painful revision surgeries.  The project will result in a working prototype of an adaptive growing rod and demonstrate its feasibility in a standardized biomechanics model. This device has the unique features of simultaneous high strength and ultra-low stiffness matching that of human bone, and the ability to vary its stiffness depending on location.   When compared to the leading competing growing rods based on the Harrington rods system in this market, these features reduce the number of revision procedures required by reducing a leading source of complications, facilitating healthy development of the spine from better load sharing, and improving the overall efficacy for treatment of severe scoliosis in children.  \r\n\r\nThis project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application: there is a current lack of quantitative understanding of how stress at the bone-screw interface is affected by implant stiffness in growing rod constructs.  This is important because high stress at the bone-screw interface is believed to be responsible for implant loosening and pull-outs.  Furthermore, it is not known how location-dependent implant stiffness modifies such stress.  The project seeks to bridge these gaps by quantitatively monitoring how stress at the bone-screw interface is affected by variations in the implant stiffness introduced by microstructural engineering and thermo-mechanical training in a Ti-Nb alloy.  Experiments are performed using a modified ASTM standard model that accounts for the changing stiffness of the growing spine.  In addition, personnel involved in this project, including a Ph.D. level graduate student and undergraduate researchers, will receive entrepreneurship and technology translation experiences through direct involvement in the customer development process.  Students will participate in all conversations with surgeons, hospital officials, regulatory personnel, and medical devices manufacturers.  Students will be asked to make customer contacts independently, and receive training of the lean-startup strategy central to the NSF I-Corps program.    \r\n\r\nThe project engages pediatric orthopedic surgeons and a medical devices manufacturer to ensure a clear and current understanding of clinical needs and challenges, as well as regulatory and reimbursement hurdles of this technology translation effort from research discovery toward commercial reality.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe primary, and most significant outcomes of this NSF AIR/TT project are a pair of medical implant devices that will potentially reduce the incidence of post-surgical complications in the treatment of degenerative disk diseases and scoliosis.  Both of these implants are currently being commercialized and awaiting FDA 510k clearance; it is expected that both devices will be on the market before the end of 2019.  The AIR/TT project helped to build the technical foundation for these products, generated lab-bench valildation, and established the entrepreneurial training and knowledge that eventually led to the commercialization efforts.\nThe first of the two device is a spinal rod device designed to address the problems of screw loosening during the treatment of early-onset scoliosis in young child and adjancet-level complications in the treatment of adult scoliosis.  The proposed solution to this problem utilizes a newly-developed Ti-Nb alloy funded by a previous NSF basic science project.  A key distinguishing characteristic of the alloy is that it possess a tune-able elastic modulus between 20-110 GPa while maintaining a high strength as expected from metallic alloys.  Modification of the elastic modulus through heat treatments performed prior to the final machining and surface finishing steps, which we call \"training\", can be performed on local regions in a device, such that the stiffness of a Ti-Nb rod could be varied from by location, allowing implants with flexible ends and rigid mid-span, or vice versa, to be engineered in order to satisfy the conflicting requirements of flexibility and rigidity.  Specifically for pedicle screw systems, reduced stiffness toward the ends of the rod, near the pedicle screw regions, allows for reduced stress at the bone-screw anchor and at the adjacent segments, while higher stiffness toward the mid-span maintains the rigidity needed for proper fixation. The Ti-Nb alloy is known to be biocompatible and does not cause inflammatory response.  We have shown through modified ASTM standardized testing that using a location-varied stiffness rod reduces the stresses on the vertebrae by over 65% compared to a standard titanium rod.  This significant reduction in adverse stress is expected to reduce the incidence of screw loosening and undesirable bone remodeling that begets a host of post-surgical complications. \nA second device made from the materials technology studied in the project is a spinal interbody device with tunable stiffness to match patient-specific differences in the bone quality and expected implant loads.  With the Ti-Nb alloy, we created an interbody device that could change stiffness by over 200% by changing processing conditions without changing the material compositions or the geometry of the implant.  The strength is not significantly impacted by the change of stiffness, and the process of stiffness control can be applied on an individual device level.   The operating principles of the stiffness control is very similar to that used for the aforementioned rod device.  This technology is expected to improve load sharing between implant and bone, and reduce the incidence of subsidence where the implant sinks into the surface of the vertebral end plate. \n The intellectual merit of the project is achieving the ability to tailor the elastic properties of the material by controlled precipitation of second-phase nanoparticles through aging heat treatments.  The project advanced knowledge in two specific areas:  1) Identify and quantify the effect of aging temperature and duration on the initial and strain-dependent elastic moduli of Ti-Nb alloys, and 2) Identify and quantify the effect of these variations on the stress state experienced by the spine.  The work produced processing parameters that overcome the technical barrier of obtaining the desired strain-dependent moduli response, followed by the fabrication of the working prototype device.\nIn terms of broader impact, the proposed project led to the introduction of a new type of spine implant that improves the outcome of adult and pediatric scoliosis, and degenerative disk diseases.  A prototype of the device was successfully demonstrated and subsequent interactions with industrial partnerss have led to 1) initiation of testing necessary for obtaining FDA clearance, 2) formation of academic-industry collaborations , 3) start of early-stage fund-raising efforts, 4) creation of licensing agreements, and 5) establishment of independent start-up company to market the product. Additionally, the project has also provided entrepreneurial training to both graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the faculty involved.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/27/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ji Ma"
