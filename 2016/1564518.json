 "awd_abstract_narration": "The University of South Alabama (USA) proposes to add four new cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students to their existing CyberCorps(R) Scholarship for Service (SFS) program in cybersecurity with strong emphasis on the cutting edge of critical cybersecurity research. The program is graduating skilled cybersecurity professionals with strong leadership skills and a commitment to public service. The project will have an immediate impact on the cybersecurity capabilities of the federal workforce by providing graduates with general computing and security skills. The University of South Alabama has a record of meeting the needs of a diverse student body and a high percentage of the students come from rural or financially depressed areas. In the current program, 30% of the SFS Cyber Scholars are female and 15% are members of underrepresented groups. The project team consists of 17 cybersecurity-focused faculty members providing education and research opportunities to the SFS Cyber Scholars. The expert faculty along with the state-of-the-art security laboratories allow students to be on the cutting edge of critical cybersecurity research issues facing the nation in one of the best cybersecurity research facilities in the country.\r\n\r\nThe project will continue the successful SFS Cyber Scholars program recruiting students throughout the Gulf Coast region and will enrich diversity and capacity in the national cyber workforce. The USA School of Computing is unique in this region, consolidating five undergraduate computing programs in information technology, computer science, cyber assurance, information systems, and health informatics. The project team brings both military service experience and experience in managing NSF's scholarship programs. Graduates of the USA Cyber Scholars program are skilled in research methodology, develop hands-on cyber knowledge, and are prepared professionally to enter the federal cyber workforce.",

Our local program is known as the University of South Alabama (USA) Cyber Scholars, which has a continuing focus to recruit, educate, train, and place future cybersecurity professionals in the federal workforce. The key objectives of the USA Cyber Scholars program are to recruit highly qualified applicants, mentor them in cybersecurity curriculum and research, provide professional development opportunities for them, and monitor progress toward these goals. Our ultimate goal is to ensure timely graduation and suitable placement. This was accomplished through our major activities: 1) advertising the Cyber Scholars program in the southeast region and recruiting potential students, 2) recruiting and selecting a cohort of students through scholarship awards, 3) developing and implementing mentorship activities for awardees, 4) building a network of government agencies for internships and future employment opportunities, 5) overseeing cybersecurity curriculum and training opportunities within the School of Computing at USA, and 6) monitoring placement of graduating students in the federal cybersecurity workforce.</p>\n<p>The USA Cyber Scholars program began in 2011 under award DUE-1241675 after participating in the CyberCorps program under a collaborative sub-contract with Mississippi State University. The program has been continued under this award (DGE-1564518) in 2016 and a second program renewal that started in 2022 under award DGE-2142948. Since inception, the Cyber Scholars program has awarded 63 scholarships total and graduated 50 students, with 10 students still completing their academic programs. All 50 program graduates have been placed in permanent cybersecurity positions across several federal executive agencies and approved Department of Energy Laboratories (82%), and the remaining with federally funded research and development centers as well as approved state positions (18%).

All 27 graduates were placed in permanent cybersecurity positions across several federal executive agencies and approved Department of Energy Laboratories (93%), and the remaining with federally funded research and development centers as well as approved state positions (7%). Of the scholarships provided by the grant, 39% were awarded to female students, with 16% of our recipients from underrepresented groups.</p>\n<p>Professional development of Cyber Scholar students during the grant period supported a wide variety of opportunities, including participation in monthly cybersecurity colloquiums and engagement of K-12 students in on-campus cyber learning activities.

This started with our initial grant in 2012 and continued under this current award DGE-1564518 that started in 2016.
