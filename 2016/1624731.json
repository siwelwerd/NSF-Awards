 "awd_abstract_narration": "The semiconductor industry is perennially one of America's top exporters. Worldwide semiconductor \r\nsales for 2014 reached $335.8 billion, and the number of U.S. jobs in this sector was estimated to be \r\naround 250,000 in 2013. More broadly, the U.S. tech industry, which depends on semiconductor \r\ninnovation to spur new products and applications, is itself estimated to represent no less than 5.7% of the \r\nentire U.S. private sector workforce (at nearly 6.5 million jobs), and with a tech industry payroll of $654 \r\nbillion in 2014, it accounted for over 11% of all U.S. private sector payroll. Yet despite its success, the \r\nindustry must continue to innovate if the U.S. is to retain global leadership in this highly competitive area. \r\nThe complexity of modern microelectronic products necessitates the use of computer tools to formulate \r\nand verify product designs prior to manufacturing. When a product doesn't operate as intended or suffers \r\nearly failures, this can often be attributed to inadequacy of the models used during the design process. In \r\nfact, the shortcomings of existing approaches for system component modeling have become a serious \r\nimpediment to continued innovation.\r\n\r\nThe Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML) proposes to create \r\nmachine-learning algorithms to derive models used for electronic design automation with the objective of \r\nenabling fast, accurate design of microelectronic circuits and systems. Success will make it much easier \r\nand cheaper to optimize a system design, allowing the industry to produce lower-power and lower-cost \r\nelectronic systems without sacrificing functionality. The eventual result will be significant growth in \r\ncapabilities that will drive innovation throughout the electronics industry, leading to new devices and \r\napplications, continued entrepreneurial leadership, and economic growth.\r\n\r\nWhile achieving those goals, CAEML will also focus on diversifying the undergraduate engineering \r\nstudent body and improving the undergraduate experience. Students from groups traditionally \r\nunderrepresented in engineering will be targeted for recruitment as undergraduate research assistants. \r\nMember companies will provide internships and mentors for participating students, and the diverse \r\ngraduate and undergraduate student researchers in CAEML will receive hands-on multidisciplinary \r\neducation. CAEML will also participate in all three site universities' existing avenues for student and \r\nfaculty engagement with local youth. In particular, university-based summer camps are a tried and tested \r\nmethod of making high-school students familiar with and comfortable on our campuses. The HOT DAYS \r\n@ Georgia Tech (https://www.ece.gatech.edu/outreach/hot-days)  camp is a week-long summer program \r\ndesigned to introduce high-school students to electrical and computer engineering concepts through \r\nvarious half-day modules including building a computer, working with robots, using music synthesis \r\ntechnology, building simple digital logic circuits and constructing a speaker from common household \r\nitems. Additional modules covering CAEML research areas will be developed and incorporated into the \r\ncamp's schedule. CAEML undergraduate and graduate students can serve as counselors or instructors \r\nfor camps. Georgia Tech's Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing \r\n(CEISMC) hosts a variety of camps and programs for K-12 teachers, as well as students. CAEML faculty \r\nat Georgia Tech will participate in that effort as well as the NSF-funded Summer Teacher Experience in \r\nPackaging, Utilizing Physics (STEP-UP) Program (https://www.ece.gatech.edu/outreach/step-up-\r\nprogram), which is an eight-week research experience for metro Atlanta high-school physics teachers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Center for Advanced Electronics through Machine Learning (CAEML) will create machine-\r\nlearning algorithms to derive models used for electronic design automation, with the objective of enabling \r\nfast, accurate design of microelectronic circuits and systems. The electronics industry's continued ability \r\nto innovate requires the creation of optimization methodologies that result in low-power integrated \r\nsystems that meet performance specifications, despite being composed of components whose \r\ncharacteristics exhibit variability and that operate in different physical or signal domains. Today, \r\nshortcomings in accuracy and comprehensiveness of component-level behavioral models impede the \r\nadvancement of computer-aided electronic system design optimization. The model accuracy also impacts \r\nsystem verification. Ultimately, the proper functionality of an electronic system is verified through testing \r\nof a representative sample. However, modern electronic systems are so complex that it is unthinkable to \r\nbring one to the manufacturing stage without first verifying its operation using simulation. Today, \r\nsimulation generally does not ensure that an integrated circuit or electronic system will pass qualification \r\ntesting the first time, and failures are often attributed to insufficiency of the simulation models. With an \r\nimproved modeling capability, one could achieve better design efficiency, and also perform design \r\noptimization. For system simulation, behavioral models of the components' terminal responses are \r\ndesired for both computational tractability and protection of intellectual property. Despite many years of \r\nsignificant effort by the electronic design automation community, there is not a general, systematic \r\nmethod to generate accurate and comprehensive behavioral models, in part because of the nonlinear, \r\ncomplex, and multi-port nature of the components being modeled.\r\n\r\nCAEML will pioneer the use of machine-learning methods to extract behavioral models of electronic \r\ncomponents and subsystems from simulation waveforms and/or measurement data. The Center will make \r\n2 primary contributions to the field of machine learning: it will demonstrate the application of machine \r\nlearning to electronics modeling, and develop the entire machine-learning pipeline. Historically, machine-\r\nlearning theorists have focused on the model learning and evaluation tasks, but CAEML will focus on \r\nend-to-end performance of the pipeline, including data acquisition, selection and filtering, as well as cost \r\nfunction specification. CAEML will develop a methodology to use prior knowledge, i.e., physical \r\nconstraints and the domain knowledge provided by designers, to speed up the learning process. Novel \r\nmethods of incorporating component variability, including that due to semiconductor process variations, \r\nwill be developed. The intended end-users are electronic design automation (EDA) tool developers, IC \r\ndesign houses, and system design and manufacturing companies.\r\n\r\nCAEML consists of 3 sites: Illinois, Georgia Tech, and NC State. The scope of research at each site \r\nencompasses both algorithm development and the application of the derived models to a variety of IC \r\nand system design tasks. Investigators at all 3 university sites have unique skills and expertise while \r\nsharing interests in electronic design automation, IC design, system-level signal integrity, and power \r\ndistribution. To leverage the cross-campus expertise, many of the Center's proposed projects involve \r\ninvestigators from more than one site. The Georgia Tech investigators have special expertise in \r\nadvanced IC packaging, power integrity, multi-physics simulation, computational electromagnetics, neural \r\nnetworks, optimization and system integration. All three sites have strong research records in the fields of \r\nsignal integrity analysis and electronic design automation. Excellent computational resources are \r\navailable at Georgia Tech for the proposed work including extensive measurement and fabrication \r\nfacilities.",
