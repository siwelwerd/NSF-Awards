 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-Technical Abstract\r\n\r\nHighly-efficient non-linear optical (NLO) materials are essential to act as waveguides for electrooptic applications. Such materials are used in ultrafast laser spectroscopy and, more recently, to generate ultraviolet laser light for nanolithographic applications. Current research and engineering activities in the field of NLO materials typically concern synthesis of NLO crystals; however, research is needed for understanding how to design NLO materials and why materials exhibit a particular NLO response. While exploring the fundamental driving factors for creation of new NLO materials, research will be performed to grow large (on the order of one cubic centimeter) single crystals to allow a quantitative understanding of the interaction of light with the NLO material. These analyses of basic principles by graduate students and postdoctoral associates -- who are also engaged in local education, teaching, mentoring, and leadership -- will enhance scientific progress and promote commercial expansion of this technologically important field.\r\n\r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract\r\n\r\nEmerging technologies require high-performance nonlinear optical (NLO) materials that exhibit enhanced optical properties at the microscopic and macroscopic level. The rational design of crystal structures, in particular noncentrosymmetric materials, and how to target polar, polar-chiral, and chiral structures, is an ongoing theme in crystal engineering. A new class of potentially high performance NLO inorganic materials, solid-state oxide-fluorides, has been identified.  These studies demonstrate that i) the use of fluoride ligands with early-transition metals enhances the second-order Jahn-Teller distortion in comparison to pure oxide compounds, ii) the synthesis of noncentrosymmetric materials can be promoted with the use of polar basic-building units, and iii) the synthesis of compounds that contain two separate anionic building units is likely to result in a noncentrosymmetric compound. These materials comprise a large and new class of solids with properties associated with piezoelectricity, pyroelectricity, ferroelectricity and second harmonic generation (SHG). The structure-property relationships that give rise to high, low, or null nonlinearities of the NLO materials will be examined. Finally, the growth of large crystals (on the order of one cubic centimeter) allows detailed analysis with measurements of the NLO tensor and phase-matchability properties, and other properties of interest such as piezoelectricity.  The materials synthesized will have potential use in relaxor ferroelectrics and non-linear optics. These materials will have a high damage threshold and the potential to fabricate large, single crystals suitable for optical use and technical applications. \r\n\r\nThe project is supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program in the Division of Materials Research.",

The NLO properties necessary for applications in tunable laser systems, as well as other technologically useful properties such as piezoelectricity, ferroelectricity, and pyroelectricity, are available in crystalline materials lacking inversion symmetry, known as noncentrosymmetric (NCS) solids.

Notably, NH<sub>4</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub>F has 2.5 times higher NLO efficiency than the current standard DUV material, KBe<sub>2</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, and large single crystals of this material can be synthesized without the toxic reagent BeO. We also synthesized two quaternary tellurates with the formula BiMTeO<sub>6</sub> (M= Al, Ga), which display chiral structures (spacegroup <em>P</em>312) in which inversion symmetry is broken by the stacking order of octahedral building units without the presence of a local chiral center.</p>\n<p>Other new NCS compounds discovered by our group provide excellent examples to understand structure-property relationships in NLO materials. A new pentaborate compound, K<sub>3</sub>B<sub>5</sub>O<sub>8</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>, crystallizes in the point group<em> mm</em>2 (spacegroup <em>Fdd</em>2) and displays low SHG efficiency (0.5 x SiO<sub>2</sub>).&nbsp; The <em>&chi;</em><sub>14 </sub>component of the macroscopic<sub> </sub>NLO<sub> </sub>susceptibility in point group<em> mm</em>2 is equal to zero, which means the anti-parallel arrangement of [B<sub>5</sub>O<sub>10</sub>] units along the <em>x</em>-axis leads to the cancellation of &chi;<sub>14 </sub>and thus prevents the maximal component of &chi;<sub>14</sub> from contributing to the macroscopic NLO<sup> </sup>susceptibility of the crystal.

Experimentally, high-quality single crystals of Ca(BO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> with maximum dimensions of 50 x 41 x 22 mm<sup>3</sup> were successfully grown by the Czochralski method. The outstanding performance attributes provide evidence that Ca(BO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub> can be an excellent DUV birefringent material for light polarization.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 10/03/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Kenneth&nbsp;R&nbsp;Poeppelmeier</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1608218/1608218_10422620_1570142560719_ic-2018-01965h_0002--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1608218/1608218_10422620_1570142560719_ic-2018-01965h_0002--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Crystal Structure of K3B5O8(OH)2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1608218/1608218_10422620_1570142560719_ic-2018-01965h_0002--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Crystal Structure of K3B5O8(OH)2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">(a) Ball-and-stick and (b) polyhedral representation and of the structure of K3B5O8(OH)2.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Fenghua Ding</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kenneth&nbsp;R&nbsp;Poeppelmeier</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Crystal Structure of K3B5O8(OH)2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1608218/1608218_10422620_1570142875813_ja-2018-04762a_0006--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1608218/1608218_10422620_1570142875813_ja-2018-04762a_0006--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Poly-anionic Vanadium Oxide-Fluoride Iodate Building Units\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1608218/1608218_10422620_1570142875813_ja-2018-04762a_0006--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Poly-anionic Vanadium Oxide-Fluoride Iodate Building Units\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">A comparison of (a) trans-[VFO2(IO3)2]2? and (b) cis-[VO2F2(IO3)2]3? polyanions.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Hongwei Yu</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kenneth&nbsp;R&nbsp;Poeppelmeier</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Poly-anionic Vanadium Oxide-Fluoride Iodate Building Units</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1608218/1608218_10422620_1570143056654_ic-2018-010879_0006--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1608218/1608218_10422620_1570143056654_ic-2018-010879_0006--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Inversion Symmetry Breaking via Cation Ordering in BiMTeO6\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1608218/1608218_10422620_1570143056654_ic-2018-010879_0006--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Inversion Symmetry Breaking via Cation Ordering in BiMTeO6\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Inversion symmetry is broken in the structure of BiMTeO6 (M=Al, Ga) by the site ordering of M and Te cations.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Fenghua Ding</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Kenneth&nbsp;R&nbsp;Poeppelmeier</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Inversion Symmetry Breaking via Cation Ordering in BiMTeO6</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
