 "awd_abstract_narration": "(U-Th)/He thermochronology is a powerful tool for constraining the thermal history of rocks and regions. The technique can provide detailed insight into a myriad of geologic processes, including the formation of both ancient and modern landscapes, the thermal evolution of fossil-fuel source rocks, and the history of asteroid impacts. Almost any geologic process that results in or from a change in temperature can be studied with (U-Th)/He thermochronology. This proposal will fund the acquisition of an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS), a key piece of instrumentation needed to make (U-Th)/He measurements, at the University of Colorado Thermochronology Research and Instrumentation Lab (CU-TRaIL). The CU-TRaIL serves an expanding user base in the broader Earth science community, and acquiring a dedicated ICP-MS will help meet the growing demand for (U-Th)/He data. The new machine will be located in the same laboratory space as the sample preparation facility and the He extraction and measurement line, thereby allowing for much more efficient analyses and greatly reducing current inefficiencies in laboratory staff time. In addition, students and other lab scientists will be able to quickly experiment with new and innovative techniques to increase the range of processes that can be addressed with (U-Th)/He thermochronology and to improve the efficiency and quality of the measurements. The speed, and versatility of the new ICP-MS machine will also open up the possibility for new collaborations within the Geological Sciences department, and provide University of Colorado graduate students with invaluable experience and training opportunities. \r\n\r\nThe CU TRaIL is currently equipped with mineral separation and microscopy facilities, a quadrupole He system for degassing and measuring He from minerals, and clean lab space for mineral U-Th spiking and dissolution. This award will provide funding to acquire a new quadrupole inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) primarily utilized for U-Th solution analysis for (U-Th)/He geochronology. The new ICP-MS will also be made accessible for other types of analyses, especially trace element work on digested accessory mineral, carbonate, and whole rock solutions, in which there is particular interest in the Department of Geological Sciences at CU. CU TRaIL has generated >3800 sample analyses; developed external collaborations that include 24 senior PIs and 20 graduate and undergraduate students; billed >$230,000 worth of analyses; generated data used in at least 42 abstracts and 4 submitted manuscripts on which a CU TRaIL member is a coauthor; and hosted a short course that filled rapidly to maximum capacity. This successful launch of the facility promises a healthy future ahead. However, the lab is now experiencing intensifying demand for data from both internal and external users. The current bottleneck to meeting this growing need is access to an ICP-MS to efficiently generate U-Th analyses for dissolved mineral solutions. This access issue also poses an obstacle to training students and visitors in this key part of the method, and limits flexibility in running experimental solutions associated with several avenues of the lab?s method development work. Acquisition of an ICP-MS will address these research, development and training demands, and will lead to >50% increase in efficiency in this part of the analytical process. It will also aid in achieving the lab?s twin goals of conducting innovative, interdisciplinary, and high-caliber research while simultaneously serving the greater Earth science community.",
