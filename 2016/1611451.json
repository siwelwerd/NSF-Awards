 "awd_abstract_narration": "With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Yeh at University of Texas at Austin and Professor Petty at Furman University are studying the properties of small metallic particles, termed silver clusters. Due to the special chemical, physical and optical properties of silver clusters, these tiny particles have been made into a variety of colorful molecular sensors for detection of disease-related DNA and modifications on DNA. But we do not understand what really controls the color, the stability, and synthesis yield of these wonderful nanomaterials. The project seeks to answer these fundamental questions, with the end goal to engineer and harness silver clusters for a diversity of biological sensing and imaging applications. Undergraduate and high school students at Furman characterize the chromophores and the graduate students at UT-Austin at the same time develop their sensing applications. The collaboration and feedback between the two groups are the linchpin that drives the development of new nanosensors. Furthermore, the PIs outreach to local high schools to integrate a larger group of interested and talented students. These research activities will inspire a diverse group of curious students to share in the excitement of scientific innovation.\r\n\r\nFuture progress in fluorescence detection and imaging is hampered by the scarcity of functional probes. Professors Yeh and Petty are developing a novel class of switchable and tunable silver clusters that are conjugated with DNA strands. They are addressing core factors that control the chemical stabilities, biocompatibilities, and optical properties of silver clusters using a wealth of purification and analysis techniques such as HPLC, SEC, CD, MS, ICP-AES and DNA footprinting. Silver clusters present new opportunities for molecular sensing and imaging because of their strong, activatable emission. The transformative integration of physical/analytical chemistry, molecular engineering, and photonics will create a versatile set of toolkit for diverse applications, including personalized medicine, super-resolution microscopy, and biothreat detection.",
