 "awd_abstract_narration": "This small scientific conference focuses on the chromosomes of fungi, including baker`s yeast as well as other useful as well as harmful fungi. In addition to their many roles in decay and turnover of living matter in the biosphere, fungi (yeasts, molds, mushrooms, etc) are convenient organisms to study how living cells copy their chromosomes, divide in two, and then rebuild their nuclei with the right number of chromosomes in them. This conference brings together scientists that work on this subject. The organizers have come up with several formats that give opportunities to the young scientists to present and discuss their research with the more experienced mentors from all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe FASEB Yeast Chromosome Structure, Replication, and Segregation Meeting surveys the knowledge of the simple model systems that have allowed several recent breakthroughs in understanding of eukaryotic chromosome biology. First presented to the community at the earlier conferences in this series, some of such breakthroughs include fine mapping of functions in DNA replication, single-molecule analysis of early event in replication origin recognition, detailed mapping of meiotic recombination, kinetochore ultrastructure, etc. The organizers make a case that the relatively narrow scope of the biological processes under study, combined with the broad arsenal of technical approaches presented during the meetings make them a uniquely intense training experience for the participants. Broader impact of the conference includes the ongoing experimentation with the presentations` format, allowing a high proportion of talks to be presented by postdoc-level scientists, in sessions chaired and mediated by accomplished investigators.",

The focus of this work is understanding how genomes are maintained, duplicated and segregated, questions of basic importance in cell biology and for understanding genome stability and evolution.  The NSF funding was used to support the participation of junior scientists at the meeting.  In particular, the funding used to defray the registration costs of 4 junior faculty and 5 student speakers at the meeting.\n\n The post conference survey confirms that the meeting was a success.  Meeting participants gave the meeting a score of 4.4 to 4.6 out of 5 on a variety of questions about satisfaction with the meeting organization, talks and posters.  In particular, the Flash Talks&mdash;5 minute talks by students and postdocs designed to increase exposure of junior scientists&mdash;were very well received, with strong support expressed to the organizers for including similar talks in future meetings.  86% of participants said they would like to attend the meeting again.\n\nBoth in terms of intellectual goals of disseminating the most recent scientific discoveries and fostering collaboration in the field and the broader impact goals for increasing participation and visibility of junior scientists, the organizers feel that the objectives of the NSF support of this meeting were thoroughly fulfilled.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/12/2016\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Nicholas R Rhind"
