 "awd_abstract_narration": "As personal robots become common in our homes, they will perform a broad range of helpful tasks for their owners.  In doing so, all sorts of physical interactions will occur between the robot and the home environment, for example, picking up a mug requires the robot to carefully control contact forces as it secures a grasp. As tasks become more advanced, for example, operating a can opener, the robot will have to \"understand\" how to grasp the can and the can opener, so that it can operate the opener.  The goal of this project is to gather data and develop algorithms that will allow a robot to understand how to grasp tools in a way that facilitates its ability to operate that tool safely and effectively. \r\n\r\nThis research aims to improve the understanding of the physical interactions between the instruments and the environment in daily manipulation tasks with the goal of developing effective robotic grasp and manipulation planners to facilitate the tasks. The research designs and develops a physical-interaction observation system to observe both the interactive motion and wrench between the instruments and environment in several representative instrumental manipulation tasks by a number of participants. Each manipulation task is characterized with its instrumental motion models and wrench distribution models. Using the models, optimal grasps are generated using the task wrench coverage measure and evaluated using a real robotic arm and hand platform. The data collected in this work enables researchers to fully explore daily living tasks and provide excellent training and testing data sets for other related research.  The optimal manipulation grasping approach equips robot manipulators with the ability to hold instruments with a firm grasp to withstand the disturbance in daily living interactions and perform tasks efficiently.",
