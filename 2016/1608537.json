 "awd_abstract_narration": "Glycan-binding proteins are crucial for a wide range of biological processes. They belong to two distinct groups: lectins and glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins (GAGBPs). A member of one group rarely possesses the characteristics of both groups. The human lectin Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a member of the first group. This project is based on the finding that Gal-3, a lectin, actually possesses characteristics of a GAGBP. The current study investigates these newly-discovered characteristics of Gal-3. The research is integrated with educational activities through an initiative called \"From Bench to Blackboard.\" This initiative introduces glycobiology to high school students and K-12 teachers through lab- and web-based approaches. The anticipated results from the proposed work is revealing hitherto unknown properties of Gal-3 and will inspire new research activities involving Gal-3 and GAGs.\r\n\r\nGal-3 is one of the most extensively studied human lectins but it has never been reported as a GAGBP. However, preliminary data for this study show that Gal-3 binds to sulfated GAGs and proteoglycans. The proposed research elucidates the detailed interactions of Gal-3 with GAGs and proteoglycans. The length and sulfation level of GAGs, that are optimal for binding by Gal-3, are determined by calorimetry and spectroscopy. The GAG binding site of Gal-3 is being delineated with the use of site directed mutagenesis. Various biophysical techniques are employed to study non-covalent cross-linking of Gal-3 by GAGs and proteoglycans. In addition, competitive cross-linking of Gal-3 by GAGs and glycoproteins is also being examined. Information obtained from this research is redefining the binding properties of Gal-3 and providing a foundation for discovering Gal-3 dependent cellular and extracellular functions of GAGs and proteoglycans.",

GBPs belong to two subgroups: lectins and glycosaminoglycan (GAG)-binding proteins (GAGBPs). The structures of the binding sites of lectins, their preferred ligands and mode of actions are fundamentally different from those of GAGBPs. While lectins interact with specific glycoproteins, GAGBPs recognize GAGs and proteoglycans. A member of one subgroup is not expected to possess the characteristics of both. The current NSF-funded project, however, established that human lectin Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a notable exception to that rule. Data obtained through this project unequivocally showed that, besides being a lectin that binds to N- and O-linked glycoproteins, Gal-3 has the properties of a GAGBP. The project revealed the following unexpected characteristics of Gal-3. (i) Gal-3 interacts with sulfated GAGs (heparin and chondroitin sulfates) and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) (Figure 1). (ii) Sulfated GAGs and CSPGs specifically bind to the LacNAc/lactose binding site of Gal-3. (iii) Four positively charged amino acids in the vicinity of the LacNAc/lactose binding site of Gal-3 play important roles in GAG binding (Figure 2). (iv) While, heparin, chondroitin sulfate B (CSB) and E (CSE) are found to be monovalent ligands of Gal-3, chondroitin sulfate A (CSA), chondroitin sulfate C (CSC) and bovine CSPG engage in multivalent binding with Gal-3 and form cross-linked complexes (Figure 3). (v) Constituent monosaccharides and the sulfation patterns of GAGs modulate their cross-linking abilities and affinities for Gal-3 (Figure 3). (vi) By using CSA and CSC as baits or capturing agents, Gal-3 was purified through a newly developed detection method named&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ca</span>pture and&nbsp;<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Re</span>lease (<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">CaRe</span></strong>) (Figure 4). (vii) It was determined that Gal-3 bound to GAG chains through a mechanism named <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">bind and jump</span>&nbsp;</strong>(Figure 5). While full length GAG chains bind to Gal-3 with micromolar affinity, shorter GAG fragments bind to Gal-3 with weak affinity. (viii) GAGs including CSA and CSC perturbed Gal-3-glycoprotein cross-linked complexes (Figure 6).</p>\n<p>Thus, the outcome of this project clearly shows hitherto unanticipated functional ties of Gal-3 with sulfated GAGs and proteoglycans.
