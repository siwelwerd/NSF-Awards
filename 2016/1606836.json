 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract Title: The Fundamental Limit of Fiber-Optic Sensors in the Infrasonic Region\r\n\r\nNontechnical: Fiber-optic sensors have been widely used in industry and research. However, one of their fundamental properties, the intrinsic limit of sensitivity, has not been fully understood. Specifically, at infrasonic frequencies (below 20 Hz), there has been no direct observation of the inherent noise in fiber-optic sensors, and the available theories remain inconclusive. The proposed project aims to address this problem by devising a set of experiments to probe the sensitivity-limiting noise in optical fibers and supporting the experimental study with advanced theoretical modeling. By uncovering the physics underlying the ultimate limit of sensor performance at low frequencies, the research will substantially deepen the understanding of infrasonic fiber-optic sensing, allowing future sensor designers to exploit the full potential of fiber-optic sensors at an unprecedented level of sensitivity. Moreover, the novel sensor designs used in the experiments will serve as blueprints for future ultra-sensitive distributed infrasound sensors, which are critical for monitoring mass-destruction weapons, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, glacial motions, etc. The project will directly fund multiple students at both undergraduate and graduate levels and will generate capstone and summer research opportunities for college and high school students. It will also help create a new research thrust, precision fiber-optic sensing, at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, and improve the presence of NSF in the state of Alabama.\r\n\r\nTechnical: The overarching goal of the planned research is to understand the physics that sets the ultimate limit of fiber sensor sensitivity at low frequencies. The investigation will primarily focus on direct measurement of the spontaneous thermal noise generated by optical fibers in the infrasonic region. A parallel effort will also be dedicated to the development of a three-dimensional visco-elastic model with concentric structures to describe the thermomechanical noise in optical fibers. To address the challenges facing the measurement of the minuscule thermal noise at infrasonic frequencies, a new sensor design based on a Mach-Zehnder-Fabry-Perot hybrid interferometer will be employed. Preliminary theoretical analysis has shown that such a scheme is able to raise the sensor sensitivity by a factor of 104, hence extending the thermal noise-dominated spectral region to well below 1 Hz. The scientific merit of the proposed research rests upon its primary goal toward uncovering the fundamental physical law of fiber thermal noise. The mystery surrounding the 1/f behavior of fiber thermal noise has puzzled researchers for two decades. There is an urgent need within the fiber-optic sensor community for a thorough investigation specifically targeting the low-frequency characteristics of thermal noise. By leveraging new sensing concepts such as hybrid interferometers, the proposed work will completely transform optical sensing for low-frequency signals and open up a new paradigm of infrasonic technologies.",

We have successfully demonstrated the proposed Mach Zehnder-Fabry Perot (MZ-FP) hybrid interferometer and used it to verify theoretical predictions of the fundamental fiber thermal noise across a broad frequency range, including the infrasonic region. Our results not only show direct experimental evidence of thermodynamic noise and thermomechanical noise in fibers, but also offer new approaches to achieve ultrahigh-resolution strain sensing. Many applications can potentially benefit from these findings, including optical sensing, optical metrology, gravitational wave detection, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>(2)&nbsp;Novel fiber sensors for structural health monitoring (SHM).</strong> SHM is a critical technology in the nation?s long-term infrastructure development and maintenance. We have developed a variety of techniques that aim to address some of the current challenges in SHM. For example, multi-parameter Lamb-wave sensing based on polarization-maintaining fiber Bragg gratings (PM-FBG) reduces the number of sensors needed for anisotropic materials such as carbon composite materials. Meanwhile, dynamic PM-FBG strain sensors based on differential detection offers background-free strain monitoring with much improved signal resolutions. Pico-strain resolution fiber-optic sensing in the infrasonic region based on fiber Fabry-Perot interferometers enables unprecedented measurement resolutions at low frequencies, which is especially suitable for SHM purposes.</p>\n<p><strong>(3) Fiber-optic sensing under harsh environment.</strong> Sensing under severe conditions are ubiquitously needed in planetary and solar missions, oil/gas exploration, geophysical research, and aerospace manufacturing and testing. Jumpstarted by this NSF grant, we have established a new research thrust in the area of harsh-condition fiber-optic sensing. Specific topics under study include: <em>i) </em>fiber-optic heat-flux sensors for high-temperature, high-pressure and corrosive environment, <em>ii)</em> distributed water quality (e.g., turbidity, PH value, etc) sensing using silica fiber networks, <em>iii)</em> distributed fiber-optic temperature sensing in Li-ion batteries for battery thermal control, and <em>iv)</em> fiber-optic hydrogen sensors for renewable energy safety. These activities have led to extensive multi-disciplinary collaborations and additional research funding, including new grants from NASA, EPA and the State of Alabama.</p>\n<p><strong>(4) Real-time spectroscopy with high resolution and high sensitivity.</strong> Time-stretch spectroscopy (TSS) has established as an important technology for real-time spectroscopy. However, its overreliance on detector speed and inherent tradeoff between spectral resolution and signal-to-noise ratio hinder its applications. With the support of this NSF grant, we have demonstrated a new TSS scheme called <em>time-wavelength optical sampling</em> (TWOS), which is able to overcome these shortcomings. A sub-GHz spectral resolution and a frame rate as fast as 2 kHz have been achieved with simple, off-the-shelf components, demonstrating the potential of this technology in real-world applications. A U.S. patent on this technology is pending.</p>\n<p>Here are the major educational and societal outcomes of the project:</p>\n<p><strong>(1)</strong> Overall, the project has produced <strong><em>3</em></strong> Ph.D. dissertations, <strong><em>1</em></strong> granted patent, <strong><em>2</em></strong> pending patents, <strong><em>18</em></strong> journal publications, and <strong><em>14</em></strong> refereed conference papers. The results and data have been disseminated through publications, conferences, invited talks, lectures, and online platforms (e.g., researchgate.net, Google Scholar, ArXiv, etc).</p>\n<p><strong>(2)</strong> Overall, the grant has partially funded <strong><em>7</em></strong> graduate students for their research activities, conference trips, and publications. It has also led to <strong><em>15</em></strong> undergraduate capstone research projects (PH 499, HON499 and OPE 460). <strong><em>Eight</em></strong> of these undergraduate students are<strong><em> </em></strong>female. Students funded by this grant have won such prestigious award as SPIE Optics and Photonics Education Scholarship and Alabama GRSP Fellowship. Many have become professionals in the field of optics.</p>\n<p><strong>(3)</strong> Research activities funded by this grant has stimulated extensive collaboration between the PI and the engineering departments at UAH, which expands the reach of the core research into a broader range of fields. It has also helped establish a collaborative platform between UAH and NASA in the area of fiber-optic sensing. In addition, the patents generated by these works and the associated promotion activities have attracted potential industrial partners and thereby further disseminated the outcomes of this project into the society at large.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 08/28/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Lingze&nbsp;Duan</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1606836/1606836_10422831_1630157473932_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1606836/1606836_10422831_1630157473932_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Reaching thermal noise limit with new fiber interferometer\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1606836/1606836_10422831_1630157473932_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Reaching thermal noise limit with new fiber interferometer\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Fig. 1.
