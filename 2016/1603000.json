 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Beaufort Gyre is circulation pattern in the Arctic Ocean.  Observations have documented that in 2003 to 2014, the Beaufort Gyre region accumulated more than 5000 km3 of liquid freshwater relative to the climatology of the 1970s.  Recent results suggest that the Beaufort Gyre system may be entering a period of freshwater release.  The release of so much freshwater to the sub-Arctic seas of the North Atlantic region has the potential to modify processes in this region, which is important for the climate system. This project will investigate how the Beaufort Gyre accumulates and releases freshwater and how this influences processes in the Arctic Ocean and in the sub-arctic seas of the North Atlantic. \r\n\r\nThis project would contribute to STEM workforce development by providing support for the training of a graduate student.  The project also would provide support to a young, female scientist during the formative years of her career.  The project will continue and enhance a productive collaboration that the PI has established with Shanghai Ocean University (SHOU) and leverage computational resources in Shanghai.  Additionally, it benefits from a collaboration between SHOU and the Norwegian research company Akvapan-niva AS, Norway, allowing access to field observations collected by this group.  Outreach to the K-Gray community will be achieved through leveraging existing infrastructure and activities at the PIs' respective institutions.\r\n\r\nRecent studies do not agree on the major causes of freshwater accumulation in the Beaufort Gyre region, or the consequences of freshwater release from this region to the North Atlantic.  This project will fill that gap by applying the high-resolution, unstructured grid Arctic Ocean - Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model (AO-FVCOM), complemented by analysis of historical observational data sets from the region, to investigate:\r\n1) processes and mechanisms of freshwater accumulation and release in the Beaufort Gyre region; \r\n2) roles of major sources contributing to the freshwater content changes in the Arctic Ocean; \r\n3) pathways of fresh water and sea ice from the Beaufort Gyre to the subpolar North Atlantic; and \r\n4) consequences of this release on hydrography, deep convection and circulation.",

The overarching goal of this award was to understand the critical physical processes related to the variability of ocean circulation and freshwater storage in the Beaufort Gyre region and project the changes in the sea ice, freshwater content, and inflow and outflow transports.</p>\n<p>We have developed a high-resolution, geometrical-fitting, unstructured grid Finite-Volume Community Ocean Model for the Arctic Ocean (AO-FVCOM).

The results reveal that the freshwater flux from the sea surface (Ekman pumping) is a primary physical mechanism to the regional interannual variability of freshwater content.&nbsp; As a result of increased freshwater runoff in response to global warming and high variability of ice extent, the coastal flow over the Arctic shelf and slope has dramatically changed in the last decades. The intensified coastal and slope flows have become a competitive source for the unprecedented freshwater accumulation in the region. However, since the freshwater transport driven by the inflow over the slope is significantly smaller than the freshwater outflow from the Beaufort Sea to the Arctic interior, the net lateral flux plays a minor role in the freshwater accumulation in the Beaufort Gyre.</p>\n<p>We projected the impact of global warming on the future Arctic ocean condition. The IPCC uses a&nbsp;representative concentration pathway&nbsp;(RCP) &nbsp;to represent the greenhouse gas&nbsp;concentration. The Community Earth System Model (CESM)?s projection based on a radiative forcing value of 8.5 W/m<sup>2</sup> (RCP8.5) suggests that in the Arctic, the yearly-mean air temperature, net heat flux, and river runoff will increase ~0.12?C, 0.06 W/m<sup>2</sup>, and 0.03x10<sup>4</sup> m<sup>3</sup>/s, respectively. &nbsp;We conducted the AO-FVCOM simulation for 2025 and 2050 by considering the CEMS-RCP8.5-projected changes in air temperature, heat flux, and river runoff. In the Beaufort Sea, compared the 2050 simulation results with the 2018 condition, the sea ice extent will significantly reduce, with a maximum of -6x10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup> occurring in August and September. The yearly-mean sea surface temperature will increase by ~0.4-0.8?C. The Arctic Ocean will become much fresher. Especially during summer and autumn, the maximum salinity drop at the sea surface can exceed 2 SPU. Significant reduction in the sea ice and increased river runoff will intensify the coastal and slope currents with order up to ~ 10 cm/s. The global-warming will enhance the seasonal variability of the circulation in the Arctic Ocean and stabilize the Beaufort Gyre. The freshwater content in the Beaufort Gyre region will increase due to the net advective freshwater inflow from slope during the spring and by a net Ekman pumping-induced freshwater flux via the lateral freshwater flux during summer through autumn. Warming will reduce the inflow flux through Fram Strait by a maximum up to ~0.5 Sv. It will thus increase the freshwater outflow from the Arctic to the North Atlantic Ocean.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/15/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Chang-Sheng&nbsp;Chen</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1603000/1603000_10440222_1631740260741_image6--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1603000/1603000_10440222_1631740260741_image6--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Projected changes in SST and salinity\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1603000/1603000_10440222_1631740260741_image6--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Projected changes in SST and salinity\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Projected changes in the sea surface temperature (left panels) and salinity (right panels) relative to the 2018 state in September 2050.
