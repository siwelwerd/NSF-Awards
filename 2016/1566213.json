 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Catalysis Program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Kenneth M. Nicholas, Chemistry Department, University of Oklahoma, is developing methods for removing oxygen from alcohols. Many components of plants, such as cellulose and glycols, are alcohols and the conversion of these into valuable commodities often requires the removal of oxygen. However, this is a difficult process to accomplish. In this project rhenium and vanadium compounds are being developed as catalysts that effectively deoxygenate and couple alcohols in an environmentally benign way. Ultimately, the project may develop new chemical processes for the conversion of renewable feedstocks made from plants into useful chemicals and fuels. The project provides educational and technical training for future  scientists at the University of Oklahoma, two regional colleges (in Texas and Louisiana), and the Oklahoma School of Science and Math.\r\n\r\nThe overall objective of this project is to discover, develop and mechanistically elucidate selective deoxygenation reactions of all classes of alcohols employing oxo-rhenium and -vanadium catalysts and economical, benign reductants. The targeted reactions include alcohol and phenol deoxygenation, alcohol reductive coupling, and reductive cyclizations of 1,n-diols. Structure/reactivity relationships and mechanistic insights into oxygen-transfer reactions are being established through the study of substrate- and catalyst-dependent catalyze deoxygenation, reductive coupling product selectivity, the reactivity of probable metal-alkoxide reaction intermediates, reductions of oxo-metal complexes by hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and computational modeling of potential reaction pathways.",
