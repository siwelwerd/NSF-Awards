 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tidal disruption events (TDEs), which occur when a star is destroyed by the gravitational\r\nfield of a supermassive black hole, are unique probes into the properties of otherwise-quiescent\r\nsupermassive black holes (SMBHs). About 30 of them have been observed so far and this number\r\nis steadily increasing, aided with surveys and new instruments coming online. Despite this\r\nwealth of observational knowledge, our understanding of the TDE physics, which will ultimately\r\nallow us to interpret those observations, remains rudimentary at best. In particular, we still\r\ndo not understand what causes the debris to lose its energy and angular momentum, fall into\r\nthe black hole and radiate. This project will make use of the fact that, at their core,\r\nTDEs are ultimately well-described by the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD)\r\nequations of motion. By carrying out direct GRMHD simulations of TDEs, the project hopes to obtain a first-principles\r\nunderstanding of TDE physics. \r\n\r\nThe proposed simulations will provide answers to several long-standing\r\nquestions in the TDE community: How does the debris circularize, dissipate energy, and accrete\r\nonto the SMBH? What fraction of stellar gas forms the disk, what fraction is ejected as an\r\noutflow, and how do these fractions depend on the black hole mass, spin, and the inclination\r\nof the stellar orbit? Do eccentric accretion disks form and how does angular momentum transport\r\nwork in such disks? If such an eccentric disk is tilted, as is naturally expected in TDEs,\r\ndoes it undergo general relativistic precession? Do such disks produce relativistic jets and\r\nhow? Understanding these issues will allow the community to make meaningful, quantitative\r\ninterpretation of TDE observations.\r\n\r\nEven though the project is focused on TDEs, it elucidates the basic\r\nphysics of tilted accretion disks and their jets that is applicable to a range of sources\r\nincluding quasars, black hole binaries, and ultra-luminous X-ray sources. \r\nAdditionally, the proposed simulations will study, from first principles\r\nand for the first time, the development of magnetorotational instability in eccentric tilted\r\naccretion disks and the long-term evolution and GR precession of such disks under continuous\r\nfeeding by the debris stream.\r\n\r\nMoreover, stars shredded by black holes and producing relativistic jets offer some\r\nof the most fascinating manifestations of general relativity. The project will disseminate the\r\nresults obtained as part of this proposal in public talks, summer schools, radio station and\r\nnewspaper interviews, and press releases. Finally, the project will involve undergraduate students in data\r\nanalysis and visualization, and they will gain experience in working with Big Data, black\r\nhole accretion and jet physics, presenting their results at conferences, and publishing their\r\nwork in peer-reviewed journals.",

We simulated in general relativity for the first time how curious stars, which abandon their secure lives at large distances, wander too close to their galactic centers where they get torn into spaghetti-like strands by million times more massive black holes. We showed that such tidal disruptions, even when the stellar orbits are tilted relative to the black hole equator, as is typically expected, still result in the formation of whirlpools of gas known as accretion disks.

We showed for the first time that contrary to long-standing expectations, accretion disks produce powerful jets even when the magnetic field is dominated by the azimuthal component, as expected in tidal disruptions. If a tilted disk is thin, we demonstrated that its inner regions can flatten out in the black hole equatorial plane, resolving a 40-year-long problem of what happens to such disks in the presence of magnetic fields.
