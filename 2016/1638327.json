 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effects of extreme events on society are not only a function of the immediate damage induced on the physical infrastructure system, but also of the post-event recovery process that a community is able to implement. This recovery process depends on the availability of investments from the financial sector (e.g. by private banks, insurance, and re-insurance companies). Appropriate relationships between these financial and physical infrastructures are therefore necessary to provide the financial pre-conditions for rapid and efficient restoration of the physical system. On the other hand, these extreme events also represent stressors for the financial network, and can cause collapses if the relationships between financial and physical infrastructures are not established in a sustainable, resilient manner. This project aims at developing a deeper understanding of the relationships coupling the financial and physical infrastructures and their effect on the resilience of these interconnected systems. This improved understanding will ultimately lead to support for policy makers and for financial and physical infrastructure managers in order to improve preparedness for and responsiveness to extreme events.\r\n\r\nThe aims of this project will be accomplished through the integration of existing research in the fields of physical infrastructure risk assessment and financial network modeling with computational techniques for the analysis of large interconnected systems. Models and methods for engineering reliability analysis of systems subjected to extreme events, Markov chain models for system evolution and recovery following major disruption, and network models of transportation and supply infrastructures will be used for describing the physical infrastructures. Financial infrastructures and the contractual relationships among these institutions and between physical and financial sectors will be modeled using financial network analysis techniques, incorporating recent results in distress propagation and progressive financial collapse. Combining these into a common heterogeneous network model for interconnected physical and financial infrastructures, resilience analysis will be conducted under a suite of potential hazard scenarios. Because of the computational challenges associated will modeling the responses of large systems of physical and financial assets during the hazard recovery process, surrogate models for network diffusion analysis, analyzed using graph-theoretical approaches, will be developed and calibrated, allowing for efficient analysis of large-scale systems. Finally, making use of the above resilience analysis, the graphical structure of the physical-financial network, representing the contractual relationships between these entities, will be optimized in order to maximize the resilience of the resulting system under the extreme hazard event. The results of this network optimization will be useful to policy makers in determining which contractual structures and policies best support and improve the resilience of the interconnected system. Overall, this project will result in a better understanding of the interactions of hazard, vulnerability, and financing in the post-event recovery of communities exposed to extreme events from an interdisciplinary perspective combining engineering, finance, and network theory. Computationally, the framework will allow for analysis of large systems, including random (or uncertain) heterogeneous network structures.",

The management process of these systems can be formulated as a sequential decision-making problem under uncertainty, where actions are selected to minimize long-term metrics related to costs and risks. Predictions of long-term evolution are affected by systematic uncertainty (e.g. about climate change), which can be reduced by acquiring and collecting additional data. The project has developed analytical tools to support long-term decision making, to assess the benefit of information and to relate the assumption of availability of future information to current decisions. With application to flood risk mitigation, the analysis has showed how the assumption regarding the availability of future information can play a key role in current decision making: generally, higher information availability induces higher flexibility in current design strategy.</p>\n<p>The occurrence of extreme events puts stress on both the physical infrastructure, causing damages and failures, and the financial system. The recovery process following an event requires a large amount of resources from financial agents, such as insurance companies. If the demand for funds overpasses their capacity, these financial agents cannot fulfill their obligations, thus defaulting, without being able to deliver the requested funds. The project has investigated how the resilience of urban communities depends on the reliability of the financial agents operating in the insurance markets, and how to optimize the mechanism adopted by these agents to share the requests for funds from stakeholders. We have modeled the integrated system as a graph (where nodes represent financial agents and physical assets, and links relations among these, as illustrated in Figure 1), have considered models of fund demands coming from the physical assets, have evaluated metrics such as the expected number of defaults, and have identified the graph configuration which optimizes these metrics. In many settings, we have found that pooling the capacities of all agents together is effective: this is the \"perfect team\" redistribution. However, the analysis shows that, in some settings, the contagion prevails on the diversification of the risk, making us prefer a risk-sharing mechanism with a lower level of redistribution with respect to the \"perfect team\". Figure 2 illustrates how the probability of failure of the team (Pf) depends on the number n of financial agents and their capacity c. The graph shows that, for that model, a low capacity suggests breaking the configuration in small teams.</p>\n<p>In the maintenance/repair process, the impact of information in decision making can be assessed by the so-called \"Value of Information\". We have shown how this value can be negative for agents acting under external constraints, as regulations imposed by public codes, and this is an example of the phenomenon of information avoidance. For example, a manager forced to repair an asset when its probability of failure is too high can prefer to avoid collecting free information about the actual condition of the asset, and even to pay in order to avoid this (as illustrated in Figure 3, where the value of information becomes negative). We have illustrated how the value of information depends on regulations, and discussed how incentives and penalties can alleviate information avoid.</p>\n<p>To process the information collected by sensors and estimate physic parameters of large scale problems, the project has developed approaches based on Bayesian inference, integrating physical-based models. We have shown how novel numerical techniques, based on Markov Chain and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, can be efficiently used for generating samples and infer physical parameters in high dimensional models. As an example of application, Figure 4 shows an example of pressure field in the soil (above) and inferred permeability (below). We have compared the performance of different sampling approaches in some settings related to mechanics modeling, relevant for natural and induced seismicity.</p>\n<p>All the project outcomes have direct impact for the field of risk analysis and control of engineering systems, including urban infrastructure systems. The developed frameworks and the results of the analysis are useful to decision makers and to policy makers, in determining control policies for the interconnected systems, optimal configuration of financial agents, effective regulation for information collection. Overall, this project promotes a better understanding of the interactions of hazard, vulnerability, and financing in the post-event recovery of communities exposed to extreme events.
