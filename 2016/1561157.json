 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant funds a workshop to bring together Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) researchers supported by NSF's Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) program and those supported by the Department of Energy (DOE). As NSF's response to the President's Materials Genome Initiative, DMREF seeks to foster tight collaborations between materials researchers in experiment, theory, and computation. These collaborations are founded on highly iterative feedback loops in which experimental results directly inform theory and computation, and vice versa, with the goal of accelerating the discovery and development of new materials. The workshop provides researchers a forum to share their research results and discuss cross-cutting topics related to establishing and sustaining research collaborations, managing digital data, and supporting long-term simulation software development. \r\n\r\nResearchers that are participating in Material Genome Initiative projects provide leadership to the broader materials research community by implementing strategies to achieve the goals set out by this Initiative, including reducing both the cost and time it takes to bring a new material to market. The workshop addresses both successes and challenges faced at the early stages of research, particularly for highly collaborative projects, and helps solidify newly-formed collaborations. Overarching themes identified through presentations, break-out sessions, and discussions are presented in a report for dissemination to the broader materials research community. MGI projects are developing tools that are made available to aid research of the larger community and this workshop presents the most effective ways to implement this task. The workshop, which will be held in the Arlington, Virginia area on January 11-12, 2016, follows in a series of successful workshops, the latest being held in Bethesda, Maryland January 12-13, 2015.",
