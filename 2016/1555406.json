 "awd_abstract_narration": "Dynamics Days is a conference that focuses on nonlinear dynamical and complex systems, including physical and biological systems. The conference brings together experts in experimental techniques, theoretical analysis, and mathematical modeling. The themes of the conference include Mechanical Systems, Mathematical Sciences, Computing Sciences, Physics, Life Sciences, and Network Sciences. Funds are requested to support the participation of students and young researchers, who will have the opportunity to contribute talks or present in a poster session.\r\n\r\nIn the last decades, Dynamics Days has established itself as a premier conference for interactions between specialists in different fields and between young and established researchers. The topics of the conference cover a variety of areas with overlapping interests in nonlinear dynamics, including mathematics, physics, engineering and the life sciences. This variety attracts participants from a broad range of fields.  Topics of emphasis in 2016 include, but are not limited to: Applications of Network Science to biological and social systems; Self-propelled particles, flocking, swarming; Complex materials, granular materials; Control and stability of dynamical systems and complex systems; and Pattern formation, fluid dynamics, nonlinear waves.",
