 "awd_abstract_narration": "In this project funded by the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms Program A of the Chemistry Division, Prof. Benjamin J. Schwartz of UCLA is using a combination of experimental and theoretical techniques to unravel the structure and behavior of solvated electrons.  The ability to combine experiment and theory in this way provides outstanding educational opportunities not only to undergraduate and graduate students, but also to Los Angeles area high school students via an outreach program for science teachers.  The broader impacts of this work include a better understanding of solvated electrons, which play central roles in radiation chemistry (it is reactions with solvated electrons that makes ionizing radiation dangerous to living organisms) and electron transfer reactions (such as those in both biology and batteries).  \r\n\r\nThe experimental focus of the project is based on using ultrafast spectroscopy to study the properties of solvated electrons.  Ultrafast spectroscopy takes advantages of pulses of light that are extremely short (~100 fs), providing a means to \"stop action\" of the electrons on the time scale with which molecules move in room temperature liquids.  The theoretical focus of the project is based on mixed quantum/classical simulations.  Here, quantum mechanics is used to describe the properties of the solvated electrons, but the solvent molecules are treated classically.  The simulations can be used to calculate the results of the ultrafast spectroscopy experiments, so that together, the combination of experiments and simulations can provide new insights into the structure and reactivity of this interesting and important chemical species.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nWhen an extra electron is injected into a liquid, the resulting species is termed a ?hydrated electron?.  Hydrated electrons are important in radiation chemistry:  for example, when ionizing radiation passes into a living organism, the radiation kicks electrons out into the water, and it is reactions of the electrons with the various biological molecules that ultimately produce radiation damage.  Despite their importance in radiation chemistry and other reactions, there are still basic features of the hydrated electron that are unknown, such the structure of the electron in the water.  Since hydrated electrons are readily produced in the laboratory and are also amenable to study by computer simulations, they provide an excellent system for directly confronting theory with experiment.\n\nOne the experimental side of this project, we used ultrafast spectroscopy to measure various properties of the hydrated electron as a function of temperature.  The experiments allow us to ?look? at the electron on time scales of less than one millionth of one millionth of a second    (10?12 s), effectively allowing us to measure the electron?s properties faster than the water molecules can move.  We found that the lifetime of hydrated electrons that absorb a laser pulse decreases by more than a factor of 2 as the temperature changes from freezing to 50 ?C (122 ?F).  We also found that with careful analysis of the data, we could measure light emitted from the electrons as well as light absorbed by them, providing solid benchmarks for testing by theory.\n\nOn the theoretical side of the project, we continued our exploration of two distinct models of the hydrated electron:  the traditional model in which the electron expels water from a small region and occupies the cavity created, and a ?non-cavity? model created by us which predicts that the electron occupies the space between water molecules, so that there are some water molecule ?inside? the electron.  We also developed new theoretical methods for examining the way water molecules leave and enter the electrons? interiors in the different models.  We find that predictions of the cavity model match well with some experiments, but fail to reproduce others, and vice-versa for our non-cavity model.  In particular, the traditional cavity model is unable to account for the observed temperature dependence of the hydrated electron?s properties, including those measured by us described above.  The non-cavity model gets the temperature dependence about right, but does not reproduce experimental properties measured by other groups, such the average volume occupied by the electron. \n\nThe students and postdoctoral fellows funded by this award are already going on to careers that make excellent use of the fundamental science they learned through this research.  Former theory postdoc William Glover is now an assistant professor at NYU Shanghai.  Former theory graduate student Chen-Chen Zhou is now employed by a data analytics firm in the San Francisco Bay Area.  Former experimental graduate student Erik Farr is now employed by a start-up company in the San Diego area making light-sources for sub-10-nm lithography used in computer chip manufacturing.  Current theory graduate students Wil Narvaez and Sanghyun Park are developing new skills in computer programming and numerical algorithms, while current experimental postdoctoral fellow Eric Wu and graduate student Mariah Gomez are learning advanced laser methods and the safe handling of air-sensitive chemicals.  Both Chen-Chen and Mariah are female and openly gay, and Wil is Latino, so all these students come from highly underrepresented groups, so that the project has contributed to diversity in the sciences.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/04/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Benjamin J Schwartz"
