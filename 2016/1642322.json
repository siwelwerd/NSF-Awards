This workshop brings together a diverse group of 35 participants from a broad range of institutions and geographic areas to discuss opportunities for instrument usage in the \"mid-scale\" range. These discussions focus on instrument development activities that meet the needs of the chemistry community. \r\n\r\nWorkshop addresses the following objectives: define national needs in the chemical sciences for mid-scale instrument development,  organize needs assessment around chemical grand challenge problems, and develop a report specifying prioritized objectives in chemistry. The broader impacts are addressed by dissemination of the findings and recommendations which start a broader conversation among key stakeholders in the US chemical sciences community, including instrument developers, facility managers, and users, as well as federal agencies supporting chemical sciences.",
