 "awd_abstract_narration": "The essential building blocks of spoken human language are the consonants and vowels that we produce and perceive to communicate. Yet, separate from these elements is a melodic level called word prosody. By changing pitch and emphasizing certain parts of a word, we can convey the word's meaning and even the broader significance of a phrase. In approximately 50% of the world's languages, changes in pitch on a single syllable can change a word's meaning. Such languages are called tone languages. The most commonly-spoken language in the world, Chinese, is a tone language, as are most of the languages of East and Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southern Mexico. Yet despite decades of research on the building blocks of language, consonants and vowels, we understand little of how humans perceive tone and how tone is integrated into the larger grammatical systems that we use to communicate in everyday life. For instance, Just how is tone processed in the brain? What do speakers produce and listeners tune their ears towards when producing tones rapidly in conversation? How do the deeper grammatical processes affecting tone influence such things?\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to bring together experts from diverse perspectives who focus on tone languages. While linguists have explored the diverse ways in which tone interacts with grammar and meaning, they have paid less attention to its role in cognition. On the other hand, psychologists have focused mainly on the neural and behavioral processing of tone, but have not explored tonal detail nor its interaction with grammar. Furthermore, most of the cognitive research on tone focuses on just a handful of East Asian languages. Yet, tonal systems vary substantially across the world's languages and the research should reflect this diversity. Finally, computational work on tone languages has the potential to promote cross-collaboration among researchers, but such work is still in its infancy. The 5th Symposium on the Tonal Aspects of Languages will focus specifically on integrating different academic approaches to the study of tone, promoting the study of diverse tone languages, and modeling tonal behavior using computational methods. These goals will promote greater collaboration across disciplines and drive the scientific study of tone forward.",

A total of 78 authors from 14 different countries submitted papers to the conference. They presented work on 32 different languages from many different language families (Sino-Tibetan, Oto-Manguean, Niger-Congo, Austroasiatic, Indo-European, etc.) These papers spanned various academic disciplines as well (phonetics, phonology, neuroscience, computational modelling, music research, and psycholinguistics).</p>\n<p>Extensive support was offered to graduate students attending the TAL meeting. Roughly half of the attendees were graduate students from universities around the world. All graduate students with papers accepted for oral presentation were offered travel reimbursement up to $500 and full hotel accomodation. Graduate students with papers accepted for poster presentation were offered partial hotel accomodation. Moreover, registration costs were kept low for graduate students ($50, which included the conference dinner). As a consequence, all non-local graduate students attending received some form of financial aid. This vastly improved the representation of graduate student research at the conference. Finally, during the first day of the conference, a special afternoon session on computational modelling of tone and prosody was presented by Dr. Yi Xu from University College, London.

Thus, in addition to achieving the goals set forth in the NSF proposal, the conference also generated a substantial amount of original research.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/09/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Christian&nbsp;T&nbsp;Dicanio</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1566053/1566053_10414484_1499630021788_IMG_0186--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1566053/1566053_10414484_1499630021788_IMG_0186--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Yi Xu presentation\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1566053/1566053_10414484_1499630021788_IMG_0186--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Yi Xu presentation\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Dr. Yi Xu (University College London) presenting on Pentatrainer2, modelling software for analyzing tone.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Christian DiCanio</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christian&nbsp;T&nbsp;Dicanio</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Yi Xu presentation</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1566053/1566053_10414484_1499629865734_IMG_0217--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1566053/1566053_10414484_1499629865734_IMG_0217--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Graduate students\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1566053/1566053_10414484_1499629865734_IMG_0217--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Graduate students\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Graduate students at the TAL2016 poster session</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Christian DiCanio</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Christian&nbsp;T&nbsp;Dicanio</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Graduate students</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
