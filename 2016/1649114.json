 "awd_abstract_narration": "This grant supports the 22nd International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory (ISTTT) to be held July 24-26, 2017, in Evanston, Illinois. The symposium will showcase 35 original papers drawn from a pool of over 300 submissions from around the world. A special workshop session will be held to explore additional ways of placing the symposium findings into professional practice. This award will cover fellowships to foster participation from a selected set of advanced graduate students from underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nSince its inception, the ISTTT has been the premier gathering of transport theorists. The coming Evanston Symposium promises to build on that tradition: the papers accepted for the event represent breakthrough research from around the world. These papers have the potential to challenge current thinking about transport science, and perhaps even to transform the field. And the papers address a variety of pressing topics in transportation: they include ideas for promoting greener, more sustainable travel modes, and for transporting people and goods in emergency situations. Given the role that transportation plays in the world and in the lives of her people, the ideas unveiled in the coming symposium are expected to be of significance. An outcome of this workshop includes a report that summarizes the main intellectual achievements of the conference. The report will describe the key challenges raised, new problems identified, and main innovations proposed by the contributors of the conference.",
