 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Antarctic subglacial environment remains one of the least explored regions on Earth.  This project will examine the physical and biological characteristics of Subglacial Lake Mercer, a lake that lies 1200m beneath the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.  This study will address key questions relating to the stability of the ice sheet, the subglacial hydrological system, and the deep-cold subglacial biosphere.  The education and outreach component aims to widely disseminate results to the scientific community and to the general public through short films, a blog, and a website.\r\n\r\nSubglacial Lake Mercer is one of the larger hydrologically active lakes in the southern basin of the Whillans Ice Plain, West Antarctica.  It receives about 25 percent of its water from East Antarctica with the remainder originating from West Antarctica, is influenced by drain/fill cycles in a lake immediately upstream (Subglacial Lake Conway), and lies about 100 km upstream of the present grounding line of the Ross Ice Shelf.  This site will yield information on the history of the Whillans and Mercer Ice Streams, and on grounding line migration.  The integrated study will include direct sampling of basal ice, water, and sediment from the lake in concert with surface geophysical surveys over a three-year period to define the hydrological connectivity among lakes on the Whillans Ice Plain and their flow paths to the sea. The geophysical surveys will furnish information on subglacial hydrology, aid the site selection for hot-water drilling, and provide spatial context for interpreting findings. The hot-water-drilled boreholes will be used to collect basal ice samples, provide access for direct measurement of subglacial physical, chemical, and biological conditions in the water column and sediments, and to explore the subglacial water cavities using a remotely operated vehicle equipped with sensors, cameras, and sampling equipment. Data collected from this study will address the overarching hypothesis \"Contemporary biodiversity and carbon cycling in hydrologically-active subglacial environments associated with the Mercer and Whillans ice streams are regulated by the mineralization and cycling of relict marine organic matter and through interactions among ice, rock, water, and sediments\". The project will be undertaken by a collaborative team of scientists, with expertise in microbiology, biogeochemistry, hydrology, geophysics, glaciology, marine geology, paleoceanography, and science communication.",

To accomplish this, we drilled through ~3,600 ft (~1,100 m) of ice in 2018-2019 to study Mercer Subglacial Lake (SLM), a ~50 ft (~15 m) deep lake that is approximately twice the size of Manhattan. SLM is &lt; 60 mi (100 km) upstream from the coastline and a location where the ice sheet begins to float on the ocean. The lake receives significant volumes of water that flow beneath the ice, serving as a temporary storage basin for the nutrient rich water before it is periodically discharged to marine waters beneath the Ross Ice Shelf. Because of the relative isolation of the subglacial environment from the surface, the microbes in SLM's ecosystem must acquire their energy from the scarce food sources available in this permanently dark and cold environment.</p>\n<p>As the ice sheet advanced and retreated in the past, it altered conditions in the water and environments underlying the ice in profound ways. For one, advance of the ice sheet traps microbial food sources from the ocean under the ice, providing a range of substrates in the sediments suitable for fueling a variety of metabolisms. In addition, the pressure the glacier exerts on the bedrock as its flows crushes the rock finely, which supports chemical reactions that liberate minerals and generate compounds suitable as energy sources for microbes. In this way, the sources for energy in SLM contrast with lakes found on Earth's surface that directly rely on photosynthesis, with the interactions among ice, rock, and water being all that is necessary to sustain life under the ice.</p>\n<p>Microbes inhabiting SLM at the time it was sampled may be ancestors of marine microbes that were introduced to this region when the ice sheet retreated in the past, have originated from melting of ice overlying the lake, and/or have been co-transported with water that flows into the lake. Based on comparing the microbes in SLM with those previously documented in a nearby subglacial lake (Whillans Subglacial Lake) and marine waters near the ice sheet grounding zone, the majority of its species likely originated from interior portions of the continent that are beneath the ice sheet. Since water is known to be widespread at the base of the ice sheet, the implication is that SLM is a component of an interconnected microbial ecosystem that is linked through water transport and has evolved under deep ice for millions of years.</p>\n<p>Microbial processes that occur under ice sheets can substantially effect the greenhouse gases they release to the atmosphere and the nutrients they transport to the ocean. As these downstream consequences have the potential for global climate impacts, it is vital to communicate these findings to wide-ranging audiences. In a collaborative effort, our broader impacts were accomplished using a transmedia approach that allowed substantial public access to science and built on practical and theoretical research within the discipline of film. We created and disseminated our research through a documentary for PBS, short science films, a social media campaign, a museum installation, and PBS Learning Media modules for K-12 students. This project also trained a female graduate student at the University of Florida and provided opportunities for them to incorporate their research into the education and outreach activities, as well as present their data at international meetings. Three undergraduate students were also trained and participated in research activities during the course of the project, one of which is currently enrolled in a graduate program and pursuing a PhD degree.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/12/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Brent&nbsp;C&nbsp;Christner</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1543396/1543396_10457302_1642024838473_Xner_Fig1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1543396/1543396_10457302_1642024838473_Xner_Fig1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Water sample from Mercer Subglacial Lake\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1543396/1543396_10457302_1642024838473_Xner_Fig1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Water sample from Mercer Subglacial Lake\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">This water sample was collected through a 1,100 m borehole through the West Antarctic Ice sheet and from the middle of Mercer Subglacial Lake\ufffds 15 m water column.
