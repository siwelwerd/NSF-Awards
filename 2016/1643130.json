 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the Fifth Annual Midwest Women in Mathematics Symposium (WIMS) to be held on April 8, 2017 at Indiana University - Purdue University Indianapolis. The aim of WIMS is: (i) to highlight the scholarly contributions of female mathematicians in the Midwest region, and (ii) to stimulate collaborations, networking, and mentoring relations among female mathematicians in the Midwest region. WIMS has been established as an annual event that rotates among colleges and universities in the Midwest. The Symposium brings together female mathematicians from across the Midwest at all stages of their careers. Based on attendance at previous WIMS, 150 participants are anticipated in 2017.\r\n\r\nThe Symposium features two hour-long plenary lectures by distinguished senior female faculty members and ten thirty-minute invited lectures by promising female junior faculty and postdoctoral researchers. The topics of the academic sessions at WIMS 2017 are Geometry and Topology, Dynamical Systems, and Mathematical Biology. Graduate students and recent Ph.D.s have the opportunity to present their work at the Symposium Poster Session. The lectures and poster session are accompanied by open problem sessions, during which WIMS participants work in small groups to discuss field-specific problems. Such work will naturally lead to follow-up visits among the participants at other Midwest institutions and new long-term collaborations. More details about the symposium can be found at http://math.iupui.edu/~buse/WIMS-17/.",
