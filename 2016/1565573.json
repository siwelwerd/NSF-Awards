 "awd_abstract_narration": "This proposal will inaugurate a CyberCorps\u00ae Scholarship for Service (SFS) program at the University of Texas at El Paso. The UTEP SFS Scholars program will fund highly qualified students in the Software Engineering of Secure Cyber-Systems program.  They will graduate with the ability to apply disciplined software development principles and processes that focus on the specification of measurable attributes emphasizing safety and security, design of solutions that address such attributes, and verification and validation throughout the software lifecycle. SFS Scholars will complete a curriculum that is based on a nationally-recognized set of recommendations for building secure software systems, participate in an internship to utilize and enhance their cyber-security knowledge, and transfer knowledge gained from coursework into practice through hands-on activities that bring real-world experiences into the classroom and a practicum project with significant cyber-security components. In addition to providing a well-designed plan of study, the proposed program includes structured student mentoring following the nationally recognized Affinity Group model that develops students? professional, technical, and communication skills. The recruitment plan includes national, regional, and local outreach efforts to attract applicants, and a selection process that ensures recommendations of students highly qualified for the program. The effort includes formative and summative evaluation, a well-defined continuous quality improvement plan to assess how well the curriculum and student co-curricular activities prepare graduates for productive careers, and an Advisory Board that recommends program improvements based on data.\r\n\r\nThe recruitment plan includes strategic involvement with Women in Cybersecurity (WiCyS); Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), Center for Minorities and People with Disabilities and the Computing Alliance for Hispanic-Serving Institutions (CAHSI). The recruitment strategies aim for a cohort that is 40% female and 85% underrepresented minorities. The recruitment, retention, and student development efforts will impact students beyond those who are funded. The promotion of the experiences and successes of SFS scholars is expected to attract more students who seek education and training in secure cyber-systems. The educational and training materials developed through the program will be published and disseminated to CAHSI institutions and beyond via the CAHSI Summit and social media.",
