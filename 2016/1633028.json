 "awd_abstract_narration": "A number of phenomena of societal importance, such as the spread of diseases and\r\ncontagion processes, can be modeled by stochastic processes on networks. The analysis \r\nand control of such network phenomena involve, at their heart, fundamental graph-theoretic problems. \r\nThe graphs encountered are typically of large-scale (having tens of millions of nodes); \r\nfurther, typical experimental analyses involve large designs with a number of parameters, \r\nleading to hundreds of thousands of graph computations. Novel methods for solving these problems\r\nare needed, since fast response times are critical to effective decision making.\r\nThe overarching goal of this project is to develop efficient distributed algorithms \r\nand associated lower bounds for graph-theoretic problems that arise in computational \r\nepidemiology and contagion dynamics.  This will have a significant impact on these specific \r\napplications, through more efficient algorithmic tools for enabling complex analyses.  \r\nThe project will also make fundamental contributions to the design and analysis of \r\ndistributed algorithms for graph problems in large-scale networks, and will\r\nresult in an algorithmic toolkit with building blocks for performing large-scale \r\ndistributed graph computation.  The project will lead to significant curriculum development \r\nfor undergraduate as well as graduate students, as well as public health analysts. \r\nFinally, the project will help in involving minority and underrepresented students in research. \r\n\r\nThe technical focus of the project will be on distributed algorithms for fundamental topics \r\nin graph algorithms such as graph connectivity, distances, subgraph analysis, and different\r\nkinds of centrality measures.  These topics underlie some of the recurring problems in the \r\nmodeling, simulation and analysis and control of different kinds of contagion processes.  \r\nFor all these problems, the project will focus on developing provably efficient distributed \r\nalgorithms and showing lower bounds under a message-passing distributed computing model. \r\nThe PIs will also develop efficient implementations of these algorithms, and evaluate their \r\nperformance and solution quality in real-world graphs arising in epidemiology.  The graphs \r\nthat arise in these applications have several novel characteristics, which will present new \r\nchallenges as well as opportunities for distributed computing.",
