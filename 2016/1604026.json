 "awd_abstract_narration": "PI:  Variano, Evan\r\nProposal Number: 1604026\r\n\r\nThe goal of the proposed research is to experimentally and theoretically explore the physics of turbulent flows with high concentration of particles. The proposal focuses on the complex, and at the same time common in engineering applications, case of non-spherical particles that move on the flow field because of the combined effectws of drift and of inertia. Such flows are prominent in the chemical process industry (e.g., fluidized bed catalytic reactors, pneumatic transport) and in the environment. \r\n\r\nParticles large enough to exceed the Stokesian limit will be measured in turbulent flow. The general objective is to better understand particle motion for cases in which inertia is non-negligible, and the specific objective is to understand how particle shape influences response to fluid shear. Laboratory measurements will reveal particle acceleration, rotation, and mass transfer between individual particles and the surrounding fluid. One group of particles will be manufactured with transparent, refractive-index-matched materials and internal tracers, thereby enabling optical measurements of their rotation and translation in three dimensions. A second group of particles will fabricated from a new type of neutrally-buoyant silica-sucrose glass that was designed to slowly dissolve, thereby enabling measurements of the mass exchange between particles and fluid. The shapes that will be studied are cylinders and cones; additional shape features resembling tails and fins will be added to help evaluate the role of particle alignment with local coherent structures in the turbulent flow. Extending beyond the Stokesian limit can reveal new phenomena because inertia adds complexity to the interaction of particles with local shear. The proposed project will explore the inertial regime, providing observational evidence of how large particles interact with turbulence. Numerical methods cannot easily simulate the motions of interest, and thus the proposed laboratory techniques were developed to rapidly explore a large range of shapes. Particles of the type examined herein appear in many areas of science and engineering, and the proposed work will advance study in these areas by providing the first detailed description of the relevant physics. An example engineering opportunity lies in the design of small-scale robotic vehicles. The results herein will enable the design of navigation and sensing strategies, and determine how vehicle shape would influence these strategies. Related opportunities in the fields of biology and biomechanics include an improved description of animal behavior in turbulent environments, especially for mid-size aquatic organisms that balance swimming with drifting. Educational impacts will include the production of a series of videos that will be distributed online. These videos will provide a unified demonstration of particle motion across size, shape, and buoyancy regimes in both turbulent and laminar flows, in the spirit of the classic National Committee for Fluid Mechanics films.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project asks about how an object's shape affects the rate at which heat and mass are exchanged across the object's surface.  Some such results are well-known, e.g. the fact that spheres have a lower exchange rate than any other shape due to their minimal ratio of surface area to volume.  This is why curling into a ball helps a person stay warm in cold weather.  Rates of heat and mass transfer are also known for cases in which there is a steady fluid flow moving past the object.  For example, standard predictions exist for the heat loss from a cruising airplane or the rate of weathering on the surface of sediment sinking in the ocean.   This project intends to address a never-before-studied case in which the objects are free-floating in a turbulent flow.  This case is interesting because the fluid flow influences the exchange rate in a manner that is neither steady not totally random.  Instead, the flow is structured in a way that can have feedbacks with the object shape.  This feedback is an open question - we do not know its magnitude or even its sign!   Measurements in the decade leading up to this project showed that objects' shape change how they experience turbulence.  This implies that an object's shape will influence the types of flow they experience across their surface areas while suspended in turbulence.  Our goal in this project is to measure the statistics of these flows and quanitfy how they affect the rate of heat and mass transfer.  We do so for a variety of basic and applied shapes.  We are motivated by real-world engineering applications such as free-floating water-quality-measurement drones (e.g. the ARGUS project) and science questions such as the fate of carbon in the ocean (much of which moves between the open water, organisms, and sediment aggregates many times before eventually being sequestered at depth or returned to the atmosphere). \n\nThis project uses direct measurements in the laboratory, supported by the mathematical tools of scaling analysis.  Scaling analysis helps organize the laboratory-scale measurements and allows us to exten these results to a wide range of real-world phenomena, even those which are much larger than the laboratory tests.  The measurements use a variety of cutting-edge techniques, some of which were developed specifically for this project.  To measure the statistics of the flows surrounding each object we use high-speed videography closely related to the motion-capture technology used in Hollywood movies.  One difference between this work and Hollywood methods is that we use laser light to illuminate the flow, and do so in a very selective manner.  If light was present everywhere, it would be difficult to measure what is happening, so instead we work in a dark room and illuminate only a narrow region that has been carefully measured.  By doing this we can measure motion with high precision.  Such methods are well-established; for this project we added a new methodology.  We created particles from a custom material.  It is a nontoxic glassy substance that slowly decays in water, shedding its outer layer slowly like candy in a person's mouth.  Measuring these objects with both methods showed for the very first time the rates of heat and mass transfer between non-spherical objects and the turbulent fluid flow in which they float freely. \n\nThe first key result is that shape does matter - particles' dissolution rate varied across the shapes we studied.  This was not obvious in advance, because previous measurements of the same shapes showed that they all have the same amount of total kinetic energy.  So while they all move the same amount in fluids, the details of their motion are different and shape-dependent.  We show in this project that these differences in motion are enough to cause significant differences in the rate of heat and mass transfer.\n\nThe second key result was a big surpise.  We found that free-floating objects in turblent fluids have heat- and mass-exchange rates that follow a pattern that is exactly opposite to particles free-floating in stationary fluids.  In our measurements, disc-like particles have faster heat- and mass-exchange rates that rod-like particles.  It is very well established knowledge that in non-moving fluids, disc-like particles have slower heat- and mass-exchange rates that rod-like particles.  Using this conventional knowledge for the objects in turbulent flow would give a result that is exactly opposite to the truth.  Having  measured the actual rates of mass transfer for free-floating objects in turbulent flow give us the surprising and useful result that elongated objects dissolve more slowly than corresponding flattened objects.  Combining these results with previous ones suggest that this is because of the way that elongated objects align with the \"vortex tubes\" that are part of turbulent flow.  Detailed computer simulations can examine such hypotheses and use our results for validation and verification.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Evan Variano"
