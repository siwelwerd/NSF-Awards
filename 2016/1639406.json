 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports 83 graduate and undergraduate students studying at US institutions to participate in the 2016 Annual International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium - An Additive Manufacturing Conference. This conference will be held August 8 - 10, 2016, in Austin, Texas, hosted by The University of Texas in Austin. It is considered a globally-leading professional gathering in the additive manufacturing field. It brings together researchers from academia, industry, and national labs. The award provides student participants with opportunities to exchange ideas with leading researchers and engineers from worldwide industrial and governmental facilities, as well as with students and faculty from both domestic and international schools. In addition to nurturing a global additive manufacturing vision, participants will learn the latest research areas and results in additive manufacturing fields. \r\n\r\nThe support will cover the registration fees at $600 per student. The call for student support applications will be disseminated through posting on main conference website, promulgation through conference organizers, and direct communication with students involved in the poster session of the conference. The conference committee will select 83 students from these applications. The selection criteria include: (1) students must be from US institutions, and (2) students must be actively participating in the conference through presenting a paper or a poster. Priority will be given to students who have multiple technical papers accepted and students who present NSF-sponsored technical papers. After the conference, the list of students who receive the support will be posted at the main conference website and in the 2016 Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium post-conference report.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project supported student participation in the Twenty-Seventh and Twenty-Eighth International Solid Freeform Fabrication (SFF) Symposia.  The symposia took place on August 8-10, 2016 and August 7-9, 2017 in Austin, Texas at The University of Texas at Austin.  Funds offset student registrations which enabled students to come and participate.  For the 2016 meeting, there were 234 students which represented approximately 43% of the entire meeting participation.  The meeting had 360 oral presentations and 56 poster presentations.  Of these, 197 papers were included in the 2500-page proceedings.  Authors had an option to have their papers peer reviewed prior to publication.  For the 2017 meeting, there were 292 students which represented approximately 44% of the entire meeting participation.  The meeting had 436 oral presentations and 46 poster presentations.  Of these, 230 papers were included in the proceedings and two special issues of journals. \n\n \n\nRespecting student support, the total request was for 83 students from domestic universities to each receive a registration fee waiver valued at $600 each.  There were 70 qualified students who attended the 2016 SFF and 13 qualified students attended the 2017 SFF Symposium.\n\n \n\nIntellectual Merit\n\nThe 2016 SFF symposium was attended by 544 national and international researchers. The following year, total attendance was 667.  The Symposia were organized in a manner to allow the multidisciplinary nature of the SFF research to be presented coherently, with various sessions emphasizing computer interfacing and modeling, machine and process development and materials and materials processing for SFF.  The three-day event was completely composed of individual oral presentations to accommodate the demand for this dissemination format.  We believe that documenting the changing state of SFF art as represented by the meeting proceedings serves both the people presently involved in this fruitful technical area as well as the flux of new researchers and users entering the field.\n\n \n\nAll information on the SFF Symposium was made available through the worldwide web at http://sffsymposium.engr.utexas.edu. \n\n \n\nBroader Impacts\n\nIn addition to the benefits of direct meeting participation, students were able to network with the international additive manufacturing research community.  Wider dissemination was accomplished through the proceedings.  A total of 198 papers were included in the proceedings volume in 2016, and 214 total papers were published in 2017.  Another six papers were published in a special issue of the Virtual and Physical Prototyping journal, and ten were published in the journal JOM.\n\n \n\nThe SFF Symposium serves as a primary forum for networking and dissemination of information dealing with research issues in freeform fabrication.  According to Ian Campbell, senior editor of the Rapid Prototyping Journal, \"The SFF Symposium is to be regarded as the foremost international conference for rapid prototyping research.\"  RPJ, 9#1, 2003. In a recent tally by AM experts on the most significant milestones in the history of AM, excepting the invention of specific AM processes, the inauguration of the SFF Symposium ranks highest [1].  When asked which publications had greatest influence on the AM field, the Proceedings of the SFF Symposium tied with the only refereed archival journal dedicated solely to the AM field, the British-based Rapid Prototyping Journal [1].  This same group ranked the SFF Symposium highest by over 50% to the next conference when asked what meeting contributed most to the development of the AM field [1]. The SFF Symposium Conference Proceedings are heavily cited in the archival literature, and it is anticipated that the 2015 Proceedings will be as well.\n\n \n\n[1] Christopher L. Weber, et al., \"The Role of the National Science Foundation in the Origin and Evolution of Additive Manufacturing in the United States\", IDA Paper P-5091, IDA Science &amp; Technology Policy Institute, Washington, DC, 2013.\n\n \n\nAdditive Manufacturing is an extremely broad and interdisciplinary field, encompassing mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, aerospace engineering, biomedical engineering, computer science and engineering, biology, design, materials science and engineering, manufacturing science.  The topics covered at the SFF symposium impact many industries.  The 2016 and 2017 conferences served as a forum for this diverse interdisciplinary group of researchers to gather for the purpose of synergistic interaction and sharing of ideas and progress.\n\n \n\nThe SFF Symposium brings together students, faculty and research scientists to interact in areas related to freeform fabrication.  Details of student involvement are described elsewhere in the NSF project final report.\n\n \n\nThe Proceedings of the Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium is a significant contribution to the research literature in the field.    The proceedings are heavily cited in archival literature including the Rapid Prototyping Journal.  A special issue of ten best papers from the 2016 SFF Symposium was published as a special issue of the journal JOM in March of 2017.  Ten papers from the 2017 meeting will be published in a special issue of the journal JOM in March of 2018, and six will appear in 2018 in the journal Virtual and Physical Prototyping.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/09/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ihab Ragai"
