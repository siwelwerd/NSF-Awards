 "awd_abstract_narration": "Culturally Authentic Practice to Advance Computational Thinking in Youth \r\nThis project is funded by the STEM+Computing Partnership (STEM+C) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning. This project will contribute to that effort by developing and assessing a new curriculum for a high school course, Introduction to Digital Technology. This course is an entry-level Career Technical Education (CTE) course for high school freshmen and sophomores that can lead them to an academic pathway that culminates in students taking an Advanced Placement (AP) course in computer science. The updated course will be implemented in two schools having large populations of students from groups underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, and the course will promote development of computational thinking skills by engaging students in authentic and culturally relevant, problem-based, inquiry learning (PBIL) projects. Student-created multimedia digital narratives consisting of mobile applications and computationally generated music will showcase student learning and student solutions to PBIL challenges. The project will investigate the factors associated with successful implementation of the updated course and its expected outcomes, including the impacts of integrating computer science and computational thinking within STEM disciplines at the high school level. The outcomes of this project will: 1) contribute to the knowledge base for current efforts to integrate computer science and computational thinking in STEM courses for K-12 students nationwide; 2) facilitate greater participation of students traditionally underrepresented in STEM, including girls, in educational pathways to careers or advanced work in IT fields; and 3) impact current instructional programs in the state of Georgia, and potentially nationwide.\r\n\r\nThis project will employ a design-based research approach to develop and validate a pedagogical model for integrating instruction and learning of computational skills with science practices and crosscutting concepts. The feasibility of the model will be tested through a pilot study in two Atlanta-area schools having culturally diverse student populations. The project will provide teachers with teaching resources, the technology needed to implement the new curriculum units, and professional development opportunities to support their implementation of the curriculum.  A mixed-methods research strategy will be used to characterize and estimate the level of student gains in understanding and applying computational thinking skills, understanding targeted crosscutting concepts associated with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS), and increasing development of 21st Century skills, sense of belonging, and persistence in computer science. Data will be gathered from classroom observations, pretests and posttests of knowledge, embedded assessments within activities, interviews with teachers and students, and analyses of student work. Statistical models will be tested to explore the school and district-level factors that positively or negatively impact successful implementation and outcomes of the new courses.",

The initial curriculum, now titled <strong>Student-Centered Computing (SCC) Foundations</strong>, was designed to provide students with an engaging introductory computer science experience that would encourage all students, including girls and minorities, to continue in computer science. The key elements of the course are an inquiry-driven, collaborative project-based learning (PBL) approach, a focus on standards-based computer science skills and crosscutting concepts that transcend science and computer science, and the inclusion of culturally authentic practices that support the students? voice, choice and sense of critical agency. Students are encouraged to bring their personal interests and experiences to bear on their coursework by prompting them to choose a topic that interests them, team up with like-minded students, and use that topic as the driver for a year-long project. The students develop rigorous computational thinking skills as they create a narrated PowerPoint presentation and a website, digitally produce music, and design an app-based game.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual Merit</strong>: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The SCC curriculum is explicitly designed to encourage student agency and critical engagement, reduce identity threat, and promote asset-based thinking and a sense of belonging in the class and in the larger field of CS.

However, the results regarding teachers? experiences also illustrate that although teachers value many aspects of the curriculum, they experienced a set of relatively consistent challenges during the curriculum implementation.
