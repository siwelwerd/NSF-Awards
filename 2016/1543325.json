 "awd_abstract_narration": "Accurately measuring precipitation in Antarctica is important for purposes such as calculating Antarctica?s mass balance and contribution to global sea level rise, interpreting ice core records, and validating model- and satellite-based precipitation estimates. There is a critical need for reliable, autonomous, long-term measurements of Antarctic precipitation in order to better understand its variability in space in time. Such records over time are essentially absent from the continent, despite their importance. This project will deploy and test instrumentation to measure and record rates of snowfall and blowing snow in Antarctica.\r\n\r\nProject goals are based on installation of four low-power, autonomous Antarctic precipitation systems (APS) co-located at automatic weather station (AWS) sites in the Ross Island region of Antarctica. The APSs are designed with an integrated sensor approach to provide multiple types of observations of snow accumulation types at the test sites. The APSs are designed to construct an accurate timeline of snow accumulation, and to distinguish the water equivalent of fallen precipitation from surface blowing (lofted) snow, a prime confounding factor. The standard suite of instruments to be deployed includes: precipitation gauge with double Alter windshield, laser disdrometer, laser snow height sensor, optical precipitation detector, anemometer at gauge height, and a visible /infrared webcam. These instruments have previously been shown to work well in cold regions applications.",

However, snowfall is poorly measured due to the challenges of operating sensors in the Antarctic environment where temperatures can drop below -50 degrees Celsius and wind speeds can often exceed 50 mph (22 m/s). Weather models are typically used to estimate snowfall amounts but without accurate measurements of snowfall to compare the models against, the accuracy of the weather model to estimate snowfall amounts is unknown.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A research project was developed with the purpose of assessing the ability of current sensing technology to measure the small amounts of snowfall the polar regions receive and whether those sensors could operate year-round in the harsh Antarctic conditions. The goals of this research were to 1) show that a robust snowfall measurement system could be deployed and operated year-round, 2) accurately measure snowfall amounts, even under very light snowfall conditions, and 3) compare the measurements from the systems to one of the Antarctic weather models to assess its performance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Four locations on the Ross Ice Shelf near McMurdo Station were chosen to install a series of sensors that would provide information on snowfall amount, numbers of snow particles, including sizes and fall speeds, and wind and temperature measurements (Figure 1). Figure 2 shows an example of one of the instrument setups at the Lorne field site. The precipitation gauge was shielded by a series of baffles that help slow the wind and allow the snow to fall more vertically into the gauge, increasing its measurement accuracy. Snowfall size and fall speeds were measured to help distinguish conditions of blowing snow (snow that is picked up from the surface by the wind) versus falling snow, a snow height sensor measured how much snow would accumulate on the surface during each event, and a snow particle counter was used to help determine when snow was actually occurring and filter out erroneous measurements of snowfall from the precipitation gauge. Visible and infrared radiation sensors were installed to help further determine cloudy versus clear conditions and provide another method for determining if measured snowfall amounts in the snow gauge were due to blowing snow versus falling snow conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The project collected data in the field for two years (2017-2019) and was considered a success. It was demonstrated that all the sensors shown in Figure 2 could operate throughout the year, even in the harsh winter conditions. The snow gauges were able to collect and measure very small snowfall amounts at rates of approximately 1/1000<sup>th</sup> of an inch per hour, though at various points during the winter months the gauges did fill completely with snow and we were unable to get accurate snowfall measurements from August through October (during the latter part of the Antarctic winter). An additional, unexpected observation was the ability of the snow gauges to also measure sublimation rates (Figure 3). Sublimation occurs when snow undergoes a phase change and changes directly from a solid to a vapor without first melting. This can be seen in the snow gauge measurements as the snow mass decreases slowly over time. Sublimation is also a critical measurement because sublimation also accounts for loss of snow and ice on the glaciers and ice sheets and a journal paper is forthcoming on the observations regarding sublimation measurements. Estimates of sublimation have been made using various techniques but these measurements are the first long-term measurements of sublimation and have the potential to dramatically improve our understanding of the role sublimation plays in offsetting precipitation accumulation on the ice shelves and glaciers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Comparisons of observations have also been done against one of the Antarctic models and has shown that the model does a generally poor job at determining both the correct location of snow and the amount of snow, and a separate publication is being prepared to show these results. It should be noted, however, that the observations from the sensors can be used to improve the model estimations in the future as more research is conducted and thus improve our ability to estimate snowfall amounts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Lastly, the varying distances between the installation locations provided an opportunity to assess the variability in the snowfall amounts between the locations. This assessment will also help determine if the weather models have a bias in estimates based on location as well as showing the impacts of terrain on snowfall amounts near McMurdo (from Ross Island) versus flatter areas around Lorne and Alexander Tall Tower.
