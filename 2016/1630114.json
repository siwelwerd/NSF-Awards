 "awd_abstract_narration": "Quantum information science (QIS) is the interdisciplinary field that investigates how to control the behavior of systems obeying the laws of quantum mechanics to make them perform information-processing tasks.  The task of engineering and controlling quantum systems to perform interesting information-processing tasks is one of the grand challenges for 21st Century science and technology. If successful, it will have far ranging implications for many technologies, including computation, communications, and environmental sensing. The Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC) is a research center headquartered at the University of New Mexico, with an experimental node at the University of Arizona. Research at CQuIC focuses on the development of tools for the control of quantum systems and the application of those tools to information-processing tasks. Under this five-year award, CQuIC becomes a Focused Research Hub in Theoretical Physics (FRHTP). The activities of the FRHTP are centered on a stable of three postdoctoral research fellows who will, first, work with CQuIC's senior scientists and research students on projects generated by the FRHTP's Project Directors and, second, bring new expertise to CQuIC and introduce new research projects into the portfolio of quantum-control projects.  The chief outreach activity under the FRHTP is CQuIC's sponsorship and organization of the Annual Workshop of the Southwest Quantum Information and Technology Network. Held every February, the Workshop is attended by 150-225 scientists, with an emphasis on participation by undergraduate, graduate-student, and postdoctoral researchers.\r\n\r\nQIS is a large, diverse field that draws from a variety of disciplines in the sciences and engineering.  To do effective research in this field requires knowledge and expertise from many different backgrounds and attention to learning new theoretical concepts and experimental techniques as they are developed within or brought into the field.  CQuIC leaders categorize research projects in this diverse field in two ways.  The first focuses on the type of quantum system to be controlled. This encompasses the control and measurement of complex quantum systems, where the complexity arises because systems have many interacting parts (many-body systems), have Hilbert spaces of moderate to large dimension (qudits), or have complex dynamics by virtue of contact with environments or ancillas (open quantum systems).   The second categorizes the work according to objective, such as the development of tools for the control and measurement of complex quantum systems or on their application to specific computational, communication, or metrological control tasks.  Within this general framework, CQuIC pursues several research directions: foundational investigations in quantum information, control, and measurement; control of qudit atomic and optical systems; quantum control and squeezing of collective atomic spins; and analog quantum computation and simulation. Through close collaboration with experimental partners both within CQuIC, and within the larger SQuInT network, CQuIC advances both fundamental and practical aspects of quantum information science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nOverview.  This grant created a Focused Research Hub in Theoretical Physics (FRHTP)  within the Center for Quantum Information and Control (CQuIC) at the University of New Mexico (UNM), focused on the subject of Quantum Information Science (QIS).    QIS is an interdisciplinary subject that studies how the unique aspects of quantum physics at the atomic scale can be use to process information at the macroscopic scale.  Thus has applications in advanced computing, communication, and sensing). The central goals of the FRHTP were to advance cutting-edge theory in QIS and to enhance the professional development of early-career scientists in QIS.  The cornerstone of this project was a prize postdoctoral fellowship.  Postdoctoral fellows added new intellectual energy to CQuIC, creating synergy to enable advances that could not occur through the activities of the individual senior participants alone. The FRHTP at CQuIC served as a hub for the community in theoretical QIS, developing resources that accelerated research and education at UNM as well as nationally. We achieved this through a variety of hub activities that brought together the community to interact, create, and tackle critical problems, and integrate this with education, training, and shared educational resources to help develop the next generation of quantum information scientists.  Hub activities included hosting visitors, seminars, schools, and workshops (particularly the long-running SQuInT Annual Workshop), and creating outreach programs that focus on building diversity and inclusion of traditionally underrepresented groups in QIS.  The senior participants were divided into the Project Directors (PDs) who organized and lead the Hub and additional Senior Collaborating Participants from UNM and other partnering institutions, including national laboratories in New Mexico, Sandia and Los Alamos National Laboratories.  \n\nIntellectual merit.  A core goal of the FRHTP was to advance knowledge in theoretical QIS by providing value added that enabled CQuIC to address the most pressing and challenging problems of the field.  Research was driven by CQuIC postdoctoral fellows funded by this grant.   Outcome were published is high-impact peer-reviewed journals, and at professional conferences and workshops.  A sample of the key finding and explorations include:  \n\nReliability of analog quantum simulation:  In the era of Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, digitized error correction is not possible.  We found important relationship sbetween computational complexity and sensitivity to imperfections, including quantum chaos, and other dynamical instabilities.  \nQuantum sensing:  Nonclassical properties of light and matter can be used ad precision sensors that enable measurements beyond the standard limits of noise.  We established the foundational understanding of \"quantum illumination,\" whereby nonclassical light is used for the task of radar (target detection in the atmosphere). We analyzed the performance of this protocol and explained the fundamental mechanism for the known quantum advantage.\nCharactering quantum performance: Deducing the performance of quantum information processors is challenging because measurement of a quantum system disturbs the system.  We showed how one can optimally tomographically reconstruct the state of qubit given an ensemble of identically prepared copies.  These results also give fundamental new insight how to create optimal measurement and reconstruction protocols for other quantum devices.\n\n\n \n\nBroader Impacts. The FRHTP at CQuIC created a nucleus, drawing together the broad QIS theory community in a hub for hosting short and long-term visitors, workshops, conferences, and postdoctoral fellows.  CQuIC broadly impacted the community through its flagship organization of the Southwest Quantum Information and Technology (SQuInT) Annual Workshop, a world-class interdisciplinary QIS conference friendly to students, postdocs, and other early-career researchers.  Additional broader impact is in education.  The FRHTP placed high priority on recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities (URMs) to participate in building a diverse and inclusive group of QIS theorists.  We worked locally, leveraging the resources of UNM, an R1 Minority-Serving Institution, to help create a pipeline of traditionally URMs in QIS who can attain graduate degrees and contribute to the QIS ecosystem.  This was accomplished in collaboration with QU-REACH, a ten-week summer undergraduate research program targeting historically-excluded groups in STEM (including women, Hispanic, American Indian, and Black students) and students who are the first generation in their families to attend college.  We also refined each step of our recruitment and selection of postdoctoral fellows, to strengthen diversity at CQuIC.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/20/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Ivan H Deutsch"
