 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bridges across the U.S. continue to deteriorate at an alarming rate and the American Society of Civil Engineers estimate a cost of over $76 billion to improve the country's functionally obsolete or structurally deficient bridges. This indicates a significant demand for innovative bridge health monitoring solutions that can strategically guide management, maintenance and replacement programs without risking public safety. Unfortunately, the need to improve how our bridges are managed and repaired or replaced faces similar issues and demands as the rest of the U.S. transportation network: continuously shrinking resources and governing bodies who do not have the necessary insights from bridge health data to find a workable solution. \r\n\r\nTo discuss how to address these critical problems, researchers, practitioners, and individuals representing public and private sectors (transportation infrastructure and built environment owners, operators, designers and maintainers) convened with Big Data technology and analytics experts participated at the inaugural BRIDGE-ing Big Data Workshop hosted by the University of Nebraska in October 2015. During this workshop, it became clear that Big Data technology could assist with providing a timely solution. It also was apparent that past efforts focusing on utilizing bridge health monitoring and big data techniques as part of the management and maintenance/replacement processes are fragmented, and resulting datasets are not deemed trustworthy and are under-utilized. This project will (1) catalog datasets including sources, copyrights, license, collection procedures, and expected access controls from private sector, academia, and government agencies, (2) obtain commitments from stakeholders and host collaboration workshops with small working groups to discuss, import/export, and share bridge structural health monitoring data, and (3) solicit proposals from businesses/researchers to develop innovative applications that integrate disparate and voluminous data sources. It is anticipated that this project's findings will benefit the Midwest Big Data Hub transportation spoke and potentially inform similar activities for highways, buildings, power distribution networks and other civil infrastructure entities. Findings from this project will be promoted to national and international technical organizations, to directly impact workforce development, education and research programs. Combined, this project will make a direct impact on our country's ability to efficiently maintain the health and safety of its bridges.",

As a planning grant to investigate BD opportunities for bridge health, this project successfully fulfilled its mission of generating proofs-of-concept, bringing together stakeholders and building capacity for future BD Spokes activities. \nA number of prototyping activities were completed. An NSF Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (DIBBs) platform (http://datacenterhub.org) was used to create, publish, and share a regional bridge health dataset. Second, working together with the NSF Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) project, Open Collaborative Data Factories (OCDF), we piloted standardized manifests for dataset IP and license agreements tracking integrated with access control primitives. We also developed standard representations for bridge deficiencies detected by next-generation sensing systems. Finally, working with the National Data Service, we created a compute and query infrastructure for the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) National Bridge Inventory data with approximately 17 million bridge inspection records accessible using a big data tool pipeline. Project collaborative activities brought together the public works sectors, including departments of transportation and county and city officials in the Midwest, railroad operators, bridge auditors, researchers and big data technologists through two Bridging Big Data workshops in 2016 and 2017. These workshops attracted over 120 in-person visitors and many more through the project website. \n\nThe partnerships resulting from this project are transforming state and private sector entities, including small businesses, involved in bridge health management and risk mitigation. We have promoted our results and platforms to organizations like the American Concrete Institute (ACI), the Nebraska Department of Transportation and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), to impact workforce training, education, and research in the civil engineering application domain. Through extension activities, this project?s findings benefit the Midwest Big Data Hub transportation spoke by allowing for replication of these activities to better manage highways, buildings, power distribution networks and other civil infrastructure.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/30/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Robin A Gandhi"
