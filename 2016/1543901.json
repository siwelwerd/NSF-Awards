 "awd_abstract_narration": "Finger millet is a grain crop of strategic importance to food security in Eastern Africa.  The grain has high nutritional value, can grow in arid environments and thus is important to the livelihood of smallholder farmers.  A major agricultural goal in the region is to develop higher yielding varieties of finger millet through reducing or eliminating diseases that impact growth of the plant.  Blast fungus is a pathogen that reduces yield up to 80% and is one of the main diseases affecting finger millet. To understand how to control disease outbreaks, this project uses genomic sequencing as a powerful approach to identify precise strains of the fungus and to study how the fungus causes disease symptoms in the plant. Sequence analyses of blast strains collected in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia will provide information on the genetic diversity of the pathogen in Eastern Africa, and provide a resource to identify the factors that are responsible for infection of finger millet. The knowledge from this approach is essential to develop efficient disease management strategies. Furthermore, sequence analyses of the finger millet host will clarify why some cultivars are more resistant to blast than others. The generated resources will also be used as a vehicle to train undergraduate and graduate students in Eastern Africa in bioinformatics, an expertise that is essential to translate the information to improve breeding strategies.  \r\n\r\nThe specific aims of the project are to (1) Generate 80X PacBio sequence for the allotetraploid finger millet genome (1C=1.8 Gb) to generate a high quality genome assembly (1C=1.8 Gb); (2) Resequence 200 Eastern African isolates of the finger millet blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, including 24 that were collected 10 years ago, to determine the diversity and evolution of this finger millet pathogen both over time and across geographic regions. The blast genome sequences will be mined to identify candidate effector genes using an effector prediction pipeline that incorporates common characteristics of known effectors (secretion and high polymorphism levels;(3) Analyze the blast-finger millet interaction transcriptome using RNA-Seq to identify genes that are induced at early stages of infection. Genes encoding secreted proteins will be identified from the RNA-Seq experiment and cross-referenced to those identified using the effector prediction pipeline. Host genes that are differentially expressed will be compared between compatible and incompatible interactions, and with genes that are differentially expressed during early stages of blast infection in rice, and(4) Develop a nested association mapping panel of some 4000 RILs derived from 21 diverse parents using a double round robin design. This population will represent the first mapping resource that captures substantial diversity present in finger millet germplasm and has a high quantitative trait loci detection power.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFinger millet is an important food security crop in eastern Africa.  Its nutritional qualities and adaptation to semi-arid regions make it a strong candidate for incorporation into climate-smart agriculture.  However, finger millet yields in farmers\u2019 fields are below the yield potential, and investment is needed to bring finger millet breeding into the 21st century.  To aid in this endeavor, we generated a chromosome-scale genome assembly of the allotetraploid finger millet accession KNE 796-S.  Co-funded by BioInnovate Africa, the genome assembly was used as a framework to analyze the diversity of finger millet germplasm across the finger millet growing regions of the world.  Diverse lines were selected for intercrossing to develop segregating populations for trait mapping.  A practical spin-off of this work was the identification of F1 lines displaying hybrid vigor, a trait not typically seen in breeding programs because of the use of a much narrower germplasm base.  To demonstrate the use of the genome sequence in going from a quantitative trait locus to the underlying causal gene, we mapped and identified the gene controlling purple coloration of stigma and anther color in finger millet.  Loss of purple coloration was caused by mutations in a MYC-bHLH transcription factor that regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis.  Additionally, our project investigated blast disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, which is the main biotic constraint to finger millet production.  This fungus can infect more than 50 grass species, but most strains are host-specific.  We used a two-pronged approach, studying both virulence of the pathogen and resistance of the host.  A total of 226 M. oryzae strains were isolated from diseased finger millet tissues collected from eastern Africa with funding from a Bill and Melinda Gates PEARL project, and their genomes were sequenced.  The sequencing data were bioinformatically mined for effector genes, some of which were differentially present in finger millet- and rice-infecting blast strains, or showed presence/absence across the 226 finger millet-infecting blast strains.  To experimentally study host infection, we developed techniques to microscopically assess infection in finger millet leaf sheaths.  The high fungal load in leaf sheaths also allowed us to study fungal gene expression at early infection stages.   Transcriptome analyses 30 and 48 hours post infection (hpi) of leaf sheaths of a highly susceptible and a resistant finger millet accession inoculated with a single finger millet blast isolate revealed that expression of many effector genes increased from 30 to 48 hpi in an incompatible reaction, but decreased in a compatible interaction.  Four effector genes with differential presence across the sequenced finger millet blast strains and expression during early infection time points were selected for further analysis.  Three of the effectors were transformed together in a strain lacking these effectors but did not affect the virulence of the wild-type strain on the two finger millet accessions tested.  A fourth effector was transformed singly in the same M. oryzae background.  While the wild-type strain was highly infectious on the finger millet accessions AAUFM-44 and TZA1637, both accessions were highly resistant to a subset of the transformants.  Our results, including the observation that finger millet is completely immune to rice-adapted M. oryzae strains, indicate that finger millet has the cellular and molecular mechanisms for complete immunity and challenge current views on finger millet resistance to the blast fungus.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/31/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Katrien M Devos"
