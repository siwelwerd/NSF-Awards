 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical description\r\nThis Research Infrastructure Improvement Track-2 Focused EPSCoR Collaboration (RII Track-2 FEC) award is a collaboration among three institutions in Montana, Wyoming, and South Dakota including Montana State University (MSU), University of Wyoming (UW) and University of South Dakota (USD).  The project will focus on developing a framework of CO2 mitigation scenarios that would not create conflicts with food security and production of clean energy.  The project will offer novel experimental insights, modeling tools, and technological solutions for improving the resiliency of food security and ecosystem services to global climate policies.  The modeling activities and extensive field research is expected to generate new data and findings that will lead to new insights into how biogeochemical modeling, agricultural economics, carbon-capture and sequestration, water and biodiversity research can be used within an integrated framework.  The project will leverage existing networks and hubs to integrate new data-streams into the modeling exercises.  Through involvement with Tribal Colleges and networking with existing programs with Native American student populations, the project will serve to enhance and diversify the STEM workforce in the participating jurisdictions.\r\n\r\nTechnical description\r\nThe proposed project will evaluate the consequences of a bioenergy, and carbon capture and sequestration (BECCS) economy in the Upper Missouri River Basin (UMRB).  In seeking to evaluate how negative CO2 emissions, and the security and economic costs associated with changes to energy policy, the project will address four research objectives: (1) Develop empirical and numerical models to explain recent trends in land use and land-cover change; (2) Apply biogeochemical ecosystem and crop models to evaluate a set of stakeholder-designed regions and scenarios for bioenergy production potential, and use new and existing data and observations to quantify trade-offs between biofuel expansion and food security and other carbon, soil and bioclimate variables; (3) Evaluate the feasibility of BECCS within the context of carbon capture and storage, existing political and institutional constraints, and policy frameworks affecting farmers and Tribal Nations; and (4) Produce a synthesis report addressing the economic feasibility of BECCS and provide the basis for knowledge transfer to collaborators at national and international organizations.  The collaborations with several government agencies, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector, in addition to a scientific advisory panel, provide high potential that the project and its findings will transfer to national and international stages.",

Decarbonization strategies such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) are thus being promoted to meet global climate goals. However, the feasibility and implications of decarbonization strategies for multiple societal and environmental goals is unclear.

Overall, findings provide evidence that given soils, production practices, future climate, geologic considerations, an ongoing socio-ecological transition, and food security challenges, the UMRB landscape is not well positioned to make significant contributions to first- or second-generation biofeedstock production without technological innovations and policy incentives.

Of note, despite increases in agricultural intensity in the UMRB, increasing temperatures and aridity are projected to cause a shift away from intensive row crops, which are most sensitive to increased dryness, towards less intensive land uses (e.g., grassland, shrubland, pasture and hay) (Figure 1). These changes are not spatially uniform with some areas projected to continue seeing transitions to intensive crops.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Findings exploring incentives for stakeholders to adopt first- and second- generation biofeedstocks in the UMRB at a meaningful scale for climate mitigation suggest that significantly higher incentive policies or improvements in crop technology would be needed. Consistent with these results, research at the farm-level indicates notable economic challenges for transitioning current UMRB farming systems to BECCS (Figure 2). All bioenergy scenarios resulted in a reduction of farm-level profitability relative to current baseline cropping systems (Figure 3).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Our experiments to identify crop technology for expanding bioenergy at a meaningful scale for climate mitigation were among the first to explore the growth of perennial switchgrass in a cool, semi-arid cropland and to use a native, field-isolated cyanobacteria as biofertilizer in its native soil.

Taken together, this evidence underscores a need to rethink decarbonization strategies to be context specific. Findings highlight the region is undergoing a significant social-ecological transition, including shifts in economic opportunities and biodiversity. For example, grassland bird abundance across the UMRB is predicted to increase for most species under a variety of future land use and climate change scenarios (Figure 5). Despite large socio-environmental differences, strong agreement was found among residents regarding desirable land uses, with agriculture being among the most desirable. Contributing to the 'fuel versus food' debate, findings point to the vulnerability of farmers to climate impacts on agricultural systems, with implications for livelihoods, food security, and wellbeing. Findings emphasize disparities in food access and food security among rural, low-income, and tribal communities, calling for systemic changes to foster equity.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Through interdisciplinary collaboration, this project advanced approaches and capacity to address important land use questions and decarbonization strategies in ways that support people and the planet.

Contributing to the 'fuel versus food' debate, findings point to the vulnerability of farmers to climate impacts on agricultural systems, with implications for livelihoods, food security, and wellbeing. Findings emphasize disparities in food access and food security among rural, low-income, and tribal communities, calling for systemic changes to foster equity. \n\n \n\nThrough interdisciplinary collaboration, this project advanced approaches and capacity to address important land use questions and decarbonization strategies in ways that support people and the planet. Frameworks, tools, and data of this project have been integrated in the following: (1) research training of 53 students and classroom training of over 1,000 students; (2) 69 peer-reviewed articles; (3) 137 presentations; (4) a webinar series, stakeholder workshops, and working group; (5) knowledge assets for citizens including fact sheets, research briefs, media, and a story map, Changing Landscapes, Changing Communities in the UMRB and; (6) youth engagement through the creation and distribution of the Land Use Explorers Kit which offers hands-on activities to contribute observations as citizen scientists (Figure 6). \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/05/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Selena Ahmed"
