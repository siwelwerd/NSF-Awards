The goal of the conference is to bring together leading experts in bioengineering, nanomaterials, biology and medicine to review recent advances in nanoengineering and nanomedicine, including new experimental methods, synthetic approaches, modeling and computational efforts, analyses and innovative methodologies for sensing, quantifying, diagnosing and treating medical disorders using nanoengineering approaches.  The program is organized under 5 tracks:  Nano-imaging, Nanoparticle-based delivery, Nano and Microfluidics, Modeling of nano-phenomenon, and Nano-materials design.   The goal of the conference is well matched to programs supported by Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems (CBET) and Emerging Frontiers in Research and Innovation (EFRI), which is particularly focused on the development of new technologies.",
