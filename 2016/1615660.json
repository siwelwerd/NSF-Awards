 "awd_abstract_narration": "Phylogenetics is the branch of mathematical biology concerned with reconstructing evolutionary relationships among species.  While phylogenetic analyses are widely used throughout the biological sciences, there remain fundamental questions about how to reconstruct trees most effectively under a host of increasingly complex data scenarios.  This project addresses fundamental scientific challenges in phylogenetics using a range of mathematics tools from probability, combinatorics, and geometry.  One main goal of the project will be to develop better methods for reconstructing evolutionary histories.  The project will further develop STEM infrastructure by training graduate students in mathematical methods in biology.\r\n\r\nThis research develops tools from probability, combinatorics, and geometry to solve problems in phylogenetics, that area of mathematical biology concerned with reconstructing evolutionary histories between collections of species.  The particular problems to be addressed include the development of new algorithms for alignment free phylogenetic tree reconstruction, the study of the distribution of maximum agreement subtrees for random trees, and the development of geometric tools to better deploy distance-based phylogenetic algorithms.  The implementation assuming alignment free phylogenetic tree reconstruction will be the first statistically consistent method that takes into account both substitution and insertion/deletion processes.  The project on maximum agreement subtrees makes connections to longest increasing subsequences and related tools from combinatorial probability.  The project on distance-based methods will use tools from polyhedral combinatorics and tropical geometry to better understand the comparison between greedy algorithms procedures and the underlying approximate optimization procedures.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPhylogenetics is that part of biology concerned with reconstructing evolutionary relationships between species.  Phylogenetics is an area rich with mathematical challenges.  The evolutionary relationships that are studied are represented by special types of graphs called trees, and so methods from discrete math are used to study properties of those trees.  In addition, the models that are used to model the evolutionary changes to the DNA over time are probabilistic in nature, and so methods from statistics are used to reconstruct the trees from data. \n\n\nThis project approached these phylogenetic models using tools from algebra, geometry, and combinatorics.  Specific problems addressed in this project include the random maximum agreement subtree problem, identifiability problems for phylogenetic models, and geometric approaches to distance-based methods.\n\n\nMaximum agreement subtrees are a way to measure how similar two trees are to each other.  To calibrate this as a useful tool, one needs to understand what the maximum agreement subtree looks like for two random trees.  In this project we developed a combinatorial approach to understand this problem in the asymptotic situation of large trees, when the two random trees have the same underlying shape.\n\n\nIdentifiability is the basic question about statistical models of whether or not it is possible to infer the model parameters from data.  This project developed a new technique to prove identifiability based on algebra and combinatorics, specifically using algebraic matroids, combined with tools from computer algebra.  Then the identifiability of all the 2-tree mixture models for group based models was established using the new method.\n\n\nDistance-based methods in phylogeny use pairwise distances between species (based on measures of how much change to the DNA has happened) to try to reconstruct trees.  The space of all tree metrics has the geometric structure of a tropical variety, which is a union of polyhedral cells.  This project used this geometric structure to understand how max distance based methods work, and for constructing supertrees.\n\n\nThe projects supported by this grant have led to research that involved 10 PhD students over the life of the grant.  Those students have gone on to jobs in academia and industry.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/03/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Seth M Sullivant"
