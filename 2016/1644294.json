The workshop will include two-person faculty teams from 20 MSIs interested in developing a competitive Noyce proposal. Participants will also engage in a series of post-workshop individualized sessions that will provide additional proposal guidance. The QEM workshop and post-workshop interactions will provide participants feedback on their required project summaries to assist them in developing their ideas into competitive Noyce proposals. MSIs are uniquely qualified to address the issue of recruiting, retaining, and developing STEM teachers for high-need schools. As such, the project's workshops will help develop stronger MSIs, in general, and teacher preparation programs, specifically, to meet the nation's needs for a more productive science and technology workforce.",

The two-day workshop assisted two-person teams, from MSIs with accredited teacher education programs, in further developing their ideas for Noyce proposals for the FY2017 competition.

Key topics discussed included: overview of NSF and the Noyce program tracks; NSF&rsquo;s merit review process and preparation of competitive proposals; project design, data management, assessment and evaluation plans; and project sustainability and institutional change. At the end of the workshop, participants completed evaluation questionnaires soliciting their feedback regarding their overall workshop experience. Thirty-seven of the 40 workshop participants responded to the questionnaire (93% response rate).

In particular, the quality and promptness of feedback provided were cited as key characteristics in strengthening their Noyce proposals.
