 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will explore various topics within algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry.  The study of integer and rational number solutions to polynomial equations has been an ongoing area of research since the time of the ancient Greeks, and the project will develop a  theory of \"number field fragments\" that may yield a new approach to answering some such questions, in particular those related to Fermat's last theorem and its generalizations.  In algebraic geometry, the project aims, among other things, to show that one of the simplest parameter spaces already has bad singularities, and in fact contains every singularity imaginable.  Many of the specific research topics contained in the project are at a level accessible to beginning graduate students, and one of the goals is to involve students in the research.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, given a Galois extension K of Q with Galois group G,  the project will extend geometry-of-numbers methods to study the \"fragments\" of K cut out by an idempotent of the group ring QG, in the hope of developing a new way to prove the nonexistence of certain Galois representations.  It will also study correspondences from a curve to itself that are unramified on one side, from the point of view of arithmetic dynamics, since such setups yield new examples of almost-everywhere-unramified arboreal representations.  In algebraic geometry proper, the project will study infinitesimal neighborhoods of the vertex of a cone to try to prove that the Hilbert scheme of points satisfies Murphy's law.  Finally, the project will explore whether there is an idele class group variant of the Cohen-Lenstra heuristics.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual merit: The project supported the PI's research on many topics within arithmetic geometry, some of which have had applications to down-to-earth questions in other parts of mathematics.  For instance, the PI (with co-authors Kiran Kedlaya, Alexander Kolpakov, and Michael Rubinstein) developed new algorithms for solving polynomial equations in roots of unity and used these algorithms to classify all tetrahedra for which all pairs of faces form an angle that is a rational number of degrees: there are two infinite families of such tetrahedra and 59 sporadic tetrahedra that do not fall into any family.  The PI studied the behavior of iteration of polynomials, proving (with John Doyle) the function field analogue of the 1994 Morton-Silverman conjecture.  With Manjul Bhargava, the PI proved a definitive result for algebraic stacks, related to the problem of deciding which polynomial equations f(x,y)=0 have integer solutions.  With Raymond van Bommel, Edgar Costa, Wanlin Li, and Alexander Smith, the PI proved the best known results on which integers arise as the order of groups coming from abelian varieties over finite fields.  With Bruce Jordan, the PI generalized one of the most famous theorems from the 19th century, the analytic class number formula of Dirichlet and Dedekind.  All in all, about 40 publications resulted from the project.\n\nBroader impacts: In response to the pandemic, the PI (with Edgar Costa, David Roe, and Andrew Sutherland) developed the website researchseminars.org, which enabled mathematical researchers worldwide to find out about online seminars and participate in them despite the pandemic.  It attracted 80,000 distinct visitors within its first 28 days, and continues to be used as a way for mathematicians to present their research to others.\n\nThe project supported the writing of a graduate textbook, Rational points on varieties, which recently was awarded the Doob Prize (a prize awarded once every three years by the American Mathematical Society for the best research-level mathematics book).  That book has also served as the basis for learning seminars, initiating the next generation of researchers into the field.  In fact, the PI has run a learning seminar nearly every semester since 2001.\n\nThe PI has involved seven graduate students as research assistants supported by the project, and all seven have earned the Ph.D. degree, in part thanks to the project - many worked on topics that grew out of the PI's project research.  In addition, the project supported six undergraduate researchers who made advances in the study of tetrahedra, such as on the question of which tetrahedra can fill space leaving no gaps.\n\nThe PI has delivered several expository lectures, often on topics associated with the project research, including, for example, the 2019 Arnold Ross Lecture to about 1000 high school students and the Clay Lectures at the 2020 Arizona Winter School to about 200 graduate students.
