 "awd_abstract_narration": "In response to the Materials Genome Initiative (MGI), a Grand Challenge was launched in the summer of 2015 through a partnership between the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the National Science Foundation.  The goal of the Materials Science and Engineering Data Challenge is to demonstrate how existing digital materials data can be used to advance the development of new models of materials behavior along with discovery of novel material compositions or innovative processes. Participants of the Grand Challenge were asked to submit their results in the form of a technical paper. The competition was closed on March 31, 2016 and six winning groups were selected to present their research findings at the Materials Science & Technology (MS&T) 2016 conference, to be held from October 23-27, 2016 in Salt Lake City, Utah. This award supports travel and registration to enable the winners of the Grand Challenge to attend MS&T and present their findings at a special symposium organized for the competition.\r\n\r\nWinners of the Grand Challenge will present their results to a diverse, international audience of more than 3,000 attendees. Participation by the winners of the Grand Challenge will enable widespread dissemination of their important findings related to the national goals of the Materials Genome initiative at a well-attended conference of students, professionals, and thought leaders in the field of materials science and engineering.",
