By studying the paleoecology of disturbance regimes from a historical context, the investigator will provide new insights into the stability of a pristine rainforest.  The investigator's analyses of the spatio-temporal patterns of fire across multiple habitat types will transform basic understanding of distinguishing climate-induced fire impacts versus those that were human-induced.  The project will address fundamental questions of fire ecology and landscape disturbance in a highly biodiverse ecosystem.  The project will have a strong focus on educational and research capacity-building in the study region.  It will foster collaboration across U.S. and foreign organizations, and it will provide a strong foundation for interdisciplinary education and training of undergraduate and graduate students.  Project results will promote collaborative ties among national and international partners to increase their capabilities to address issues related to tropical forest stewardship across many parts of the Earth.\r\n\r\nSoil charcoal records provide insight into the potentially important role of fire in the ecology of rainforests affected by episodic droughts.  This project will focus on four core questions:  (1) How prevalent was fire during the Holocene and earlier periods?  (2) Is the spatial pattern of fire consistent with climatic control or with agricultural activities associated with shifting cultivation? (3) What is the quantity of pyrogenic organic matter in soils among different habitats, and how well is such charcoal preserved in tropical soils?  (4) What is the history of peat accumulation in the forest over the past 6,000 years, and has it been affected by past fire events and environmental change?  A total of 126 sampling sites will be established across seven habitat types in a study region in Indonesian Borneo, and the investigators will examine these for direct evidence of past fires from radiocarbon-dated charcoal particles in soil.  Sampling data will be spectrally, chemically, and quantitatively analyzed to determine the chronological pattern of changing fire over time.  The data and methods developed from this research project will have global implications for studying fire behavior studies across a wide-range of diverse ecosystems.",

While fires impact land that has been purposely cleared for logging or agriculture, fires rarely if ever penetrate the shaded and moist sub-canopy environments of intact forest. Yet, wood charcoal is found, with ease in many cases, in soils in primary pristine rainforests. We studied two main locations: an unlogged rainforest in a national park that supports a range of habitats from swamp forest to high elevation montane cloud forest, and deep peatlands where organic matter accumulation preserves a record up to 40,000 years.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the first study, we found charcoal in all habitat types, but it was by far the most abundant in the lowland sites&nbsp;where human-caused fire is most likely.&nbsp;A set of 50 radiocarbon dates showed that in lowland areas fire occurred throughout the last 3,200 years, peaking 1300-1600 AD. The upland areas lacked evidence of fire before 1250 CE but otherwise had a similar pattern to the lowlands. The period of high fire is coincident with regional demographic changes as well as regional droughts documented elsewhere in Southeast Asia. In upland areas, fires likely burned only under regional drought when fires could more easily spread upslope. Although forest plot studies at this site show little structural evidence of past fires, tree diversity is lower than expected in the most burned areas on alluvial benches. Thus, our&nbsp;results suggest that land clearance was a major source of fire, but that these tropical rainforests were largely resilient to fires and land use hundreds of years ago. Current fire mirror patterns of fire spread that occurred hundreds of years ago, though the scale of modern events is likely greater.</p>\n<p>In the second study, we discovered one of the oldest and deepest peatlands in the world in the headwaters of the Kapuas River. A transect of 15 deep cores across the peatland, three of which were studied intensively, allowed for a unique cross-sectional view of peatland development. The peat cores provide valuable numbers for carbon sequestration; our results from this site suggest it is the most carbon-dense peatland in the world and worthy of protection from land conversion to agriculture. We studied the charcoal content of the peat and found, contrary to expectation, that fires occurred throughout the 40,000-year record. This indicates that most fires consumed little peat. Some gaps in the record were the result of peat loss from severe fires during the drier early phases of the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years ago) and following a major immigration of the Austronesian expansion in the early Holocene (9000 to 4000 years ago), when human-set fires may have been important. This is the first study to show the complex, and long, developmental history of deep inland peatlands of Indonesia. These results have additional implications for the paleoclimate history of the very wet tropical rainforest regions of Indonesia, showing greater climate impacts than previously thought for this region.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/30/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Daniel&nbsp;G&nbsp;Gavin</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1561099/1561099_10429911_1656629808509_IMG_2800--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1561099/1561099_10429911_1656629808509_IMG_2800--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Gunung Palung (Mt Palung), Indonesia\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1561099/1561099_10429911_1656629808509_IMG_2800--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Gunung Palung (Mt Palung), Indonesia\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Gunung Palung National Park; Mt Palung rises 1000 m above the coastal plain.
