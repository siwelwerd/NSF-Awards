 "awd_abstract_narration": "Many basic physical principles, like conservation of mass or momentum for a fluid, are captured mathematically as systems algebraic differential equations.  Simplifying and solving these systems (which means reducing the number or complexity of the equations, and finding inputs that satisfy all equations) are fundamental to applications in many areas, including cellular biology, approximation for chemical reaction systems, combinatorics, and analysis.  The theoretical and algorithmic study of such systems spans more than a century, using three methods: purely symbolic, numerical, and hybrid symbolic-numeric.  \r\n\r\nSymbolic methods (the quadratic formula being the simplest example) give the strongest guarantees of reliability, at a high (even exorbitant) cost in computational time and memory, since the same algorithm solves both mathematically hard and easy instances.  Numerical methods (the basis for computational simulation) allow small errors or approximations for speed; small intermediate errors produce corrupted outputs on singular and ill-conditioned (that is, nearly singular) input instances. In this project, a hybrid symbolic-numeric approach will be developed. Hybrid algorithms are more adaptive and have lower complexity than symbolic algorithms, and can avoid the errors of numerical algorithms.\r\n\r\nIn more technical detail, the three investigators apply existing and develop new methods of symbolic-numeric computation and differential algebra, producing algorithms that run on all inputs. They bring together existing methods of numerical algebraic geometry and software packages, such as Bertini, with recent theoretical results in differential algebra that provide upper bounds needed for guaranteed results. New near-optimal root isolation techniques are developed, implemented, and applied to solve systems of differential equations with finitely many solutions.  The work spans from theory to producing practical tools.\r\n\r\nAs part of this project the three investigators mentor and train students in symbolic and numeric computation at CUNY (noted for serving minority and low-income students) and NYU, and more broadly in New York City and Long Island, by activities ranging from  developing a Symbolic-Numeric Computing course for graduate students at the Computer Science program of the CUNY Graduate Center and NYU, to advising high school students in projects.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nAlgebraic differential equations arise naturally in applications such as\n\ncellular biology and chemical reaction systems.  These equations\n\nhave unknown parameters such as growth rates or speed of chemical\n\nreaction.  The identifiability problem asks whether a particular\n\nparameter can, in principle, be determined from the ``shape'' of these\n\ndifferential equations -- such parameters are said to be identifiable.\n\nWe show that this problem is decidable, but more importantly,\n\nprovide an efficient randomized algorithm for identifiability.\n\nOur implementation and experiments show that the algorithm is practical.\n\n \n\nFor identifiable parameters, we address the broader task\n\nof estimating them numerically.  A key problem here, of interest in its\n\nown right, is isolating and approximating the roots of a system \"S\"\n\nof equations in $n$ variables.  Despite great progress\n\nin recent years, especially from the algebraic side, current numerical\n\nalgorithms lack one or more ingredients for a\n\ntruly ``certified'' numerical solution.  We made three fundamental\n\ncontributions here. \n\n \n\n(a) The first is a new algorithm for isolating simple\n\nreal roots of the system \"S\".  Our solution is based on an\n\nabstract subdivision framework based on 3 tests: exclusion of roots,\n\nexistence of roots and root uniqueness.  We introduce a methodology to\n\nfirst transform the abstract algorithm into an\n\ninterval form (as needed for certification), and finally into into an\n\neffective form (as needed for implementation).  We further provide a\n\ncomplexity analysis of our algorithm.  Our methodology can be broadly\n\napplied, as gaps we identified in the root isolation literature is\n\nubiquitous.\n\n \n\n(b) Our second contribution address complex roots of the system \"S\".\n\nBecause the number of roots grow exponentially with $n$, an attractive\n\nalternative approach is the ability to ``track'' individual roots of\n\nthe system by the homotopy continuation method.  Our analysis reveal\n\ncertain key ingredients needed for a certified algorithm.  Moreover,\n\nunlike previous algorithms, ours is adaptive (avoiding the use of an a\n\npriori step-size).\n\n \n\n(c) The third contribution address the case where \"S\"\n\nare ill-conditioned or have multiple complex roots.  This is rarely\n\ntreated in the numerical\n\nliterature.  Assume $\\Sigma$ is in triangular form, perhaps through\n\nalgebraic transformation.  Then we can exploit our recent (2016-19)\n\nnear-optimal algorithm for isolating complex roots of univariate\n\npolynomials, extended to isolating ``natural'' root clusters.  We gave\n\nthe first certified algorithm for clustering the roots of $\\Sigma$.\n\n \n\nThese results, although couched in concrete problems, embody general\n\nprinciples that can serve as the foundations of truly certified and\n\neffective algorithms in numeric-algebraic computation and its many\n\napplications.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/22/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Chee K Yap"
