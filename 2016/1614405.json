 "awd_abstract_narration": "Ferroelectric materials possess an inherent polarization that can be reoriented (or ?switched?) with an applied electric field.  Understanding how defects, grain size, and other material parameters affect this switching process is important to be able to improve device performance in applications such as capacitors in consumer electronics, inertial sensors such as those in automotive collision detection systems, or precise positioners used for camera focusing.  This EAPSI project seeks to identify the effects that grain size has on ferroelectric switching speed by collecting time-resolved neutron diffraction data on barium titanate ceramics with a broad distribution of grain sizes during electric-field-induced polarization.  This work will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. John Daniels, an Associate Professor at the University of New South Wales who helped pioneer this time-resolved diffraction technique, at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization.\r\n\r\nThe effect of grain size on the magnitude of dielectric permittivity of ferroelectrics is well known, but the effects on switching speeds are not yet completely understood.  Current hypotheses claim that new domains form at grain boundaries due to local electric field enhancements caused by a difference in permittivity between the grain boundary and the lattice.  This theory will be explored via time-resolved, stroboscopic neutron diffraction experiments performed on barium titanate samples with a broad range of grain size distributions while undergoing electric-field-induced polarization.  Strain contributions from intrinsic (piezoelectric) and extrinsic (non-180\u00b0 domain switching) components are easily separable and the ability to collect structural information on time scales of interest to ferroelectrics (<1 s) with this technique.  These combined pieces of information will allow for accurate detection of piezoelectric strain rate and the associated ferroelectric polarization speeds.  This work will be conducted in collaboration with Dr. John Daniels, an Associate Professor at the University of New South Wales who helped pioneer this time-resolved diffraction technique, at the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization.\r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Australia Academy of Science.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project aimed to understand the relationship between grain size of polycrystalline BaTiO3 ceramics and ferroelectric switching speed by performing in-situ switching experiments while observing strain states in the specimens via time-resolved neutron diffraction.\n\nFerroelectrics are materials that possess a spontaneous, reorientable dipole within their crystallographic unit cell.  This means that at the lowest level of atomic symmetry, there exists an unbalanced charge (often due to off-center ions) that can be shifted by an applied electric field (where the off-center ions are moved from one equilibrium position to another).  These dipoles interact with their neighbors and form regions of uniform polarization called domains.  Neighboring domains are divided by regions known as domain walls, and as a domain grows at the expense of another, domain walls move through the bulk of the material until the domains aligned with the applied field have grown to the point that they reach some obstacle, a grain boundary for example, that they cannot grow past.  This phenomenon is called ferroelectric switching.  It is theorized that ferroelectric switching can be made faster by reducing the size of grains, thereby reducing the distance that any domain would be able to grow and simultaneously increasing the number of domains that form under an applied electric field since grain boundaries are known nucleation sites for domains.  As domain walls propagate through materials, particularly those that separate domains whose polarization directions differ by less than 180&deg;, the material experiences a detectable change in strain.  This strain is observable through peak shifts in diffraction data that is measured over time while simultaneously ferroelectrically switching the material.\n\nThe scope of this project included manufacturing, characterizing, and studying domain dynamics of samples of polycrystalline BaTiO3 ceramics, all of which was done at the host institution.
