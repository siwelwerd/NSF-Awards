 "awd_abstract_narration": "A key challenge in many autonomous robot manipulation applications is\r\nthe rearrangement of multiple objects.  There are two situations where\r\nsuch needs arise: (i) the manipulation task itself is to rearrange\r\nobjects, and (ii) occluding items must be rearranged to allow the\r\nrobot access to the target object(s). Examples of such scenarios can\r\narise in warehouses and industrial setups, where a robot has to\r\nfrequently select, pick and transfer products, packages and pallets in\r\nthe presence of many other similar objects. Another example comes from\r\nservice robotics, where a robotic assistant that operates in a human\r\nspace has to frequently retrieve or rearrange multiple items placed in\r\nnarrow spaces, such as objects in shelves.\r\n\r\nThis project investigates which classes of multi-object manipulation\r\nplanning can be efficiently addressed given progress in multi-body\r\nmotion planning and develops a powerful suite of novel computational\r\nsolutions.  The key insight is that for many real-world rearrangement\r\ntasks the sequence of object motions to solve the problem, ignoring\r\ngrasping aspects, look similar to solutions of multi-body motion\r\nplanning, especially for similar sized objects. The study of this link\r\nreveals it is possible to cast certain multi-object manipulation\r\nproblems as a \"pebble motion problem on a graph\", which is well\r\nstudied in algorithmic theory and multi-body motion planning. The\r\noverall objective is to provide rigorous methods with desirable\r\ncompleteness and optimality guarantees for multi-object manipulation,\r\nwhich exhibit good scalability and efficiency for problems where\r\ncurrent methods face issues with the inherent combinatorial\r\ncomplexity.  Such methods could also be used as guiding heuristics for\r\ntasks with additional constraints, such as non-trivial dynamics and\r\nuncertainty.",

The key challenge is finding a pick-and-place sequence that minimizes the number of actions performed, where only objects on top of the stack are accessible. SOR is closely related to parallel sorting. The team established lower/upper bounds and (1) asymptotically optimal polynomial-time algorithms, and (2) fast heuristic search for computing exact optimal solutions. A connection between SOR and multi-robot planning was established through a Rubik table result that shows shuffle-based rearrangement of matrices can be performed efficiently.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.656; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The team has obtained multiple seminal results in taming the combinatorial explosion in </span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">multi-body path planning</span><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">.

In a follow-up paper (Humanoids 2017 paper), it was also shown that the same process can also be beneficial in the context of dual-arm humanoid robots, where the two arms share degrees of freedom, e.g., a torsio. A more recent contribution (WAFR 2020) identifies a useful connection between multi-arm rearrangement and recent results in multi-body path planning on graphs with vertex capacity constraints. Results indicate good scalability to multiple arms and objects.

  "por_txt_cntn": "Rearranging objects is essential for many real-world robot manipulation tasks, from logistics to service robotics. A key challenge is the combinatorial explosion induced by the infinitely many ways with which objects can be placed. This motivates the development of effective methods for dealing with these combinatorial issues.\nThis project developed efficient multi-object manipulation solutions by a) identifying cases where extending solutions from multi-body planning can help resolve rearrangement problems, and b) employing hierarchical tools, which decompose hard instances into simpler subproblems addressable by such multi-body planners.\nIntellectual Merit: \n\n \nFor tabletop object rearrangement (TOR) with overhand grasps, the team established that optimal resolution of simple tasks is actually NP-hard. Through establishing an equivalence between TOR and classical combinatorial problems, fast and efficient TOR methods were developed. Hardware experiments demonstrated that our algorithms significantly improved the efficiency in carrying out TOR tasks (up to 30% improvement in solution quality). A paper appeared at the selective RSS 2017 conference, where it was nominated for the Best Student Paper Award. An extended version was invited to IJRR. Follow-up work studied the case of dual-arm rearrangement. Using two arms improves efficiency but introduces new challenges. The project studied the structure of this problem and developed an optimal MILP model.\n\n \nA related significant result targeted stack-based object rearrangement (SOR), such as organizing a shelf of soft drinks in a convenience store, or multi-story autonomous vehicle parking. The key challenge is finding a pick-and-place sequence that minimizes the number of actions performed, where only objects on top of the stack are accessible. SOR is closely related to parallel sorting. The team established lower/upper bounds and (1) asymptotically optimal polynomial-time algorithms, and (2) fast heuristic search for computing exact optimal solutions. A connection between SOR and multi-robot planning was established through a Rubik table result that shows shuffle-based rearrangement of matrices can be performed efficiently.\n\n \nThe team has obtained multiple seminal results in taming the combinatorial explosion in multi-body path planning. These results (accepted/published at MRS 2017, RSS 2018, IROS 2018, WAFR 2018) established that coordinating the motion of multiple moving bodies in dense settings can be achieved in low polynomial-time in arbitrary dimensions with asymptotic optimality. Highly efficient algorithms were developed for optimal solutions.\n\n \nCoordinating multiple robotic arms involves many high-DoF arms and searching through sequences of actions including object placements, and handoffs. A new method was developed, which achieves asymptotic optimality in a scalable manner (MRS 2017 paper, receiving Best Paper Award) by extending an approach for multi-robot planning. In a follow-up paper (Humanoids 2017 paper), it was also shown that the same process can also be beneficial in the context of dual-arm humanoid robots, where the two arms share degrees of freedom, e.g., a torsio. A more recent contribution (WAFR 2020) identifies a useful connection between multi-arm rearrangement and recent results in multi-body path planning on graphs with vertex capacity constraints. Results indicate good scalability to multiple arms and objects. The algorithm finds high-quality solutions fast and improves quality given additional computation.\n\n \nPlanning problems involving multiple objects give rise to a multi-modal state space.The conditions for asymptotic optimality of task and motion planning (TAMP) shows that methods, which have been developed for motion planning can be directly extended to  TAMP and achieve similar guarantees under relaxed assumptions.\n\n \nBroader Impact: \n\n \nThe research team applied these foundational tools in important industrial applications, such as robot packing, where objects need to be moved from an unstructured pile to a neat arrangement, and dynamic setups, where objects continuously arrive on conveyors. For robot packing, we proposed a complete, robust pipeline that only uses RGB-D data and a single robot arm with a minimalistic, vacuum-based end-effector.  For dynamic picking from conveyors, most existing systems are greedy but we proposed an optimal order over accessible objects given the robot arm?s profile.\n\n \nThe PIs organized the 2nd IEEE Multi-Robot and Multi-Agent Systems (MRS) conference at Rutgers University, August 2019. \n\n \nThe project has exposed K-12 and undergraduate students to research. Three undergraduate students published top conference publications, including first author publications.  Incoming PhD students had the opportunity to co-author with more senior students. More senior students were involved in mentoring. The PIs mentored high school students that went on to CMU, NYU, and Brown. \nStudents participated in international collaboration that resulted in common publications and collaboration across different domains (e.g., integrating planning and perception).\nDr. Bekris and Dr. Yu developed a new course in Computer Science at Rutgers University, titled \"Introduction to Computational Robotics\", which is offered to both undergraduate and graduate students. Through this course as well as graduate seminars, the PIs introduced and covered results coming out of this project. For instance, connection is made between practical tasks of rearranging objects and NP-hardness, as the computational complexity of robotics challenges is being discussed in the class.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 03/30/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Kostas Bekris"
