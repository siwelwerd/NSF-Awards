 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Third International Conference on Mathematical Neuroscience will be held in Boulder, Colorado from May 30 to June 2, 2017.  The brain is one of the most complex biological structures, and we are still far from understanding how it functions. Understanding the computations performed by the brain will require significant contributions from multiple disciplines. Mathematical techniques have served an integral role in advancing neuroscience research for many decades. The International Conference on Mathematical Neuroscience will provide a forum for researchers to discuss current mathematical innovations emerging in neuroscience. The lectures will discuss new tools and methods for analyzing complex data sets and building rigorous mathematical models of brain function. A major aim of the conference is to attract and train young researchers on current methods in mathematical neuroscience. To fulfill this goal, there will be a tutorial component held the day before the main meeting. For broader impact, a collection of tutorial chapters will be solicited from presenters and published as a  collection of lectures, and presentations will be made available on the conference website. The conference  is in line with the present national BRAIN initiative, aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying neural computation. The topics discussed during the tutorial sessions and main meeting are relevant to scientific disciplines beyond neuroscience: including systems biology, economics, and ecology.\r\n\r\nThe meeting provides an opportunity for mathematicians to gain exposure to current research in neuroscience and communicate with neuroscientists. At the same time, it enables experimental neuroscientists to discuss current progress on understanding the dynamics and function of neural systems with mathematicians who develop new tools and methods to address present challenges. The meeting will begin with a tutorial day (May 30) featuring topics from three major areas in mathematical neuroscience: stochastic and nonlinear dynamics, information theory, and probability and statistics.  The tutorials will introduce junior researchers to fundamental techniques used in contemporary mathematical neuroscience through lectures given by leaders in the field. The main conference (May 31 - June 2) will feature a broader set of topics in mathematical neuroscience, with a focus on the use of experimental data in modeling studies as well as using theory and models to explore hypotheses and design better experiments. A new challenge in modern neuroscience is to extract understandable patterns and features from high-dimensional data sets including neuronal activity, functional connectivity, and anatomy. To understand how the human brain functions and performs complex computations, improved methods for handling data are needed, together with rigorous mathematical models of neural systems. This conference will bring together leaders in applied mathematics and neuroscience that are developing new mathematical techniques for understanding high-dimensional data sets, building models to capture activity patterns and emergent computation, and working closely with experimentalists to address more targeted questions about brain function. Synergistic interactions between these topics will also be identified, to understand the full complexity of the nervous system.

The meeting brought together researchers from the field of mathematical neuroscience, which is a broad and active area of research based on mathematical techniques to understanding information processing and computations in the brain.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The tutorial (May 30) consisted of two parallel sessions taught by five leaders in different areas of mathematical neuroscience. Tutorials introduced students and postdoctoral researchers to advanced topics in mathematical neuroscience: stochastic hybrid systems, information theory, neuronal variability in networks, plasticity, correlations and information transfer, and spike coding networks. In addition to contributing to the basic education of tutorial attendees, the tutorials provided background to help attendees follow and understand the research talks during the main meeting. Each tutorial lecture block was one hour long, but the speakers usually only spoke for 45-50 minutes to allow for plenty of questions. Because of the more intimate format and longer breaks, students felt more comfortable to interact with each other and the speakers during this time.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The main conference (May 31 to June 2) featured talks on cutting-edge research in mathematical neuroscience. Topics included data-driven modeling, methods for analyzing high dimensional data sets, novel methods in nonlinear dynamics and stochastic systems, and analytic methods for model reduction. The ten invited plenary speakers are leaders in their respective field and consisted of 40% women, which earned the conference a \"well above average\" rating from biaswatchneuro (https://biaswatchneuro.com)</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Contributed talks were selected from submitted abstracts by a program committee. Each abstract was reviewed and scored by 2-4 reviewers. The top scoring abstracts were selected for contributed talks and the remaining abstracts that still addressed topics relevant for the meeting were selected for posters. As with the invited speakers, 40% of the contributed talks were given by women. Contributed talks were split into three parallel sessions according to the topic. Contributed talks (30 minutes) were shorter than invited talks (40 minutes) to allow ample time for questions and group discussion. In general, there were fruitful discussions following each session. Group lunches were held in the conference area of the hotel, which promoted continued interactions and networking among attendees. The poster session took place over 2.5 hours on the second day of the conference, and was well attended. For the first time this year we used crowd sourcing to determine two of the poster awards. This idea was well received by the organizing and managing committees of the conference, as well as of all its attendees.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A collection of tutorial chapters and research articles has been solicited from presenters at the conference. Some of them are published in our conference website (<a href=\"%22\"><span class=\"s1\">https://www.math.uh.edu/~zpkilpat/icmns2017/program.html</span></a>), while others will be published in the Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience. This special issue will disseminate cutting edge mathematical techniques in neuroscience to a broader audience. The conference has helped to train a future generation of researchers in mathematical methods in neuroscience, in line with the present national BRAIN initiative aimed at understanding the mechanisms underlying neural computation.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The conference has provided training to students and postdoctoral researchers in the field of mathematical neuroscience, both in terms of theoretical methods for data analysis and modeling, as well as providing inspiration for mathematical modeling work in different experimental systems. Approximately 40% of the conference attendees were women, so in this regard, we were able to reach members of underrepresented groups in STEM. The conference will continue to be held annually in the coming years, and we believe that the success of year with its high quality talks and discussions will help in publicizing the conference in the future. Furthermore, we believe that the dissemination of results presented at the conference in the form of open access articles in the Journal of Mathematical Neuroscience will reach a yet a broader audience of trainees and investigators working in the field of mathematical neuroscience.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 11/13/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Zachary&nbsp;P&nbsp;Kilpatrick</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1642544/1642544_10453767_1510032032442_icmns5--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1642544/1642544_10453767_1510032032442_icmns5--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Brent Doiron\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1642544/1642544_10453767_1510032032442_icmns5--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Brent Doiron\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Brent Doiron discussing the origin of correlation changes in attention.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zachary Kilpatrick</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zachary&nbsp;P&nbsp;Kilpatrick</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Brent Doiron</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1642544/1642544_10453767_1510031253925_icmns2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1642544/1642544_10453767_1510031253925_icmns2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Paul Bressloff\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1642544/1642544_10453767_1510031253925_icmns2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Bressloff\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Paul Bressloff giving a tutorial on stochastic hybrid systems.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zachary Kilpatrick</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zachary&nbsp;P&nbsp;Kilpatrick</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Paul Bressloff</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1642544/1642544_10453767_1510031946745_icmns4--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1642544/1642544_10453767_1510031946745_icmns4--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Stefano Fusi\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1642544/1642544_10453767_1510031946745_icmns4--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Stefano Fusi\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Stefano Fusi discussing a computational theory of plasticity.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Zachary Kilpatrick</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Zachary&nbsp;P&nbsp;Kilpatrick</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Stefano Fusi</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
