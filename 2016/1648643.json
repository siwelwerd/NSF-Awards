The conference attracts an international crowd that includes academics, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders. The meeting environment allows participants to exchange ideas, interact with leaders in the field, meet up-and-coming scientists, network, develop collaborations, and generate new ideas on the leading edge of robotic technology.",
