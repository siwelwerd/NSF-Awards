 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will advance efforts of the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program to better understand and promote practices that increase students' motivations and capacities to pursue careers in fields of science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) by engaging in hands-on field experience, laboratory/project-based entrepreneurship tasks and mentorship experiences. \r\n\r\nEducation Connection's Center for 21st Century Skills, in collaboration with a consortium of education and industry partners, will develop an online open source platform with an integrated incubator curriculum that engages high school students, teachers, and mentors in synergistic collaborations to advance students' competencies and skills via the design and launching of STEM-related products and services. The project will be tested, iterated, and implemented in 25 diverse in-school settings and 2 afterschool settings to assess its effectiveness. The project will be implemented as a high school Capstone course and engage over 1,100 predominantly underrepresented students in the development, iteration, and launching of challenge project solutions. The focus of the project is on development of entrepreneurship skills in high school students and teaching them how to persist in the STEM marketplace.\r\n\r\nThe guiding research questions of the project are: (1) What coherent sets of experiences effectively and efficiently support student competency, motivation, and persistence for productive participation in the STEM-related workforce of today or in the future? (2) What instructional and curricular models can effectively engage teachers to utilize and integrate technologies to enhance student understanding of STEM-related occupations? (3) What roles might business and industry workforce members play in motivating students to become aware of, interested in, and prepared for careers in the STEM-related workforce?  and (4) What are effective and productive ways to ensure broadening participation by engaging underrepresented populations in STEM programs and careers? Using a quasi-experimental design, the EDC research team will compare 12th grade students enrolled in STEM Starter Capstone courses with their peers enrolled in traditional Capstone courses. Participating schools will serve as sites or blocks, each offering two STEM Starter Capstone courses and two traditional Capstone courses.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n \nIn alignment with the goals stated in the narrative for Skills21STEMStarter: An Incubator and Launch Pad to STEM Entrepreneurship and Careers, Skills21 implemented a three year grant to grow the entrepreneurial and STEM interest and skills in high school students in Connecticut.  Each year students completed individual challenge based projects and worked with adult mentors.  The STEMStarter platform was designed, tested, and refined, and is a robust platform to support students through Capstone projects where students can demonstrate their mastery of 21st century skills, growth in STEM interest, and entrepreneurial abilities. \n\n \nSTEMStarter teachers introduced the Skills21 Challenge Project each fall.  Students were challenged to develop a product, service or solution that could address a real world problem.  Problems ranged from small problems that impact a niche group to large, global challenges that impact millions.  Solutions ranged from physical objects, to technology driven solutions (apps or websites), to new systems that leverage human capital in different ways. Participating students developed a working prototype of their solution along with a business plan to prove feasibility and growth potential for their product.  Each year in May, students presented their projects to a panel of judges who assessed projects by viewing the online documentation in each student?s Launchpad profile, listening to a brief pitch and engaging in a conversation, and testing out the product (when feasible).  Judges were professionals from a variety of industries, professors from higher education, and local community leaders.  Judges scored projects using a rubric that students were able to refer to while designing their projects.  All students were provided with a score and comprehensive narrative feedback from the judges.  Students with the highest scores in different categories were presented with awards to recognize their accomplishments.  Categories included Outstanding Community Service/Social Justice Project, Outstanding Use of Technology Project, Outstanding Environmental Justice Project, and Outstanding Engineering Project.  \n\n \nLaunchpad, the comprehensive STEMStarter Platform, was tested and refined each year, and has become a robust resource for students and teachers.  Launchpad contains instructional material and resources for students and teachers and also allows students to build a complete profile of their project to share with teachers, college admissions officers or prospective employers.  A series of carefully scaffolded activities guide students through the ideation, design, development, and exhibition of their projects.  Each activity allows students to create an artifact that is added to their portfolio of work.  Along with each activity is a video with in depth explanations, resources, and custom templates.  As students add artifacts to their portfolios, the entire process from coming up with a problem to exhibiting the solution is documented in detail. The public facing portfolio also requires students to design their own logo, create a brief ?trailer video? about their project and write a brief bio. \n\n \nStudents participating in the STEMStarter Capstone project grew in a variety of skills.  They developed entrepreneurial skills, not usually taught in high school, by writing business plans and marketing campaigns.  Students needed to use a variety of 21st Century skills including creativity, inquiry, planning, marshalling resources, collaboration, intrinsic motivation, and managing ambiguity. Students showed a moderate statistically significant growth in their inquiry skills when compared to peers doing a non-STEMStarter Capstone project.  Additionally, the STEMStarter students showed growth in inquiry, creativity and entrepreneurial mindset from fall to spring.  In qualitative interviews students expressed greater intrinsic motivation for this project compared to other classes.  They attributed this to their ability to choose a topic of personal interest and have more control over the process and outcomes compared to their other more traditional high school courses.   \n\n \nTeachers grew in their capacity to teach a challenge based course by participating in STEMStarter.  Teachers attended summer professional development workshops and also received support from our school coach, who visited classrooms throughout the year to help teachers and/or students with their projects.  The STEMStarter model calls for teachers to facilitate student learning while gradually releasing ownership of the project to students themselves and most reported using this model in class. \n\n \nIn conclusion, students who participated in the STEMStarter program were able to design and implement a project to solve a real world problem that aligned with their interests and passions.  Students were able to express their creativity by using their skills and talents to develop feasible solutions.  The student voice and choice in the projects led to student reports of increased intrinsic motivation.  The development of the Launchpad Platform enabled teachers to facilitate challenge based learning and allowed students to demonstrate their work and growth over time.  The project has led to further work in Capstone in the state of Connecticut and will continue to grow as the state mandate for a ?mastery based diploma assessment? credit is implemented for the class of 2023 and beyond.  \n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/29/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jonathan Costa"
