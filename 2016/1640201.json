 "awd_abstract_narration": "The project will investigate an innovative, school-wide approach to integrating computational thinking learning experiences in STEM courses in high school. This whole school approach is designed to reach all students via greater access to high quality computational thinking learning experiences in a variety of STEM courses. Integrated course activities will help students see how computer science is applied in mathematics and science. Students will use simulation tools to model science and mathematics concepts as well as data collection, visualization and analysis tools. The project will include collaboration with teachers in order to develop materials and examine their use with high school students. The project will also refine a framework that can be used by other projects to describe and define computational thinking. An important contribution of the study is investigating the number and type of experiences students need to have to learn about computational topics. In addition to classroom-based activities, students will also complete capstone challenge activities in partnership with industry professionals that will be presented at the end of the year in a state-wide showcase. Finally, resources for teacher professional development will be created for in-person and online, on-demand use. The STEM+Computing Partnership (STEM+C) program seeks to advance multidisciplinary integration of computing in STEM teaching and learning through applied research and development across one or more domains.\r\n\r\nThe project will carry out an integrated, interdisciplinary curriculum development and implementation effort at the school level. The project will conduct a design-based implementation research study of whole school design, development and use of resources for the integration of computational thinking with other STEM disciplines. This will allow for refinement of the whole-school model while investigating the challenges and opportunities for integrating computational thinking in high school STEM courses. The resources to be refined and designed include a library of computational thinking curriculum, professional development resources, and assessments of computational thinking. The study will also refine a taxonomy for computational thinking that characterizes the aspects of computational thinking important for students to learn and examines how they develop over time. In addition to examining the implementation of the curriculum, the research design includes a study of the number and type of experiences students need to have in order to learn computational thinking concepts. The data collected and analyzed include quantitative and qualitative information about students' learning and teachers' implementation.",

This means that we are missing a critical opportunity to prepare young people to approach problem solving and scientific inquiry in computationally sophisticated ways, to connect them to the excitement and promise of applying computing in STEM pursuits, and to see computing and STEM as synergistic and integrated rather than separate and distinct. Over the past four years our project team has worked intensively with Chicago-area high schools to bring computational thinking (CT) activities to STEM classrooms. The work of the project team has involved 6 major activities:<br /><br />1. In the course of our research we have developed an expanded taxonomy of computational thinking practices in science&nbsp; that has guided our curriculum development and research. Our refined taxonomy includes categories on algorithms, scientific visualization, and programming in addition to categories on computational modeling, data practices, systems thinking, and computational problem solving.<br /><br />2. In collaboration with high school science teachers, our team has expanded our CT curriculum library with 26 full-length curricular units in the areas of biology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. These curricular units fully integrate computational tools and methods in authentic classroom inquiry activities. Since the start of the project, our curricula and assessments have been implemented with 4,223 students and 15 teachers. In the most recent design cycle we developed units about COVID-19, Kinetic Molecular Theory, Newtonian Mechanics, Infectious Diseases &amp; Immunology, Motion and Acceleration, Central Dogma, Data Visualization, Systems and Models, and Sampling Distributions. In these units, teachers integrated various CT tools, including NetLogo, CODAP, Sage Modeler, Python, and NetTango.<br /><br />3. Throughout the grant we have collected data from classroom implementations in three public high schools serving significant numbers of low-income and underrepresented students: School 1 (71% African American, 25% Hispanic, 70% Low Income), School 2 (9% African American, 81% Hispanic, 94% Low Income), and School 3 (30% African American, 15% Hispanic, 41% Low Income). <br /><br />4. Our team has designed and implemented several assessment strategies including summative unit assessments and smaller embedded assessments. In 2020 we published a journal article examining student work throughout a science unit. Using pre-post scores, we identified students with both positive and negative gains and examined how each group&rsquo;s CT practices developed as they engaged with the curricular unit. Our results show that students exhibited science and computational learning gains after engaging with a unit with computational models.<br /><br />5. To support our curriculum development effort this grant supported the development a fully-featured web platform (https://ct-stem.northwestern.edu) that supports curriculum authoring and deployment. In the past year we have made several major improvements to the curriculum authoring and remixing tools based on feedback from teachers to better support them in creating or modifying existing curricula for their classroom. Further, we have added classroom management tools to help teachers engage their students with CT-STEM curriculum.<br /><br />6. Our work has incorporated the NetLogo software as a principal component of the modeling and simulation strand. As such, we have continued to improve both the NetLogo Desktop software and the NetLogo Web software for use in this project. In the past year, we have released several releases of each of these products. Additionally, the team has been developing a block-based interface modeling software, NetTango Web, which was released to the public as part of this grant.<br /><br />Finally this grant has directly supported the professional training of 7 PhD students, four post-doctoral scholars, and numerous undergraduate students who have participated in research activities.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/18/2020<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;Horn</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",
