 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Stanford Institute for Theoretical Economics (SITE) summer workshop series offers one of the leading forums for presenting innovative economic theory. SITE workshops bring together top scholars from around the world to highlight and discuss current theories on almost every topic in economics.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the SITE summer workshops is to advance economic science for the benefit of society. SITE's mission is to encourage and support the participation of younger scholars as well as provide exposure for scholars and institutions that typically may not be represented at other economics forums. All SITE attendees benefit from opportunities to engage in critical scientific discussion, to gain exposure to new developments in their field and beyond, to promote exchanges across disciplines, and to initiate and collaborate on new research. Attendees bring these assets back to their work and institutions. \r\n\r\nSITE contributes to the understanding and application of economic theory to processes, institutions, and systems, nationally and globally. SITE workshops promote rapid dissemination of the latest, topical research not only to economists but also to researchers, policy-makers and scholars in other disciplines, government and the private sector. To further facilitate dissemination of the knowledge and research, SITE maintains a website where digital versions of the presented papers are available to all. \r\nSITE facilitates sharing and cross-pollination of theoretical and empirical work on almost every topic in economics, including behavioral and experimental, computational, development, finance, industrial organization, labor, macroeconomics, public, and economic history. Organizers conduct from seven to ten sessions each summer, with an average of 16 presentations and over 40 participants per session. Organizers strive to include research papers in the most active and innovative areas of theoretical economics, as well as under-represented topics. There is also some cohesion along lines of research presented from year to year, reflecting the continuing interests of the organizers.  The goal and contribution of each SITE workshop is to contribute to the dissemination of scientific knowledge, strengthen empirical and theoretical economic analysis and research methods, and improve understanding of the processes and institutions of the US and global economies.",
