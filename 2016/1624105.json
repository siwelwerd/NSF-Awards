 "awd_abstract_narration": "With the support of the National Science Foundation, Scott Branting of the University of Central Florida will lead an interdisciplinary archaeological team analyzing the social organization of a large and short-lived Iron Age city. Archaeological investigations of large ancient cities, which are at a comparable scale to some modern cities, offer an opportunity to explore how households and social networks, and the people that comprise them, interacted with each other over extended periods of time. Knowledge gained from this analysis of the past could be used to help plan cities of the future that better fit changing climates, resources, and social forms. With limited later occupation or soil accumulation on top of the city's buildings and streets, as well as a wealth of geophysical data that has been used to map the buried structures and open spaces within the city, Kerkenes provides an exceptional location to undertake large-scale urban analysis of a planned city that predates forms of city planning that predominate around the world today. The international team that will collaborate on this project includes: Dr. John M. Marston from Boston University, Dr. Sarah R. Graff from Arizona State University, Dr. Canan Cakirlar from the University of Groningen, Dr. Sevil Baltali-Tirpan from Istanbul Technical University, Drs. Nil\u00fcfer Baturayoglu Y\u00f6ney and Burak Asiliskender from Abdullah G\u00fcl University, and Dr. Joseph Lehner from Koc University.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this research, three walled urban blocks within the ancient city will be the target for archaeological excavation and analysis. These urban blocks have been selected so as to investigate a range of different households that inhabited the city. Basic questions to be answered by the research include: how many households inhabited the urban blocks and what were the range of activities each household participated in during the relatively short life of the city? These results will be leveraged through the existing geophysical plan in order to model the locations of different social networks throughout the city that the inhabitants of these urban blocks interacted with in their daily lives. In addition, environmental archaeology and material analysis components of the research will explore how these households had access to and utilized resources that lay outside the city's walls. The results of this research will contextualize how the inhabitants of the city used this large, non-western, planned city and its hinterland during its approximate sixty year life. They also hold great promise for better understanding the role this city at Kerkenes Dag in central Turkey played in the larger historical and geopolitical events in this area of the world between 612-540 BC. Finally, the data generated by the project will be used for educational purposes. The Kerkenes Project has an over twenty year track record of training elementary, high school, and university students in archaeology and evolving geospatial technologies. Project data has and will continue to be used in courses and outreach programs emphasizing STEM and social studies concepts across these educational levels within the United States and abroad.",

This was accomplished by using multiple methodologies over 3 1/2&nbsp; field seasons that included excavating 1,567.5m<sup>2</sup> across three different urban blocks, surveying 349,200m<sup>2</sup> with electrical resistance remote sensing to identify 4,497 unique buildings in the plan of the buried city, and analyzing artifacts and ecofacts from the excavations including those found in the 10,460 liters of collected soil samples.</p>\n<p>Excavations focused on one urban block in the northern part of the city, named Urban Block 8. Urban blocks at Kerkenes are walled compounds that form key elements of the city's plan and contain assorted buildings and open areas. Numerous activity areas were identified by the team in the large contiguous excavations in Urban Block 8 including areas for food preparation, storage, and the hosting of public events. The remains of a last feast held in a public hall were also identified, consumed days or weeks before the short-lived city was destroyed with fire. Even evidence of the paths of individual acts of looting during the destruction of the city were discovered. No evidence for households were yet found in the excavations of Urban Block 8, but additional smaller scale excavations in two nearby urban blocks, 7 and 20, yielded evidence more in line with possible households. Evidence for regional and interregional trade and interactions have been discovered through material analysis and production practices found across several types of artifacts including amber inlays, glass beads, metal objects, and ceramics.</p>\n<p>The evidence from the excavations for the range of activities that are identified as having taken place in particular building types is being leveraged through the remarkable geophysical data into larger understandings of the social and political organization of the city. Specifically, the plan of the 4,497 buildings discovered in the geophysical data, covering 1/3 of the total area of the city, is being combined with the results of the excavations using a range of modeling and simulation methodologies. These include a PhD dissertation modeling the clustering and accessibility of storage rooms to assess if the organization within the city was more hierarchical or heterarchical, ongoing work to model small world networks and neighborhoods within the city, and another PhD dissertation using cellular automata simulations to detail the spread of the final fateful fire that destroyed the ancient city. Presentations and preliminary publications on this work have been completed during the course of the project and more, including the two PhD thesis, are planned to be completed over the course of the next year.</p>\n<p>The impact of this project lies both in archaeology and broader interdisciplinary research within urban studies. Very few archaeological projects have anywhere close to a plan of a single period of settlement encompassing 4,497 buildings. This is a unique dataset within the late Iron Age in Anatolia is an important contribution to understandings of both local history and that of the broader Middle Eastern and Mediterranean regions. It also offers an ideal laboratory for developing and applying methodologies for exploring social dynamics within a large, non-western planned city. Already several innovative applications have been developed or applied by the project with broader applicability to other cities in the past and the present including transportation models, fire simulations, and spatial analysis of social organization. With over half of the world's population and 80% of the United States' population now living in cities, it is a critical to understand the processes at work behind urban social organization and interactions from an interdisciplinary and multicultural perspective. This project provides an important perspective from the past. Additionally, during the time of the award, the Kerkenes Project has tested on site innovative 3D drawing software for augmented reality headsets. The DATCH software (datchucf.org) was developed with separate funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and more recently from the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and has potential impacts across field sciences. Finally, the project had significant impacts on students and the local community. Involvement by local stakeholders in the project has been strengthened by publications in both Turkish and English. The data from the project is being used in presentations, curriculum, and theses for students from elementary school through graduate studies around the world. Students have also been involved in all levels of the project, from participation to leadership, benefitting both the students and the project. Former students have attained postdoctoral positions in various countries as well as permanent faculty positions at Sydney University and at Leiden University during this award, further expanding the global impact of the project and setting it up for sustainable success.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/29/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Scott&nbsp;Branting</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1624105/1624105_10441516_1675017523130_UrbanBlocks7820--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1624105/1624105_10441516_1675017523130_UrbanBlocks7820--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Locations of Urban Blocks 7, 8, and 20 in Kerkenes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1624105/1624105_10441516_1675017523130_UrbanBlocks7820--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Locations of Urban Blocks 7, 8, and 20 in Kerkenes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The locations of Urban Blocks 7, 8, and 20 at Kerkenes, where excavation took place during the project.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kerkenes Project</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Scott&nbsp;Branting</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Locations of Urban Blocks 7, 8, and 20 in Kerkenes</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1624105/1624105_10441516_1675017660559_UB8Trenches--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1624105/1624105_10441516_1675017660559_UB8Trenches--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Trenches Excavated within Urban Block 8\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1624105/1624105_10441516_1675017660559_UB8Trenches--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Trenches Excavated within Urban Block 8\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The locations of trenches excavated within Urban Block 8 through the 2022 season.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kerkenes Project</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Scott&nbsp;Branting</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Trenches Excavated within Urban Block 8</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1624105/1624105_10441516_1675017795235_geophys_results_small--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1624105/1624105_10441516_1675017795235_geophys_results_small--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Electrical Resistance Data through 2022 at Kerkenes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2023/1624105/1624105_10441516_1675017795235_geophys_results_small--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Electrical Resistance Data through 2022 at Kerkenes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">The data produced by the electrical resistance survey at Kerkenes through 2022.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Kerkenes Project</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Scott&nbsp;Branting</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Electrical Resistance Data through 2022 at Kerkenes</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
