 "awd_abstract_narration": "Over the past few decades, advances in immunology have led to efficacious immune therapies for cancer, recognized as the \"Breakthrough of the Year\" by Science Magazine in 2013. Previously incurable cancers are now responding to immune therapies. Despite these compelling results, much can be learned by more basic research studies on anti-tumor immunity. In particular, it is not well known how emerging aberrant cells are initially detected and prevented from proliferating further through the interaction between the surrounding cells and the immune cells. We have previously identified the cell-to-cell signaling molecule that recruits immune cells into tumors. The identified molecule, interleukin-17D (IL-17D) is known as a signal molecule that carries out inflammation against pathogens in fish and also in invertebrates such as oysters. This project will investigate the impact of IL-17D on the gene activation and gene modification in cells of mammalian origin. In collaboration with Hiroyuki Sasaki, MD, PhD, an expert on epigenetics at Kyushu University, the project will uncover new insights into how IL-17D signals to mediate immune cell activation.\r\n\r\nThe project will advance the knowledge in the field of immunology by characterizing the genes induced by a conserved secreted protein involved in inflammation. This research will be carried out at Kyushu University under Professor Hiroyuki Sasaki. The project investigates the global gene expression and epigenetic modifications in cells stimulated with IL-17D using RNA-seq and bisulfite sequencing analyses. The project investigates 1) the immune response genes induced in response to IL-17D and 2) epigenetic changes from prolonged IL-17D stimulation in differentiated versus transformed cell types. Successful completion of this project will lead to detailed understanding on how IL-17D signals to mediate surveillance of transformed cells. Results from this project will contribute towards the basic research needed to develop efficacious immune therapies.\r\n\r\nThis award under the East Asia and Pacific Summer Institutes program supports summer research by a U.S. graduate student and is jointly funded by NSF and the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science.",
