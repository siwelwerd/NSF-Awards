 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) through Targeted Infusion Projects supports the development, implementation, and study of evidence-based innovative models and approaches for improving the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may pursue science, technology, engineering or mathematics (STEM) graduate programs and/or careers. The project at Winston Salem State University seeks to improve the motivation, engagement, and academic performance of students by building software that enables the organization of computer science and physics courses using game design principles and mechanisms. This approach is about motivating particular student behavior in a course through the use of game elements, such as instant feedback, freedom to fail, freedom of choice, leveling, progress bars, badges, and leaderboards. The activities and strategies are evidence-based and a strong plan for formative and summative evaluation is part of the project. \r\n\r\nThis project has the objectives to: implement a course gamification platform that can support the gamification of STEM courses; develop instructional materials for gamifying modules of two computing courses, Data Structures and Introduction to Database Systems, and one physics course, Principles of Physics; and evaluate the developed software and created instructional materials to assess their effect on student motivation, engagement, and academic performance. Course gamification, which leverages extrinsic and intrinsic motivators for engaging and motivating students to learn, has the potential to improve academic performance and contribute to increased retention and graduation rates in STEM disciplines. Therefore, the proposed gamification approach and supporting software will be especially beneficial for institutions whose students have low STEM graduation rates.",

This suggests the need of employing methods that have the potential to motivate students and enhance their learning experience. Gamification - the application of game design principles and game mechanics to a non-game context - is a promising method that increasingly attracts the interest of educators due to its potential to foster motivation and behavioral changes in learning contexts. Specifically, course gamification uses game elements, such as instant feedback, freedom to fail, choice, achievements, progress mechanics, badges, and leaderboards, as interventions in the learning process. The primary aim is to stimulate student interest in learning by creating fun and engaging learning activities.</p>\n<p>While gamification has been regarded as a promising learning technology approach, it has also been acknowledged that it is difficult to design and implement and that there is a lack of appropriate tools to support course gamification. Another major barrier that hinders the growth of gamified academic courses is the lack of sound evidence demonstrating the potential of gamification. The goal of this project was to target these barriers by creating a course gamification platform, which is powerful and flexible enough to support both gamifying courses in the way that meets the vision of their instructors and conducting various experimental studies related to gamified learning.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the project we developed the gamification platform OneUp. Its design was founded on motivational theories and inspired by the idea of providing gameful experiences to students. It enables instructors to create 'challenges' consisting of questions, dynamic problems and Parson's problems and to integrate game design principles in their instructional methods. Dynamic problems are unique instances of programming or calculating problems generated from templates. The system can be used for students' out-of-class practicing and self-assessment or for graded quizzes and tests. It includes flashcards as well to support student learning. OneUp automatically checks the challenges taken by the students and presents immediate feedback. It also supports students and instructors by providing learning analytics and visualization of student performance and progress.</p>\n<p>In order to meet the project goals the system was designed to be highly configurable and course-independent. Any game element can be turned on and off to allow studies on the effectiveness of various combinations of elements. Gamification-related configuration includes the choice of game elements to be used along with specification of gaming rules for them. The system&nbsp;currently supports the following game elements: experience points, levels, progress bar, badges,&nbsp;leaderboards,&nbsp;virtual currency,&nbsp;learning&nbsp; dashboard, avatars, duels, call-outs, unlocking and goals. The game rules specify under what conditions (based on challenges) specific game elements will be applied. For example, a rule can specify that when all five challenges in a certain topic are completed correctly, a certain badge will be given. The game engine included in the platform is responsible for executing the rules, which are created by the instructor in a user-friendly interface.</p>\n<p>An additional goal of the project was to evaluate the developed software and assess the effect of gamification on student motivation, engagement and academic performance. Four STEM courses have been gamified with the OneUp platform - Computer Programming I, Data Structures, Introduction to Databases, and General Physics. We have developed challenges for these courses and have conducted semester-long empirical studies to evaluate the impact of gamification on students engagement and academic performance, as well as&nbsp; their motivation to practice in the gamification platform. To answer our research questions we used three complimentary methods: extracting data from the OneUp system logs, student final course grades and a survey based on the standard Student Course Engagement Questionnaire, augmented with questions related to the use of OneUp. Regardless of the different subjects and the difference in the applied gamification, the results of the studies consistently showed that the incorporation of gamification features to an online practicing platform led to increased student practicing and self-study. This, in turn, led to improved course performance. Overall, the results of the studies indicate that the gamification intervention had a positive effect on students' learning experience and engagement.</p>\n<p>The main contribution of this project from a practical perspective is the development of a course-independent, configurable gamification platform which enables instructors to gamify their courses. From a research perspective, in addition to the results of the empirical studies which positively confirm the impact of gamification on student engagement and performance, a major contribution is providing a vehicle for exploration of different gamification designs in different learning contexts to researchers.
