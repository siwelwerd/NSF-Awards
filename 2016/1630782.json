 "awd_abstract_narration": "New discoveries in basic physics often require scientists to probe Nature at the extremes of energy, distance (very large or very small), intensity, and density, where it is most likely to uncover discrepancies in understanding.   Extreme conditions can be produced in the laboratory - the high-energy particle accelerators are an example - but often only after great investments in both scientific personnel and infrastructure.  For this reason, over the past two decades physicists interested in fundamental physics have increasingly turned to astrophysics, using the exotic conditions already existing in Nature to test the understanding of the underlying laws of physics.  This strategy has proven successful: the high fluxes of neutrinos available from our Sun and cosmic rays led to the discovery of neutrino mass and flavor mixing; studies of the velocities of stars bound in galaxies and galaxy clusters revealed that 85% of the matter in the universe is dark, hidden from us, yet crucial in forming the structures we see in the night sky; observations of the thermonuclear explosions of distant stars led us to conclude that our universe is expanding at an increasing rate, dominated by some mysterious, unidentified vacuum energy; and most recently, a new field of gravitational wave astronomy opened up with Advanced LIGO's detection of the merger of two massive black holes, allowing scientists to test physics in the presence of extreme gravitational fields. This project will bring together nuclear physicists and astrophysicists interested in the quantitative modeling of astrophysical systems, to advance the understanding of the properties of neutrinos, the behavior of nuclear matter at the extremes of temperature and density, and the nature of dark matter.  \r\n\r\nThe main scientific goal of this project is to produce improved models of extreme astrophysical environments, like the cores of supernovae and the interiors of neutron stars, by combining knowledge of the underlying nuclear and neutrino microphysics, with the most advanced tools for numerical simulations in astrophysics.  This will enable to reliably connect available astrophysical observables, such as the electromagnetic and nucleosynthetic signals from supernovae, to underlying fundamental microphysics.  A second goal is to create the kind of interdisciplinary research environment that will allow the training of a new generation of scientists to work effectively at the interface of astrophysics and fundamental physics.  The nuclear physics community will benefit greatly from junior researchers trained in this interdisciplinary science, who can then bridge the gap between astrophysical and astronomical measurements on one hand, and their interpretation in terms of our \"standard model\" of fundamental interactions, and its possible extensions, on the other.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIn 2017 the gravitational waves produced by merging neutron stars were detected by two new observatories, LIGO and Virgo.   Each neutron star had a mass comparable to that of our Sun, but squeezed into a volume with a radius of only 10 km.   The merger created subtle ripples in space that propagated outward, eventually arriving at Earth.  The existence of gravitational waves had been predicted by Einstein 100 years earlier.   But only very recently were they observable: it took decades to create observatories like LIGO and Virgo with the requisite sensitivity to see them. \n\nThis event -- called GW170817 -- is an example of multi-messenger astrophysics.  Gravitational waves were not the only signature of the merger.  A short gamma-ray burst was recorded.  Then, as the fireball created by the merger expanded and cooled over a period of several weeks, a variety of infrared, optical, and UV observations were made of the associated radiation. \n\nThe power of multi-messenger astrophysics is that observations can be combined to constrain the properties of an astrophysical event.  Such multiple observations are now common because a number of new and highly capable observatories have come on line recently.  These include the LIGO and Virgo detectors (now joined by KAGRA), the James Webb space telescope, the ALMA array of 66 coordinated radio telescopes operating at millimeter wave lengths, the IceCube detector for recording high-energy neutrino interactions in Antarctic ice, SuperKamiokande and other deep-underground detectors for recording low energy neutrinos from the Sun and supernovae, and the Pierre Auger array for probing the highest energy cosmic rays. \n\nN3AS -- the Network for Neutrinos, Nuclear Astrophysics, and Symmetries -- was proposed to help theory keep pace with the rapid advances being made in instrumentation and observation. An important theme in astrophysics emerged from a National Research Council study completed two decades ago, \"Connecting Quarks to the Cosmos.\"  The extraction of new physics from astrophysical events generally requires theoretical models that relate observations to the underlying microphysics driving the event.  In the case of GW170817, that includes the equation of state of nuclear matter at extreme density, isospin, and temperature; the transport of energy and other quantities by neutrinos; and the nuclear reactions that help power the expanding fireball and create new elements.\n\nThe N3AS Hub had two important missions.  The first was to create an institutional network that could provide young researchers with the training in multiple fields needed to be effective in modern multi-messenger astrophysics.  The second was to help theory respond to the rapid expansion in multi-messenger observations.  Multiple observations can be interpreted only if the theorists analyzing the data have all of the requisite expertise.  A network of collaborating theorists is needed. \n\nTo interpret astrophysical data, one needs models of the requisite fidelity, based on the best available microphysics that the community can collectively provide.  If the model fails to reproduce observation, either the model is too primitive, or the microphysics used is incomplete.  A famous example of the latter comes from solar neutrinos, where our failure to correctly predict the neutrino flux was traced to new particle physics, neutrino mass and mixing.\n\nThe N3AS Hub fulfilled its first mission by training and mentoring eight young researchers, several of whom are now in faculty-level positions.  It fulfilled its second mission by advancing our understanding of the complex, quantum-entangled neutrino physics governing mergers and supernovae; building improved modekls of the nuclear equation of state for high densities and temperatures; and creating sophisticated numerical models that exploited these new microphysics advances.\n\nGW170817 provides an example of the importance of N3AS work.  After the event was observed, it was quickly concluded that within the radioactively powered fireball -- the expanding ejecta known as a kilonova -- new heavy elements had been synthesized.  The astrophysical origin of many of the heavy elements we find on earth had been uncertain.   These r-process elements can only be synthesized under very extreme conditions.  The conclusion that the kilonova was the likely site of the r-process was possible because of the modeling some N3AS theorists had made prior to observation of the event.  That work predicted a tell-takle evolution of the light curve, reflecting the presence of heavy elements and their influence on the opacity.\n\nThis is the kind of work that N3AS conducted during the five years it existed as a Hub.  A great deal of followup work was done on the kilonova, improving the model, studying the path of the r-process, and relating that path to the nuclear physics that will be done at FRIB.  Such successes helped justify the later continuation of N3AS as a Physics Frontier Center.\n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/03/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Wick C Haxton"
