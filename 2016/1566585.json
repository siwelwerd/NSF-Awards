Higher Teichmueller\r\nspaces are connected components of the variety of representations\r\nof the fundamental group of a surface into semisimple Lie groups,\r\nwhich share essential properties with Teichmueller\r\nspace. Classical Teichmueller space plays an important role in\r\nvarious fields of mathematics due to its rich structure and the\r\nfact that it is a smooth cover of the moduli space of Riemann\r\nsurfaces.  For higher Teichmueller spaces many potentially\r\ninteresting structures are yet to be discovered and the relation\r\nto the moduli space of Riemann surfaces still needs to be\r\nclarified. The proposed research focusses on identifying the\r\ngeometric objects (similar to hyperbolic surfaces in the case of\r\nclassical Teichmueller space) which are parametrized by higher\r\nTeichmueller spaces. These objects will then be used to define\r\nalgebraic, geometric and dynamical structures on higher\r\nTeichmueller spaces, and we expect that they will help to\r\nconstruct a natural map from higher Teichmueller spaces to\r\nclassical Teichmueller space.\r\n\r\nTeichmueller space is the space of all geometric surfaces with a\r\nfixed combinatorial type. Because it parametrizes all surfaces,\r\nTeichmueller space is a fundamental mathematical object which\r\nalso plays an important role in theoretical physics. Every point\r\nin Teichmueller space corresponds to a tiling of the Euclidean\r\nplane, the two-dimensional sphere or in most cases the hyperbolic\r\nplane by one polygon and its images under subsequent reflections\r\nin the sides. (Nice pictures inspired by such tilings appear in\r\nM.C. Escher's work.) The combinatorial type of the surface is\r\ndetermined by the number of vertices of the polygon and the\r\ngluing data, but the geometry of the surface depends on the\r\nlength of the sides and the angles at the vertices of the\r\npolygon. Teichmueller space is the example of a moduli space of a\r\npattern (the tiling) with rich symmetries (the reflections in the\r\nside of the polygon). Such moduli spaces can be efficiently\r\nstudied via the group generated by the symmetries of the\r\npattern. Higher Teichmueller spaces are moduli spaces of more\r\ncomplicated patterns in higher dimensional spaces. However, the\r\nsymmetry group of these patterns is the same as the symmetry\r\ngroup of the tilings associated to classical Teichmueller\r\nspace. Therefore one expects higher Teichmueller spaces to\r\nparametrize geometric objects which are not surfaces themselves,\r\nbut closely related to surfaces. The proposed research focusses\r\non identifying these geometric objects and studying their finer\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nThe project proposes various activities to involve graduate\r\nstudents in research and teaching, as for instance a yearly\r\nmathematical retreat for graduate students to study, explore and\r\npresent a mathematical topic in a group, and small workshops with\r\nmini-courses which allow graduate students to get insight into\r\nthe working of modern research collaborations.\r\n",
