 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will support the establishment of a new network (NeuroCaseNet) for current and future faculty that are developing, using, and evaluating case studies and Problem Based Learning (PBL) teaching methods in the neuroscience curricula. While there is strong support for neuroscience education within this large and diverse community, the adoption of case studies and PBL methods within neuroscience courses is far less developed. Finding appropriate teaching resources, in part due to the interdisciplinary nature of neuroscience and the rapid growth of neuroscience programs, is a strong challenge. This network will provide collaboration opportunities for educators with a strong interest in using these pedagogies in the classroom and create a platform for the discussion and dissemination of new teaching resources for the broader neuroscience education community. The increased faculty and future faculty collaboration on creating case studies stimulated by the network promises to enhance neuroscience education in all institutional contexts.\r\n\r\nThe broad objectives of this network are twofold: to provide collaboration opportunities for educators with a strong interest in using these pedagogies in the classroom and to create a platform for the discussion and dissemination of new teaching resources for the broader neuroscience community. The network is organized into cohorts of case writers, each with 6-8 Fellows of whom are experienced in cases/PBL methodologies. These Fellows will work collaboratively to create publishable case studies via focused workshops. The Journal of Undergraduate Neuroscience Education will be a primary vehicle for dissemination of these pedagogical tools to the wider neuroscience education community. The network then provides support for Fellows to create their own peer-mentoring groups which is intended to both support the generation of a new rounds of case writers but more importantly to encourage and promote implementation of case studies and PBL in the classroom. The network will partner with established promotors of neuroscience education, specifically the Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience and the Society for Neuroscience to education and inform the community of these new curricular tools. Thus, with the creation of new curricular materials via the case writing Fellows and peer mentoring groups to encourage and support the implementation of these case studies, the network will have a strong impact in promoting pedagogical change in STEM disciplines. \r\n\r\nThis project is being jointly funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Directorate for Education and Human Resources, Division of Undergraduate Education as part of their efforts to address the challenges posed in Vision and Change in Undergraduate Biology Education: A Call to Action (http://visionandchange/finalreport/).",

We successfully created a strong community of educators through the use of in-person and virtual workshops for the NeuroCaseNet fellows. These workshops brought together faculty educators (called \"fellows\") who desired protected time with like-minded individuals to either create <em>de novo</em> narratives or to adapt existing narrative-based curricula for undergraduate neuroscience curricula. By providing protected time to focus on developing these curricular products, the network fellows and leadership were able to create and publish eleven case studies, created eight more for future publication and to publish three articles about best practices for adoption of case studies in the classroom. The published case studies created a significant impact, generating ~200 requests for the case implementation notes and other instructor-specific materials. Many of the products developed by NeuroCaseNet were published in the Journal of Undergraduate Neuroscience Education (JUNE) which is freely accessed through database searches or the JUNE website. We created an open Facebook page for discussion about evidence-based teaching practices and for announcements of interest to the group. The NeuroCaseNet members also presented their work at a variety of conferences and workshops, e.g. the Society for Neuroscience&rsquo;s annual meeting and the Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience workshops. Over the lifetime of the network 26 oral or poster presentations were given by NeuroCaseNet members, resulting in dissemination of case-based pedagogical tools to a wide audience. A positive outcome of this faculty network was the strong community created among the NeuroCaseNet members, resulting in collaborations on projects across institutions and an expansion of professional networks. In addition, a goal of the network was to grow the community of case-based users and writers by creating \"nodes\" of interested faculty and future faculty that coalesce along discipline or geographical lines. &nbsp;In Atlanta and Charleston, new colleagues have attended workshops and conferences hosted by NeuroCaseNet fellows, suggesting that growth of the network and additional curricula will emerge beyond the end of the grant funding.
