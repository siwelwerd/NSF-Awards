 "awd_abstract_narration": "Water temperatures over the inner-half of continental shelves are typically cold in winter and warm in summer, consistent with the annual cycle of surface heat fluxes from the atmosphere. However, preliminary analysis of historical data and synthesis of previous regional studies indicate there are large regional differences in the amplitude of the annual cycle. For example, the\r\naverage temperature difference between August and February is less than 5 C along much of the U.S. West Coast, but is between 15 and 20 C along the East Coast. While there are also large regional differences in the annual cycle of surface heat, the surface heat fluxes do not generally account for the observed amplitude of the annual cycle or the regional differences. Both these results and previous\r\nstudies indicate that advective heat fluxes are important over the inner shelf and that they tend to buffer the response to surface heat fluxes and lead to important biological and societal implications. Thermal stresses play a key role in both organism function and community ecology, and small increases in inner shelf temperatures or alterations in the processes that control them can lead to dramatic shifts in community structure and/or mass mortality events. Thus, a clear understanding of how buffering by advection functions would allow some predictive capacity for the potential changes in both ecologically and commercially important coastal marine species in future climate scenarios. This research project aims to understand the processes controlling water temperature variations over the inner shelf on annual and interannual timescales. The project involves training of a graduate student.\r\n\r\nThis study will provide the first comprehensive look at the heat budget of the inner continental shelf, including its seasonal cycle and inter-annual variability. Available temperature and velocity data sets will be used to examine how the heat balance can be maintained by a number of possible sources of cooling including: across-shelf exchange due to depth-dependent upwelling, the along-shelf advection of an along-shelf temperature gradient, and the across-shelf exchange due to eddies. The results will be synthesized to determine the relative contributions of heat flux components and their associated processes for the different shelf regions of the continental US.  The analysis will enable an assessment of the role of shelf environment (e.g. width) versus external forcing (e.g. surface heat flux, wind stress) in driving the regional temperature patterns observed. The results will yield new information about inner-shelf circulation, the role of advection in controlling or moderating inner-shelf heating, as well as give broader context to previous studies of across-shelf exchange in the coastal ocean.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe heating of the coastal ocean?s surface by the sun during summer, coupled with warming atmospheric temperatures, has the potential to raise water temperatures along our coasts to levels that the local ecosystems cannot withstand.  How long the hottest waters of summer persist in the coastal zone, whether days or months, can control what oceanic plants and animals will survive within the coastal zone.  Yet, the ocean over the inner part of the continental shelf, just offshore of the surf zone where waves break, appears to have the ability to buffer rising temperatures regardless of what circulation occurs offshore.  We investigated the regional importance of this buffering in different parts of the continental United States and the physical processes that cause temperature moderation using centennial scale records of coastal temperatures from numerous locations as well as two decades of paired temperature and velocity observations at two key coastal sites.\n\nIn all coastal regions of the United States, ocean temperatures within the inner shelf during summer are far lower that what a simple estimate based on the cumulative heating from the sun over the course of the spring and summer would predict.  In most cases, maximum inner shelf water temperatures are only half as warm as what heating through the surface of the ocean should cause.  Additionally, summertime water temperatures are also quite steady, with small year to year changes in the summer monthly mean temperatures compared to winter.  Offshore in waters deeper than about 30 m, the ways in which the coastal ocean circulates to disperse or move warm summertime waters is variable.  Wind forcing of the ocean?s surface, tides, and large scale density or pressure-driven oceanic currents can all act to cool the coastal zone, but depend on these processing being both present and effective.  With significant regional differences in the occurrence of strong winds, tides, or large-scale ocean currents, as well as the time variable nature of wind events, oceanic cooling over the outer shelf is understandably variable with high year to year differences in maximum summer temperatures.  However, our work has shown that, regardless of what is occurring offshore, a specific mechanism exists over the shallow, inner part of the continental shelf that acts to remove the heat of the sun ? shifting it offshore -- and moderating the weekly, monthly, and year to year differences in water temperatures in this critical area of the coastal zone.\n\nResults from almost two decades of paired temperature and velocity observations at coastal sites off Oregon and Massachusetts show the same pattern of a background, or mean, onshore flow of cooler waters at depth, and offshore flow of warmer waters at the surface.  This background cooling mechanism works as follows:  Summertime heating of the shallow waters, coupled with their rapid mixing due to the friction of the shallow bottom, warms them more rapidly to a deeper depth than waters offshore and causes an across-shelf difference in temperature and therefore density.  This density difference, because of the rotation of the earth, drives an ocean current along the shelf, that again due to the friction of the bottom, is partially redirected across the shelf, bringing cooler waters onshore at depth and moving the warm surface waters offshore.  The mechanism is able to buffer, or moderate, temperature variability because it scales its intensity with the magnitude of the heating of the inner part of the shelf;  the warmer the inner shelf gets, the stronger this mechanism works to replace them with the cooler waters from deeper depths offshore.  Our work has shown, within a series of publications, that this mechanism is likely to be present in all coastal zones, working to moderate water temperatures within this critical part of the coastal ocean and, potentially, mitigating the impacts of climate change over seasonal timescales.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/25/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Anthony Kirincich"
