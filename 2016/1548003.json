 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project creates an I-Corps Site at Oklahoma State University (OSU).\r\n\r\nNSF Innovation Corps (I-Corps) Sites are NSF-funded entities established at universities whose purpose is to nurture and support multiple, local teams to transition their technology concepts into the marketplace. Sites provide infrastructure, advice, resources, networking opportunities, training and modest funding to enable groups to transition their work into the marketplace or into becoming I-Corps Team applicants. I-Corps Sites also strengthen innovation locally and regionally and contribute to the National Innovation Network of mentors, researchers, entrepreneurs and investors.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Oklahoma State University (OSU) I-Corp Site is to increase the number of STEM-related startups and licensing opportunities emerging from the OSU campus. Recently, emphasis at this institution has been placed on the facilitation of business startups and tech transfer on campus resulting in an ecosystem that includes the School of Entrepreneurship, the Riata Center for Entrepreneurship, The Oklahoma State University Research Foundation, the New Product Development Lab, the College of Engineering, Architecture and Technology's Fab Lab, and the Center for Sovereign Nation Engagement. The OSU I-Corp Site accelerates startup activity on campus not only by providing funding and training to startup teams, but also by helping create a faculty and student population that is familiar with the business startup process. It also provides a pathway for underrepresented students to participate in STEM-related business startups. \r\n\r\nThe Site grant provides 90 teams (over a three year period) $3,000 in funding per team along with training in the startup process, creating a culture of business startup and technology commercialization activity on campus that will remain in place long after the three year I-Corp grant is completed. \r\n\r\nThe OSU I-Corp Site impact includes the creation of STEM-related startups, licensing opportunities, jobs in Oklahoma and beyond, and incentives that attract underrepresented student groups to participate in the program. Business startups are particularly important for Oklahoma because the state has few Fortune 500 companies and other large employers. An increase in STEM-related jobs in Oklahoma bolsters the economy and improves the educational experiences of the students that are involved, increasing their competitiveness not only as STEM students but as citizens of our state and nation.",

While we had considerable success, it took considerable effort on the part of the PI, Co-PI's and support personnel to convince the faculty and students to participate in the I-Corps program and to apply for the I-Corps Nationals program. This was further complicated by the Covid pandemic and therefore, the team had to request no-cost extensions for an additional 4 years. However, during the final year, it was noted that the faculty and students were quite knowledgeable about the I-Corps program and the teaching team was able to support several student/facult teams. During year 2 of the project, the site program supported several NSF REU site teams to complete an I-Corps site project. Several teams also applied for and successfully obtained funidng for a Venturewell E-team stage I, II and the Asprire program.
