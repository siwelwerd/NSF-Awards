The focus of this conference is to empower women statisticians, biostatisticians, and data scientists by exchanging ideas and presenting technical talks on important, modern and cutting-edge research, discussing how to establish fruitful multi-disciplinary collaborations, and showcasing the accomplishments of successful women professionals. In particular, an ultimate objective of this conference is to increase the proportion of successful women researchers who have the technical skills, capacity and inclination to take on the challenges of 'big-data' oriented research in twenty-first century. \r\n\r\nThe two and half-a-day conference (starting the afternoon of October 20th) has multiple parallel technical sessions providing participants with the opportunity to learn about novel approaches and innovations addressing the challenges of big data. The technical sessions are complemented by career development sessions for all stages of participants starting from graduate students to senior professors, leadership development sessions, and formal and informal mentoring sessions. The conference, through multiple invited technical sessions highlights the research of female rising stars, mid-career and senior researchers and provides the opportunity to establish new collaborations. In addition, the mentoring and networking sessions of academic, government and industry participants guide early-career women participants on a successful career trajectory. \r\n\r\nConference URL: http://www.amstat.org/meetings/wsds/2016/index.cfm",
