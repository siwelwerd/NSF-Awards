 "awd_abstract_narration": "The development of new connections between neuronal cells in the brain is a critical process which ultimately underlies our ability to learn and remember.  This proposal focuses on a newly-discovered process called Nuclear Envelope Budding (NEB) that allows cells to make targeted changes to the structure of their connections with other cells. Three sets of experiments will be carried out, examining (1) molecular changes that underlie NEB, (2) the mechanical means through which NEB is accomplished, and (3) how NEB actually functions in newly-developing cell-to-cell connections.  An exciting and novel aspect of this latter set of experiments is the use of live cell microscopy to document the development of new connections in real time as they form in a living organism.  These studies will provide novel and critical insights into how the brain develops and into how our experiences can lead to changes in our neuronal circuitry.\r\n\r\nThis proposal takes advantage of the well-established Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) model of synapse outgrowth and maturation to further our understanding of how RNA granules are formed and subsequently trafficked to synaptic sites during development.  In particular, these studies will focus on the recently described process of Nuclear Envelope Budding (NEB), a nuclear export pathway by which RNA granules that contain postsynaptic transcripts are released from postsynaptic muscle nuclei. In Aim 1, we will investigate how Pin1, a highly conserved enzyme, functions to regulate NEB via nuclear lamina remodeling.  In Aim 2, we will explore the role of a non-canonical Nuclear Pore Complex that we hypothesize loads mRNA transcripts into RNA granules forming at the periphery of the nucleus.  Finally, in Aim 3, we will take advantage of a new tool to image trafficking dynamics of RNA granules in postsynaptic muscles at the time of synaptogenesis.  This proposal utilizes high resolution imaging modalities including array tomography, immunogold EM and live cell imaging. These approaches, combined with the genetic tractability of the in vivo system, poise this study to make a significant contribution to our understanding of RNA granule biology and provide exciting new mechanistic insight into the bidirectional communication that occurs between the nucleus and the forming synapse during NMJ development.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nFor years it has been assumed that the method by which cells transfer genetic information from the nucleus (cellular control room), to the cytoplasm is via a structure called the Nuclear Pore Complex (NPC).  Indeed, the NPC is responsible for the majority of this transfer process via a tunnel it forms through the membrane of the nucleus, allowing for RNA and protein to shuttle between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of the cell.  However, our work has highlighted a less utilized, but likely very critical, alternative route for passage of large macromolecular complexes across the nuclear membrane.  There were numerous observational studies of this process over the past 70 years, but it was unclear what the cellular function was.  Moreover, it has been known for quite some time that certain viruses utilize an alternative mechanism to the NPC to cross the nuclear membrane, mainly due to size constraints of the tunneldiameter formed by the NPC, which is not wide enough for viral capsids to transverse.  It was long assumed that this was a mechanism that the viruses had evolved independently and was thought to not be utilized as an endogenous cellular process.  Our work, and now the work of others, has begun to link all these various observations together and we have coined the term Nuclear Envelope Budding (NEB), as an endogenous cellular mechanism to move large aggregates of RNA and possibly protein across the nuclear membrane. \n\nThe work funded by this award was aimed at uncovering why and when the cell utilizes this alternative transport mechanism.  Our studies have led to the idea that during times of high RNA production, some of the RNA is not processed properly and cannot to be utilized by the cell to make functional proteins, and thus needs to be eliminated as cellular trash.   Importantly, recent work by other independent groups have shown that NEB might serve as a mechanism to clear damaged proteins from the nucleus.  The results generated via the studies funded by this award have garnered critical insight into this understudied mechanism of nucleocytoplasmic transport.  \n\n \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/18/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sean Speese"
