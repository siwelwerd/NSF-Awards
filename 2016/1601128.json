A major goal of the study is to search for and examine possible evidences for new particles and laws of nature beyond those described in the so-called Standard Model, which represents our current understanding of the fundamental constituents of matter and the laws that govern their interactions.  The Standard Model is believed to be incomplete, as it fails to account for some important findings and questions, such as the apparent imbalance of matter with respect to antimatter in the universe and strong evidence for dark matter, inferred from astronomical observations. This project will involve performing precise measurements of differences in behavior of matter particles compared with their antimatter counterparts, the results of which may reveal information on the origin of the observed matter-antimatter imbalance in nature, which is crucial to understanding how the universe evolved to its current state.  In addition to these fundamental research goals, the funding for this research program enables the training of the next generations of scientists and engineers at all levels, including undergraduates, PhD. graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and engineers working at the frontier of particle physics research with the state of the art data analysis and computing techniques, electronics instrumentations and particle and radiation detection techniques.\r\n\r\nThis research is carried out with the LHCb particle detector at the LHC collider at the CERN laboratory.  The specific focus of the research is on studies of reactions involving particles that contain the bottom quark or the charm quark. These studies allow for precise tests of the Standard Model, which may reveal possible deviations from its predictions.  The findings, together with expected results from experiments at the energy frontier, could help uncover new laws of nature and point the way to the structure of new physics beyond the Standard Model.  The research program also involves the upgrade of the LHCb detector, which is required for operations at higher luminosity of the LHC collider.  The detector upgrade effort is focused on the design of electronics instrumentation for extracting and recording electrical signals from a silicon strip tracking system located just upstream of the LHCb magnet.",

Our current knowledge of the fundamental constituents of matter and the laws that govern their interactions, obtained from decades of experimental observations and theoretical ideas and efforts, is encapsulated in the so-called Standard Model.  However, the Standard Model is believed to be incomplete, as it fails to account for some important findings and questions, such as the apparent imbalance of matter with respect to antimatter in the universe and the strong evidence for dark matter inferred from astronomical observations. A major goal of this research program has been to search for and examine possible evidence for new particles and new laws of nature beyond those described in the Standard Model. The program involves the study of proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland. These collisions are recorded by a particle spectrometer called the LHCb detector. While the results of these studies overwhelmingly conform to the predictions of the Standard Model, evidence for potential deviations has emerged in a few areas.  A key objective of this research program has been to make major contributions to the upgrade of the LHCb detector with the aim of significantly enhancing its sensitivity as well as enabling the operation of the detector at higher intensities of the LHC collider.  The completion of this program in the next two years, together with the Belle-II detector at the Japan?s KEK laboratory, will mark the start of an era of extremely precise studies of heavy quarks and leptons as powerful probes of new physics effects.\n\n \n\nEvidence for unequal lepton interactions\n\nEnshrined in the Standard Model is the equality of the strength of interactions between charged leptons- the three electron-like particles amongst the building blocks of matter- and the gauge bosons that mediate the electroweak forces. A key finding of our previous research NSF supported was evidence for preferential interactions involving the heaviest charged lepton, the tau lepton.  This result, which deviates from the Standard Model predictions, is consistent with a previous finding at the BaBar experiment that operated at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory from 1999-2008.  Similar results are also reported by the Belle experiment in Japan. In this funding period, we extended our studies of universality of lepton interaction to the decays of the heaviest b-flavored meson, B_c meson,  which is made up of a bottom quark and an anti-charm quark  The measurement of  this extremely rare process also stands at about two standard deviations from the range of the Standard Model predictions, consistent with the previously intriguing hints of non-universality in the behavior of the charged leptons.\n\n \n\nStudy of differences in Matter and Antimatter Interactions\n\nAnother key objective of this program is to perform precise measurements of differences in the behavior of matter particles compared with their antimatter counterparts, the results of which may reveal information on the origin of the observed matter-antimatter imbalance in nature, which is crucial to understanding how the universe evolved to its current state.  Studies carried out in this research program led to the development of new algorithms and techniques that improved the capabilities of the LHCb detector in performing such measurements. \n\n \n\nUpgrade of the LHCb Detector\n\nThe LHCb collaboration, the international consortium of institutions that built and now operates the LHCb experiment at CERN, is engaged in a major program to upgrade the detector.  The detector upgrade enables the experiment to operate at much higher collision intensities.  On this front, our research program has been focused on the design of sophisticated electronics instrumentation for extracting and recording electrical signals from a silicon strip detector system located just upstream of the LHCb magnet.  This device plays a key role  in detecting and recording the trajectories of charged particles produced in the collisions.  The new instruments will be installed in the LHCb detector in the current prolonged shutdown of the LHC collider in 2019-2020.\n\n \n\nTraining of young scientists and engineers\n\n In addition to these fundamental research goals, this research program has helped train several young scientists and engineers, including undergraduates, PhD. graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and engineers, in sophisticated detector and electronics design and state-of-the-art data analysis and computing techniques.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 07/09/2019\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Abolhassan Jawahery"
