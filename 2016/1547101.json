 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award is for an observational and modeling campaign that will address the impact of cloud seeding on orographic winter precipitation.  There is a lack of concrete evidence that cloud seeding has the intended impact of increasing precipitation, yet several states in the western US have conducted seeding operations over many years.  With advanced observational tools and computer modeling the researchers involved in this project believe that they can build the scientific foundation for weather modification as a tool for precipitation enhancement.  The researchers will heavily instrument the area around the Idaho Power Company's seeding operations in the Payette Mountains to collect data on the effectiveness of these activities.  This award represents a public/private partnership that has the potential to improve the viability of the cloud seeding operations and has implications for the water-hungry populations in the western US.  Multiple graduate and undergraduate students would be involved in the field work and data analysis, ensuring the development of the next generation of atmospheric scientists.   \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Seeded and Natural Orographic Wintertime clouds: the Idaho Experiment (SNOWIE) field campaign will take place in early 2017 in the Payette Mountains of Idaho.  The main observational assets that will be used are the University of Wyoming King Air research aircraft with in-situ and remote sensing instruments, the CSWR Doppler on Wheels mobile radars, and a host of ground-based remote sensing and in-situ precipitation sensors.  The overall goals of the project are to understanding the natural dynamical and microphysical processes by which precipitation forms and evolves within orographic winter storms and to determine the physical processes by which cloud seeding with silver iodide (AgI), either from ground generators or aircraft, impacts the amount and spatial distribution of snow falling across a river basin.  The core scientific objective of the proposal are to: 1) Evaluate the role of mesoscale and microscale dynamics and of the underlying terrain in the formation, growth, and fallout of natural ice crystals in winter storms through observations, 2) Investigate how the natural snow growth process is altered as a result of airborne AgI seeding through both observations and model simulations, and 3) Evaluate the effects of ground seeding on snowfall amount and distribution.",

This collaborative project between the Universities of Wyoming, Colorado, and Illinois, the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and Idaho Power Company, involved a 8-week field campaign between January-March 2017 in Payette Mountains of Idaho resulting in 24 cloud seeding events, post-processing and data analyses from the SNOWIE field campaign, and numerical simulations of orographic cloud systems in the using a version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model developed specifically for simulating orographic cloud seeding effects. Eight manuscripts related to SNOWIE have been published collaboratively across the groups with two in the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)</em>, three in the <em>Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology (JAMC),</em> one in the <em>Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS; Fig 1) </em>and two in <em>Journal of Atmospheric Sciences (JAS)</em>. Six additional manuscripts led by the participating institutions were developed and are either published or in review. The SNOWIE results, representing a critical step toward quantifying cloud seeding impact and understanding cloud seeding efficacy, have been covered by numerous newspaper or TV interviews, podcasts, and newspaper and magazine articles. Many presentations were given at national and international conferences. Four undergraduate and eight graduate students have conducted research as part of the SNOWIE project.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Intellectual merit:</strong> SNOWIE was the first experiment showing the entire chain of events related to cloud seeding beginning with the introduction of silver iodide aerosol into cloud regions containing supercooled liquid water, leading to the nucleation of ice crystals, followed by ice particle growth to sizes sufficiently large such that snow falls to the ground (Figs. 2-4). The PIs were able to quantify the snowfall on the ground by isolating radar returns that were unambiguously the result of cloud seeding in regions with light or no natural precipitation (Fig. 5).&nbsp;For the three could seeding events, precipitation gauges measured increases between 0.05 and 0.3 mm as precipitation generated by cloud seeding passed over the instruments. The total amount of water generated by cloud seeding ranged from 120,000 cubic meters (100 ac ft) for 20 min of cloud seeding, 240,000 cubic meters (196 ac ft) for 86 min of seeding to &nbsp;340,000 cubic meters (275 ac ft) for 24 min of cloud seeding. We then linked the spatial distribution and magnitude of snowfall from cloud seeding to atmospheric conditions, seeding operations, and dynamical, thermodynamical, and microphysical processes. The main results from this research are: i) more AgI did not necessarily produce more snowfall, ii) the greatest amount of snowfall, largest area covered by snowfall, and highest peak snowfall produced occurred on the day with the largest and most widespread occurrence of supercooled drizzle, highest wind shear, and greater liquid water content along and downwind of the seeding track, iii) the day with the least supercooled drizzle and the lowest LWC downwind of the seeding track produced the smallest amount of snowfall through seeding.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact: </strong>SNOWIE results provide new insights in the requisite ambient conditions needed for effective glaciogenic seeding of orographic clouds, and thus build the scientific foundation for weather modification as a tool for precipitation enhancement, which are beneficial to the Western States that suffer in many years from water shortages. SNOWIE investigators closely worked with the Idaho Power Company (IPC) during the experiment and data analysis showing a successful public-private partnership. All collaborative publications were a joint effort between the participating universities, scientists from the National Center for Atmospheric Science, and members of IPC. Four undergraduate and eight graduate students have conducted research as part of the SNOWIE project. Students were involved in the science meetings and the bi-annual workshops. Students are co-authors on research papers and presentations. Several students have presented their research at national conferences and published their results in peer-reviewed journals. SNOWIE research has led to the completion of three M.S. degrees and one Ph.D. degree, with more in the pipeline. Findings from SNOWIE have been incorporated into the advanced undergraduate and graduate courses on applied, mountain, and experimental meteorology at the Universities of Illinois, Wyoming, and Colorado.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 12/23/2021<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Jeffrey&nbsp;R&nbsp;French</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1547101/1547101_10421196_1640291516106_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1547101/1547101_10421196_1640291516106_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1547101/1547101_10421196_1640291516106_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Overview of the collaborative manuscripts as a result of SNOWIE.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Katja Friedrich</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Jeffrey&nbsp;R&nbsp;French</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1547101/1547101_10421196_1640291836092_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1547101/1547101_10421196_1640291836092_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2021/1547101/1547101_10421196_1640291836092_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Combined maximum Ze between the surface and 1 km AGL  on 19 Jan at a) 1710, b) 1719, c) 1729, and d) 1746 UTC.
