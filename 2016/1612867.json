 "awd_abstract_narration": "Integral curves are reasonable models for a variety of natural structures that arise in brain imaging and in atmospheric sciences. Natural structures in brain imaging include the axonal fibers connecting neurons. Natural structures in atmospheric sciences include isolines of barometric pressure, storm fronts, and jet streams. Generally, the data are points along the curves and are corrupted by noise. The goal of this research is statistical estimation of these curves. These researchers will investigate a detailed list of issues pertinent to statistical integral curve estimation, which will deepen and widen our understanding of the natural structures. The PIs will validate their statistical methodology by analyzing images on both diseased and healthy brains. The reliable statistical estimation of fibers will include the assessment of uncertainty in the images used for diagnostic procedures in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and brain tumors. It will also enhance the imaging tools needed for planning imaging-guided neurosurgeries. In meteorology the correct estimation of these curves can enhance existing weather maps. Finally, the PIs will capitalize on the similarities between modeling curves and modeling surfaces and investigate the statistical estimation of surfaces, which serve as natural models for axonal fiber bundles in brain imaging and iso-surfaces in digitized images used by many sciences.\r\n \r\nIntegral curves are solutions of differential equations where the governing vector or tensor fields are observed directly or indirectly and perturbed by noise. Several directions of their statistical analysis are planned, including a fully nonparametric diffusion function model, simultaneous confidence bands for integral curves, adaptive estimation, comparison of images of the same brain obtained via different procedures, model reduction based on tensor's order, and a unified approach to nonparametric estimation of manifolds, where integral curves and surfaces serve as particular cases. Specifically, the PIs plan to provide an end-user with enhanced images that contain not only estimated integral curves, but also simultaneous confidence bands that show the quality of the estimation in a uniform way, and moreover all the tuning parameters would be calculated from the data only. Upon completion of the proposed research, a practitioner would be armed with a procedure of systematic comparison of statistical properties of different tractography algorithms. Finally, the PIs plan to extend their methodology from 1D curves to 2D surfaces. The basis of this research is a synergy of empirical processes theory, Gaussian processes theory, the theory of ordinary differential equations, perturbation theory for tensors, numerical analysis, computer vision, and computational statistics.",
