 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description\r\nTwelve researchers across three institutions in three states (Louisiana, Arkansas, and Alabama) will collaborate on this brain research, and develop a foundation for the region as a hub for interdisciplinary, collaborative research activity in the neurosciences. This work will focus on understanding the initiation of epileptic brain seizures and longer-term impacts on brain function such as memory. Epileptic seizures directly impact roughly 1% of humans, and have indirect impacts on loved ones and caregivers as well as economic impacts on society. Epilepsy has been called a ?window to brain function? because the condition impairs different brain functions depending on the location of the seizure in the brain and the impacted network of neurons, and because it provides a unique opportunity to study an impaired brain?s function over time and space. The project will develop minimally invasive implantable sensors that can be used for monitoring before, during, and for several months following seizure events. Researchers will relate changes occurring during seizure events with those observed in the intervals between events. The project includes hiring four new faculty, design and purchase of equipment, development of new undergraduate and graduate courses, recruitment and training of a diverse student population to better reflect the regional community, and new student research and workforce opportunities. \r\n\r\nTechnical Description \r\nThe activities of the team across three institutions (Louisiana Tech University, the University of Arkansas, and the University of Alabama) are organized under four thrust areas that focus on recording and analysis of electrical activity, magnetic activity, neurochemical and optical signals, and memory function of the brain. A series of coordinated and synergistic investigations will be conducted using innovative methods and tools designed to probe brain function at the molecular, cellular, and macro levels in epileptic rats and human subjects. Patients with focal epilepsy, during their presurgical evaluation, will undergo implantation of intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) electrodes for subsequent long-term (days) recording and monitoring of their spontaneous seizures. Non-invasive magnetoencephalographic (MEG) imaging is also used to provide important complementary information on the electromagnetic activity of the brain. This collaboration will advance research and also result in the creation of unique databases of human and animal data from the participating institutions.",

In this project, we sought transformative advances in long-term probing and understanding of the brain's function, in particular the elucidation of the molecular and neurophysiological underpinnings of transitions of brain networks from normal states into crises (epileptic seizures) and the impairment of brain's higher functions (memory) in epilepsy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Vision:&nbsp;E</strong>lucidate the brain mechanisms underlying the genesis of epileptic seizures and memory loss, acquire a better understanding of brain's cognitive functions, and work towards the development of new effective treatments for epilepsy.</p>\n<p><strong>Mission:&nbsp;E</strong>mploy cutting-edge technologies to discover how pathological molecular and cellular processes in the epileptic brain contribute to generation of seizures and impairment of memory.

Long-term (4 to10 days per patient), continuous and highly sampled (2 kHz) 7,560 hours of intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals from 90 to 250 brain sites per patient and 45 epilepsy patients were recorded during the patients' stay at the epilepsy monitoring unit for monitoring of their seizures and localization of their epileptogenic focus. Memory tests were also performed on these patients during this period. Multi-channel (148) MEG signals were also recorded from these patients on an outpatient basis while at rest and during memory testing. MEG signals with memory testing from 24 healthy volunteers were also recorded and stored in the human database. The second NeuroNEM database consists of long-term (on average 1.5 months), continuous 8 channel intracranial EEG data with seizures and periodic evoked potential testing of their auditory memory from 100 epileptic and control rodents.&nbsp; Novel biosensors of neurotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA, serotonin and dopamine were developed and utilized for short-term&nbsp;<em>in vivo</em>&nbsp;recordings from the rats' brain as well as&nbsp;<em>ex vivo</em>&nbsp;from brain slices.

Thus, these tools can impact the diagnosis as well as the treatment of epilepsy by surgical intervention. We also expect that the mathematical algorithms we developed would contribute to the development of more reliable biomarkers for seizure prediction and timely administration of new pharmacological or electromagnetic treatments (responsive neuromodulation) to avert seizures from occurring.

Additionally, early-career researchers - both assistant professors and postdocs - were well-integrated into productive activities. The project also contributed to STEM education by organizing summer REU programs that recruited cohorts of students with a high degree of ethnic, racial, and gender diversity. Last, but not least, NeuroNEM has produced a number of important publications, increased cross-state capacity for collaborative outreach activities, and developed an enduring infrastructure for the pursuit of future grants in brain research.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 02/08/2022<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Leonidas&nbsp;Iasemidis</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632891/1632891_10452547_1643847430621_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632891/1632891_10452547_1643847430621_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"A Tri-state Brain Research Program in Epilepsy and Memory\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632891/1632891_10452547_1643847430621_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"A Tri-state Brain Research Program in Epilepsy and Memory\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">NeuroNEM Research Roadmap</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Dr. Leon Iasemidis</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Leonidas&nbsp;Iasemidis</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">A Tri-state Brain Research Program in Epilepsy and Memory</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632891/1632891_10452547_1643898179152_Picture2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632891/1632891_10452547_1643898179152_Picture2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Novel Microelectrodes\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2022/1632891/1632891_10452547_1643898179152_Picture2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Novel Microelectrodes\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Development of biosensors for long-term (months) in vivo recordings of neurotransmitters.(P.
