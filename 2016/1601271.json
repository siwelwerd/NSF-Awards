 "awd_abstract_narration": "Tens of thousands of years ago the levels of rainfall in northeastern South America were much higher than today. As a result, the Amazon and the Atlantic rainforests were much more extensive, occupying regions that are today covered by deserts and savannahs. When the climate became drier, those forests retracted and became fragmented. This change likely had dramatic effects on the animals and plants that live in tropical rainforests. This project asks how tropical forest organisms were affected by the climatic changes experienced over the past 250,000 years. The genomes of three species of lizards that occur in the Brazilian forests will be studied, and by comparing the DNA sequences of multiple individuals per species over their geographic range, the project will uncover the extent that their populations have expanded or declined in the past. This research shed light on how these organisms have responded to environmental change, in addition to the processes that led to their current distribution patterns. This project will provide training in molecular systematic methods and mentorship for undergraduate and Masters students at The City College of New York.  It also will foster new USA-Brazil scientific collaborations through joint field trips to northern Brazil.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to test how populations of forest-associated lizards have been affected by a recently proposed dynamics of moisture transport in South America during the Quaternary. It will generate Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data of three arboreal lizard species that occur in both Amazon and the Atlantic rainforests (Anolis punctatus, A. ortonii and Polychrus marmoratus) using a restriction-site associated DNA sequencing protocol. Phylogenetic relationships will be inferred using coalescent-based methods. Analyses of genetic structure will be performed to infer the number of effective populations within the different species. Scenarios of population expansion, contraction, or persistence will be evaluated based on coalescent simulations and both likelihood-based methods and Approximate Bayesian Computation. Estimates of demographic parameters such as effective population sizes, divergence times between populations, and migration rates will be estimated using best-fit models. Together these data will provide new insights on the population structure for taxa in the Brazilian Atlantic and Amazonian rainforests, and how they have responded to recent climate perturbations.",

Tens of thousands of years ago, for example, levels of rainfall in South America were at times much higher than today&rsquo;s. As a result, rainforests that harbor high numbers of animal and plant species, such as Amazonia and the Atlantic Forest, may have been very different from now. For instance, it is possible that these forests were much more extensive at more humid times, occupying regions that are presently covered by deserts and savannahs. On the other hand, these rainforests may have retracted and become fragmented during drier periods. Such changes would have dramatic effects on forest organisms - for instance, with species extinctions in some regions, migration of species into new regions, and even the origination of new species as forests changed.</p>\n<p>To investigate these possibilities, this research project asked how tropical rainforest lizards were impacted by temperature and precipitation over thousands to millions of years ago in South America. To do that, we studied the genomes anole lizard species that occur in Brazilian forests, because the DNA of organisms can provide clues about population crashes or expansions that may have occurred in the past.</p>\n<p>By comparing the DNA of several individuals, we found evidence of extensive rainforest expansions in South America hundreds of thousands of years ago. These expansions promoted physical contact between major rainforest blocks that are now separated by open and dry habitats. Importantly, this provided key opportunities for species to colonize new regions, dramatically changing the composition of species in Amazonia, the Atlantic Forest, and the Andean forests. We also found that populations have experience both contractions and expansions in the past, during times of documented rainfall shifts based on geological data. These responses were sometimes species-specific, suggesting that the particular attributes of each organism may affect how they respond to climate dynamics.</p>\n<p>To sample lizard DNA, this project required expeditions to forest sites in northern Brazil. Our fieldwork yielded not only the necessary genetic samples, but also many new species records and a number of lizard and frog species that are completely new to science. Among these findings are also records of two lizard species that have been unreported for more than 40 years and were presumed extinct. Moreover, we ended up identifying and reporting the presence of an exotic and highly invasive Caribbean lizard in Brazil&rsquo;s southeast, which may have devastating consequences for the native species.</p>\n<p>This work fostered USA-Brazil scientific collaborations through the involvement of local researchers and training of students from different institutions in Brazil, such as the University of Sao Paulo, the National History Museum in Rio de Janeiro, and the Federal University of Acre in Amazonia. In the US, this project provided direct training to two graduate and three undergraduate students from an urban minority-serving college in the city of New York. Our research resulted in four scientific publications and five presentations in scientific meetings, and at least three other manuscripts are currently under preparation. We also reached beyond academia to communicate and discuss the results of our research with the general public through posts in scientific blogs in the Internet and by contacting and working with the
