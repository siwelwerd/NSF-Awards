 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Plum Island Ecosystems (PIE) LTER (Long Term Ecological Research) site is developing a predictive understanding of the response of a linked watershed-marsh-estuarine system in northeastern Massachusetts to rapid environmental change. Over the last 30 years, surface sea water temperatures in the adjacent Gulf of Maine have risen at 3 times the global average, rates of sea-level rise have accelerated, and precipitation has increased. Coupled with these changes in climate and sea level are substantial changes within the rapidly urbanizing watersheds that influence water, sediment, and nutrient delivery to the marsh and estuary. In PIE IV the research focus is on: Dynamics of coastal ecosystems in a region of rapid climate change, sea-level rise, and human impacts. This work will advance our understanding of how the structure and function of coastal ecosystems will be altered over the next several decades and beyond. Because of their position at the land-sea interface, coastal ecosystems are particularly threatened by human activities in watersheds and to sea-level rise. PIE research will address both fundamental ecological questions as well as provide critical information on how to manage these systems. For example, it will help us understand how species changes in a complex interaction network result in changes to the abundance of key species, food web structure, and energy flow. PIE research will also improve our understanding of the importance of the coastal zone to regional and global carbon and nitrogen budgets and advance our ability to model biogeochemistry at the ecosystem scale in a spatially explicit framework. Finally, it will provide a greater mechanistic understanding of biogeomorphic feedbacks that will be essential in future conservation efforts. The investigators will continue their award winning Schoolyard program, \"Salt Marsh Science\", which serves over 1,000 students in grades 5-12 in ten schools each year. In collaboration with the Gulf of Maine Institute PIE LTER is developing a new initiative with local Middlesex Community College. By providing flexible paid internships with academic credit, PIE will be able to reach students from economically and ethnically diverse backgrounds who might not otherwise consider STEM careers. Outreach is important to PIE scientists. Activities include scientific collaborations outside PIE and with local, state and federal agencies, involvement in the Marine Biological Laboratory science journalism program, and partnership with Mass Coastal Zone Management in conducting marsh elevation surveys. PIE scientists currently serve on panels or advisory groups for US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), and many state and local agencies. All data collected by the PIE LTER are centralized and made available to the public through a web site http://pie-lter.ecosystems.mbl.edu/.\r\n\r\n\r\nResearchers at PIE will test how internal feedbacks within the marsh-estuary ecosystem influence the response of geomorphology, biogeochemistry, and food webs to three major drivers: climate, sea-level rise, and human alteration of the watershed. They anticipate large changes in the geomorphology of the marsh and estuary over the next several decades. They hypothesize that major feedbacks are exerted through sediment dynamics, changes in hydrology, alterations of carbon and nitrogen cycles, species interactions, and species introduction or loss due to warming. Positive biogeomorphic feedbacks within the marsh ecosystem will likely contribute to marsh persistence while sea level rises, but they hypothesize that PIE is moving from a predominantly high-elevation marsh to a lower elevation marsh, with less overall wetland, more open water, and more marsh edge. These changes will greatly impact estuarine biogeochemistry, primary production, and community dynamics. PIE IV will address three questions: Q1) How will the geomorphic configuration of the marsh and estuary be altered by changes in the watershed, sea-level rise, climate change, and feedbacks internal to the coastal system?; Q2) How will changing climate, watershed inputs, and marsh geomorphology interact to alter marsh and estuarine primary production, organic matter storage, and nutrient cycling?; and Q3) How will key consumer dynamics and estuarine food webs be reshaped by changing environmental drivers, marsh-estuarine geomorphology and biogeochemistry? Cross-system comparisons with other LTERs along gradients of temperature, species composition, tidal range, and sediment supply will further our understanding of long-term change in coastal ecosystems.",

Some major findings were:\n\n\n1) Over the past 20 years, rivers entering the estuary show a decline in the mean annual concentrations of nitrate, while phosphate is increasing. The decline of nitrate has occurred despite increased human activity in the watersheds, suggesting that beaver ponds, which have increased since the early 2000s, are altering the relative proportions of storage, emissions, and transport of inorganic nutrients to the estuary. Annual fluxes of other constituents show no temporal trends, instead, export is controlled by the large inter-annual variability in discharge. This suggests that climate variability is currently more important than land use change for most constituents.\n\n\n2) A major effort was building a robust understanding of how the marsh/estuarine system will respond to sea-level rise (SLR). Marshes must keep up with SLR or drown. Currently our marshes are predominantly high elevation marshes vegetated by Spartina patens with low elevation marshes dominated by Spartina alterniflora only making up about 20% of the marsh area. Measurements and models of the estuary revealed that there is a net loss of marsh due to erosion but that some portion of the eroded sediment is being redeposited onto the marsh platform contributing to marsh accretion. Field measurements on the marsh surface found that marsh accretion rates were significantly correlated with marsh elevation, with higher accretion rates in low-elevation marshes. This was driven by not only the higher deposition of eroded sediments but also by changing production of the grasses with elevation. A model of how both sedimentation and grass growth varies with elevation was coupled with a hydrodynamic model to predict how the marsh will change with SLR. If SLR is moderate (Spartina alterniflora) will begin to replace the higher elevation vegetation (S. patens). At high rates of SLR, (1 cm/yr), the marsh is greatly reduced in size and the high marsh is largely lost. \n\n\n3) Shifts in habitat configuration and productivity in marshes due to SLR may shift the availability of some types of prey, with cascading consequences for trophic dynamics. Although we have not yet seen a loss of high marsh habitat in PIE marshes, an experiment revealed the importance of the high marsh to intermediate consumers. When altered creek geomorphology prevents mummichogs (a killifish Fundulus heteroclitus) from accessing high marsh prey, it results in decreased mummichog abundance.\n\n\n4) A large amount of carbon is stored in salt marsh sediments. Measurements from cores, dated using radiometric methods, shows marsh burial rates between 70 to 190 gr.C per m2. Annual measurements of C storage using eddy flux towers, also show similarly high rates, with low marshes storing more C than high marsh. However, these measurements show a large interannual variability which we can relate to changes in summer precipitation and/or soil salinity. We have not seen large lateral losses of inorganic carbon from our marshes in contrast to some other areas. \n\n\n5) Waters in the Gulf of Maine are warming rapidly, which has led to the northward expansion of southern species such as the fiddler crab, Minex pugnax. Adults were first observed in 2014 and since they have continued to expand in number. Studies have shown that crabs in PIE LTER marshes are larger and have fewer parasites than those in marshes to the south. In areas where the burrows are present, they reduce above ground and below ground plant biomass. The effect on aboveground biomass was surprising because in the fiddler crabs historical range (Cape Cod, Massachusetts and south), they facilitate growth.\n\n\nBROADER IMPACTS: \n\n\nPIE-LTER Schoolyard Program: Our Salt Marsh Science program serves grades 5-12.
