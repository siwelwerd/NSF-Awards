Conference experience is critical for training undergraduate and graduate students to be well prepared for the computing workforce of the future. ICDCS is a premier conference and has a wide coverage of topics in distributed computing. The conference has made significant impacts to the computing community since it was founded in 1979. The selected papers have influenced the design and implementation of many distributed computing systems, software and applications today. Participation in such a premium conference provides an excellent opportunity for students and junior faculty members to learn the latest advances in distributed computing and interact with peers and world-renowned researchers. The availability of travel grants will be announced widely and the students will be asked to provide a document detailing how the participation will benefit them.",
