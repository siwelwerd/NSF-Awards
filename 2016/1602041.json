The workshop was initiated by three NSA/DHS National Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education (CAE/IAE) and IA Research (CAE/R) in the State of Kansas: the University of Kansas, the Kansas State University, and the Fort Hays State University.  In 2013 and 2014, they met as KanSec; in 2015, they have renamed the conference CanSec, and broadened the scope to other Midwestern states.\r\n\r\nThis grant provides support of students to attend CanSec, where they can interact with peers and faculty from across the region.",
