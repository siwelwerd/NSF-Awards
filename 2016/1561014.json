 "awd_abstract_narration": "Understanding phosphorus (P) behavior in the environment is critical to society, as P often plays a central role in promoting productive agriculture as a fertilizer. Yet phosphorus is also a contaminant in aquatic environments, where human-derived enrichment of P in water and sediment can promote harmful algal blooms.  Worldwide reserves of P are limited, especially in the U.S., and sustaining agricultural production will require the recovery and recycling of P.  The protection of water resources is also an increasingly critical area of concern to promote sustainable clean drinking water, healthy fisheries, and economically vital recreational resources. These issues require improved understanding of how P is, and can be, mobilized in different geological and engineered settings. P interaction with other elements, especially iron, manganese, and carbon, often controls P mobility, and understanding this interaction is therefore key to developing strategies for more sustainable agriculture and water quality. This research program?s goal is to develop a conceptual framework of the environmental conditions that maximize phosphorus mobility in sediment-water systems.  The project will integrate with NSF-EPSCoR program investigating lake water quality. Research on these topics will be integrated with outreach opportunities to teach local schoolchildren and stakeholders about responsible nutrient management and how to better protect water resources.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus is generally partitioned in sediment-water systems between mineral, dissolved, and organic pools. Determining the response times for different pools of P species to changing redox conditions is a major hurdle in understanding the drivers of phosphorus mobility and bioavailability in sediment-water systems. Static models describing P partitioning and mobility between these pools are voluminous but do not capture key factors.  The redox conditions near the sediment-water interface (SWI) are a critical control on the reactivity of P and associated redox-active elements (Fe, Mn, S, N especially) in shallow freshwater and marine systems, and can fluctuate on diel, seasonal, and more chaotic event-based timescales. The central hypothesis of this project is that the mobility of specific P pools is maximized by changes in redox conditions at the SWI over short (minutes to hours) time spans, and that the duration and severity of these redox oscillations drives the partitioning and behavior of P (and Fe) species over time near the SWI.  To test this requires a comprehensive investigation of P speciation and mobility that couples field and laboratory approaches designed to elucidate the drivers and dynamics of this complex system.  Analysis of the specific P pools and related elements will utilize advanced techniques to examine the partitioning of different P forms in different pools under changing redox conditions.  Specifically, high-resolution in-situ monitoring of natural and manipulated SWI redox dynamics using environmental voltammetric techniques, combined with a suite of targeted analyses to describe the redox-driven evolution of sediment-water P pools including: 1) sediment P mineralogical composition and extractability, 2)  P and Fe speciation, and 3) enzyme digestion and NMR techniques to determine organic P speciation will provide the data needed to develop a molecular-based and temporally constrained model of P speciation and mobility in sediment-water systems.",

In this body of work, we explored the relationship between fluctuating environmental conditions that are characteristic of the interface between a shallow lake?s water column and its sediment, commonly referred to as the sediment-water interface (SWI). Through both lab experiments and field measurements in focal lake systems within the Lake Champlain Basin, we demonstrated a fundamental link between the chemical form (composition) of phosphorus in the lake?s sediment and its mobility as conditions change in the overlying lake water. With controlled experiments that manipulated the timing of low vs. high oxygen conditions at the SWI, we found that the cycling of iron in water and sediment, driven by those fluctuating oxygen conditions, controlled the timing of the &nbsp;release and sequestration of phosphorus in sediment. Initially, phosphorus release from iron minerals in sediment took multiple weeks of low oxygen conditions. If the sediment became oxygenated, as might occur during a wind mixing event in the water column, iron and phosphorus rapidly precipitate and return to the sediment inventory within hours through adsorption to iron mineral surfaces. However, this new pool of iron bound phosphorus can be released much more quickly (a few days) if oxygen conditions become low again, suggesting that in many shallow systems where fluctuating oxygen concentrations at the SWI are particularly common, phosphorus bound to iron minerals may become more mobile over time, increasing the sediment?s capacity to fuel CyanoHABs. Indeed, when we examined the seasonal changes in the composition of phosphorus in sediment over time in a lake where we had also been monitoring seasonal changes in the water column conditions, we found that there were substantial differences in both the concentration and composition of phosphorus in the sediment that were related to seasonal changes in the water column (Figure 1). Furthermore, after large changes in phosphorus composition and concentration during the warmer months, the sediment returned to an almost identical phosphorus composition and concentration as to that in the previous winter, further illustrating the strong control that the seasons, and their impact on the lake, exert on the sediment inventory of phosphorus and its relative mobility (Figure 1). &nbsp;Additionally, we had opportunity to utilize Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICRMS) to characterize organic P in this system in new detail.&nbsp; The range of P<sub>org</sub> molecules is significant and highly variable across both space and time, showing that a highly labile and dynamic pool of P<sub>org</sub> is an integral part of overall P cycling in the system.&nbsp; Beyond our core basic research outcome of an improved conceptual framework of P mobility in sediment-water systems, there were substantial outcomes facilitated by NSF?s investment associated with STEM career mentorship and outreach to water quality stakeholders and the general public.
