 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Description: Photonic crystals are periodically structured artificial materials constructed from building blocks that are approximately a thousand times larger than those in atomic crystals. As symmetry in atomic crystals affects the electronic properties, symmetry in photonic crystals is a crucial factor determining the optical properties. However, because the repeating unit of photonic crystals is much larger than the periodicity in the atomic crystals, the symmetry in photonic crystals can be controlled by manipulating the structure of their repeating unit by using nanofabrication techniques. The research component of this CAREER award is to perform experimental and theoretical investigations of the symmetry effect on the optical properties of photonic crystals, aiming to achieve high performance of optical materials and optoelectronic devices. The research is integrated with nanoscience education activities at local K-12 schools and a nearby Native American community in collaboration with elementary school teachers.\r\nTechnical Description: The main objective of the research project is to establish a concrete understanding of how the optical performance of photonic nanostructures is affected by the structure symmetry. For efficient control of point group symmetry, a fabrication technique recently developed by the principal investigator is employed. The technique involves wet etching processing of silicon wafers. Translational symmetry is broken in a controlled manner by methods based on colloidal self-assembly. The symmetry effect on optical properties is investigated for: (i) high efficiency in thin-film organic solar cells, targeting light absorption that surpasses the conventional theoretical limit; (ii) high photoresponsivity in Si-based hot-electron infrared detectors, targeting broader band photoresponsivity than current benchmarks; and (iii) artificial white coatings mimicking nanostructures in white beetle scales, targeting thinner scales with stronger light scattering among low-refractive-index materials. Methods based on colloidal self-assembly are developed to fabricate such structures with precise control over structural parameters to determine the relationship between the structure and the optical scattering properties.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe energy and environmental challenges we face today require a radical transformation of energy conversion and heat management systems to make them highly efficient, environmentally friendly, and inexpensive.  Nanotechnology can potentially provide novel solutions for managing various forms of renewable energy including solar radiation.  In particular, nanoscale light manipulation plays a crucial role in enhancing photovoltaic efficiency in solar cells and cooling efficiency in building and human body heat management.\n\nWith support from this grant, we have addressed these issues from the perspective of heat radiation.  Specifically, by controlling light-matter interactions, we have developed (1) crystalline silicon solar cells that are approximately 10 times thinner than conventional cells and yet yielding high efficiencies and (2) white surfaces that achieve optical reflectance similar to white papers with 10 times thinner films.  The developed materials and devices can be fabricated with conventional manufacturable processes. \n\nThin silicon solar cells are highly flexible and capable of removing heat effectively when shaped in nonflat forms.  Resulting low temperatures of the cells help increase their photovoltaic efficiency further.  A remaining issue of the thin cells for practical manufacturing is that they can be easily broken if not handled carefully.\n\nA key to achieving high optical scattering power in white films is to employ structural anisotropy, a concept we discovered in a genus of white beetles.  These beetles display white color with anisotropic network of relatively uniform nanofibrils.  We have identified key structural features of the beetle scales and realized them in fibrous films by electrospinning silk.  These processed silk films exhibit even higher scattering power than the white beetle scales, which are believed to have been optimized through adaptive evolution.  With less powerful scattering in photonic glass, we have observed cooling significantly more effective than commercial solar rejection paints under sunlight.  Thus, the bioinspired electrospun films would be highly useful for daytime cooling fabrics.  A remaining challenge for this application is to improve mechanical strength of the nanostructures such that the fabrics can be washable.\n\nThe grant supported three PhD students who have graduated with the degree.  Among them, a student benefited from an internship training in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory for solar cell fabrication.  In addition, many undergraduate and master students gained knowledge on both experiment and simulation from the grant.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/14/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sang Eon Han"
