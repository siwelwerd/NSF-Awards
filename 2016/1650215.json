The project will contribute to the exploration of innovative new approaches for determining the impact of NSF programs and projects, promote the usefulness of NSF program and project evaluations, and help to expand the theoretical foundations for evaluating STEM education, workforce, and outreach initiatives.\r\n\r\nThe STEM Evaluation Community will serve as a focal point for evaluation capacity building with and across the NSF programs that fund STEM education, workforce and outreach activities, bringing people and ideas together, facilitating dialogue, sharing resources, offering opportunities for dissemination and more. The resulting connected system of evaluators will promote social innovation through a lively, dynamic evaluation professional community in which NSF program and project evaluators will share their work, learn from each other, and, ultimately, leverage and enhance the existing evaluation capacity building infrastructure that has been developed for specific NSF programs and audiences, thus charting a course to build further evaluation capacity across NSF.",
