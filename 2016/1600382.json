 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the third Lake Michigan Workshop on Combinatorics and Graph Theory, held at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, on March 5-6, 2016. The workshop series focuses on combinatorics and graph theory, which are two very active areas of research in modern mathematics. The geographical location of the workshop is intended as a focal point for the large number of researchers and students in the Midwest and provides opportunities to strengthen research collaborations on a variety of graph theoretical and combinatorial problems. The workshop, which will be advertised to universities throughout the Midwest, will train students and beginning researchers in important classical and emerging techniques of combinatorics and graph theory. \r\n\r\nThe workshop features two sets of three tutorial lectures, focusing on classical techniques and results in combinatorics that are not always presented in typical graduate sequences, and on emerging techniques on which the speakers are particularly qualified to expound. Tutorial lectures by Professor Edray Goins from Purdue University concern \"q-series, Partitions, Generating Functions,\" \"Modular Forms,\" and \"Applications.\"  Tutorial lectures by Professor Margaret Readdy from the University of Kentucky concern \"Quantum Combinatorics,\" \"Coalgebraic Combinatorics,\" and \"Whitney Stratifications and Combinatorics.\" In addition, the workshop features short talks by students and early-career faculty members. More details may be found at the workshop website \r\nwww.stat.purdue.edu/lmwcgt16/",
