 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award supports participation in the \"Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems Workshop\" series held in the spring semesters of the years 2016, 2017, and 2018 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The workshop serves to bring together young researchers and senior researchers in the field, disseminating recent breakthroughs in ergodic theory and dynamical systems and fostering collaborations in the area. The NSF funding for the workshop provides support for younger researchers (graduate students, post-doctoral researchers, and assistant professors), including those from groups underrepresented in mathematics. This workshop also strives to have a global impact in the mathematical community, with specific emphasis to recruit participants and speakers from Africa and Latin America. Additionally, the workshop will continue to serve as a platform of recruitment at U.S. institutions for graduate students from developing countries. \r\n\r\nEach year the workshop begins with a colloquium presentation by a distinguished keynote speaker. The next three days of the workshop include talks by main speakers that serve to headline the workshop days, semi-expository talks by senior researchers that provide junior researchers with an introduction to their research areas, and talks by graduate students upon recommendation from their advisors. The 2016 workshop (held April 7-10, 2016) features presentations on partially hyperbolic dynamics and on asymptotic properties of group actions and the relations between objects associated to them.   A highlight of the workshop is the Problem Session, where participants share open questions and new areas of research for possible collaboration. The successful collaborations created are evidenced by the four proceedings which have resulted from the previous workshops, published by Contemporary Mathematics and Walter de Gruyter.

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe major goal of this project has been to organize the Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems Workshop each spring in the Department of Mathematics at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  The project is led by Idris Assani (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), Jana Rodriguez Hertz (SUSTECH-China), and Kimberly Presser (Shippensburg University-Pennsylvania).  The workshop serves to bring together young researchers with senior researchers in the field to foster research collaboration.  The project has broader impacts both in an emphasis on recruiting participants from underrepresented groups and from a wide global area.  Our specific focus in these years has been increasing participation from Latin America and Africa.  Travel costs from these areas can be a huge deterrent for a young researcher, so making funds available and recruiting participants from these areas was an important objective. \n\nDuring this cycle of the workshop, the co-organizers designated a keynote speaker and one or two main speakers to anchor the days of the workshop.  The goal was to recruit high caliber mathematicians who enriched the other goals of the workshop.  The keynote speakers for this cycle were Francois Ledrappier, Elon Lindenstrauss, Idris Assani, and Valerie Berthe.  The main speakers for the workshop were Federico Rodriguez Hertz, Raul Ures,  Sebastien Donoso, Boris Kalinin, Albert Fathi, and Jana Rodriguez Hertz.\n\nWhile disbursement of funds and visa issues impacted some of the international participation, we were able to hold the workshops in April 2016, April 2017, April 2018, and January 2019 using these grant funds.  Over this grant cycle there are been 44 different participants, many of who attended in multiple years.  Young researchers comprised 59.1% of those attending the workshops.  Women represented 15.9% of the participants and researchers from underrepresented groups made up 22.7% of the attendees.  Faculty from international universities made up 47.7% of the participants and each year we were able to recruit at least one young researcher from Africa or Latin America to attend. \n\nSuccessful collaborations from the workshop are made evident by a number of joint publications which have resulted from connections made at the workshops.  For example, discussions at the 2018 workshop between researchers who live across the world from each other, Mrinal Roychowdhury (University of Texas Rio Grande Valley) and Jason Atnip (University of New South Wales, Australia), led to a joint paper on quantization for them along with Mariusz Urbanski (University of North Texas).
