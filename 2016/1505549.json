 "awd_abstract_narration": "Nontechnical Abstract:\r\nThe goal of this project is to study the electronic and structural properties of crystalline materials found at a new frontier of condensed matter physics, one where materials possess both an appreciable interaction between electrons in tandem with a strong coupling between their inherent magnetism (spin) and their orbital motion.  This unique combination of energy scales is predicted to stabilize fundamentally new states of electronic matter, ranging from new forms of superconductivity to new quantum entangled states with far-term applications potential in quantum computing.  Research supported by the project focuses on understanding the materials pathways necessary for realizing these new states and on exploring the interactions responsible for driving the prototypical parent state of these materials - the spin-orbit Mott phase - from an insulator into a metal.  Supported activities work to train the next generation of scientists utilizing national neutron and x-ray user facilities as well as work to address the nation's growing deficit in new materials discovery/synthesis by supporting the growth of new crystalline materials.  The project provides research experience to undergraduates from underrepresented demographics through summer research internships as well as conducts outreach activities aimed at inspiring precollege students to pursue materials science/physics academic and career pathways. \r\n\r\nTechnical Abstract:\r\nThe project focuses on experimentally exploring the mechanisms through which new classes of spin-orbit Mott (SOM) materials are driven from their parent insulating states into the metallic regime via carrier/bandwidth tuning. The insulating phases of SOM systems are inherently driven by a delicate interplay between strong spin-orbit coupling, crystal field, and short-range Coulomb interactions. This unique balance of energy scales in SOM compounds is predicted to host nearby exotic ground states ranging from high temperature superconductivity, to novel forms of quantum spin liquids, to correlated topological phases. Models of these new phases place them within close proximity to the parent SOM state.  The primary goal of the project is to understand how interactions evolve once this parent state is destabilized and driven into nearby materials phase space - specifically, to resolve the role of electron correlations and the evolution of electronic and structural degrees of freedom as the metallic state is approached.  Searching for new states/phase behaviors beyond the melting of the spin-orbit Mott phase is a second, overlapping goal of the supported research. Research activities are comprised of a combined materials synthesis, bulk electron properties characterization, and neutron/x-ray scattering effort aimed at forming a comprehensive picture of interactions in perturbed SOM states in classes of Ruddlesden-Popper, pyrochlore, and geometrically frustrated iridates.  Students at the graduate and undergraduate levels will be trained in materials synthesis techniques as well as in the use of neutron and x-ray scattering at national user facilities, helping to build the core of the next generation of the national user community.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project sponsored the experimental investigation of a class of insulating compounds, known as spin-orbit Mott materials, with the goal of understanding what new electronic states form when these insulators are driven to become metals.  Theories have long posited that spin-orbit Mott materials may become unconventional metals when charge carriers are introduced into them, with predictions of exotic magnetic states as well as high-temperature superconductivity put forward.  Work in this project tested these theories, both by creating crystals of carrier-doped spin-orbit Mott materials predicted to host these unusual metallic properties and by then performing an in-depth investigation of their underlying electronic ground states.  Research conducted discovered a number of exotic, correlated metallic states manifest across a range of spin-orbit Mott insulators driven toward becoming metals via chemical substitution.  Chief among the research outcomes were direct similarities discovered between the unusual metallic states formed in carrier-doped spin-orbit Mott materials and those previously discovered near the high-temperature superconducting phases of doped, conventional Mott insulators. These experimental discoveries validate prior theories that doped spin-orbit Mott states can indeed host correlated metallic states with emergent phase behavior, and the project outcomes motivate continued exploration of these materials for their numerous potential applications in far-term technologies (e.g. high temperature superconductivity, spin-based electronics).  Furthermore, the project supported the dissertation work and training of two Ph.D. students as well as three undergraduate researchers, all of whom have now continued on to pursue advanced degrees in STEM fields.  The award also addressed national training deficits by supporting the training of the next generation of crystal growth experts, capable of discovering new forms of quantum materials, as well by training members of the next generation of scattering experts needed for powering federally supported neutron and synchrotron user facilities in the United States. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 05/11/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen Wilson"
