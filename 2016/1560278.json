 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award from the Division of Chemistry (CHE) and the NSF Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) Program support a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the University of Puerto Rico-R\u00edo Piedras entitled, \"PR-CLIMB (Puerto Rico-Chemical Learning in Materials and Biomolecular applications)\" The PR-CLIMB REU Site is developed by Professors Arthur D. Tinoco and Professor Dalice M. Pi\u00f1ero Cruz who seek to provide undergraduate students a research experience that capitalizes on the academic and professional strengths of the university and Puerto Rico at large. As a minority-serving institution, the site offers a unique experience to a diverse set of students recruited from 2-year and 4-year institutions. In this nine-week program, students engage in fundamental studies of materials and biomolecules for potential applications in water purification, energy storage, sensing, drug design, and drug delivery. Students also are exposed to a variety of techniques in seminars and seven hands-on workshops that develop their skill sets in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals fields. The REU site develops well-rounded students with strong communication skills who are able to become self-sufficient researchers and productive citizens.\r\n\r\nThe PR-CLIMB REU Site provides undergraduate students with high caliber interdisciplinary research experiences that inspire interest in Chemistry graduate programs and also in the Puerto Rican biotechnology and pharmaceutical job markets as a viable career opportunity. To overcome a current economic crisis in Puerto Rico, it is a priority to provide a first-rate intellectual experience that demonstrates the quality of the university's resources and the island's job opportunities. Ten students conduct research in a diverse set of laboratories focusing on fundamental studies of materials and biomolecules that are engineered for applications in water purification, energy storage, sensing, drug design, and drug delivery. Through seven hands-on workshops, students obtain a broad training on biomolecular synthesis, chemical fractionation, purity assessment, activity assays, and characterization via spectral, structural, and electrochemical approaches. Seminars are offered on ethics in research, strategies for producing high quality research and public presentations, and funding opportunities for graduate work. In addition, professionals in academia and industry discuss their respective job fields.",

Also, this program offered information about the Puerto Rican academic, biotechnology, and pharmaceutical job markets as viable career options. A diverse set of research laboratories participated in PR-CLIMB, focusing on fundamental studies on the engineering of materials and biomolecules for potential applications in water purification, energy storage, sensing, drug design, and drug delivery. All participants or PR-CLIMBers, as we like to call them, received mentorship from the principal investigator of the laboratories and a co-mentor in the form of a senior graduate student or postdoctoral researcher. The principal investigators include the program's director Dr. Tinoco and Drs. Vilmali Lopez, Torsten Stelzer, Marvin Bayro, Kai Griebenow, Jorge Colon, Liz Diaz, Carlos Cabrera, Zhongfang Chen, Jose Rivera, Abel Baerga, and Eduardo Nicolau. Prof. Kariluz Davila was the co-director and an undergraduate student (Yahaira M. Cruz) served as the program's administrative assistant.</p>\n<p>During the course of the program, the PR-CLIMBers participated in workshops with hands-on experiences on modern chemical instrumentation. The workshops focused on topics in cell culturing, MALDI TOF TOF, high resolution NMR, chromatography, x-ray characterization, electrochemistry, nanoparticle characterization, and surface analysis. The participants also engaged in a seminar series in which presentations on scientific writing, ethics in research, communication and presentation skills, online resources, professional development, graduate studies and research fellowship opportunities were offered. As part of this series, the students presented their research plans via a flash oral presentation designed for a general scientific audience. The participants had the unique opportunity to visit a local pharmaceutical company such as Eli Lily and Pfizer. During the closing ceremonies, the participants presented their research results in a poster symposium that was evaluated by a panel of judges. The participant earning the highest evaluation each summer was awarded full support to attend a national conference. To help students aspire to graduate studies we have invited professionals from the Chemistry sectors of academia, industry, and medical research to serve as guest speakers including Dr. Alan Saghatelian (Salk Institute for Biological Studies), Dr. Jessica Mendez (Eli Lilly), Dr. Melinda Lull (St. John Fisher College Wegmans School of Pharmacy) and Dr. Irma Molina (The VA Caribbean Healthcare System). They have provided insight into their experience as natural sciences graduate students and as employees in their respective fields to demonstrate the diverse possible career paths.</p>\n<p><strong>Broader Impact</strong></p>\n<p>The PR-CLIMB program has attracted a wide mix of students from all over the United States with the help of a dedicated team of faculty from other universities throughout Puerto Rico and the mainland, who serve as liaisons. We have made a strong effort to recruit and serve a diverse pool of students of different socioeconomic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds who would be most transformed by the traineeship offered by PR-CLIMB (<strong>Table 1</strong>). The program has been extremely successful in helping to maintain participants in the STEM fields (<strong>Table 2</strong>) and producing several post-program accomplishments. Students have presented their REU research at national conferences. First place prizes were received for posters presented at the MeTRC and CSTEP conferences. The participants who won the best poster prize at the program closing ceremonies have received travel awards by the NSF-REU Leadership Group to attend the spring editions of the American Chemical Society (ACS) National Meeting &amp; Exposition to give an oral lecture about their research and their overall PR-CLIMB experience. &nbsp;Three participants have also published their REU research while several more will soon publish. Some of the local participants have continued to perform research with their REU mentors.</p>\n<p>The PR-CLIMB program has extended its services beyond its participants. It has provided mentorship training to the student mentors of the program and has propelled their respective doctoral/postdoctoral work. The program has networked with other on-campus summer traineeships such as the American Chemical Society and NIH STEP UP to share resources and offer its workshops and seminars to their respective participants. These resources were also shared with other summer student researchers not affiliated with these programs and professors and their students at other institutions within Puerto Rico. This amounts to an additional 25 researchers serviced by the program during the two summer terms. The program has laid the foundation for workshops that are now routinely offered as training opportunities for UPR-RP undergraduate and graduate students throughout the academic year. These accomplishments demonstrate the program's sustainability and vast outreach.</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 09/24/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Arthur&nbsp;Tinoco</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560278/1560278_10429781_1569359269644_Figure1_GroupPictures--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560278/1560278_10429781_1569359269644_Figure1_GroupPictures--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Figure 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560278/1560278_10429781_1569359269644_Figure1_GroupPictures--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Figure 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PR-CLIMB 2016 and 2017 group pictures.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Arthur Tinoco</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Arthur&nbsp;Tinoco</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Figure 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560278/1560278_10429781_1569359824540_Table1_ParticipantPool--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560278/1560278_10429781_1569359824540_Table1_ParticipantPool--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Table 1\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560278/1560278_10429781_1569359824540_Table1_ParticipantPool--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Table 1\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Description of the PR-CLIMB participants.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Arthur Tinoco</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Arthur&nbsp;Tinoco</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Table 1</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560278/1560278_10429781_1569359877372_Table2_ParticipantAccomplishments--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560278/1560278_10429781_1569359877372_Table2_ParticipantAccomplishments--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Table 2\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1560278/1560278_10429781_1569359877372_Table2_ParticipantAccomplishments--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Table 2\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">PR-CLIMB participant accomplishments.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Arthur Tinoco</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Public Domain</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Arthur&nbsp;Tinoco</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Table 2</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
