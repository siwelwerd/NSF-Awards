 "awd_abstract_narration": "This is a theoretical study about neutron stars, which are formed from the death of very massive stars that collapse and produce supernovae. Some neutron stars have very strong magnetic fields and are called \"magnetars.\" Their extreme density makes them a great laboratory for studying fundamental physics, including the effects of Einstein's theory of general relativity. Magnetars may also have a connection to Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), which are extremely energetic explosions in the universe. The PI will simulate merging neutron stars to see if she can create black holes and GRBs.  She will also explore the neutron star equation-of-state (EOS), which is a mathematical relationship between temperature, pressure, and energy. The PI will train and mentor a postdoctoral scholar and several undergraduate students, including women. The team will also carry out an outreach program with grade school children in the New York City area.\r\n\r\nThe science goals will be carried out through a theoretical and computational investigation of GRBs. They will computationally investigate the regime of hyper-accretion on magnetars that might form after core-collapse of the stellar progenitor and explain the presence of precursors on emission in GRBs. They will carry out fully general relativistic simulations of the merger of binary neutron stars as a possible cause of short duration GRBs. They will explore the role of the EOS in the formation of the accretion torus and jet needed to produce the GRBs, and whether there exists EOS that can lead to black hole formation after binary merger.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "Intellectual Merit:\nThis project had multiple science goals, under the common umbrella of\nthe study of Gamma-Ray Bursts and Magnetars, and their astrophysical\nconnections.  A special focus of the research has been devoted to study\nbinary neutron star mergers, which represent the ultimate targets for\nmultimessenger astronomy, being among the most promising sources of\ngravitational waves, and, at the same time, likely accompanied\nby a variety of electromagnetic counterparts across the entire\nspectrum, including short gamma-ray bursts and\nkilonova/macronova transients.\n \nAmong the most significant results of the project is a detailed\nnumerical investigation of the fate of the remnant compact object\nresulting from a binary neutron star merger, and the astrophysical\nimplications for the equation of state of dense matter.  Using General\nRelativistic MagnetoHydrodynamic simulations, we presented the first\ndetailed study of binary neutron mergers forming a long-lived neutron\nstar, and studied how the structure of the neutron star remnant, the\nrotation profile, the accretion disk, the magnetic field evolution and\namplification, and the ejection of matter depend on the equation of\nstate of the neutron star.\n \nFollowing the detection of the watershed event GW170817/GRB170817, the\nfirst astrophysical source detected in gravitational waves and\nmultiwavelength electromagnetic radiation, we performed a detailed\nmodeling aimed at unveiling the structure of the emitting region.  We\nnumerically studied the propagation of a jet into the ejecta of a\ndouble neutron star merger, and the resulting afterglow radiation, all\nthe way from the prompt gamma-rays to the late radio afterglow.  Our\nresults confirmed a single origin for binary neutron star mergers and\nshort gamma-ray bursts: GW170817 produced a structured outflow with a highly\nrelativistic core and a canonical short gamma-ray burst.\n \nBroader Impacts: The variety of physics/astrophysics/numerical topics and\ntechniques involved by this research project have made it ideal for the\ninvolvment of students at all levels, including undergraduates.\nThe PI has been especially focused to work with underrepresented minorities\nin science.\n\n\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/25/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Rosalba Perna"
