 "awd_abstract_narration": "Most industrial and aerospace systems must move in a specified way in order to accomplish desired tasks.  When such systems include flexible components, motion results in vibration or oscillation.  In these cases, achieving the desired output is challenging and may require additional energy usage or complex sensors.  Also, many existing control solutions do not perform well when the system parameters or configurations change. This project seeks to commercialize a control solution for such systems driven by stepper motors.  The proposed solution limits vibration caused by stepper motors, which improves efficiency, increases safety, and decreases energy consumption. Extensive customer discovery will be conducted in order to better understand the specific needs and performance requirements of flexible systems driven by stepper motors.\r\n\r\nStepper motor actuation sequences can be designed to limit undesired vibration using input-shaping design techniques.  The primary challenge encountered in designing input shapers for stepper motors and other on-off actuators is the inherent discretization in both command amplitude and time. Analytic input-shaped stepper motor profiles for short-distance motion commands for lightly-damped flexible systems have been developed. These commands can be made robust to modeling error in the natural frequency of the undesired vibratory mode. The potential for commercialization of this technology will be explored by interviewing potential customers in the aerospace, automotive, electronics, material handling, and process industries. Additional desired characteristics for the stepping motor control sequences and other application areas may be discovered during this process.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis project investigated the need for technology that reduces unwanted vibration in computer-controlled machines.  Over 100 interviews were conducted with engineering companies to discover and understand the need for vibration-reducing technology.  It was determined that great need exists in both spacecraft and cranes for command-shaping technology to reduce vibration and oscillation.  The market size for spacecraft was determined to be fairly small compared to the market size for cranes. \n\nThe main needs discovered in spacecraft were for controlling the vibration in the flexible appendages such as solar panels and antenna, as well as the oscillation of the sloshing fuel used to power the thrusters.  The main needs discovered in cranes were for limited in the payload swing.  Furthermore, a special challenge was discovered in the area of crane operations that involved payloads that create double pendulum effects.\n\nFeedback control technology was often cited as a standard method for attempting to control unwanted vibration.  However, it was discovered that feedback control was considered expensive and challenging to implement.  The main difficulty was obtaining, installing, and calibrating sensors that could provide reliable and accurate feedback control measurements.  Command shaping control methods, that do not require sensors, were identified as desired technologies that could satisfy this technological need. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/04/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William E Singhose"
