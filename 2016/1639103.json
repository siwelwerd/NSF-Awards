The Symposium will be held 21-25 August 2016, as part of the 252nd American Chemical Society National Meeting & Exposition in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  This project will provide travel support to the Symposium for early career scientists in several categories, i.e., undergraduate students, graduate students, post docs, and non-tenured faculty members.\r\n\r\nDr. Zhang's research activities have produced several groundbreaking discoveries in the investigation of the formation, growth, and physical and chemical properties of atmospheric particles. For example, Dr. Zhang's Science publication revealed that organic acids form strongly hydrogen-bonded complexes with sulfuric acid and reduce the barrier required for nucleation, contributing significantly to global aerosol production. In other important publications Dr. Zhang elucidated the fundamental chemical role of organics in atmospheric nanoparticle growth. Symposium topics include: (a) the investigation of the formation, growth, and physical and chemical properties of atmospheric aerosols, and (b) the assessment of climate and air quality implications of atmospheric aerosols. Awards for Best Student Presentation will be made at the symposium.",
