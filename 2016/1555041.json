 "awd_abstract_narration": "Forested mountain watersheds supply the majority of water to the western United States, and are fundamentally fire-prone ecosystems. Contemporary drought, and projected future climate change, simultaneously exacerbate fire risks in the Sierra Nevada and threaten the sustainability of the water supply. Management approaches that could simultaneously reduce fire risks while safeguarding water supplies are sorely needed.  This research takes advantage of a unique pair of watersheds in the Sierra Nevada where fire suppression was practiced for almost a century prior to the 1970s, and managed wildfire has been practiced since then. These basins will be studied to determine how vegetation cover, snow and soil moisture behavior, and water yields have responded to the changed fire regime.  The results will be synthesized in a modeling framework that can be applied to evaluate the potential consequences of similar shifts in fire regime elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada.  Results of the research will provide an evidence basis to motivate new fire management in the Sierra Nevada, reducing fire risk and enhancing water security in a region that supplies 60% of California's 38 million residents.  These results will be shared through an outreach program developed with the California Fire Science Consortium.  The project will also include a citizen-science project involving middle-school students participating in outdoor environmental education programs run by NatureBridge at Yosemite National Park.  \r\n\r\nThe removal of fire from forested mountain ecosystems represents a century-long, massive, and poorly-understood experiment, altering the composition, demography, allometry and succession dynamics of forests, with presumed (although largely unquantified) effects on biogeochemistry, hydrology and ecosystem function.  This research project leverages a unique opportunity to explore these effects by examining changes in vegetation, fire and hydrology in the only two watersheds in the Sierra Nevada where fire suppression has been deliberately alleviated and the natural fire regime allowed to re-establish.  Historical and contemporary aerial photography will be used to reconstruct vegetation histories in the study watersheds.  The resulting vegetation maps will be used as a basis for upscaling distributed soil moisture and fuel moisture measurements made throughout the study basins, and as input into distributed hydrological models.  Weather stations, snow cameras and soil moisture observations will be installed in sites with distinct post-fire vegetation successions to characterize the effects of vegetation change on local meteorological and hydrological conditions.  Laboratory experiments will be undertaken to evaluate the persistence of soil hydrophobicity under repeated freeze-thaw cycles, characteristic of the Sierra Nevada wet season.  The process insights obtained through these field observations will be used to develop, parameterize and test a probabilistic model representing the dynamic interactions of fire, vegetation and water.  The project will contribute new process understanding about the interaction of fire and hydrology in snow dominated landscapes, specifically how fire history impacts snowpack dynamics (such as interception, sublimation and melt timing), and how freeze-thaw processes impact post-fire soil hydrophobicity. It will generate unique spatial, temporal and historical datasets that will reveal the joint consequences of fire suppression and its alleviation on vegetation and hydrology in montane forests.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "In the early 1970s, the National Park Service made a bold decision about fires in the remote Illilouette Creek (Illilouette) and Sugarloaf Creek (Sugarloaf) Basins in Yosemite and Sequoia/Kings Canyon National Park.  They reversed 100 years of fire suppression, allowing naturally occurring fires to burn without intervention. \n \nFifty years later, these \"managed wildfire\" basins - particularly Illilouette - are different to the rest of the Sierra Nevada.  Fire area and severity has increased since the 1970s in the Sierra Nevada - but fires in these basins remain unchaged, frequent, and small.  Their outlines make a \"jigsaw\" pattern, where the last fire forms a boundary stopping the spread of the next one.  The landscape is diverse, ranging from dead snags, dense regenerating pine trees, and, excitingly for water scientists, places where new wetlands are forming from dry forest.   \n \nI wanted to understand how the changes to the fire regime had, over 50 years, changed the vegetation in these watersheds, and what it meant for water resources.  I wanted to know if the basins were wetter, and if this would alter future fires in the Sierra Nevada.  I wanted to equip students in the outdoor education facility NatureBridge to make their own measurements to help answer these questions.  The questions are hard to answer - no one in the 1970s collected information about how water was changing as the fires returned.  So, I needed to combine remote sensing, air photos, field studies, laboratory experiments and numerical models in a piece of hydrological detective work.   \n \nLuckily, aerial photographs of Illilouett and Sugarloaf were taken right at the start of the managed wildfire period - smoke from the first fire that would burn freely in Sugarloaf is even visible at the edge of one of the images! The types of vegetation visible in these early air photos (and later ones too) could be worked out using object-oriented classification, a kind of image analysis that I could test in 2012, when air photos were taken and detailed vegetation mapping was done in Illilouette.

Wetness of the soil was closely related to vegetation cover, letting us use our vegetation maps to estimate changes in soil water.  The results showed especially large increases in wet soil in the middle of Illilouette.

We installed weather stations and soil moisture monitoring in areas where meadows, forests and shrublands abutted.  Snowpack melted much faster under forest canopies, but persisted in the meadows, which also stayed much wetter through summer.  These data and flow observations in Illilouette Creek helped us train a hydrologic model.  We ran the model using our vegetation maps, and compared the results to when we ran it with 1970 forest cover.  The results show that Illilouette now produces about 50 mm/yr more streamflow than it did when fire-suppressed.  We re-ran all the modeling for future climate scenarios, and found the same streamflow increases due to managed wildfire.   We measured fuel moisture and found that the wetter soils in Illilouette shorten the fire season and change fire risk.    \n \nMore fires in Illilouette and Sugarloaf could also increase the negative outcomes of wildfire for water - erosion and flooding.  But, our modeling and flow data showed no increase in flooding.  Lab experiments showed that the water repellent soils that contribute to flooding and erosion after fires were destroyed by freezing.

But for places where we can use managed wildfire, this study tells a success story.  Thanks to managed wildfire, Illilouette is more diverse, safer from fire hazards and drought, and provides more water.  Sugarloaf shows us that this experience can't be repeated unless enough fires occur on the landscape.  This project tells us that careful and judicious use of managed wildfire should be on the policy agenda of those seeking to improve resilience in Sierra Nevada forests. \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/18/2021\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Sally Thompson"
