 "awd_abstract_narration": "Lighting is a crucial component in a number of applications, and as such it is the number one source of electricity use in the commercial and industrial markets. The number of installed lamps in these applications is only about half of that used in residences, but the amount of electricity used by these high-power lights is three times as high. These customers are operating high-power lamps for an extended period of time daily - using large amounts of energy for lighting and searching for an energy-efficient alternative. Target applications where there is a high potential for energy savings by implementing energy efficient lighting technology include parking, roadway, and sports lighting; high-mast lighting in seaports, airports, and stadiums; warehouse lighting; indoor agricultural lighting; and hazardous area and underwater illumination. These applications require a far-reaching directional light source, where the present innovation may achieve this with high energy efficiency and low cost. This project aims to advance solid-state white lighting technology through increasing energy efficiency and decreasing cost. The proposed innovation relies on laser-stimulated phosphor technology to create an energy-efficient, high-power light source. Commercialization of this innovation could lead to the next generation of ultra-efficient and smart light sources, surpassing the limitations of current lighting technologies and drastically increasing the availability and uptake of energy-efficient light sources in the high-power market, in turn, reducing\r\nglobal energy consumption and helping to preserve our environment.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this project is to evaluate the commercial feasibility of laser-stimulated phosphor technology for solid-state white lighting. Specifically, the proposed project will perform customer discovery research within the high-power lighting market, resulting in a commercialization plan and market focus; and will develop an optical simulation model based on laser-phosphor interactions to be used as the basis for further design and optimization to inform future prototyping efforts. The fundamental research conducted previously has showed that laser-stimulated phosphor emission is a viable alternative to produce high-quality white light. The next steps in commercializing this innovation involve identifying the market segments with the greatest need, and adapting our technology to fit those needs through innovative optical designs. Exploration and optimization of optical designs will therefore be the focus of this project. By exploring potential design schemes,the capabilities of this technology can be more fully understood and quantified. Optical modeling will be used to create and optimize designs, understand optical interactions, simulate illumination,and quantify potential performance capabilities. This will be done using the LightTools Illumination Design Software, a 3D optical engineering and design software product that supports virtual prototyping, simulation, optimization, and photorealistic renderings of illumination applications. Proper use of the simulation software to produce accurate results requires an understanding of the materials involved and their optical properties. The goal of the current project will be to develop a working simulation model that accurately simulates the optical interactions and resulting photometrics, agreeing with experimental data. This will include single laser models, using a blue or near-ultraviolet laser diode in combination with various phosphor compositions and matrix composites. Once an accurate model is established that agrees with experimental data, further optimization and designs can be explored that will inform future prototyping efforts. The technology demonstration at the end of this project will be an accurate model that will serve as the basis for further research in laser-stimulated phosphor technology, both within the goals of commercializing this current innovation and for future research efforts in this area.",
