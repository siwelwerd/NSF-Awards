Applications of distance geometry are widely visible in everyday life and include management of cellular telephone networks, drug synthesis, robotic automation in manufacturing, and architectural design. By bringing together scientists from diverse fields whose research involves distance geometry, the workshop has considerable potential to impact important applications while advancing related theory. The workshop will include four tutorial presentations, a poster session, and over 20 additional invited presentations. This will be the first workshop on distance geometry held in the United States. The workshop webpage is currently maintained at http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Workshops/Distance/, which contains the workshop announcement and call for participation.\r\n\r\nThe workshop will highlight important mathematical and computational challenges in distance geometry and draw connections to closely related mathematical problems in graph rigidity, semidefinite programming, and matrix completion, among others. The workshop is scheduled to involve leading researchers who are applying distance geometry to a wide range of scientific fields. In addition, the workshop will involve a large group of students and early-career researchers, and will create new resources that will be made available to introduce newcomers to the concepts and applications of distance geometry.",

The scientific program was determined by an organizing committee chaired by Farid Alizadeh (Rutgers) and Leo Liberti (CNRS and Ecole Polytechnique). Other scientific committee members were: Amir Ali Ahmadi (Princeton), Marcia Fampa (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro), Bill Jackson (Queen Mary University of London), Nathan Krislock (Northern Illinois), Monique Laurent (CWI), Th&eacute;r&egrave;se Malliavin (CNRS and Pasteur Institute), Michel Petitjean (University of Paris 7), Nicolas Rojas (Yale), Amit Singer (Princeton), Ileana Streinu (Smith College), Henry Wolkowicz (Waterloo), and Yinyu Ye (Stanford).</p>\n<p>From its origin to present day, distance geometry has straddled theory and application and benefited from the interplay between them. DG began as a classic mathematical endeavor rooted in Heron&rsquo;s theorem and later generalized by Cayley and Menger. Some notable mathematical developments associated with DG are Euler&rsquo;s conjecture about the rigidity of polyhedra and Maxwell&rsquo;s work on force diagrams. Recent developments that have had considerable impact in applications are Schoenberg&rsquo;s theorem about the equivalence of distance matrices and positive semidefinite matrices and the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma, which is one of the cornerstones of the analysis of large-scale image databases.&nbsp; DG is particularly useful as an inference model for incomplete or noisy data, which makes it an important tool for data science. Engineering applications of DG arise in wireless networks, bioinformatics, robotics, architecture, and many more. DG is also used in compressed sensing, low rank matrix completion, and the geometric representation of graphs. An unfortunate consequence of such broad relevance is that DG developed in a fragmented way, resulting in rediscovery of ideas, duplication of terminology, and a lack of clear separation between fundamental theory and application details.</p>\n<p>By bringing leading scientists in each application area together with those developing more general theory, the workshop aimed to facilitate a more unified vision. The workshop: 1) highlighted important mathematical and computational challenges in distance geometry; 2) drew connections to closely related mathematical problems in graph rigidity, semidefinite programming, and matrix completion, among others; 3) involved leading researchers who are applying DG to applications in a wide range of fields; 4) involved a large group of students and early-career researchers; 5) celebrated the historical evolution of DG and its appearance in different applications; and 6) created new resources in the form of presentation slides and videos (tutorials only).</p>\n<p>The workshop included a total of 28 presentations, four of which were tutorial in nature. The tutorials were all presented on the second day of the workshop which was billed as a &ldquo;tutorial day.&rdquo; These tutorials were videotaped and fully closed captioned. They are now linked from the workshop website to offer a lasting resource to a broad community. Several presentations addressed core DG topics such as matrix completion and graph rigidity; others touched optimization themes in semidefinite and convex programming; still others considered DG variants, such as DG with inexact or noisy distances. Applications included protein structure determination using nuclear magnetic resonance data, molecular or nanostructure determination using x-ray or neutron diffraction data, and several types of localization problems. Feedback following the workshop suggests that it was successful in both facilitating new research collaborations across disciplines and in sustaining existing collaborations.</p>\n<p>Because of DG&rsquo;s relevance to data science and to also help reach a broad audience, the workshop was held in association with the DIMACS Special Focus on Information Sharing and Dynamic Data Analysis.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 06/29/2017<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Tamra&nbsp;J&nbsp;Carpenter</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1623007/1623007_10417400_1497457970443_DG-workshop2--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1623007/1623007_10417400_1497457970443_DG-workshop2--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Tutorial by Pablo Parrilo at the DIMACS Workshop on Distance Geometry\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1623007/1623007_10417400_1497457970443_DG-workshop2--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Tutorial by Pablo Parrilo at the DIMACS Workshop on Distance Geometry\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Pablo Parrilo of MIT gives his tutorial presentation ?Graph Structure in Polynomial Systems: Chordal Networks? in the DIMACS Workshop on Distance Geometry.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tamra Carpenter</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tamra&nbsp;J&nbsp;Carpenter</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Tutorial by Pablo Parrilo at the DIMACS Workshop on Distance Geometry</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1623007/1623007_10417400_1496958680017_DG-workshop1--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1623007/1623007_10417400_1496958680017_DG-workshop1--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Group Photo: Distance Geometry Workshop.\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1623007/1623007_10417400_1496958680017_DG-workshop1--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Group Photo: Distance Geometry Workshop.\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Attendees of the DIMACS Workshop on Distance Geometry: Theory and Applications.</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tamra Carpenter</div>\n<div class=\"imagePermisssions\">Copyrighted</div>\n<div class=\"imageSubmitted\">Tamra&nbsp;J&nbsp;Carpenter</div>\n<div class=\"imageTitle\">Group Photo: Distance Geometry Workshop.</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1623007/1623007_10417400_1497458089740_DG-workshop3--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1623007/1623007_10417400_1497458089740_DG-workshop3--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"Research discussions at the DIMACS Workshop on Distance Geometry\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2017/1623007/1623007_10417400_1497458089740_DG-workshop3--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"Research discussions at the DIMACS Workshop on Distance Geometry\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Ileana Streinu (Smith College) and Th\u00e8r\u00e9se Malliavin (Institut Pasteur) engage in research discussions during a break at the DIMACS Workshop on Distance Geometry.
