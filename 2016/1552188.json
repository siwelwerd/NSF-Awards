 "awd_abstract_narration": "The effects of the solar eclipse in 2017 on the ionosphere will be studied using a combination of GPS receivers, the SuperDARN radar system, HF-band amateur radio, and plasma modeling. The large array of information to be used will include data accumulated by amateur radio operators, and involve graduate students and the Virginia Tech amateur radio club as well as the American Radio Relay League (ARRL).  Analysis of this information is expected to constrain models and enrich our understanding of ionospheric behavior. \r\n\tThe long path length over US soil of the 2017 eclipse affords an exceptional opportunity to focus significant diagnostic capabilities on the ionospheric effects of eclipses. Details of E and F-region variability will be exposed, and the natural laboratory provided by the eclipse will be used to study geophysical plasma diffusion, convective motion, and production of irregularities and waves. In coordination with more quantitative data from other sources, the amateur radio data will be used to constrain models in order to reconstruct the temporal evolution of the plasma density and the spatial extent of eclipse effects on the ionosphere.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThe NSF provided funding to Virginia Tech (VT) and collaborating institutions over the 2016-2020 interval to allow scientists, engineers, and students to engage in detailed studies of how the 2017 solar eclipse affected radio propagation through near-Earth space.  In addition to the scientists and engineers at VT, this work involved the nationwide amateur radio (ham) community as active participants.  Another total eclipse will occur in 2024, and the findings from the 2017 experiment will have a significant impact on further experiments to be undertaken for the 2024 eclipse. \n\nOne of the most significant findings from the 2017 eclipse experiment is that high frequency (3-30 MHz) radio signals can propagate over very long horizontal distances during eclipses.  It is well known that high frequency propagation at low elevation angles can refract around the curve of the Earth - this is the phenomenon behind the operation of over-the-horizon radar systems, first developed for defense applications in the Cold-War era.  The differences in propagation path lengths during eclipses are frequency and elevation angle dependent, and it is not unusual for signals to propagate several hundred kilometers farther than they would under normal, non-eclipsed conditions. \n\nThe eclipse was found to have minimal impact on GPS location services, so eciipses are not expected to create problems for GPS systems that might impact the public. Future eclipses are therefore not expected to present safety hazards for GPS-related systems in use by the public for navigation and location-finding services.  Computer simulations of upper atmospheric phenomena during eclipse conditions corroborate these results.\n\nThe funds provided by NSF supported the work of a large number of undergraduate and graduate students, all but one of whom have moved on to find employment as scientists or engineers in industry, at other universities, and at government research laboratories.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/14/2020\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Gregory D Earle"
