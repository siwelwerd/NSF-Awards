 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is the inaugural workshop meeting of a new STEM Education research network calling itself the Accelerating Systemic Change Network (ASCN). At the workshop the main agenda Item is to strategically plan the growth of the network to bring it to the point where it can support fledgling efforts in departments and institutions to transform their teaching and learning practices. At this meeting, working groups will be established and working group members will share their own work with one another, establish an agenda for their group, and articulate their vision and goals for the larger network.  \r\n\r\nThe intellectual merit and the broader impacts of supporting the start-up of the ASCN is that this will expand the knowledge base about how to effectively bring about systemic organizational change within higher education so that using evidence-based practices to support effective student learning becomes the new normal.",
