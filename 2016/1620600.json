 "awd_abstract_narration": "Newer faculty often find the process of writing their first grant proposals to be quite challenging. Professors Malika Jeffries-EL of Boston University and Jeffrey Moore of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign are organizing a workshop that seeks to clarify that proposal writing and reviewing processes and position newer faculty to write more competitive proposals to federal funding agencies. Participants have the opportunity to network with successful grant recipients and program officers. They engage in mock panels, speed coaching sessions, and other activities designed to provide them with a better understanding of how to put together a research plan that is ambitious yet practical. Broader impacts are also discussed in terms are educational activities, outreach and applications to societal problems. \r\n\r\nThe workshop, supported by the Division of Chemistry, is entitled, \"Chemistry Early Career Investigator Workshop,\" will be held on March 10-12, 2016 in Arlington, Virginia. This workshop brings together 100 junior faculty from a broad range of institutions and demographics to discuss steps in strategically crafting research ideas, planning educational and outreach activities, and assessing and evaluating project aims.",
