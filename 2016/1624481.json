 "awd_abstract_narration": "This award will permit the acquisition of a 213 nm laser, which will be coupled to an existing inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICPMS) to enable laser ablation mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) at Middlebury College.   LA-ICPMS is a rapidly growing field which has been transformative because it allows rapid analysis of very small regions (~10 microns) on materials such as minerals, shells, and artifacts.  At Middlebury College, the LA-ICPMS will be housed in the Geology Department and will be used primarily to undertake uranium (U) - lead (Pb) dating and trace element analyses of minerals, which are the primary recorder of past tectonics.  We also anticipate usage by biologists and by archaeologists who are interested in understanding the source materials and trade patterns of ancient tools.  The proposal was widely supported by faculty at nearby colleges and will be primarily dedicated to undergraduate research, providing hands-on research experience for students regardless of the scope or budget of their project.  Users will include a diversity of students, including many underrepresented groups and first time college students.\r\n\r\nAcquiring a laser will allow numerous projects to be undertaken in more efficient and effective ways. For example, laser ablation radically expands the number of possible ICPMS applications, including the ability to analyze materials in-situ with high spatial resolution, which is essential for many applications.  It also reduces sample preparation time and complexity relative to solution chemistry, facilitating a wider user base for the existing ICPMS. One internal project will use the provenance of detrital minerals in offshore sediment cores to test predictions of dynamic uplift in the eastern U.S.  Another will use detrital zircons in Paleozoic meta-sedimentary rocks to test longstanding models of Appalachian tectonics.  A third internal project will use the laser to better understand the origin of U and Th in bedrock aquifers with unsafe alpha activity.  External users have also put forward a range of project ideas.  Many users are interested in U-Pb geochronology to date igneous rocks, establish the timing of regional metamorphic events, and reconstruct cratonic evolution using detrital zircons.  Other users are interested in measuring trace elements to establish the provenance of archaeological artifacts, understand petrogenesis of young magmatic centers, and undertake trace element thermo-barometry.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThis award allowed us to purchase a 213 nm laser to accompany an ICAP-Q quadrupole mass spectrometer.  Whereas a mass spectrometer allows measurement of the composition of rocks or minerals dissolved into a liquid form, the laser allows us to make the same measurements by ablating small spots on samples that are still in their original solid state.  The added laser capability means that samples can be analyzed with relatively little preparation and with a much higher spatial resolution.   To this end, we have used the laser on two main projects thus far.  First, we have used it to undertake U-Pb dating of the mineral zircon from a variety of settings.  We have dated many volcanic-volcanic and rocks to establish the age of tectonic events in Maine, Vermont, and Iran. We have also dated zircons in sediment from offshore New Jersey  to fingerprint the source of these sediments and better understand evolution of the northeastern U.S. over time.  Second, we have used the new laser to undertake U-Pb dating of the mineral calcite sampled from faults and fractures in New England.  This work has revealed evidence for two previously unrecognized tectonic events that occurred much more recently than expected.  This discovery has potential to change our view of how passive margins (like the eastern U.S.) evolve over time.   Our hope is to publish these results within the coming year.\n\nThe laser has been used heavily, contributing data to 5 out of 8 senior theses project in the spring of 2017.  Likewise, it was used by at least four summer research students at Middlebury this summer, with additional heavy usage anticipated into the fall.  Because the laser enables a range of new applications it has engaged a wider swath of students and provided a context within which they can learn about analytical chemistry and geochronology.  In the coming year we plan to expand the range of applications to include trace element analyses on minerals and whole rock samples (as fused glass).   We also hope to expand usage to include folks at neighboring institutions, particularly those who wrote letters of support for the project.  In sum, the laser has performed extremely well and has proven reliable under heavy usage.  It has added a useful piece of scientific infrastructure to the region and will be resource to students and researchers in the region for many years to come.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/05/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: William H Amidon"
