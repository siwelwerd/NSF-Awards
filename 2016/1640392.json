 "awd_abstract_narration": "Even today, as one watches the ongoing destruction of historic cities and cultural heritage in conflict zones, there emerge pressing questions about how people persist through times of political upheaval, how political violence reshapes lives, and how the act of survival, in itself a material phenomenon, reshapes our understanding of violence. With these pressing concerns in mind, doctoral candidate, Ms. Tiffany Cain, and Dr. Richard Leventhal, both of the University of Pennsylvania, examine how political upheaval and war impact civilian spaces and everyday life in conflict zones. Archaeology, as a framework of analysis, emphasizes attention to the material culture of past societies distant and recent, and, lends itself particularly well to the study of the daily lives of people who often go unaccounted for in the documentary record. The researchers aim to provide a framework for recognizing and interpreting the material culture of political violence in spaces not typically associated with conflict - specifically, marginalized civilian settlements rather than battlefields and military forts. This research contributes to the broader anthropological understanding of the social and material processes of violent conflict by re-centering the experiences of ordinary people in its analysis.  This dissertation project is situated within a community-based research initiative in Quintana Roo, Mexico that trains local participants in archaeological methods and research design as well as historic preservation planning and implementation. This program positions archaeology as a key component of a sustainable development plan for the community and actively contributes to the informal education of local Maya community members through close collaborative programming. \r\n\r\nThis project's investigations are concerned primarily with archaeological remains generated by the Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n, or Maya Social War (1847-1901). The Caste War was a fifty four-year episode of violent conflict between a broadly defined Maya working class and Spanish creole upper class. The insurrection left many abandoned towns, haciendas, and ranches in the once thriving frontier landscape of what is now central Quintana Roo, Mexico. Conflict archaeology, a growing thematic field within the discipline, has brought the material analysis of modern warfare to the forefront of today's research concerns. Still, ordinary towns, settlements, and civilian spaces have not often been the focus of archaeological investigations of violent conflict. This research takes a novel approach to investigating the material culture of war by evaluating (1) how violent conflict impacts civilian spaces and (2) what its material consequences are for daily life in conflict areas. The investigators assess these questions by exploring how two processes commonly associated with conflict - the construction of defensive structures and regional abandonment - materialize. By examining the remains of unique settlement fortification practices observed in the study area as well as the association between rapid abandonment and the high density of culturally-valued grinding stones (metates) left in deserted settlement areas, the researchers will demonstrate how these marginalized communities on the frontier of 19th century Yucatan mobilized local knowledge and common practice in an effort to collectively persist in the face of large-scale violent conflict.",

Yet, such forms of collective violence are not new phenomena&mdash;though their coverage by the media and the growth of global populations may exacerbate their reach. As one of the processes most common to the human condition, collective political violence and warfare warrant dedicated study across spatial and temporal arenas. how people persist through times of political upheaval, how political violence reshapes lives and landscapes, and how the act of survival, in itself a material phenomenon, reshapes our understanding of violence. Equally pressing are questions of how postwar landscapes are reinhabited and reintegrated into social life-sometimes by those who chose to stay, sometimes by those who left the place behind, and at other times by new settlers looking to make new lives for themselves. Support from the NSF allowed Tiffany C. Cain to successfully complete fieldwork toward her doctoral dissertation, which addresses these areas of concern by examining one landscape reshaped by political violence during the latter half of the 19th century.</p>\n<p>Tihosuco, located in what is today the Mexican state of Quintana Roo, was a burgeoning Yucatecan creole frontier outpost as the region shifted from subjugation under Spanish colonial rule to Independence and early nationhood. Long-term political unrest, an incomplete project of colonial domination over the majority Maya region, and the rapid privatization of once communally held lands all contributed to the 1847 uprising often referred to as the Caste War of Yucatan. The Caste War&rsquo;s proximate cause was the public execution of a local Maya leader, which sparked the rebellion&rsquo;s first attack at Tepich and then at Tihosuco. The insurrection led to organized paramilitary action (1847-1866) and prolonged and devastating guerilla warfare (1866-1901) across what are now the Mexican States of Yucatan, Campeche, and Quintana Roo. In 1901, rebels were forced into negotiation by the Mexican government, effectively bringing the conflict to an end by treaty. A detailed archaeological investigation about the material consequences of this prolonged episode of political violence, rather than its causes, had not been undertaken until this study.</p>\n<p>This project built on four seasons of exploratory reconnaissance survey work in collaboration with the Ejido de Tihozuco&mdash;Tihosuco&rsquo;s federally-recognized presentative land organization. The NSF funded research conducted in two seasons during 2017. The first season focused on augmenting the archaeological survey, focusing especially on the recovery of an undocumented historic town and hacienda, as well as an extensive network of roads which remain the site of over one hundred defensive field fortifications which the work showed to be associated with wartime defensive strategizing. The second season focused on targeted surface clearing and surveying, alongside vertical excavations in the war-abandoned town of Tela&rsquo;&mdash;historically an administrative auxiliary to the economic hub at Tihosuco. During the 19th century, this town was home to just shy of 3,000 people. It was abandoned during the war under conditions that are still not well understood. It was never permanently resettled. Our investigations suggested that people may have stayed to try to defend the town for a significant amount of time during the early years of the war. Such a realization is important for archaeologists studying violent conflict because it serves to remind us that while violence is often associated with particular kinds of spaces, such as battlefields, it is not confined to these spheres, extending well into civilian population centers. People often chose to flee, but they also chose to stay. And, their domestic lives must adapt to new constraints until they chose to leave, succumb to the violence, or succeed in surviving the new conditions imposed on their lives.</p>\n<p>The study successfully drew preliminary conclusions in support of Cain&rsquo;s doctoral dissertation but would be strengthened by future comparative excavations, continued regional survey, and extended artifact analysis. As a component of a larger heritage initiative being facilitated alongside residents of Tihosuco, this project serves as a strong model of how to conduct scientific archaeological research as well as make relevant and impactful contributions to local community development initiatives. The funding for this project allowed the PIs to work with 10-16 rotating members of the Tihosuco Ejido&mdash;men and women&mdash;on a weekly basis over a total of twelve weeks. Participants learned (and taught others) methods of archaeological survey, excavation, artifact recovery and cataloguing, theoretical interpretation, technical drawing, photographic documentation, and exhibit design. Several US-based and local students were also trained in this process. Results of the research have already been presented in Mexico and the United States by both of the principal investigators, as well as local crew leaders from Tihosuco. A dissertation and journal articles are underway.</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/03/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Tiffany C.&nbsp;Cain</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1640392/1640392_10447312_1546543228144_TihosucoProjectTeam2017--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1640392/1640392_10447312_1546543228144_TihosucoProjectTeam2017--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"One Week's Team\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1640392/1640392_10447312_1546543228144_TihosucoProjectTeam2017--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"One Week's Team\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">2017 Tihosuco Heritage Preservation and Community Development Project</div>\n<div class=\"imageCredit\">Tiffany C.
