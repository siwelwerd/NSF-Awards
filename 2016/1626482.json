 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project will investigate and improve instruction in one of the fastest growing and most important areas of contemporary physics: quantum mechanics (QM). QM is the physics of extremely small systems (e.g. the size of an atom). Advances in engineering have led to an increased number of technologies that manipulate matter on this scale, leading to an increasingly critical need for a quantum-literate STEM workforce in both industry and research. This project leverages research into student learning and the challenges associated specifically with learning quantum physics. The outcomes of this work will have a significant impact on the education of STEM majors across the country, and will better prepare students for the growing number of careers in quantum technologies and research. \r\n \r\nThe project will develop new research-based educational materials that are easily adoptable by faculty from a diverse range of institutions and student populations. This will be done by answering four questions: what must students learn, what are students currently learning, how can their learning be improved, and how can faculty be helped to effectively utilize the resources developed? Thus, the key goals of this research project are to: 1) develop a set of learning goals for undergraduate quantum mechanics instruction by collaborating with a broad spectrum of faculty, industry, and research leaders; 2) improve understanding of student learning and student difficulties in QM with a focus on student learning in different instructional settings; 3) develop educational materials and assessments for quantum mechanics instruction suitable for use in multiple instructional paradigms, that are easy for faculty to modify and use in a diverse range of institutions; and 4) widely disseminate these materials, support new users, and evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum. The scope of the research and curriculum development will target a diverse population of students so the results and curricular materials will be broadly applicable.",
