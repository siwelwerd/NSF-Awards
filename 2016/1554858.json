 "awd_abstract_narration": "This CAREER award funds the research activities of Professor Joshua Ruderman at New York University.\r\n\r\nSignificant evidence suggests that most of the matter in our Universe is composed of an unknown source known as \"dark matter\".  Experiments conducted over the next few years will make dramatic progress testing the extent to which dark matter is a particle that interacts with ordinary matter.  Meanwhile, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is exploring the highest energies ever probed.  The LHC recently discovered a remarkable new particle, the Higgs boson, and is now studying the properties of this new particle.   The LHC may also discover additional new particles as well.  Against this backdrop, Professor Ruderman will pursue an original program of research and education concentrating on the origins of dark matter and the Higgs.  He will study the exciting possibility that there exist new hidden sectors of particles which have thus far escaped experimental detection because they are very weakly interacting with ordinary particles.  He will explore new models in which dark matter is a hidden-sector particle, or in which the Higgs boson interacts with hidden-sector particles.  In order to help in spreading physics to a broad audience, Professor Ruderman will also establish a competitive \"Physics in Media Travel Award\".    He will partner with NYU's Tisch School of the Arts to send film students to visit physics experiments that will appear in their movies.  He will also partner with NYU's Science, Health and Environmental Reporting Program (SHERP) to send science journalism students to visit physics experiments which will be featured in their stories.  Resulting films will be screened at local high schools, and resulting stories will be disseminated online in various journalism venues.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, Professor Ruderman will explore novel cosmologies for hidden-sector dark matter in which the annihilation rate is exponentially suppressed, predicting dark matter exponentially lighter than the TeV scale. This exponential suppression occurs when dark matter annihilates into heavier states, or is in equilibrium with heavier particles that are annihilating.   Professor Ruderman will develop new observational tests for light dark matter, including searches for UV and soft X-ray photons emitted by dark-matter decays or annihilations.  Professor Ruderman will also explore the interplay of hidden sectors with Higgs physics.  He will develop novel models with a fine-tuned Higgs mass and light hidden-sector scalars that interact with the Higgs.  He will also explore supersymmetric models with a natural Higgs mass in which stops are light and abundantly produced at the LHC but nevertheless hidden behind top-quark backgrounds.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nIntellectual Merit- This grant funded research in theoretical particle physics.  One major goal of this project was to elucidate the origin of dark matter which makes up most of the matter in our Universe, but is of an unknown particle origin.  Another goal was to develop new strategies for discovering new particles, using cosmological observations or high energy collider experiments.\n\n \n\nSeveral major achievements were reached during the course of this project.  Multiple novel mechanisms were discovered for producing dark matter in the early Universe.  These mechanisms point to new particle origins for dark matter, where dark matter has interactions with other particles that differ from previous proposals for the particle origin of dark matter.  The new dark matter models that resulted from this research can be searched for at future experiments targeting dark matter.  A second achievement was the development of probes of new particles using low energy photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background.  Outcomes of this research show how future cosmological observations can discover new particles.  A third achievement was the development of new methods for using data from high energy colliders, collected at the highest energies, to search for new physics.  This research will aid experimentalists working at the Large Hadron Collider, and future higher energy colliders, to discover new physics.\n\n \n\nBroader Impact- A major achievement of this funding was the establishment of the NYU Physics Journalism Fellowship.  This fellowship is awarded annually to a science journalism masters student from NYU\u2019s Science, Health, and Environmental Reporting program.  Awardees were funded to visit physics experiments that appeared in their stories, including the Large Hadron Collider, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array.  Resulting stories were published in Gizmodo, LiveScience, Mashable, Popular Science, and Scienceline.  The Physics Journalism Fellowship positively impacted the education of science journalism students, by giving them hands-on reporting experiences.  It also positively impacted the public at large, who were exposed to physics experiments through the resulting published stories.  As an additional Broader Impact activity, the PI gave several public lectures on dark matter during the course of this project.\n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 08/11/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Joshua Ruderman"
