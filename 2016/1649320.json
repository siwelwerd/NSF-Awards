These impending workforce demands cannot be met without developing the skills of racial and ethnic minorities: however, Hispanics and Black/African Americans make up only a small percentage of doctoral students in the United States.  The goal of the Consortium of Minority Doctoral Scholars (CMDS) Design and Development Launch Pilot is to broaden the participation of minorities in these fields.  This pilot project will create a data portal that will allow the research team to study and understand the efficacy of various mentoring strategies that might be piloted across institutions and minority doctoral scholars programs.\r\nPart II\r\nThe Consortium of Minority Doctoral Scholars (CMDS) will unite three of the nation?s oldest and most prominent minority doctoral scholars programs (GEM, SREB and McKnight); organizations with a long history of impact in increasing the numbers of minorities obtaining advanced degrees.  The CMDS Design and Development Launch Pilot will conduct extensive studies using data from these three programs.  The research team will conduct a mixed method analysis of the data to discover commonalities and distinctions about the three programs? mentoring efforts as compared to students not involved in the three programs.  This will result in a data-driven strategy for researching the efficacy of mentoring programs that can be applied across the three CMSD member and other minority doctoral scholars programs.  By utilizing data from successful programs to pinpoint effective mentoring strategies, the project will create opportunities for larger numbers of minorities to be successful.  This approach has implications not only with respect to equity and access, but also the development of a workforce that will drive future advances.",
