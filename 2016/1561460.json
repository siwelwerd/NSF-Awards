The ICRA is the preeminent international meeting in this area and this is the first time that it will be held in the United States.  The meeting will consist of two parts: a 3.5 day workshop, and a 5 day conference. The workshop will feature six speakers each giving three one-hour talks. The conference will consist of eighteen 50-minute plenary lectures, together with parallel sessions of shorter presentations. The organizers expect around 150 participants. The award will be used to support travel and lodging for the workshop and plenary speakers as well as to support other participants, particularly junior researchers and graduate students. One of the primary goals of the conference is to promote interactions with other areas of mathematics by inviting prominent mathematicians in these areas to share their ideas and results. \r\n\r\n\r\nTopics to be covered at the conference include: representations of quivers; Auslander-Reiten theory; tilting theory; homological properties of finite dimensional algebras; cluster algebras and categories; group representation theory; vector bundles on weighted projective spaces; preprojective algebras and applications of geometry to representation theory. Further information can be found at the conference website, http://icra2016.syr.edu/.",
