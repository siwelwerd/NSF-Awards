 "awd_abstract_narration": "The broader impact/commercial potential of this Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) project will be to reduce the incidence of Lyme Disease through the biomanufacturing of a novel natural acaricide.  New cases of Lyme Disease have grown by nearly 50% over the past decade while the existing synthetic acaricides are dwindling in use due to regulatory and consumer safety concerns.  The CDC and USDA have begun to champion a highly effective natural acaricide extracted from grapefruit. This target molecule is a GRAS-approved natural product, which has been used extensively as a food ingredient for decades.  It is thought that this compelling safety benefit combined with potent efficacy will spur increased spraying in public areas and private residences. However, the cost of producing this natural acaricide has been prohibitive, and there is an opportunity to develop alternative sustainable production technologies.\r\n\r\nThis SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a microbial process for the economical and sustainable production of a highly potent natural acaricide.  Increasing wariness of synthetic insecticides combined with the need to prevent tick-borne illnesses creates a tremendous opportunity for natural acaricides. The project's terpene target has long been known as a highly effective acaricide; however, its commercialization has been hampered by a high cost of production.  The aim is to develop an alternative fermentation process for biosynthetic production enabling the cost reductions required to effectively penetrate the acaricide market. The main objective for this project is to increase titers by an order of magnitude. This will be accomplished by employing established and novel metabolic and protein engineering approaches. Overall, this project will provide a new sustainable, cost-effective production route, thereby enabling acaricide commercialization.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nThrough this NSF SBIR Phase I-funded research project, we have successfully completed proof-of-concept demonstration of a sustainable and economical production route to a novel, natural acaricide through microbial fermentation.  This was accomplished by applying proprietary technologies in both protein engineering and metabolic engineering to a) increase the performance of plant biosynthetic enzymes in vivo in microbial systems and b) enable high flux and yields into the main biosynthetic pathway.  Together, these results led to a more than order of magnitude increase in the biosynthesis of the target product. Furthermore, scale-up experiments demonstrated the translation of strain performance to environments relevant for commercial-scale manufacturing.  As such, the work accomplished here clearly paves the way for further development and commercialization of a natural and safe acaricidal product.  This product presents an opportunity to reduce the current $1.3 billion annual cost to the US health care system for the diagnosis and treatment of tick-borne diseases, such as Lyme disease.\n\nWe note that employing microbial fermentation for producing plant natural ingredients also offers a host of societal benefits, including: (a) improving public health (b) creating manufacturing jobs in the US, and (c) developing scientific innovations. Domestic production will promote rural development, as industrial fermentation facilities are typically located in agricultural areas and create jobs for potentially thousands (plant technicians, feedstock growers, construction workers).
