 "awd_abstract_narration": "An award is made to Kennesaw State University (KSU) to fund an electrophoretic nucleic acids analyzer and accessories for the use in multidisciplinary research and research training. Electrophoresis is the primary means of analyzing nucleic acids, separating nucleic acids based on their size and, to a lesser extent, conformation. Through an electrophoretic analysis, critical qualitative and quantitative information regarding the composition of a nucleic acid sample can be obtained. The nucleic acid analyzer will be part of the existing massively parallel / next generation sequencing facility, including an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine semiconductor sequencer (PI Van Dyke), thereby significantly expanding facility capabilities. Primary benefits will be in research, including projects involving undergraduate and graduate (Master of Science in Integrative Biology, Master of Science in Chemical Sciences) students. Additionally, programs that enhance research access to under-represented populations, including KSU's NIH-funded Peach State Bridges to the Doctorate and NSF-funded Chemistry and Biochemistry Summer Undergraduate Research Experiences programs, will benefit from this instrumentation. Involvement of the facility with course curricula is also planned, especially given the increasing importance of next-generation sequencing and transcriptome analysis in both health-related and research fields. Hands-on training in the technology used for contemporary nucleic acid sample quality control will better prepare KSU trainees for a broad range of STEM careers.\r\n\r\nAn electrophoretic nucleic acids analyzer provides automated sample processing and scalable throughput for a variety of DNA and RNA quality control applications. For example, they are routinely used to determine the integrity of genomic DNA samples before their use in involved and costly procedures such as next generation sequencing, microarrays, and quantitative PCR. The nucleic acids analyzer will be used initially by a core group of five laboratories at KSU and their collaborators. Dr. Michael Van Dyke investigates orphan transcriptional regulators in a variety of organisms, including E. coli and Thermus thermophilus. Dr. Martin Hudson studies the role of heparan sulfate proteoglycans and anosmin-like proteins in nervous system development, using C. elegans and stem cell models of nervous system differentiation. Dr. Joel McNeal investigates photosynthetic gene evolution, host/parasite interactions, and microbial endophytes in the parasitic plant genus Cuscuta. Dr. Melanie Griffin studies the global targets of the leucine response protein in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Dr. Marcus Davis explores the developmental mechanisms that pattern vertebrate appendages (fins and limbs) and the evolution of HOX gene regulation. Nucleic acids analysis will provide their materials, ranging from combinatorially selected fusion libraries to developmental stage-selected RNAs, with essential quality control assessments, thereby increasing the likelihood of success in their research and teaching endeavors.",
