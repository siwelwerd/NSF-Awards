 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project aims to address whether Escherichia from watersheds can serve as a reservoir for horizontal gene transfer to host-associated strains such as Escherichia coli, which is a known source of human infections.  Watersheds can become contaminated with Escherichia via treated sewage, livestock farming, wild animals, fowl, and sediment runoff from urban and agricultural environments. Several studies revealed that Escherichia may adapt and persist in these environments, and eventually may be able to pass the genes for new traits to host-associated strains such as Escherichia coli.  In addition to examining this idea, the data from this study will allow the broader scientific community to evaluate existing water quality monitoring methods. The research for this project will be integrated into authentic research experiences for undergraduate students in STEM fields through course-based research experiences (CREs).  In particular, undergraduates in first year and upper level laboratories will actively participate in all aspects of the project.\r\n\r\nThis project focuses on two related scientific goals: 1) characterizing genomic diversity of environmentally derived Escherichia isolates to understand variation in naturally occurring populations over time; and 2) linking profiles of 16S community surveys to observed variation in Escherichia isolate genomes and to environmental changes in a watershed. Remarkable genetic diversity has been characterized by global studies of E. coli through analysis of representative fully sequenced genomes, and targeted studies of pathogen sub-types through hundreds of draft genome sequences of clinical isolates. The preponderance of genomic data is from clinical and host-associated environments. This project produces 720 draft genome sequences of environmentally derived Escherichia isolates. The longitudinal data enable testing hypotheses about genome structure and genetic exchange in naturally occurring, non-host-associated populations through comparative genomics of genome content, arrangement and single nucleotide polymorphisms. The data address long term persistence of Escherichia populations in non-host environments, potentially serving as reservoirs for genetic exchange and renewal of fecal indicator bacteria in bodies of water. Oligotyping will estimate diversity in the Escherichia populations; water samples will produce coupled isolate genome sequences and microbial community 16S rRNA sequences. It is asserted that single nucleotide changes in 16S rRNA represent diversity of genome structure; the data will be used to test this assertion. Fine scale sampling produces longitudinal 16S rRNA microbial community profiles used to understand changes in Escherichia and other microbial populations. Work linking 16S rRNA variation to genome variation enables prediction of population changes based on 16S rRNA surveys alone. High quality recreational and drinking water sources are essential for society, and as water quality monitoring shifts to molecular based approaches, the types of datasets produced here become critical to ascertaining effective and broadly applicable monitoring techniques. A third goal fully incorporates undergraduate students in STEM fields through individual and course-based research experiences (CREs). Over 100 students in courses will gain first-hand knowledge of authentic research. The effectiveness of these experiences will be assessed through convergent mixed methods approaches designed to gauge student attitudes toward STEM fields, comparing effects of individual research experiences and CREs on first year and upper level students.",

This is, in part, due to the clinical significance of many <em>E. coli</em> strains, leading to tens of thousands of available genome sequences, but also to the broad genetic diversity that is observed among these strains. For example, when the full genome sequence of <em>E. coli</em><em> </em>O157:H7 was published, a type of <em>E. coli </em>typically associated with foodborne outbreaks, it surprisingly contained over 1 million bases of DNA in a 5 million base genome that are not found in laboratory strains of the model organism - fully 20% of the genome is different. Extensive work has occurred to date to characterize the extent of variation seen in isolates of <em>E. coli</em> from host-associated environments around the world, challenging the notion of <em>E. coli</em> as being a relatively simple, model species of bacteria. However, none of these studies has assessed naturally occurring, non-host-associated populations of the genus <em>Escherichia</em> in a systematic, in-depth manner. <strong>Intellectual Merit: </strong>Thus, questions arise as to the extent of habitats for <em>Escherichia</em> strains and the extent to which there are non-host-associated reservoirs for these bacteria that could provide opportunity for genetic exchange and evolution of the diversity of strains observed in the genus. Further, current observations of genome evolution in the genus may be intrinsically biased by the heavy focus on clinical isolates. In this study, we began to address this knowledge gap through long term, high frequency sampling of the Macatawa Watershed (Holland, MI, USA) to characterize microbial populations associated with the rivers and lake in the watershed. The watershed is hypereutrophic, having very high levels of phosphorous and nitrate contamination due to agricultural activity and urbanization and historically high levels of <em>E. coli</em>. We have isolated over 8000 strains of freshwater derived <em>Escherichia</em> strains and sequenced the genomes of over 700 of these isolates. In addition, we have used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize the bacterial communities in over 2100 water samples. These isolates and community data represent a significant increase in publicly available, non-host associated <em>Escherichia</em> genomes and longitudinal bacterial community profiles of recreational water bodies with high resolution (weekly) sampling throughout all seasons. The freshwater <em>E. coli</em> population includes isolates from all known phylogroups of <em>Escherichia</em>, with over 50% of strains being from phylogroup B1. Unique gene content is associated with all isolates from the watershed. Experimental characterization of the <em>E. coli</em> strains demonstrated that all strains are capable of growth below 11?C with some strains capable of growth at 2?C, consistent with environmental adaptation of freshwater strains to water temperatures near freezing. Additionally, we determined antibiotic resistance profiles for freshwater strains in collaboration with a local health care system. On average, each strain was resistant to two antibiotics; resistance to tetracycline, used extensively in agricultural animal production, was the most frequent phenotype observed. Comparative genomics suggests that presence of known antibiotic resistance mechanisms, however, it does not account for all resistances observed. Machine learning prediction of antibiotic resistances for the freshwater strains suggests the existence of novel genetic loci and possible novel mechanisms of resistance in this population. Bacterial communities in the rivers and streams show seasonal variation that is consistent across years. Winter and Summer bacterial communities are highly distinct from one another; cyanobacterial blooms occur in Lake Macatawa each year and are associated with genera adapted to low light conditions. This is consistent with high turbidity found in Lake Macatawa as part of the high sediment loading associated with upstream agricultural activity. <strong>Broader Impacts: </strong>The research has been conducted as part of course-based undergraduate research (CREs) and undergraduate research programs at Hope College.
