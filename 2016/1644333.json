 "awd_abstract_narration": "A graph signal is a signal in which relationships between its components follows the structure encoded in a weighted graph. The purpose of graph signal processing is to exploit this underlying structure to analyze and process graph signals. The last few years have seen significant progress in the development of theory, tools, and applications of graph signal processing. The Graph Signal Processing (GSP) Workshop is a forum intended to disseminate ideas to a broader audience and to exchange ideas and experiences on the future path of this emerging field. \r\n\r\nThe main goal of the funds requested in this proposal is to facilitate the participation of students by providing a limited number of travel grants. The recipients of the travel awards will be selected by the organizing committee among students who apply for them and who are principal authors of papers presented at the workshop. These awards will be based on merit (e.g. novelty of the research) but also on distance. We expect to provide a $500 travel awards to 20 students.",
