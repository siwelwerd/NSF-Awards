 "awd_abstract_narration": "A surface is a space which looks locally like the 2-dimensional plane, e.g. the surface of a basketball or a pretzel. Surfaces arise naturally in many scientific fields. A geometric structure is a way of measuring distances and angles on a surface or more complicated object. Studying spaces of geometric structures (or shapes) on a fixed object gives further information about their nature. The classical Teichmuller theory studies a space which parametrizes certain geometric structures (of constant curvature) on a fixed surface. Teichmuller theory has impacted diverse areas in mathematics, including algebraic geometry, complex analysis, low-dimensional topology, and dynamics, as well as theoretical physics through its connections with string theory. A metric on Teichmuller space is a way of measuring the distance, or difference, between two such geometric structures. The PIs plan to study metrics on a generalization of this theory called Higher Teichmuller Theory. Higher Teichmuller spaces may be viewed as deformation spaces of geometric structures on higher-dimensional spaces. It shares some of the nice properties of the classical theory and has become a very active field of research. The PIs will mentor graduate students who will be engaged in aspects of the project. They will also run a program which helps science and engineering students from low-resource high schools transition to college studies. \r\n\r\nHigher Teichmuller theory studies spaces of \"geometric\" representations of a hyperbolic group into a semi-simple Lie group. The main goal is to develop a theory which shares the richness, beauty and versatility of classical Teichmuller theory. The Higher theory has exploded in popularity because of the interactions it fosters between the subjects of geometric topology, real and complex differential geometry, Lie theory, algebraic geometry, string theory, and dynamics. Bridgeman, Canary, Labourie and Sambarino used thermodynamic formalism to construct a pressure metric on many higher Teichmuller spaces which is motivated by Thurston's definition of the Weil-Petersson metric on Teichmuller space (and its reformulations by Bonahon and McMullen). In the special case of the Hitchin component, the pressure metric is a mapping class group invariant, analytic Riemannian metric whose restriction to the Fuchsian locus is a multiple of the Weil-Petersson metric. Wolf developed an analogous approach to the Weil-Petersson metric, and has results on the isometry group and curvature of the Weil-Petersson metric, degeneration of hyperbolic structures, and on harmonic maps (Hitchin equations) approaches to Teichmuller theory. Wentworth has worked on the pressure metric, Weil-Petersson geometry, Higgs bundles and harmonic maps. The PIs together propose to study the isometry group, curvature and metric completion of both the pressure metric and variants on Hitchin components and quasifuchsian spaces, aiming to understand the pressure metric on general higher Teichmuller spaces.",

They come in a variety of shapes and often those  shapes reflect media in which the surfaces are found. Much of the  intellectual work of this project is to mathematically describe the  total collection of the geometries that surfaces may have.\n \n To this goal, we add a new ingredient. The space that we live in is  quite symmetric: if we had no landmarks or gravity to guide us, the  world would look the same no matter which way we turned our head.  The  surface of the earth has a separate, spherical symmetry: because the  earth is round, we perceive a different symmetry.  It turns out that there is a vast abundance of distinct ambient spaces with quite different symmetries. This research is  related to describing the collection of geometries that a surface may  have and how they relate to the symmetries of the space in which they  may live.  Moreover, we are often interested in shapes that are most  efficient in some ways, in the sense that if they were made of some  flexible material but required to contain some obstacles, they they  would stretch in some ways characteristic of the required constraints  and reflecting the symmetries of the space containing them.\n \n We completed a number of projects that elaborated on these general  themes.  Most of our work described images of surfaces that were  required to have least energy among candidates that were all constrained  similarly.  We then imagined the outcomes when the constraints were  allowed to become extreme: in that case, dominant geometries on the  highly energetic surfaces emerged that quite simply reflected the  constraints.  \n \n This sort of analysis had impacts across subfields in mathematics.   There are mathematicians that study the space of shapes of surfaces in  topological ways, using sophisticated algebraic methods, and there are  mathematicians that study the same space in analytic ways, using quite  technical extensions of calculus in their investigations.  Much of our  work aims to unite these perspectives, creating a weak dictionary  between perspectives.  The value of this is that results that are  expected from one point-of-view can be surprises in the other.\n \n While engaged in the pursuit of these intellectual objectives, we  involve and train young people who then enter the scientific workforce.
