 "awd_abstract_narration": "Abstract\r\nNontechnical:\r\nOrganic Transistors hold the promise of enabling flexible and low-cost electronics. One of the latest additions to this field is the Organic Permeable Base Transistor. Only recently has it been found that Organic Permeable Base Transistors reach very high output currents and operate at very low driving voltages. However, until now this excellent performance has come at the expense of significant base currents leading to static power losses and ruling out the use of Organic Permeable Base Transistors in most cases.\r\nThe project addresses this challenge. The origin of base currents is studied and approaches to suppress them are tested. If successful, the project will increase the switching speed of organic transistors by an order of magnitude, which will accelerate commercialization of flexible electronics. Additionally, the reduction of base currents of Organic Permeable Base Transistors will open new fields of application such as flexible backplanes for active matrix displays.\r\nTo broaden the impact of the project, additional measures aim at leveraging the research and using it as a vehicle to improve STEM education. The PI will develop courses targeted at high school teachers offering \"College Credit Plus\" classes. These \"College Credit Plus\" classes allow high school students to earn college credit early and free of cost, which has the potential to increase the enrollment in STEM degrees. Furthermore, selected work-packages of the proposal will be offered as Senior Honors Project to a student majoring in physics and mathematics. Furthermore, graduate students will be trained in a socially important research area, which will make them part of a globally competitive workforce. Students will participate in a summer school jointly organized with Case Western Reserve University providing them with all necessary background in organic semiconductors, device physics, and device engineering.\r\nTechnical:\r\nThe goal of this project is to unravel the origin of base currents in Organic Permeable Base Transistors. The specific research objectives are a) to prove that a drift-diffusion simulation of the device can quantitatively reproduce the device behavior, in particular the magnitude of base currents and b) to test the hypothesis that a self-assembled monolayer on top of the base electrode can significantly reduce base leakage currents.\r\nA quantitative agreement between the drift-diffusion simulation and experiment will be reached by a thorough characterization of the morphology of the base electrode and of the charge transport in all layers of the Organic Permeable Base Transistor. In particular, the growth of the porous base electrode and the nature of base currents will be studied by scanning probe methods, transmission electron microscopy, and electrical characterization of test devices. Self-organized layers of insulating phosphonic acids will be grown on top of the base. Charge transport across these layers will be quantified and modeled, leading to a concise description of Organic Permeable Base Transistors operating at significantly increased current amplification and thus lower static power dissipation.\r\nAs a result of the project, an experimentally validated model of the Organic Permeable Base Transistor will become available to the scientific community, which will significantly enhance the fundamental understanding of the device and will enable a rational design of Organic Permeable Base Transistors. Furthermore, the project will increase the knowledge on vertical charge transport in poly-crystalline organic films and will provide detailed charge carrier mobility models for standard materials used in Organic Permeable Base Transistors. Clarifying the nature of base currents will improve the understanding of injection into a disordered organic semiconductor and will lead to a quantitative description of injection from oxidized aluminum into the organic semiconductor C60.",

Among all flexible transistor technologies, Organic Permeable Base Transistors (OPBTs, Figure 1) are a strong contender. It was shown that OPBTs can reach a high performance, i.e. they are fast (in the 10 MHz regime) and operate at very low driving voltages. However, until now this excellent performance has come at the expense of significant base currents leading to static power dissipation, which makes a realistic use of OPBTs in larger circuits challenging.</p>\n<p>This grant has provided funding to study the origin of these increased base currents and to find approaches to limit them. We have implemented a numerical device model that is capable of quantitatively describing base currents as tunnel currents through a thin oxide layer covering the base electrode. We have shown that base currents can be reduced by increasing the thickness of the oxide layer. Indeed, we could reduce the base currents in our experiments by annealing the transistors in ambient conditions, which is expected to increase the thickness of the oxide layer and which increases the ON/OFF switching ratio of OPBTs.</p>\n<p>In most OPBTs described in the literature, the oxide layer covering the base electrode is grown by a short air exposure after processing the base electrode. This method is not sufficient to grow a dense oxide layer. To improve the quality of the oxide, we have studied an electrochemical anodization process that results in a good control of the oxide thickness, high quality oxide films, and low leakage currents flowing through the oxide (Figure 2a). Most importantly, we have shown that the organic semiconductor is not significantly harmed by the additional anodization step in acidic solutions. Consequently, base currents drop significantly leading to a large current amplification in these OPBTs (Figure 2b).</p>\n<p>Based on these results, we obtained OPBTs with excellent performance. Scaling down the device area led to devices with an ON/OFF switching ratio of almost 10<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>(Figure 3a), a transconductance of 45 Scm<sup>-2&nbsp;</sup>(Figure 3b), and a current amplification of up to 10<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>(Figure 2b). Unfortunately, these performance values are not reached in the same device, and OPBTs with a higher current amplification tend to show a lower transconductance. Therefore, in future studies, a compromise between transconductance (corresponding to a high switching speed) and current amplification (corresponding to low static power dissipation) has to be found.</p>\n<p>In subsequent studies, we used a numerical 2D OPBT model to understand the origin of the large transconductance values observed in OPBTs. We showed that OPBTs are much less influenced by contact barriers at the source electrode than other thin-film transistors. Furthermore, we studied the stability of these transistors under stress and found base-bias stress effects similar to conventional organic field-effect transistors. Additionally, we explained the origin of the (weak) collector current saturation observed in OPBTs with the help of the numeric device model, which will help to improve the saturation in these devices in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, funding by this grant helped to develop a better understanding of the device physics of OPBTs, which in turn was used to increase their performance. A performance level was reached that make OPBTs promising for low cost or flexible applications requiring high frequencies and/or high driving currents.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Apart of the intellectual merit of the project, it provided resources to train graduate and undergraduate students. One student trained by this project has been recruited as physics faculty in his home country. Furthermore, with the help of the ASSURE program at Kent State, a student from a minority serving institution was hosted in our lab, and was later admitted into the graduate program of Kent State. In collaboration with the School of Fashion and Design at Kent State University, we took part in the demonstrator competition of the Organic Electronics Association to showcase our technology to a broader audience (Figure 4).
