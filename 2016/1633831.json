 "awd_abstract_narration": "Growing demand for food, energy, and water and increasing stresses on these resources have created critical needs at the food, energy, and water nexus. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to the University of Montana will address global challenges and national needs by training a network of STEM graduate students to contribute to more sustainable and secure food, energy, and water systems in a range of careers. The University of Montana NRT program will train the next generation of scholars and practitioners by teaching graduate students how to bridge the divides needed to advance innovations at the nexus of food, energy, and water systems. Graduates will be prepared to bridge divides across sectors within the food/energy/water nexus; scales, from local to global; disciplines, including physical, biological, and social sciences; science, practice, and policy to ensure decision-relevant science and science-informed practice; and audiences, to communicate effectively across diverse constituencies and multiple platforms. The project anticipates training forty-eight (48) MS and PhD students, including twenty-eight (28) funded trainees, from the biological, physical, and social sciences. An additional seventy-five (75) STEM graduate students will participate in specific program elements alongside the forty-eight (48) NRT trainees.  \r\n\r\nThe University of Montana NRT will be built around a set of linked training elements and research initiatives. Integrative, interdisciplinary campus and field-based coursework will develop core knowledge at the food/energy/water nexus and translational skills. In addition, internships and international experiences will bridge science and practice, collaborative lab experiences will build interdisciplinary skills, and workshops will build cutting-edge quantitative, computational, and digital communication expertise. These training elements will connect evidence-based educational activities to program goals and use rigorous assessment and adaptive learning to ensure success. Trainee research will examine and address critical food, energy and water problems through decision-relevant science that addresses land use, climate change, uncertainty, governance, and adaptability. Four broad research themes will be targeted: (1) tradeoffs between food, energy, and water in river and rangeland systems; (2) energy transitions, fossil-fuel switching, and the implications for agriculture and water; (3) agricultural system resilience in the face of drought and climate-variability; and (4) tribal and indigenous issues at the food/energy/water nexus. \r\n\r\nThe NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The Traineeship Track is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary research areas, through the comprehensive traineeship model that is innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.",
