 "awd_abstract_narration": "The IEEE Radar Conference is an annual flagship conference on radar sponsored by the IEEE Aerospace and Electronic Systems Society.  The 2016 IEEE Radar Conference will be held in Philadelphia, PA from May 2 to May 6, 2016.  Approximately 500 attendees are expected.  This NSF grant will provide partial travel support for graduate students to present their work at the conference, network with colleagues, and gain exposure to the latest research activities in radar signal processing and radar system development.  The travel grants will be awarded competitively to graduate students from US universities who will be presenting papers at the conference.  The conference organizing committee has pledged to match NSF support on a one-to-one basis using funds from corporate sponsors.  This NSF grant will benefit early-career US researchers by enabling them to gain experience in presenting their work at a top-tier conference, to learn about the latest developments in radar research and emerging applications, and to network with the international radar community that can lead to future collaboration opportunities.  Encouraging graduate student participation could have a significant impact on radar research in US institutions in not only traditional defense-related applications, but also emerging civil and commercial applications, including automotive collision avoidance, medical diagnostics, and non-invasive patient monitoring.",
