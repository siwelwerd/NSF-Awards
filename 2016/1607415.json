 "awd_abstract_narration": "Gamma-rays are the highest energy form of electromagnetic radiation.  Observations of astrophysical gamma-rays serve as probes of physical conditions and processes in the most extreme environments throughout the Universe, and can be used to test fundamental physics.  The High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, located on the slopes of the Sierra Negra in Mexico, is a ground-based facility designed with unique capabilities to observe very high-energy gamma-rays.  This award supports scientists at Michigan Technological University doing research with HAWC.  In addition to hardware and service activities to support HAWC operations, the group will analyze HAWC data to study the origin of cosmic rays.  The group will engage in education and outreach activities, including the University's Summer Youth Program for high-school students. \r\n\r\nHigh-energy gamma-rays are produced when cosmic rays interact with their local environment, interstellar matter and radiation fields.  As neutral particles these gamma-rays can be traced back to their origin and used to provide critical information on the origin of cosmic rays.  The Michigan group will perform detailed studies of point, extended, and diffuse Galactic gamma-ray source emission, including studies of the morphology and spectral energy distributions to study the origin of cosmic rays.  The results using data from the HAWC Observatory will complement and can be combined with measurements by other space and ground-based gamma-ray observatories.",
