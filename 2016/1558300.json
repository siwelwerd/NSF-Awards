Additionally, tropical landscapes are undergoing rapid changes due to both climate change and deforestation. The effects of these changes on water and biogeochemical processes, at a range of scales, are large but poorly understood.  This Chapman Conference will examine current understanding of tropical ecohydrology and identify critical research needs in tropical systems.\r\n\r\nThis Chapman Conference on \"Emerging Issues in Tropical Ecohydrology\" meeting will be held in Ceunca, Ecuador with three days of meetings and one day of field work.  Themes will include (1) the influence of ecosystem degradation and recovery; (2) ecohydrological approaches and techniques for linking plant ecophysiological responses with watershed hydrology; (3) new concepts related to mechanistic assessment of the water balance across scales and across biomes (e.g., distributed modeling); (4) new techniques for measuring plant- and stream-water fluxes (e.g., stable isotopes, dendrochronology, sapflow, remote sensing, eddy covariance, distributed modeling); and (5) methods for building explicit linkages between ecophysiologists and ecohydrologists.  The conference will result in a set of synthesis papers that lay out critical questions for ecohydrological research in the tropics and a cohesive strategy for addressing the most urgent ecohydrology research needs.",

Thank to support from the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy and the University of Cuenca nearly 40 early career scientists were able to attend the meeting.  The meeting was successful in fulfilling two of its main goals which were to (1) examine our current understanding of tropical ecohydrology and identifying critical research needs and (2) to foster greater interdisciplinary collaboration across the spectrum of ecological and hydrological sciences, in particular the disciplinary ties between ecophysiologists and catchment hydrologists. \n\nThe meeting was organized around three main themes with (usually) four invited speakers per theme and day, the main themes being (i) the coupling of plant physiology and watershed hydrological functioning, (ii) scaling issues, and (iii) impacts of land degradation and rehabilitation / recovery.

There is tremendous opportunity to better link ecohydrology with ecophysiology in the tropics especially in regard to collecting empirical data from the field.

Currently the two fields are still \"worlds apart\" with ecophysiology using rudimentary hydrological approaches and hydrology using rudimentary ecophysiological approaches.  Given the limited information in the tropics a recommended strategy would be to balance longterm data collection with strategically targeted experiments particularly in regard to the use of stable isotopes.  In addition, inter-comparision watershed studies could be of great value.  Researchers in the tropics need to be especially sensitive to the need for collecting information that is of broad relevance and that can be used to aid in decision making.\n\nDuring break out meetings, participants were challenged to develop joint papers synthesizing important and emerging areas in tropical ecohydrology.  Several potential themes were identified to be further developed and published in a subsequent special issue.  Reflecting the diversity of the attendees the themes were quite diverse and included issues related to disturbance, plant invasions, soil fauna, optimal data collection strategies, influence of microtopography , and watershed market strategies.\n\nProbably the most important outcome of the conference was beyond the science in that it brought together so many scientists, especially young scientists, from across the globe who have forged what will be long-lived and productive relationships.
