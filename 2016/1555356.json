 "awd_abstract_narration": "Non-technical Abstract\r\nThe combination of hard materials (ceramics or semiconductors) and soft materials (polymers) into a single construct enables technologies (e.g., soft electronics and low-cost sensors) with new forms and functions that promise to broadly impact areas such as health care, consumer electronics, and public safety; however, combining materials with such disparate properties (thermal, mechanical, chemical, etc.) directly into hybrid structures is challenging.  In this project the research team investigates dynamic solution- and surface-chemical processes that provide new methods for the controlled synthesis of crystalline materials and their direct integration with soft materials yielding hybrid structures with useful properties (e.g., optical, electrical, etc.).  In complimentary activities, the principal investigator uses the methods and outcomes of the research activities in the creation of new educational curriculum and outreach activities that strengthen the tradition of innovation and the participation of underrepresented groups (especially Native American youths) in materials science in Nebraska.\r\n  \r\nTechnical Abstract\r\nWith the support of the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research and the EPSCoR program, this project seeks to generate new approaches to controlling crystal growth that enable the direct fabrication of hybrid structures which combine soft materials with complex, three-dimensional, inorganic materials.  Such seamless integration of components with exceedingly different properties (thermal and mechanical) cannot be achieved using traditional microfabrication.  This project includes the following specific goals: (i) Utilize mechanical deformations of chemically functionalized soft polymers to actively control the synthesis, assembly, and 2D organization of hard materials enabling the fabrication of hybrid structures with reconfigurable properties.  (ii) Synthesize hierarchical, 3D crystal morphologies and hybrid materials using the effects of flowing liquids in soft reactors.  The approaches to controlling crystal growth under investigation emphasize dynamic manipulation of physical variables surface chemistry and fluid flow that go beyond those available in systems which use rigid materials or static conditions.  Specifically, the deformation of elastomeric substrates provides a convenient way to reversibly change surface chemistry and manipulate the spatial organization of crystals; the flow of liquids in reactors can simultaneously tune the chemical and fluid-mechanical environments of crystals.  These research activities contribute significantly to the realization of new, additive approaches to the direct production of functional, hybrid materials with applications in existing and emerging technologies including, microelectronics, energy, and soft, stretchable, and flexible electronics and sensors.",

The education component of this project included training/mentorship through unique multi-disciplinary research opportunities and the development of new curriculum in the nano/microscale fabrication of hard and soft material.\n\nOutcomes Related to Intellectual Merit. This research project set out to investigate crystal growth in dynamic chemical environments by systematically varying the surface and solution conditions in which nucleation and growth occurred.  The emphasis on dynamic manipulation of physical variables?surface chemistry and fluid flow?promised to offer the community a set of new capabilities that go beyond those available using traditional methods which rely on static processing conditions.  The outcome was two fundamentally new approaches for the generation of systematically tunable dynamic chemical environments directly applicable to controlling crystal growth and more generally the creation of structures with adaptive physical properties.  The first approach enabled reversibly switchable surface chemistry using stretchable polymers.  In a series of peer-reviewed publications the research team demonstrated the basic principles of reversible surface chemistry using stretchable silicone rubbers and illustrated how this material provided conveniently tunable properties (e.g., wettability) applicable to the control of crystal growth, thin film formation, and liquid droplet organization/manipulation.

The new \"soft\" microfabrication tools for controlling crystal morphology and the integration of soft materials with hard materials developed throughout this project will provide new, additive approaches to material synthesis, which promise \"green\" manufacturing alternatives that will benefit society by enhancing sustainability and product innovation.  Further, this project partially supported seven PhD students (six graduated during the project period and one, a women PhD candidate, will graduate within 1.5 years of the project end date).  The graduates now occupy positions in industry within the U.S. and at U.S.-based startup companies. The mentorship and training they received throughout this project directly contributed to their development and competitiveness in the R&amp;D workforce.\n\nThis project supported the development of a new innovative graduate-level course on soft/hard material fabrication aimed at increasing cross-disciplinary engagement.  It was developed and conducted three separate occasions during the project period with total enrollment of 34 PhD students.  The course has had strong representation from several academic units (e.g., Chemistry, Materials Science, Food Science, and Bioengineering), an outcome consistent with one of the major goals of the course.       \n\nThe major educational outreach activities of this project focused on the development of hands-on workshops aimed at engaging Native American youths in STEM using 3D printing and soft fabrication.

External evaluation of the team's efforts (including pre- and post-activity surveys and participant interviews) indicated that the workshop was generally well liked and inclusive of the target groups.  The team will use these critical data and early successes to improve the workshop's impact and broaden its reach in the future.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 06/29/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Stephen Morin"
