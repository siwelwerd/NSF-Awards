 "awd_abstract_narration": "In recent years, high dimensional statistics has focused on methods of alleviating the curse of dimensionality, which refers to various inconvenient phenomena that arise when analyzing data in high-dimensional spaces. One assumption that facilitates this is the Manifold hypothesis: that data lie in the vicinity of a low dimensional manifold. For example, if we randomly photograph a large number of objects, randomly choose three-by-three pixel patches, and plot the corresponding points in nine-dimensional space, we approximately see a Klein bottle, which is a two dimensional manifold. This could be due to the generating process possessing only a few essential degrees of freedom. Manifold learning is a collection of methodologies for analyzing high dimensional data based on the Manifold hypothesis. This has been an area of intense activity over the past two decades. In work with Fefferman and Mitter, the foundation for a novel approach to Manifold learning has been established. The present project is concerned with using this approach for the building of practically and theoretically efficient algorithms to fit a manifold to data, given that the data lie near a manifold.\r\n\r\nCurrent approaches which attempt to build a manifold with some guarantees of success, either forgo the smoothness assumption or are restrictive in some way. In the work with Fefferman and Mitter new techniques based on fiber bundles have been developed and formally justified to verify in finite time whether there is a manifold of bounded reach lying near the data. Since this is an exhaustive process, the algorithm is extremely slow. However, when the data is actually from a manifold with perhaps some corruption by noise, our approach has sufficiently powerful techniques which can be modified and adopted to construct an approximation of the manifold in near linear time on the size of the data. The feasibility of the method has been tested experimentally through implementation of the algorithm on simple examples. Theoretical guarantees of speed will be provided for these algorithms as part of this project and the algorithms will be shown to be practical. At a broader level, we would like to introduce ideas from Whitney interpolation to statistics and engineering.",

Whether the hypothesis that data lie near a manifold be tested efficiently is a basic question. In [5], it was shown that the number of samples and the number of computations, (in a model where computing an inner product requires a unit cost,) needed to test whether a probability distribution supported in a unit ball in R^n for large n has a mean-squared distance of less than epsilon from a low dimensional manifold is independent of n, where the test is for manifolds that have bounded curvature and volume.

In order to improve this bound, a more restrictive setting was considered in [3]. The setting is as follows. Suppose data belonging to a high dimensional Euclidean space is drawn independently, identically distributed from a measure supported on a low dimensional twice differentiable embedded manifold M, and corrupted by a small amount of gaussian noise. How can we produce a manifold Mo whose Hausdorff distance to M is small and whose reach is not much smaller than the reach of M? In [3] we show that a Hausdorff distance of O(&sigma;) can be achieved using a number of computations that depends only singly exponentially on the intrinsic dimension, where &sigma; is the standard deviation of the Gaussian. This has recently been improved to O(&sigma;^2 ) in [4]. In the setting where the manifold is C^k , whether a bound of O(&sigma;^k) on the Hausdorff distance can be achieved is an interesting question. In [1], the problem of reconstructing a Riemannian manifold from pairwise distance measurements on a fine net of a manifold was considered. Such questions are encountered in differential geometry and in many inverse problems encountered in applications. The determination of a Riemannian manifold includes the construction of its topology, differentiable structure, and metric. Constructive solutions have been given to the above problems. Algorithmic procedures have been developed that solve the geometric Whitney problem for a metric space and the manifold reconstruction problem in Euclidean space, and estimate the computational complexity of these procedures. The results for Riemannian manifolds are based on a generalisation of the Whitney embedding construction where approximative coordinate charts are embedded in R m and interpolated to a smooth submanifold.
