 "awd_abstract_narration": "Newton's constant, G, is the fundamental constant which determines the attractive gravitational force between masses.  It is by far the least well known of the fundamental constants of nature.  Disturbingly, measurements of G in recent decades by laboratories world-wide have yielded numerical values which differ among themselves by far more than their assigned uncertainties.  In response to this situation a week-long \"Ideas Lab\" is to be conducted at NIST (National Institute of Science and Technology) to bring together scientists from a wide range of scientific disciplines to explore ways to make a new definitive and accurate measurement of this fundamental constant.  The best ideas so developed will be incorporated in proposals for anticipated NSF funding.  As our understanding of theoretical physics advances it is likely that there will come a time when an accurately known value of G will test theories that attempt to unify gravitation with quantum theory. In the meantime, understanding the subtleties involved in precisely and absolutely measuring a small force is important for many fields of physics and metrology. Indeed, the disagreement of recently measured G values suggests the remote possibility of fundamentally misunderstood properties of the instruments used to measure them, whose understanding could have important consequences for physical theories.\r\n\r\nAn NSF \"Ideas Lab\", Measuring \"Big G\" Challenge, is to be held July 18-22, 2016 at NIST's Gaithersburg facility. Participants drawn from a wide range of scientific disciplines will work together to explore ways to make new definitive measurements of Newton's fundamental constant G. The most promising ideas will lead to collaborative proposals to NSF for funding.  The initial NSF grant will cover registration, travel and lodging for about 20 Lab participants (15 invited participants plus 5 Director(s) and Mentors) and registration. These expenditures will be administered by the University of California, Irvine.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nNSF Ideas Laboratory at NIST: Measuring \"Big G\" Challenge\n\nProject Outcomes Report\n\nNewton?s gravitational constant G is by far the least well determined of all fundamental constants of nature, excepting the strong (hadronic) coupling constant.\n\nWhat is worse, measured values of G found in the past 30 years by highly respected research groups worldwide are in dramatic disagreement with one another.  While the relative uncertainties of some measurements are below 20 ppm, the range of these measurements is more than 500 ppm.\n\nThis sorry situation was the motivation for this NSF \"Ideas Lab\".  The Ideas Lab, held July 18-22, 2016 at NIST?s Gaithersburg facility, brought together participants from diverse scientific disciplines to engender fresh thinking and to explore new approaches to finding a value for G that will be both precise and accurate.   Sixteen applicants for the Ideas Lab were accepted, all whom but one participated.  Proposals developed here were to be considered for NSF funding. \n\nThree primary and two secondary \"mentors\" helped structure, and participated in, the general discussion.  In the first days of the lab, participants broke into arbitrarily-composed subgroups to exchange general ideas for new approaches to the measurement of G.  In the following days participants formed teams, each of which was to draft a rough proposal for work they would propose to undertake.  This led to six proposals, involving all but one of the participants.\n\nImmediately following the Ideas Lab the three primary mentors evaluated the  proposals.  Based on their  recommendations  NSF invited three of the teams to submit a formal fully-developed proposal to NSF for funding.   \n\n \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 09/02/2017\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Riley D Newman"
