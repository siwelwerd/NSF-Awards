 "awd_abstract_narration": "The award will support a series of experiments aimed at understanding fundamental properties of a unique state of matter, a \"dusty\" or \"complex\" plasma, which is an ionized gas consisting of ions, electrons, and small particulate matter (dust or ice) that is typically much smaller than the width of a human hair.   In space, examples of dusty plasmas include the clouds from which stars and planets form, comet tails, planetary rings and noctilucent clouds in the Earth's ionosphere.  Dusty plasmas are also formed in the chemically active plasmas that are used in industrial plasma processing devices to create computer chips, contaminating the end product and reducing overall yield, and the manufacturing of solar photovoltaic cells, where the dust can increase the overall efficiency of the resulting solar cells. The research program will support the training of several highly talented undergraduate students in a small college environment, providing the students with a more comprehensive research skills training than at comparable experiences at larger institutions; experience with state-of-the-art software and experimental techniques; and a variety of practical problem solving skills.  \r\n\r\nThe research program consists of several experiments designed to understand the thermal and transport properties of weakly-coupled (fluid-like) dusty plasmas.  One series of experiments is designed to measure the thermal state of weakly-coupled dusty plasmas to better understand the mechanism responsible for the high temperatures that have been measured in a number of experimental systems.  This effort will directly test two models that are believed to be responsible for the observed heating and will also support the development of a time-resolved stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) system.  This work will extend collaborative work done in the development of a time-resolved planar PIV with colleagues at in the Plasma Science Laboratory at Auburn University and the Complex Plasmas Research Group at the German Aerospace Center.  Additionally, a portion of this work will be done at the newly operational Magnetized Dusty Plasma Experiment facility at Auburn University and will examine the effect that magnetic fields have on the thermal state of these dusty plasma systems.  A second series of experiments is designed to understand the properties of a fundamental wave mode that propagates in dusty plasma systems known as the dust acoustic wave. The contribution that thermal effects have on how this wave propagates and the nonlinear process of synchronization where the properties of the wave adjust to match an externally applied drive will be investigated.  Together, these studies will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the thermal properties of dusty plasmas and provide new insight into the nonlinear properties of the dust acoustic wave.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nPlasmas, an ionized gas consisting of free electrons, ions, and neutral atoms, are the fourth, and most abundant, naturally-occurring state of matter in the visible universe.  This fourth state of matter is ubiquitous in nature and is commonly used in industrial plasma processing devices.  Often, these plasmas contain small pieces of solid particulate matter, such as ice or dust grains, which are typically much smaller than the width of a human hair.  These dust grains become charged and interact with the background plasma.  The result of this interaction is a new type of plasma system known as dusty plasma.  In space, examples of dusty plasmas include the clouds from which stars and planets form, comet tails, planetary rings and noctilucent clouds in the Earth's ionosphere. Dusty plasmas are also formed in the chemically active plasmas that are used in industrial plasma processing devices to create computer chips, contaminating the end product and reducing overall yield, and the manufacturing of solar photovoltaic cells, where the dust can increase the overall efficiency of the resulting solar cells.  For the last 25 years, researchers have studies these dusty plasmas systems in the laboratory to better understand their many properties and to gain insight into fundamental question such as how do star and planets form or how matter transitions from a solid to a liquid state.\n\nIn this research project, our work focused on the thermodynamic properties of dusty plasmas and the properties of a wave mode that is observed to propagate through the dust.  Using a volumetric imaging technique known as tomographic particle image velocimetry and high-speed imaging, the motion of the dust component was measured.  From these measurements, it is possible to understand how the energy is distributed throughout the system, to make time-resolved measurements of the how the dust wave moved through the dust and to see how the dust wave interacted with an external drive (push).  By applying a number of different analysis techniques to these measurements, we were able to demonstrate that the temperature of the dust component was much larger than the temperature of the background plasma particles, to gain insight into the properties of the dust wave and to gain insight into a process known as synchronization, where the dust wave adjusted to match an external push (much like person being pushed on a swing will begin to swing at the same rate as they are being pushed).  These results confirm earlier investigations by other groups (including our own earlier measurements), but with greater precision and accuracy than any earlier measurements.  \n\nThe scientific output of this project is measured in terms of publications and presentations.
