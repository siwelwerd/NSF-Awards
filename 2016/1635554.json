 "awd_abstract_narration": "Current and future science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) professionals produce products and services that touch nearly every aspect of human life. This proposed research will focus on the ethical responsibility of STEM professionals to critically examine the role of technology and to understand how its design impacts society at large. The proposed research will inform the design of undergraduate STEM, and other educational efforts. A key goal of the proposed research is to determine which specific facets of student participation in community engagement help students to become better attuned to promoting the public's well-being. The proposed research findings will inform curriculum development and training programs for STEM professionals. It will be of interest to universities, professional societies, communities and industry. \r\n\r\nThis proposed research aims to determine whether appropriately structured community engagement, including service learning, actively contributes to the moral maturation of students and facilitates the broadening of their sphere of ethical concern.  The research team aims to discover: (1) whether and how repeat exposure to the public through curriculum-based community engagement can promote the concern that students have for the public's well-being; (2) what role extracurricular community engagement activities play, if any, in increasing student concern for the public; and (3) whether a new service learning program focused on community engagement and sustainability can have a transformative institutional impact.  The research team will rigorously evaluate the effects that various forms of community engagement have on students' perceptions of their ethical responsibilities to the public.  A mixed quantitative and qualitative approach will be used to understand what, why, and how community engagement experiences affect the mindset of students.  The project should reveal the institutional impact of a broad-based effort to increase opportunities in community engagement and could readily inform curricular design at numerous institutions.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\n\nThe aim of this Institutional Transformation project was to examine the role that a broad range of activities, including those connected to a community engagement experience, had on student attitudes regarding their ethical responsibilities to the public.&#8239; The research team sought to determine: (1) whether and how curricular experiences promote a concern for the public\u2019s well-being; (2) what role extracurricular activities play, if any, in increasing student concern for the public; and (3) whether an institutional program focused on community engagement at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) had a measurable impact on student social responsibility attitudes. \n\n\n  \n\n\nThe team used two main approaches to evaluate its research questions. The first approach involved administering a survey at three time points during an undergraduate student\u2019s program.  These time points were when the student first entered college, at the midpoint, and near graduation.  The primary cohort of students who were surveyed was the entire undergraduate class that started Georgia Tech in Fall 2017. In addition to surveying the primary cohort, the team also surveyed undergraduate students who graduated in the Spring of 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 to obtain more general data on social responsibility attitude trends over time among the student population. The project\u2019s survey instrument is called the Generalized Professional Responsibility Assessment (GPRA).  It is based on a previous survey called the Engineering Professional Responsibility Assessment (EPRA), which was developed by Angela Bielefeldt and Nathan Canney\u2019s research team.   \n\n\n \n\n\nThe second approach involved interviewing a subset of the Fall 2017 student cohort at two different time points, during their second year of their undergraduate program and near graduation.  Interview scripts were created by the team along with relevant codebooks so that student responses to interview questions could be formally coded and evaluated.\n \n Key project findings include that personal and professional social responsibility attitudes for the students in the study tend to remain flat or decline over the course of their undergraduate education. While some students became aware of certain social issues (for example, related to mental health on the campus), this awareness did not necessarily shape their anticipated career choice. In addition, while the students indicated that they value being ethical individuals and positive forces in their community, they tend to view these values as distinct from their academic major and professional pathway.  Interactions with peers, personal exploration, and through courses outside of their major were the most common ways that students were introduced to social responsibility issues.  Moreover, participation in community service activities during the students\u2019 time at Georgia Tech appeared to influence social responsibility attitudes positively.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 10/21/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Jason D Borenstein"
