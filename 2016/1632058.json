 "awd_abstract_narration": "General Summary\r\n\r\nDivision among ethnic groups is often seen as a dangerous force that encourages violence and threatens the stability of democracy. Furthermore, such conflict is perceived to be unavoidable when ethnic identities are deeply held and strongly felt. This study seeks to explain why some countries in which ethnicity is salient experience violence while others do not. The PI examines the difference by first mapping demographic patterns, and patterns of political and economic competition in two countries and match by space and time violent and non-violent locations. This project uses two Caribbean nations (Guyana and Trinidad & Tobago) as the cases of interest. These two countries are similar in their historical, economic, and political backgrounds, including being comprised of two major ethnic groups.  While it is certainly important to understand potential threats to the democratic stability of countries in close proximity to the United States, the ultimate goal of this project is to provide more general insights into factors that encourage and prevent ethnic violence that can be applied to many other countries around the world.  \r\n \r\nTechnical Summary\r\n\r\nHow have some countries with intense, ethnic political competition managed to escape the violence that plagues many other multi-ethnic polities?  The PI develops a theory that advances the idea that ethnic violence is shaped by social and political relationships, specifically the nature of clientelistic exchanges and civil society activity. This theory generates novel implications, which are investigated through original quantitative data collection and analysis, an exploration of matching methodologies, and subsequent qualitative research through fieldwork in both Guyana and Trinidad & Tobago.  The employment of various matching methods to compare localities in Guyana and Trinidad will offer opportunities to gain important substantive information about the two countries, as well as contribute to ongoing methodological debates regarding the relative merits of various matching techniques.  The ultimate goal of this project is to provide more general insights into factors that encourage and prevent ethnic violence that can be applied to many other countries around the world.",

Over the course of these trips I was able to obtain original source material in the form of interviews and archival data. I was also able to expand my theory of ethnically-motivated political violence in these countries.  In particular, the role of state policing became a central part of my study, though I had not anticipated this originally.  \n\nFrom the original puzzle of why we see ethnically motivated violence in Guyana and not Trinidad, despite a similar level of saliance of ethnic politics, I came to understand that in Guyana most ethnically motivated political violence today is interpreted through the lens of crime.  This is particularly interesting given what research from india has shown us about 1) the role that police can play in stopping or encouraging ethnic violence (Wilkinson 2004) and also 2) the importance of interpreting violence--who gets to tell the story of its meaning (Brass 2005).  Thus, a study that started out as intending simply to focus on local-level socio-economic and political factors that might explain the differences between Guyana and Trinidad now has to grapple with the role of policing and crime as part of the explanation.\n\nMy two years of fieldwork have yielded pilot data for two time periods in each country 1) elections held before independence from Britain in each (then) colony and 2) elections held in each country in the early 2000s.  These two time periods were chosen because they present interesting variation across time and across the two countries, while also presenting important similarities in terms of each country's political development.  Both countries experienced ethnic violence pre-independence, and in Guyana this period also represents a time when indo-Guyanese trust in predominantly Afro-Guyanese police force was very low.  By the early 2000s, however, ethnic violence continued in Guyana, but had stopped in Trinidad.  Further, Indo-Guyanese trust in the police had increased, and going forward political violence committed by afro-guyanese would largely be understood as criminal activity.\n\nTo further investigate systematic patterns I have collected and begun coding newspaper reports of events of violence from both countries in both time periods. I have also collected all available census data from these two time periods.  \n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 12/21/2018\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Emily Beaulieu"
