 "awd_abstract_narration": "This project is focused on improving the representation of biosphere-atmosphere exchange processes in atmospheric chemical transport models. The overall objectives of the project are to investigate the impact of future land-use change on surface-atmosphere exchange processes, and to improve the characterization of the pre-industrial atmospheric composition. The project will aid in the development of sound policies for promoting air quality and a sustainable environment.\r\n\r\nThis research is directed toward evaluating and improving GEOS-Chem global model simulations of dry deposition, organic aerosol aging, and bioaerosols.  The focus of this work is on short-lived climate forcers: ozone and aerosols. The GEOS-Chem model is being used to isolate the impact of land surface modifications on chemical fluxes and atmospheric composition.  Modeling results will be evaluated using ambient field observations from surface sites and airborne campaigns over the last decade.",
