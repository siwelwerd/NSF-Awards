 "awd_abstract_narration": "Bacteria are the most abundant life-form on Earth, but much of how bacteria work on a molecular level is still a mystery.  Are there ways that molecular systems work in bacteria that are similar to systems in higher organisms?  Or do bacteria have their own unique systems?  Do some bacteria have systems different even from other bacteria?  In this study, molecular systems in two bacteria, Caulobacter crescentus and Brevundimonas subvibrioides, will be investigated to determine how much they have in common with systems found in related bacteria or in higher organisms.  By investigating these systems, the extent to which evolution has reused the same blueprints to build complexity will be determined.  Part of this research will be performed by college undergraduates in the classroom, allowing a great many students, who normally would not have the opportunity, to conduct their own biological research study.  Additionally, high school students will be exposed to the wonders of the biological world as seen through the lens of a microscope.\r\n\r\nProkaryotic analogs of eukaryotic cellular systems have been found in a number of bacteria.  Yet, how much these systems are conserved from bacterium to bacterium, how similar these prokaryotic systems are to their eukaryotic versions, or how much they have been adapted to suit the unique needs of each organism is largely unknown.  This research will study the GcrA/CcrM epigenetic regulatory system and the DivK/CtrA cell cycle regulatory system, both of which are conserved throughout the Alphaproteobacterial clade.  These systems will be investigated in the bacterium Brevundimonas subvibrioides where they display important operational variation from the model organism Caulobacter crescentus, using modern genetic and cell biology techniques, including ChIP-Seq and single-molecule sequencing.  The comparisons of regulatory systems between related bacteria will aid in showing how systems evolve to better suit the needs of different organisms, what fundamental principles must be conserved between them, and assess just how translatable models can be across evolutionary distance.  Part of this research will be performed by undergraduates in an upper level class, providing the opportunity for many students to work on an original research project.  This study also includes the development of a single day program designed to expose high school students to microscopy in order to visually draw students into STEM fields.",

  "por_txt_cntn": "\nBacteria are surpsingly sophisticated organisms.  Inside their cells  are complex networks of gene regulation that drive processes forward.   Often one specific organism is studied in greater depth to provide a  model of how things work.  What is not clear is how representative these  models are.  In this work, we examine two signaling systems in Brevundimonas subvibrioides, an organism closely related to the well-established model organism Caulobacter crescentus.   The first signaling system is a genetic regulatory system based on DNA  methylation (the GcrA/CcrM system).  By characterizing the B. subvibrioides system and comparing it to the C. crescentus one, we showed that there is far greater divergence than one would ever  expect.  This makes the scant few common targets of the system of  greater importance, which are topics of future research.  By examining  the role of the developmental signaling protein DivK, we uncovered  inconsistencies between what the model predicts would happen with  certain mutations and what actually happens.  This means that the model  is not as accurate as we thought it was.  The systems that we study are  conserved in large numbers of different bacteria, so by comparing and  contrasting these systems, we better refine the models and see how they  extrapolate to other organisms, meaning we better understand how other  bacteria work.  Out of this work also came an analysis of stalk  formation (little extensions of the cell pole) in Caulobacter and Brevundimonas species, and the discovery of a completely novel case of convergent evolution in bacterial viruses.\n\nAs  a result of this award, a portion of the research project was  integrated into a University classroom.  Undergraduate students got to  generate their own bacterial mutant strains, characterize their  properties, and begin to genetically identify the mutations.  In doing  so, many students got to perform actual scientific research, which is  important when undergraduate research opportunities can be hard to come  by.  Also supported by this award was the establishment of a microscopy  experience for a summer STEM camp for middle school children.   Participants of the University of Mississippi summer STEM camp for  middle schoolers used different types of microscopes to look at pond  water samples, their own cells, and every day objects at high  magnification.  This experience was designed to allow young students to  explore their world in a visually stimulating way, in the hopes that the  simple wonder and joy of exploration will help inspire future  generations of scientists.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 04/22/2022\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Patrick D Curtis"
