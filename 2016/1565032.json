 "awd_abstract_narration": "This significant project will fund thirteen additional participants to the successful Rice Emerging Scholars Program (RESP) for STEM majors at Rice University. The program is designed to meet the needs of talented students whose preparation leaves them at risk of attrition. The program is comprehensive in its attack on the barriers to persistence with activities that focus on academic preparation for college and navigational skills in college. It provides students with a challenging and immersive bridge experience focusing on the most difficult topics a student will face within their first semesters, followed by mentoring and at least two years of intensive advising.\r\n                            \r\nAll thirteen participants will have high potential, substantial financial need, and the vast majority will be from under-represented groups. This funding will greatly increase the chance that these students will major in STEM disciplines and then later graduate into leadership in the sciences and engineering. Spillover effects to the broader URM and first-generation collegian population include the creation of a visible supportive community of engaged young STEM scholars. The investigators will study the effectiveness of this non-remedial comprehensive program and its elements in overcoming obstructions to persistence by comparing RESP students to a non-RESP control group. The study will examine academic outcomes such as course grades, STEM attrition, and study skills and attitudinal outcomes such as STEM self-efficacy and career interest. The research planned comprises qualitative interviews about the college experience, quantitative longitudinal assessment of academic achievement, and quantitative longitudinal assessment of STEM attitudes and study skills using survey methodology. Research results will be disseminated broadly to the academic community in STEM education and learning sciences. The results will be scalable and exportable to inform the development of interventions at other universities in which underprepared high potential students attempt the difficult transition from high school to college.",

However, there is less evidence that the RESP program affects student attitudes such as STEM identity, belongingness, and STEM self-efficacy compared to a non-participating comparison group. One reason for this null result may be that Rice University has made many components of RESP, such as comprehensive advising, available to students beyond the RESP program.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Institutional Impact: </span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">RESP, especially augmented by S-STEM support, has catalyzed changes to the institution. New financial aid policies support low-income students&rsquo; ability to take summer classes and remain for additional semesters when needed, resulting in more STEM degrees for low-income students. Capacity for comprehensive advising has greatly expanded through a Student Success Initiatives (SSI) program, now covering roughly 10% of the undergraduate population. Partnerships between RESP, SSI, and STEM departments have formed, creating teams of instructors and advisors that integrate holistic advising with academic progress. Internships and research opportunities have expanded for low-income students.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"line-height: 1.38; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt;\" dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Summary: </span><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-family: Arial; color: #000000; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">S-STEM, with RESP, has likely added a score of new STEM degree holders and future leaders among low-income US citizens of high potential. The program&rsquo;s impact, through its research and institutional effects, multiplies this effect, with new leaders being created annually long after the grant&rsquo;s expiration.</span></p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 01/30/2023<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;Wolf</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\"></div>\n</div>",

More impressively, RESP Scholars graduate in four years at rates better than those of other Rice students: The four-year graduation rate for RESP Scholars who matriculated between 2015 and 2018 was 91%, compared to 87% for all Rice undergraduates. RESP Scholars have gone on to graduate programs at UC Berkeley, MIT, Michigan, Johns Hopkins, Stanford, University of Texas Health Science Center, and University of Texas at Austin, among others. Other Scholars have been awarded research fellowships with the NIH and NASA. Scholars are employed at Microsoft, Meta, Google, Intel, Tesla, SpaceX, MIT Lincoln Labs, Amazon, Honeywell Aerospace, Lyft, Schlumberger, Oxy, Chevron, Goldman Sachs, Accenture, and the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, among others.\nResearch Conducted \nTo examine the effect of the RESP Program, we conducted a longitudinal study that followed Scholars and a non-participating comparison group throughout their tenure in college, and a series of cross-sectional studies. These efforts resulted in ten peer-reviewed publications in three research streams: 1) evaluating the success of the RESP program for scholars versus a non-participating comparison group and a meta-analysis on the effectiveness of summer bridge programs more generally; 2) examining the effect of the RESP program on the development of attitudes important for success in STEM such as STEM identity and self-efficacy, perceived belongingness, and perceived peer support; and 3) the development and validation of measures used to select RESP scholars and measures designed to identify productive and less-than-productive study skills. \n\n \nOur research generally shows the efficacy of the RESP program, and summer bridge programs more generally, for supporting student success in STEM. However, there is less evidence that the RESP program affects student attitudes such as STEM identity, belongingness, and STEM self-efficacy compared to a non-participating comparison group. One reason for this null result may be that Rice University has made many components of RESP, such as comprehensive advising, available to students beyond the RESP program.\n\n \nInstitutional Impact: RESP, especially augmented by S-STEM support, has catalyzed changes to the institution. New financial aid policies support low-income students\u2019 ability to take summer classes and remain for additional semesters when needed, resulting in more STEM degrees for low-income students. Capacity for comprehensive advising has greatly expanded through a Student Success Initiatives (SSI) program, now covering roughly 10% of the undergraduate population. Partnerships between RESP, SSI, and STEM departments have formed, creating teams of instructors and advisors that integrate holistic advising with academic progress. Internships and research opportunities have expanded for low-income students.\n\n \nSummary: S-STEM, with RESP, has likely added a score of new STEM degree holders and future leaders among low-income US citizens of high potential. The program\u2019s impact, through its research and institutional effects, multiplies this effect, with new leaders being created annually long after the grant\u2019s expiration.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLast Modified: 01/30/2023\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSubmitted by: Michael Wolf"
