 "awd_abstract_narration": "Global warming and other climate-related processes are rapidly changing the Arctic Ocean.  Summer sea ice is disappearing and the sea surface is warming and becoming less salty.  This changing physical environment is altering basic biological processes and air-sea exchange of gasses. The carbon cycle is of particular interest in the Arctic because it is unknown how carbon dioxide sources and sinks are changing and whether these changes will lead to increased greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere.  It is thought that with less ice cover the Arctic Ocean will absorb more human-produced carbon dioxide. Higher carbon dioxide levels cause the ocean to become more acidic because carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid when it dissolves in water.  The increase in the acidity of the water can affect the food web by harming shell-forming organisms.  In spite of these important issues, not much is known about the carbon cycle in the central Arctic Ocean basins. Nearly all measurements of ocean acidity have been made on the Arctic shelves during the summer period when access is easy.  We will measure the amount of dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide in the surface water and its acidity in the central Arctic Ocean during a summer cruise on the ice breaker Louis St. Laurent and on year-round oceanographic moorings. Outreach activities include continued operation of an ocean acidification exhibit that we developed for University of Montana?s science museum which has been seen by thousands of museum visitors.\r\n\r\nThe research will specifically support installment of a shipboard underway pCO2 system along with deployment of pCO2, pH, and photosynthetically active radiation sensors on the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution time-series moorings in the Beaufort Sea.  The ship follows the same cruise track since the program began in 2003, starting south on the Beaufort shelf and extending to the northern Canada Basin.  Three moorings are deployed annually with a subsurface profiler that measures conductivity, temperature, depth, and dissolved O2.  Our sensors are deployed at ~35 m depth, just below the subsurface float. These data will allow us to compute air-sea CO2 fluxes and net community productivity during periods when there is less than 100% ice cover and photosynthetically active radiation is greater than zero. The quality-controlled shipboard and mooring data will be made available to the scientific community by submission of the data to the Arctic data repository (ACADIS).",

It is critically important to understand where CO<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;goes in the environment because of its role as a greenhouse gas and also because CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>can decrease the pH of ocean waters (ocean acidification). Because of the inaccessibility and harsh conditions of the Arctic, we lack the data necessary to understand these processes. Moreover, the Arctic Ocean is rapidly changing due to warming and loss of perennial ice cover so long-term studies are necessary to quantify the effects on the CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>cycle. Our project specifically measured the dissolved CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>concentration (also known as the partial pressure of CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>or&nbsp;<em>p</em>CO<sub>2</sub>) and pH in the Beaufort Sea and Canada Basin (Figure 1). The study was part of the NSF-supported Beaufort Gyre Observing System (BGOS) program in collaboration with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and the Institute of Ocean Sciences (IOS, Canada). We measured sea surface&nbsp;<em>p</em>CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>and deployed CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>and pH sensors on ocean moorings during the 2016 and 2017 research cruises on the Canadian icebreaker, the CCGS Louis S. St. Laurent. The mooring locations and ship cruise track are indicated in Figure 1. One of the major findings so far is that sea surface CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>increases as ice cover decreases indicating that the uptake of CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>by the Arctic Ocean will likely decrease over time (Figure 2). The study has also quantified to what extent ice formation during the Arctic autumn and winter drives CO<sub>2</sub> variability.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regarding broader impacts, as stated in the NSF guidelines, the goal of the Arctic Observing Network is \"<em>to enhance the environmental observing infrastructure required for the scientific investigation of Arctic environmental system change and its global connections\"</em>&nbsp;and \"...<em>data are considered to be community data and not subject to any embargo period\"</em>. Accordingly, the data from this project have been made available to the public and other stakeholders via the NSF Arctic Data Center, the Surface Ocean CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>Atlas (SOCAT) and Beaufort Gyre Exploration Project (WHOI) websites. In addition, some of the results have been published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature (see the Project Report). These data are also being used by biogeochemists and modelers to improve prediction of the future CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>cycle in the Arctic Ocean. The project has also contributed significantly to technology transfer, STEM education, and public outreach. The sensor inductive modem interface developed in this project is commercially available through Sunburst Sensors, a company started by the principal investigator, Dr. Mike DeGrandpre. Three undergraduate students, three graduate students and a post-doctoral researcher have participated in various phases of the project. Outreach activities have included development and maintenance of an interactive ocean acidification exhibit for Missoula's science museum, spectrUM Discovery Area (Figure 3). Dr. DeGrandpre has also taken advantage of his involvement in Arctic research by speaking to students and community groups about the changing Arctic. These events have included keynote speaker for the Montana Science Fair (~400 students), a Provost Distinguished Faculty lecture, and a webinar with video feed to 20 Montana classrooms. Lastly, working with local high school teacher David Jones, we obtained an NSF-funded PolarTREC grant to support participation on the 2017 cruise. David documented the cruise through daily dispatches and developed lesson plans based on the knowledge gained from his participation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p><br>\n<p>\n\t\t\t\t      \tLast Modified: 07/30/2019<br>\n\t\t\t\t\tModified by: Michael&nbsp;Degrandpre</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"porSideCol\">\n<div class=\"each-gallery\">\n<div class=\"galContent\" id=\"gallery0\">\n<div class=\"photoCount\" id=\"photoCount0\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tImages (<span id=\"selectedPhoto0\">1</span> of <span class=\"totalNumber\"></span>)\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t</div>\n<div class=\"galControls\" id=\"controls0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galSlideshow\" id=\"slideshow0\"></div>\n<div class=\"galEmbox\" id=\"embox\">\n<div class=\"image-title\"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"galNavigation\" id=\"navigation0\">\n<ul class=\"thumbs\" id=\"thumbs0\">\n<li>\n<a href=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1504410/1504410_10413650_1564521234596_ScreenShot2019-07-30at15.09.15--rgov-214x142.jpg\" original=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1504410/1504410_10413650_1564521234596_ScreenShot2019-07-30at15.09.15--rgov-800width.jpg\" title=\"pCO2 versus ice cover\"><img src=\"/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1504410/1504410_10413650_1564521234596_ScreenShot2019-07-30at15.09.15--rgov-66x44.jpg\" alt=\"pCO2 versus ice cover\"></a>\n<div class=\"imageCaptionContainer\">\n<div class=\"imageCaption\">Figure 2: Canada Basin mean pCO2 vs. mean sea ice concentration for shipboard pCO2 collected along the cruise track in Figure 1 from 2012 ? 2017.
