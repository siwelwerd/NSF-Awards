 "awd_abstract_narration": "The anaerobic gut fungi differ from all other groups of fungi in two ways: they grow in the absence of oxygen, and they grow in a restricted habitat (the rumen and alimentary tract of plant eating animals). They evolved hundreds of millions of years ago and represent one of the oldest fungal groups, yet their evolutionary history is unclear. Specifically, the exact relationship between anaerobic fungi and other fungal groups, as well as the timing and sequence of events that lead to their localization to a gut habitat, remains unclear. Further, it is not exactly known how the gut habitat has affected their genomes and evolution. This project will tackle these questions by sequencing the genomes of a large, diverse collection of anaerobic gut fungi, and analyzing the data produced using a wide range of computational procedures. The proposed efforts will lead to significant advances in the understanding of the history of this peculiar group of fungi and factors driving their evolution. Further, the data obtained would be of extreme interest to a broader group of scientists working in the areas of biofuel research, animal nutrition, and molecular biology of fungi.  The project will engage multiple high school and undergraduate students in research, with special effort to engage minority (especially Native American) students to advance the participation of underrepresented groups in science, technology, and math disciplines. \r\n \r\nOverall research progress on anaerobic fungi has been slow, and sequencing of anaerobic gut fungi (AGF) genomes has been hampered by their extremely high adenine-thymine content and the proliferation of intergenic repeats in their genomes. This project will utilize a new approach that combines multiple sequencing technologies to sequence the genomes and transcriptomes of a large and diverse collection of anaerobic fungal isolates. This research will utilize the data generated to conduct an extensive phylogenomic analysis, aiming to resolve their evolutionary history within the fungal tree of life, correlate the timing of AGF diversification events to the evolution of their herbivorous hosts, resolve the diversification pattern of anaerobic fungal genera, and investigate the impact of the unique habitat and evolutionary trajectory on their genomic architecture.",

The Neocallimastigomycota are unique amongst fungi in many ways: First they are only encountered in the rumen and alimentary tract of herbivores. Second they are very oxygen sensitive and die from air exposure. Third they are very efficient in breaking down plant material into simple sugars.

How related this special group of fungi is to other known free living and oxygen tolerant fungal lineages?&nbsp; Where did the Neocallimastigomycota ancestor reside before the evolution of herbivorous animals?

We leaned heavily on genomic sequencing and genomic data analysis for evolutionary purposes (a discipline called Phylogenomics) to achieve such goals. First, we identified the position and evolutionary history of the Neocalliamstigomycota in the broader fungal tree of life, and showed that they are most closely related to a group of fungi called Chytrids. Second, we timed the evolution of this group around and determined that it evolved 65 million years ago. This is a similar time to the evolution of herbivory in mammals and evolution of grasses. As such, it seems that both process (Neocallimastigomycota evolution and evolution of herbivory in mammals) were closely intertwined. Third, we inferred that the ancestors of these fungi had very limited capacity to degrade complex plant materials (e.g. cellulose and hemicellulose). More importantly, we determined that the Neocallimstigomycota have evolved into efficient degrader of plant material from such an ancestor by freely borrowing genes that enables them to do so from single cell microbes (Bacteria and Archaea, Image 1).
