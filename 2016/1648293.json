The WSSSPE4 workshop is part of a community driven effort to address the many new challenges that are evident for the development, deployment, maintenance, and sustainability of reusable software for academic research and education. These challenges include the software development process; the support and maintenance of software; governance and business models particularly for sustainability; the role of software in building science communities; the need for software to lead to science which is verifiable and reproducible; policy issues such as how to measure software impact, choose licensing, or assign software credit; and the education and nurturing of early stage researchers in scientific software. Based on successful WSSSPE1-WSSSPE3 meetings at SC13, SC14, and NCAR in 2013, 2014, and 2015, the organizers expect over 60 submitted papers and around 75 attendees at the WSSSPE4 meeting. WSSSPE4 accepted submission would be published as a special collection in http://ceur-ws.org/, which is fully indexed. \r\n\r\nThis project will support the attendance at WSSSPE4 (4th Workshop on Sustainable Software for Science: Best Practices and Experiences) for US based researchers, particularly targeted at encouraging attendance by early stage researchers with attention to diversity.

The participants will be selected using a formal application procedure, with selection criteria based around (1) the potential of their attendance to contribute towards their own research and educational goals; (2) their potential contribution to the workshop; (3) providing a diverse set of attendees with priority to early stage researchers (e.g., students, postdoctoral researchers, early stage faculty). The workshop will include vision and position papers as well as lightning talks and demos, aimed at improving sustainable scientific software today as well as defining and working towards the its future.
