 "awd_abstract_narration": "The Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program assists universities and colleges in diversifying the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) workforce through their efforts at significantly increasing the numbers of students from historically underrepresented minority populations to successfully complete high quality degree programs in STEM.\r\nThe Peach State Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (Peach State LSAMP) composed of the University of Georgia (lead institution), Fort Valley State University, Georgia Institute of Technology, Kennesaw State University System, and Savannah State University aims  to:\r\n   - Increase enrollment of historically underrepresented minority students in STEM disciplines; \r\n   - Increase baccalaureate degrees obtained by this population of students in STEM disciplines;\r\n   - Increase the transfer of Georgia Perimeter College alliance students to 4-year institutions;\r\n   - Increase the number of LSAMP students who participate in research/internships; \r\n   - Increase the number of LSAMP students who pursue graduate degrees in STEM; and,\r\n   - Partner with Education Research team to conduct research on the Peach State LSAMP.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of Peach State LSAMP is to ensure student success in completing undergraduate and graduate degrees in STEM disciplines.  Interventions are primed for a more intentional focus on LSAMP students pursuing and completing graduate school. Hence, the proposed activities will focus more on preparing more Peach State LSAMP funded students for graduate school in STEM disciplines. The Peach State LSAMP program is comprehensive and designed to enhance academic and research outcomes including well-prepared underrepresented minority students in STEM disciplines equipped for success in graduate school, engaging mentoring and research\r\nstudent retention models, and a sound and rigorous evaluation plan. The program will leverage its institutional research infrastructure and its partnerships with other academic institutions and local industries to facilitate successful transitions of minority students in STEM fields.\r\n\r\nAlliance program evaluation findings assessing the effectiveness of the Peach State LSAMP strategies will be shared with the education community to build the knowledge base and foster implementation of best practices. In addition, the project includes an exploratory study to investigate the fidelity of its community college transfer bridge program.  The study has the potential to determine if and why this intervention is effective and contribute to other in-depth research studies on the impact of this STEM pathway. \r\n\r\nThe best practices implemented in this project will have transferable values for STEM activities in other institutions in the nation. It will also create an environment in which the outcomes achieved will be sustainable after the project comes to an end.  Peach State LSAMP will not only increase the number of successful students completing degrees in STEM disciplines, but is also committed to creating a more diverse and competitive STEM workforce in Georgia and beyond.",
